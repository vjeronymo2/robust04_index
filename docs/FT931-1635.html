			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): No price movement, no profits - Foreign brokers are forced to restructure their operations on an ebbing market THE TIDE has turned for foreign brokers in Tokyo. Those which had raked in profits, despite faltering volume on the Tokyo stock market, are now being forced to restructure their operations. A recent announcement by Salomon Brothers that it would cut 10 per cent of its staff in Japanese equities, signalled the demise of computer-led program trading (which foreign brokers, especially the US houses, excelled in). While Japanese houses, which rely heavily on commission from investors, faced a plunge in revenue caused by the market slump, leading foreign brokers had managed to make money from trading their own capital using computer-led investments. Japanese brokers persuaded the financial authorities to clamp down on arbitrage between the cash market and stock index futures - locking in profits between the cash and futures markets. Market share of foreign brokers, which have greater expertise in futures and options techniques, rose to some 20 per cent; sharply higher than the 3 per cent rise during the first half of 1988. However, the market slump has finally caught up with Wall Street technology. The Japanese government badly wants to keep the stock market above 16,000 before the financial year closes in March. It has pumped in public pension funds and postal savings to support share prices. Large investors, including banks and insurance companies, have been ordered to stop selling. 'There are no profits where there is no price movement,' says an arbitrageur at a UK brokerage. Furthermore, the increase in efficiency of the markets has depressed arbitrage possibilities, as Japanese and smaller foreign houses have rushed into the arbitrage business. Some foreign arbitrageurs reckon profit opportunities in the Tokyo market will be gone within three years. Meanwhile, an increasing number of foreign houses, reliant on client orders, have met the same fate as their Japanese counterparts as trading volumes have plunged to a quarter of the peak of a daily average of over 1bn shares in 1988. County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster, announced a total withdrawal from the Tokyo market last December - the first foreign broker to give up membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Merrill Lynch Japan announced the closure of its three retail branches. UK brokers, including SG Warburg and Baring Securities, have also been cutting overheads. The winners in the current stagnant market will be securities houses with enough capital and technology to introduce innovative products to the Japanese market. One area in which US houses have become active is the corporate bond market. More Japanese companies have started to dip into the domestic straight bond market for funds, as equity-linked financing has become difficult. Domestic corporate bond issues surged 26.3 per cent durinbg 1992 to Y3,010bn, and the ministry of finance also endorsed the development of the corporate bond market by easing issuance rules. Morgan Stanley has been the first foreign house to enter the domestic underwriting business, with Japan's first fixed-price deal for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1991, paving the way for other Japanese companies to use the fixed-price re-offering system in the domestic bond market. Until the NTT issue, domestic corporate bonds were issued by the 'proposal method', by which underwriting was awarded to the securities house with the highest bid. The excessive competition for underwriting contracts led to unrealistic offering prices. Mr Masaaki Nogawa, at NTT, says the company had asked Japanese securities houses to come up with a more transparent system, but got only lukewarm responses at the time. Japanese houses, including Nomura Securities, admit that the domestic bond market has taken off as a result of the NTT launch. Last year, Morgan Stanley underwrote an NTT issue - the first in Japan - which allowed investors to trade the bonds during the offering period. Until then, investors had been forced to hold the bonds until the offering period was over, making investors vulnerable to market movements. The new methods employed by Morgan have enhanced liquidity in the secondary market of domestic corporate bonds. Leading US houses and large Japanese brokers have started to market-make corporate bonds, giving prices for which they will buy and sell. Financial deregulation in Japan, however, may pose a threat to the foreign brokers' newly established businesses. From April, banking affiliates will enter the bond underwriting business, as the gradual easing of barriers between the banking and securities industries takes place. Long-term credit banks, including Industrial Bank of Japan and Long Term Credit Bank, which have close ties with corporate Japan because of their traditional role of providing long-term funds, will be the first to enter the securities business. An official at a leading US securities house claims that if banks' affiliates aim for market share, as Japanese banks have done in their traditional territories, foregoing profitability, the fledgling market could collapse. Salomon was also disappointed recently by the approval of yen-denominated perpetual bond issues by Japanese banks, which have long been restricted from issuing yen-denominated bonds as it could intrude on the lending of the long-term banks. The approval from the ministry of finance came after Salomon's sale of foreign currency subordinated bond issues by Japanese banks, repackaged into a yen product. Although foreign brokers have been the leading force in trying to bring in innovative products, and pushing for financial deregulation in Japan, they may face increasing pressure as new markets open to Japanese institutions.  ------------------------------------------------------------ Top ten foreign brokers Pre-tax profits for the half year to Sept 92  ------------------------------------------------------------                                         Year-on-year                              Y bn        change (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Morgan Stanley              12.66           -2.4 Salomon Brothers             7.41          -53.8 Swiss Bank                   3.06           +9.2 Goldman Sachs                2.25          -65.8 Societe Generale             2.16          -66.7 County NatWest               1.42              - Baring                       1.30           +0.7 BT Asia                      1.08          -51.5 Merrill Lynch                0.88          -31.2 UBS Phillips &amp; Drew          0.69         +263.1  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Nihon Keizai Shimbun  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

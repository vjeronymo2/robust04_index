			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Company statements encourage a firm market - Market Report London stock markets closed firmly yesterday, taking their lead from the US Treasuries, but without news from the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). UK traders were hoping that before London opens today the Fed will have delivered the keenly desired  1/2 percentage point increase in its key interest rates, hopes fulfilled by the Fed's rates move last night. 'Anything less than a half-point rise will not please the market,' was the consensus view at last night's London close of trading. After a slow start, UK shares moved ahead and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 7.9 better at 3,123.5. Although trading volume was higher than on the previous day, traders stressed that it was a cautious session. Stocks were easier for much of the day but the Footsie once again bounced convincingly when it slipped towards the 3,100 area; the day's low was 3,106.8. A survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry was favourably received. Although the awareness that the FOMC meeting would not even start until late in the London trading day inhibited activity in UK stocks, there were plenty of company trading statements to keep dealers on the alert. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has shown itself both independent of and somewhat weaker than the FT-SE 100 in recent sessions, finished just 0.3 up at 3,707.2. Seaq volume of 638.5m shares compared with 671.7m on Monday when retail business was worth Pounds 1.43bn. Favourable trading comments from a handful of blue chip companies aided sentiment. Allied-Lyons and Hanson said the year had begun satisfactorily and BOC, seen as an industrial market leader, traded heavily after a very positive interim statement. The stock market remained hopeful that determined action by the Fed would at last settle nerves in the bond market and, by stabilising bond yields, enable the equity market to respond to improvement in corporate dividends and earnings. While the markets will remain on tenterhooks until there is news from the FOMC meeting, London today faces important data on the domestic economy. UK analysts expect these to confirm that domestic inflation has remained subdued, and thus ward off fears that UK base rates will be forced higher later this year. Building and construction issues rose after the latest official statistics showed new orders were 10 per cent up from the 1993 first quarter. But there were further signs that investors are turning away from the engineering and vehicles sec-tors, believed by some analysts to have outrun the economic recovery. Progress was somewhat patchy elsewhere in the market, with the food and brewery stocks showing a mixed picture as investors waited for the March retail sales statistics. Pharmaceuticals stocks continued to move nervously as attention focused on SmithKline Beecham and investors pondered the likely effect of the expiry this week of US patents on Tagamet, SmithKline's high selling anti-ulcer drug. London outperformed other leading European stock markets yesterday and UK traders sounded relatively confident that the Footsie can at last climb away from 3,100, if only the bond markets can establish themselves in a new trading range. Strategists were encouraged by the increase in trading volume as the market rallied yesterday afternoon.</p>

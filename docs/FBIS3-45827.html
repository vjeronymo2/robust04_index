Just dial 1601155 -- everything is at your  fingertips.    The 160 Wonder Information Centre, an employment hot line,  has been helping job hunters since last August.    As a branch of the Beijing Tonke Information and Technology  Development Company, it is the first such service in China.    "Station 160 is now known as `know-all' in Beijing," said  Mei  Nan, an official of Tonke.    People who want to find a new job or change professions can  phone the station, explain their needs to an operator, and get  the needed information in just a few seconds.    An individual's resume and an enterprise's brochure can be  stored in the station's "Wonder" computer network. Registered  individuals and companies also can go to the station to search  for information directly.    The computer contains background information on more than  400  companies and 6,000 job seekers.    The job hot line is a joint venture between the Beijing  Telecommunications Administration and Wonder Information Centre,  a private enterprise.    The Tonke Company, an arm of the Beijing Telecommunications  Administration, also manages seven other 160 branch stations  plus a comprehensive station offering a wider range of services.    "Even some big names such as Stone Computer Company and the  Holiday Inn Lido Hotel are registered here," said Li Guige,  executive chief of the station.    The service operates daily for 14 hours, from 8:30 am to  10:30 pm, and can handle 500 calls each day.    The job-finding information stations and the comprehensive  station are serving the public well. In Beijing, for example,  about 34 percent of the people registered have said the hot line  helped them find a satisfying job.    According to the latest statistics, sales promoters are most  in demand -- more than 50 percent of the registered enterprises  want to fill such positions.    People skilled in computer sciences, secretarial work and  public relations also are eagerly sought.    Of the people registered with the hot line, 28 percent have  graduated from a university, and 4 percent have double  bachelor's degrees.    "We aim to attract senior managers and scholars to enter our  network, such as scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences  and famous professors at Beijing University," Li said.</p>

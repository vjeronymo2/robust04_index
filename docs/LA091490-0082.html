			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER MONTOYA AIDE GETS 90 DAYS AFTER PLEA BARGAIN  </P> <P> A former top aide to convicted former state Sen. Joseph Montoya was sentenced  Thursday to 90 days in jail for lying on a Veterans Administration home loan  application.  </P> <P> Amiel Jaramillo, 36, originally was charged with racketeering, extortion and  conspiracy along with his former boss, who is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence in  federal prison.  </P> <P> But prosecutors agreed to dismiss the corruption charges against Jaramillo in  exchange for his guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to a  government agency.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an eight-woman, four-man jury Thursday began deliberating the case  of former Sen. Paul Carpenter, on trial in federal court on four charges of  racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. Carpenter was indicted as a result of  the same investigation of Capitol corruption that snared Montoya and Jaramillo.  </P> <P> The Carpenter jurors started their deliberations after U.S. District Judge  Edward Garcia read them a series of detailed instructions on the complex  federal racketeering and extortion laws. Carpenter, a Democrat who is now a  member of the State Board of Equalization, faces a maximum of 80 years in  prison and a fine of up to $750,000 if he is convicted on all charges.  </P> <P> In Jaramillo's case, he admitted that he failed to disclose that he owed more  than $18,000 in student loans when he filed an application for a Veterans  Administration mortgage loan application in 1987.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Christopher Wing said federal probation officers had  recommended that Jaramillo, now a lawyer in private practice, should not serve  any time behind bars. But U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz disagreed.  </P> <P> Schwartz, who presided over Montoya's trial earlier this year, said that in  handing down the sentence it would be unfair to consider evidence of  Jaramillo's complicity in Montoya's crimes because Jaramillo would have no  opportunity to respond.  </P> <P> "But if the things that came out at that trial were true, there would be a  substantial incarceration sentence," Schwartz said.  </P> <P> Jaramillo was given until Nov. 1 to begin serving his sentence. The delay will  give Jaramillo time to wage a legal fight to retain his license to practice  law.  </P> <P> Jaramillo was chief consultant to the state Senate Business and Professions  Committee, of which Montoya was chairman.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA)--Asyut Governor Samih al-Sa'id  has said that the situation in his Governorate is stable and  that the public is cooperating sincerely and fruitfully with the  authorities. Everyone is aware that we are all in the same boat  and we have to bring it safely to shore, he stated.    The governor called on foreign media not to exaggerate what  he describes as isolated incidents in Asyut.    Interviewed on "Good Morning, Egypt," a program carried on  Cairo Channel 1 Television Network, al-Sa'id said that as of  Wednesday [27 April] 73 repentant terrorists had surrendered to  Asyut authorities.    The governor said that Asyut has several economic, social,  and environmental problems, but "everyone is pitching in and we  have come a long way this year toward resolving these problems."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique "to the Mexican people, the peoples and </F> governments of the world, and the national and international  media" issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command of the Zapatista National Liberation  Army (EZLN) on 24 March; place not given; from the "ACIR Radio  News" newscast -- read by Juan Carlos Santoyo, special  correspondent in Chiapas]    [Text] The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command of the EZLN addresses you to denounce  the following:    1. In the evening of 23 March 1994, we learned by way of a  radio broadcast of the cowardly assassination of Mr. Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI].    2. The EZLN again explicitly condemns the use of  terrorism to achieve any end.    3. The EZLN deeply deplores the fact that the government  cannot resolve its internal problems without bloodying the  people. Federal government hardliners who prefer military  options hatched and carried out this provocation to annul any  peaceful attempt at democratizing the country's political life.    4. The EZLN notes that Mr. Colosio Murrieta always  referred to its movement with prudence and respect. His last  statements indicated he had a clear commitment to compete on  equal terms with other political forces in the nation. He  recognized the fact that great injustices exist in the nation,  and he noted the great distance between the current regime's  words and the implementation of its economic and social  policies. Those people whose raunchy voices decry the hope of  peace, justice, and dignity -- a hope born in the dialogue in  San Cristobal de las Casas -- have now chosen to sacrifice Mr.  Colosio Murrieta to signal the disruption of a peaceful  transition to liberty, democracy, and justice.    5. The EZLN knows that this crime which has rocked the  country is merely a prelude to a large-scale military offensive  by the federal government against our positions and forces and  that it marks the beginning of a dirty war against all of those  honest people who, through different paths, struggle under our  same banner of peace and dignity. By arguing that it is  necessary to reinforce the regime to avert actions such as the  assassination of Mr. Colosio, they attempt to give a political  and ideological basis to their indiscriminate repression and to  destroy the cease-fire and, consequently, the dialogue for peace.    6. There are clear warning signals that the government is  preparing an attempt to impose a military solution in the  Chiapas conflict. On 19 March 1994, the EZLN denounced that  earlier in the day government aircraft bombed near Comitan and  Altamirano on the Mendoza highway. Approximately four  incendiary bombs were dropped by these aircraft, starting fires  and releasing unusual gases, which makes one think that a dirty  war has been initiated.    7. The EZLN has shown proof of its sincere inclination to  achieve a just and dignified peace. The government, however,  has responded with lies, kidnappings, disappearances, threats,  and bombings. Now, with this barbarous slaying of a public  figure, its troops are preparing to break the cease-fire. Our  forces, which are now in the process of holding consultations  within their communities, have decided on the following step in  the dialogue for peace and reconciliation: We are now obliged  to suspend these consultations [ahora nos vemos obligados a  suspender las consultas] and to prepare ourselves to defend our  cause and our banner -- the banner of democracy, liberty, and  justice.    8. The EZLN is on red alert. Our troops -- up to our  last man -- stand ready to defend Zapatist territory. The entry  points have been mined and our combatants are girding for an  attack by the government. The uncontrolled access to newsmen,  which had been part of our policy not to hide anything from the  eyes of our people, has been canceled. In view of the imminent  government attack, only the access of war correspondents, duly  accredited by the EZLN's General Command, will be permitted.  Any person unknown to our forces who enters our territory will  be apprehended and thoroughly interrogated. Warning banners are  waving throughout our territory. The trenches of the Zapatists  will now be open to all of those who want democracy, justice,  and liberty.    9. Our just struggle is afoot. We are still prepared to  follow the path of peace. Those who do not want peace are  trying to return war to Mexican territory -- a war being  promoted by bad government and its servants.    10. The EZLN reiterates to the entire world its  commitment to respect the cease-fire, not to impede the peaceful  development of the upcoming elections, and not to stage  offensive military actions against government forces anywhere  within national territory under the conditions established in  our communique of 12 January 1994. If we are attacked, however,  our forces will defend to the last man the justness of our  aspirations as Mexicans. If our patriotic history demands more  bloodshed or that more of our combatants die in the struggle for  a true peace -- a peace with justice and dignity -- we will not  hesitate to pay the price. With dignity and courage, the  faceless will defend the ground in which our dead are buried.  We will never again return to a land that shames us. We will  never speak again without showing respect for our words. We  will continue walking the path of the highest truth, even though  this may mean death for many of those who defend Zapatism.    [Signed] Subcommander Marcos</p>

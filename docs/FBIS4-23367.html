			<p>BFN     [Text] The genocide in Rwanda received top priority at a  meeting of the seven Frontline States in the Zimbabwean capital  Harare this afternoon. The organization has appealed to all  involved to stop the killings and said it was prepared to offer  military or other assistance to help stabilize the situation.  Estelle Pienaar reports that South African President Nelson  Mandela received a hero's welcome on his arrival in Harare to  attend the meeting:    There was a tumultuous welcome for South Africa's President  Nelson Mandela today as he arrived in Harare for his first  official foreign visit as head of state. Zimbabwean vice  president and one of the founder members of the Frontline States  back in 1974, Mr. Joshua Nkomo, was there to meet him, but at  the conference center in the city delegates of the Global  Coalition for Africa who have been meeting in the Zimbabwean  capital since yesterday, together with the Frontline States, had  depressing matters to address.    The ravaging Rwanda civil war was addressed during a brief  informal discussion of the seven Frontline States' presidents  and South Africa's head of state, President Nelson Mandela. All  were very concerned about the current situation in Rwanda.  Afterwards the Frontline States met for the first time  embracing South Africa into the brotherhood of the subcontinent.</p>

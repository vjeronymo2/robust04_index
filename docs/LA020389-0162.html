			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DEAVER DROPS APPEAL OF PERJURY CONVICTIONS, CITES FINANCIAL BURDEN  </P> <P> Former White House aide Michael K. Deaver today abandoned his appeal of perjury  convictions for lying about his lobbying, saying he wanted to "put this period  of my life behind me."  </P> <P> The former top adviser to former President Ronald Reagan and a close friend of  the former First Family said he is dropping the appeal "with the firm belief  that I was not guilty of the charges of which I was convicted." Deaver also  said he could not continue the "financial burden" of the appeal process.  </P> <P> His lawyers have said that Deaver, a recovering alcoholic, is unable to find  work. The investigation by an independent counsel forced Deaver to close his  lobbying business. In 1986, the height of his lobbying career, Deaver had an  income of $527,958.  </P></p>

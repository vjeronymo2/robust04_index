			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Tatyana Zamyatina report, especially for </F> ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "`Aspen Dialogue' Demonstrates Divergences  of Views"]    [Text] Russia and the United States are leaving behind the  romantic period in their relations begun by M. Gorbachev and  continued by B. Yeltsin. Nowadays the representatives of our  and the U.S. establishment hold diametrically opposed viewpoints  on the majority of Russia's foreign and domestic policy  questions. These divergences were also demonstrated by the  Aspen Dialogue, a Russian-U.S. forum which took place in Sochi  1-6 May. This was the fifth in the series of dialogues, which  was launched in August 1991 by the International Association of  Enterprise Directors [IAED] headed by Konstantin Zatulin -- now  chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and  Relations with Fellow Countrymen -- and the International Center  for Civil Administration (United States) in Aspen, Colorado.    The Americans, who included prominent figures from the  Department of State, politicians, and political scientists --  inquired during the forum primarily about the new Russian  realities and expressed misgivings about a return to  authoritarianism in Russia. The case made by Presidential  Council Member Andranik Migranyan that the suprapresidential  powers given to Boris Yeltsin by the new Constitution will make  it possible to consolidate the democratic transformations in  Russia produced a cautious reaction by members of the U.S.  delegation. They asked: "Is there a hope that the present  enlightened authoritarianism in Russia will create democratic  institutions, which will continue operating after 1996?" And  they added that the Americans feel skeptical about autocracy as  a means of promoting democracy.    Furthermore, Greg Guroff, director of the Department of  State's World Development Agency, stated that the "U.S. press"  and people no longer love Yeltsin as much as they used to and  that there will be no repetition of the U.S. politicians'  support for actions similar to the storming of the White House  in Moscow.    The opinion of IAED President Mark Masarskiy was listened to  with interest in this debate. He believes that "the  regionalization of the economy and the federalization of the  state will hinder a return to authoritarianism in Russia." In  his opinion, the mere fact of the two-tier [dvukhkanalnyy] tax  system will not allow the federal center to concentrate  financial resources in its hands and without those resources  power is not power at all.    There was an equally keen exchange of opinions on mutual  relations between the two great powers. "U.S. policy toward  Russia is one of temporizing and indifference" -- that position  was expressed by Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, well known in  the United States as the number two man after Gorbachev, who  helped to bring down totalitarianism across one-sixth of the  globe's surface. Aleksandr Yakovlev is convinced that the  United States carried out the Marshall Plan to revive West  Europe after World War II solely because that plan was a  continuation of its victory. But for the United States the  revolution of the 1980's and 1990's in Russia was "alien."  Whereas billions of dollars were spent on the Marshall Plan,  nothing has been spent on aid to Russia. "Indeed, there is no  need to," Aleksandr Yakovlev declared. However, the academician  also noted with regret that in the United States there is no  understanding of the fact that "the reform of Russia is of  worldwide significance, especially for the creation of a  postconfrontational situation." From that viewpoint, he  believes, it would be wise for the United States and the Western  powers to assist Russia's entry into the world community because  that process is also proving very difficult.    The U.S. delegates to the forum agreed that their country  does not have a clear policy toward Russia or a clear picture of  what is going on in our country. That was demonstrated by a  movie about Russia which David Shipler, a U.S. journalist who  for many years was THE NEW YORK TIMES Moscow correspondent,  brought to Sochi. Presented as an "intellectual product," this  movie was, in the opinion of the Russian participants in the  forum, a superficial reportage which did not reflect the essence  of the Russian political process even in the slightest.    The participants in the Aspen Dialogue displayed a mutual  lack of understanding about the future of the CIS as well. When  the Russian politicians, in particular Konstantin Zatulin,  chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and  Relations with Fellow Countrymen, explained to the participants  in the forum that Russia cannot leave the 25 million Russian  speakers living in the neighboring foreign countries to the whim  of fate, the Americans immediately countered that by saying:  "Does that mean that the United States must bear the  responsibility for the entire English-speaking population of the  world?" They refused to take into account Andranik Migranyan's  arguments that "Russia is not indifferent to the direction of  the development of the CIS republics because instability and  conflicts in the Commonwealth countries influence the domestic  political situation in Russia itself."    The mutual lack of understanding of the two states'  politicians stems, in A. Yakovlev's opinion, from the burden of  the old ideological cliches, from the legacy of Sovietology -- a  "lost science in a lost era."    However, as for the creation of an atmosphere of trust  between the two powers, this, according to the U.S.  representatives, cannot be formed "centrally" but must develop  "from the grass roots." The question repeated most often by the  U.S. delegation at the forum was about the preferable forms of  aid to Russia. In Mark Masarskiy's opinion, since small and  medium business is the natural environment for the development  of democracy, that is where aid must be given first of all,  bypassing the government. But ITAR-TASS General Director  Vitaliy Ignatenko noted that the press remains an important  instrument of democracy and if the world community does not want  to lose the free flow of information from Russia and the CIS  countries this flow cannot be left without injections of finance  otherwise it will dry up.    The Aspen Dialogue showed once again how difficult the path  toward mutual understanding is and that it is not only the  politicians who have to shoulder those difficulties.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Italian unions to stage jobs protest Italy's engineering unions have called out 400,000 workers for a one-day strike on December 10 in protest at growing unemployment. The strike call comes as Fiat said it would cut its workforce by 5 per cent and Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, said it wanted a further 2,000 job cuts among its 18,500 Italian workers. The move underlines growing levels of labour unrest in different sectors of the economy in the run-up to Christmas. Last night petrol pump operators began a three-day strike; and throughout the rest of the week stoppages have been threatened by various groups of employees in air transport. Unemployment, now close to 11 per cent of the working population, has particularly hit the engineering and metal-working sectors. The unions say the recession is so severe that the Ciampi government must consider reducingthe 48-hour working week and resort to 'solidarity contracts' - a formula which permits work-sharing arrangements and temporary reductions in working hours. At the same time the unions are anxious to instil in both the government and among Confindustria, the industrialists' association, a greater strategic view of industry. The issue of excess labour, they say, must first be considered with in the broader context of Italy's industrial policy and priorities. The employers, they claim, are far too concerned with the mechanics of job cuts and plant closures. A tripartite approach to industrial strategy was agreed in the July 23 accord between the government, Confindustria and the unions on pay and productivity. However, the unions maintain the July pledges have largely been ignored, especially regarding investments in research and development. The engineering unions have traditionally been the most influential in shaping industrial relations. Next week's strike will cover 250,000 in the private sector and a further 160,000 in state-run industries. The strike will extend to Fiat plants which have in recent years tended to ignore such calls. The Fiat, in announcing its redundancy and lay-offs plan last week, rejected the idea of a reduced working week. However, the unions fear the parlous state of the domestic and international vehicle market will provoke more redundancies. Fiat this year will be producing 1.2m cars against a capacity of 2m, which will rise to 2.4m next year.</p>

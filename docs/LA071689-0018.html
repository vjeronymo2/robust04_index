			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSIDE CAA  </P> <P> I found Cieply's article interesting and informative. However, CAA co-founder  Mike Ovitz's impassioned and often smarmy plea (in the accompanying article,  "Straight Talk") for "everyone (in the business) to root for each other" almost  made me lose my lunch.  </P> <P> If I ever had any doubts about Hollywood agents getting an unjust reputation  for being sharks, Ovtiz's statement helped me make up my mind.  </P> <P> What a pitch -- I'm surprised he wasn't holding a puppy in his photo.  </P> <P> FRANCINE PEFKO  </P> <P> Toluca Lake  </P></p>

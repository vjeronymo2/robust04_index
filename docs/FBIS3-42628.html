SOS!... SOS!..." rubric: "`I Do  Not Want To Live in Somalia....': One Year Has Passed. What Has  Changed?"]    [Text] One year ago to the day, our newspaper  published an article under this title, which discussed the  importation of toxic waste to Ukraine. Western "toxic  intervention" may entail terrifying consequences, of which the  experience of countries such as Somalia or Romania testifies in  particular. Oleksiy Kabyka, chief of the Project for the  Prevention of Toxic Trade of the Ukrainian chapter of  Greenpeace, continues the discussion of the subject.    In January 1993, 230 tonnes of extremely dangerous,  chemically toxic substances, which were declared as  "construction materials" and "products of the chemical  industry," were imported to Ukraine from Germany. These facts  were revealed by the associates of the Ukrainian chapter of the  international nongovernmental organization Greenpeace.    The freight was shipped by the German companies Rimeks and  Hannolora Zibrans to the address of the small private enterprise  Podillya in Rivne. Rimeks is doing its semilegal business by  exporting waste, various old chemicals, and chemicals unfit for  use from the territory of the former East Germany to the  countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Incidentally, of the  three founders of the company which was established in June  1992, two, Serhiy Furs and Pavlo Shmaliy, were our countrymen.  The amount of the contract came to 50,000 Deutsche marks. Under  the contract, Podillya and Rimeks were to receive 25 percent of  the profits each, and 50 percent was to be used to establish a  joint venture. Doubts as to the conformity of the freight to  declarations and contracts arose immediately after its shipment  to Rivne. As Yudovich, the commercial director of the small  private enterprise Podillya, stated, "We did not even have an  idea that all of this, putting it mildly, trash would be  delivered." Besides, it came out that part of the freight had  not been declared at all--three drums (approximately 180  kilograms) of metallic mercury waste had been smuggled in. The  Security Service of Ukraine instituted criminal proceedings  precisely on account of the mercury smuggling.    For three months, all freight was stored in the compound of  the Rivne Avtotrans Enterprise. The liquid leaked from the drums  and even dissolved asphalt. It came close to starting a fire  during cleaning at a warehouse where dangerous chemical reagents  were stored: White phosphorus, which was being stored together  with other substances, self-ignited.    In early May, the bulk of the freight was moved to the  compound of a military unit. Some 10-12 tonnes of rusty drums  with dried-up paint and varnish, old canisters, and containers  for solvents and other chemicals were piled up in the open air.  To reduce the stench at least a little, servicemen poured water  on them daily, which washed the substances into the ground. The  most toxic and dangerous part of the freight is being kept at a  large warehouse, where drums are stored along with military  materiel. A second case of self-ignition of chemical reagents  has already been registered. Fortunately, there was no explosion  or fire--the servicemen smothered the flames with sand and  dragged the drum that had caught fire out of the warehouse.  Drums with mercury and pesticides are still being stored in the  compound of Avtotrans in containers.    Following the discovery of dangerous substances among the  freight, it became an urgent necessity to conduct a competent  ecological expert review. Having grasped the entire danger after  the previous inspection of the freight, Ukrainian Greenpeace  resolved to conduct a more thorough review. It was carried out  with the resources of a special radiological-toxicological  laboratory and with the participation of professional German  chemists from the scientific section of Greenpeace. The results  indicated that the substances in question are indeed toxic  (danger levels 1 through 3) and pose a danger not only to the  health but also to the lives of people. The listing of the  freight includes dozens of items, in particular chemical  reagents that are stored in 87 drums and constitute the most  dangerous part of the freight. This includes poisons such as  sodium cyanide, arsenic and mercury compounds, and other  extremely toxic substances.    On the territory of Nikolayev Oblast, Greenpeace activists  have revealed the locations of the storage and burial of toxic  waste from Germany that was imported to Ukraine between 28  November 1992 and 15 March 1993 through Ochakov and Nikolayev.  More than 100 tonnes of these dangerous substances were imported  by the German companies Hayns Ryulikh Agency, Hannelore  Zibrands, and, once again, Rimeks, to the address of the  Nikolayev scientific-production association Pivdenagrokompleks  and the Ochakov Opttorg under the guise of construction  materials and chemical industry products.    The substances in question were examined by a Greenpeace  mobile laboratory. The results of the examination showed that  these chemicals were unsuitable for any use, and that a  considerable proportion of them were toxic and hazardous to  human health.    More than 10 people saw a doctor with symptoms of poisoning  after using out-of-date paint which contained a considerable  concentration of heavy metals. Eight drums with an unknown oily  liquid were dumped and spilled in a forest stand close to the  village of Solyani, Nikolayev Oblast. About 80 broken flasks  with the depiction of a skull and crossbones were found at the  same location. The grass and forest around had already turned  yellow.    In order to attract attention to these facts, members of  Greenpeace, wearing gas masks and gray chemical protection gear,  chained themselves close to the German Embassy, together with  four drums carrying the danger sign, the inscription "Toxic,"  and the names of cities in Ukraine where dangerous substances  imported from Germany have already been found.    Similar surprises do not arrive only from that direction. An  old American liner, the United States, whose  structures hold close to 300,000 square meters of asbestos  bulkheads and ceilings and about 143 tons of powder insulation  from asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance, is currently  moored at the port of Sevastopol, awaiting the final decision of  a commission concerning its future. According to a plan of the  ship's owner, Kakhraman Sadikogly, all dangerous materials on  the ship, including asbestos, should be removed in Sevastopol.  After the United States is cleansed, it will be  returned to Turkey.    Three weeks ago, this "floating coffin" was expelled from  Turkey after protest actions by Greenpeace, local ecological  movements, trade unions, and the government of the country.  Turkey did not accept the ship, taking into account possible  ecological consequences and the potential danger of asbestos  removal work, which calls for special conditions to protect the  health of the workers.    The danger of asbestos, a needle-shaped crystal which may  split into the thinnest of fibers, physically affects cells,  which brings about cancerous diseases. Asbestos dust entering  the lungs and the digestive tract is deposited there and brings  about mesothelioma, asbestosis, peritonitis, and cancer of the  pleura. Even contact with a person who has been working with  asbestos is dangerous to those around him.    The city authorities of Sevastopol, which already suffers  from difficult ecological problems, are cynically preparing a  slow death from cancer for the residents of the city. Measures  to completely ban the use of asbestos are being taken in many  Western countries, where the danger posed by it has been fully  recognized. For example, Sweden and Denmark already have  legislation that rules out any use of asbestos. According to  even the Ukrainian standards, asbestos dust, along with  hydrocyanic acid, are considered Class 1 dangerous substances.    Greenpeace is demanding that the German Government and the  owner of the United States take timely measures to  take back from Ukraine the dangerous waste. Ukraine needs a  complete legislative ban on the importation of waste from abroad  in order to prevent such scandalous cases and problems in the  future.    When this article was ready to be printed, it became  known that German toxic waste experts had finally arrived in  Ukraine. They visited the locations of the storage of German  waste in various regions of the republic and examined them. The  conclusion drawn by the experts is that the waste should be  processed locally, i.e., in Ukraine. Greenpeace does not agree  with this, and demands that the waste be shipped back.    On 17 November, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed  the Decree on the Provisional Statute for the Issuance of  Permits for the Importation of Recyclable Raw Materials and  Waste Replacing Them to the Territory of Ukraine. The  establishment of a catalog of the groups of substances and  materials classified as dangerous wastes which will be banned  from import to Ukraine is envisioned. This legislative act gives  us hope that such incidents will be impossible in the  future.</p>

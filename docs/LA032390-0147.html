Atty.  </P> <P> Paul Odwald said.  </P> <P> Principato owned a green-and-white utility-style truck with a mechanized  attachment commonly used to reach wires strung on power poles. He would knock  on doors and tell the housekeeper or occupant that he was scheduled to repair  either cable television or electrical wires, Odwald said.  </P> <P> Once Principato gained entry, Odwald said, "he would usually secret himself in  a bedroom" and steal jewelry.  </P> <P> Authorities recovered jewelry worth $42,000 from Principato's truck and  clothing, Odwald said.  </P> <P> Principato was arrested June 9 by Newport Beach police.  </P></p>

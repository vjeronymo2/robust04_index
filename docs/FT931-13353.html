			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: A mosaic in the grand style - North Africa is a place of happy lassitude 'Tunis is a land of liberty,' wrote the Chevalier d'Arvieux, a French diplomat, over three centuries ago. 'Religion disturbs no one; they pray to God when they must, fast when they cannot do otherwise, drink wine when they have money, get drunk when they drink too much and no one finds any harm.' THESE words ring true today and explain, as much as the sand and deep blue sea, why more than 2m Europeans travel to the only country in the world whose name is derived from a fish, tuna. The bulk of those who travel to Tunisia go on summer package tours. Others have discovered that off the beaten track, North Africa's smallest country has much to offer. First of all it boasts splendid ancient ruins, the most dramatic of which are in Dougga, on the western uplands near the Algerian frontier, and a collection of Roman mosaics in the Bardo museum in Tunis which is second to none. For those interested in Muslim architecture, the fortified town and grand mosque of Qairwan, which dates from the 8th century, is but the most remarkable of many scattered around the country. The Jewish faith boasts the oldest synagogue in Africa on the island of Jerba, Ulysses' fabled land of the lotus eaters. Every spring, a pilgrimage to the Ghriba synagogue attracts Jews from all over the world to a country where their presence, though much reduced today, spans nearly 3,000 years. For their part, Christians can turn their thoughts to St Augustine, who delighted in the pleasures of Carthage before preaching a more austere creed as bishop of Hippo in what is now Algeria. On a warm summer night, Carthage still evokes a courtesan past her prime but is still attractive. Neighbouring Libya is virtually closed to foreign visitors. This is the first country an ancient traveller from the east would have crossed on his way to the 'Maghreb al Aqsa,' or 'Western land of the setting sun' as people in the Middle East still call the maghreb. Yet, on the sea shore, the setting of the roman ruins at Leptis Magna and Sabrata, both an hour's drive from the capital, Tripoli, are exceptional. Before its present troubles, Algeria attracted maybe 200,000 foreign visitors, mostly headed for the Sahara desert. A quarter of a century ago, the country's leaders set their mind against developing tourism; as a result, Africa's second largest country boasts few decent hotels, most of the state-controlled ones being very run down. Gone are the late 19th century days when guides were published in London called Algiers, The Playground of the Rich, and wealthy English families built what are to this day the most elegant houses in the Mustafa Superieur residential area of the city. Yet those who brave discomfort and explore the Tassili plateau, the mountains around Tamanrasset and the oasis of Timimoun and Tahrit, can discover something of the beauty and magic of the desert. Waiting to be discovered are the strange petrified stone forest of the Tassili, with its thousands of dark silhouettes reminiscent of fur trees weighed down by snow which, on closer inspection, are sandstone needles, and thousands of pre-historic drawings scattered over 50,000 square miles. The red needles of the Hoggar mountains near Tamanrasset are quite as unreal. For those interested in architecture there is the town of Ghardaia, founded by the puritan Mozabite sect of Sunni Islam which proved the great inspiration for Le Corbusier's art. Nearer Algiers, the roman ruins of Tipaza enabled Albert Camus to experience 'the happy lassitude of a wedding day with the world.' To Camus, the ruins of Tipaza were far more 'modern' than many a modern city. This absinthe- and jasmine-scented paradise has, however, today fallen victim to the violence which has engulfed Algeria. Morocco, for its part, boasts almost too many riches: skiing in the Atlas mountains; swimming in the pool of any number of very comfortable hotels in Marrakesh; trekking in the same mountains in late winter or spring through Berber villages which appear like Cubist paintings hung on steep rocks. For those who prefer the sun and sea, Morocco's long Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts offer fun all year round. Resorts vary in tone, though Morocco does not greatly encourage package tours and a number of its hotels cater for the seriously rich. The Palais Jamai in Fes, one of the glories of Islam, the Mamounia in Marrakesh and the Minzah in Tangiers are in the grand tradition. The variety and quality of Moroccan food, which is often sweet-sour, adds to any trip, a true feast providing a seemingly endless flow of dishes. Save for less than half a century as a French protectorate, Morocco has always been independent. Morocco's glory is its Berber and Arab architecture. The 1,000-year old religious capital of Fes is dominated by the minarets of 100 mosques. Unfortunately, mosques and other religious buildings are not open to non-Muslims. Beyond the red city of Marrakesh, from where in winter the visitor can gaze at the 13,000-ft summits of the Atlas 30 miles away, lie Taroudant, Tafraout and other old towns. As the traveller descends to the plain from the frozen passes above, he realises he has landed at the gateway of the Sahara. The contrast is intoxicating, and never more than in late winter when the southern slopes of the Atlas are covered with almond trees in flower.</p>

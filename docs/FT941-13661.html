			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Girobank staff vote to strike on pay Staff at Girobank, a subsidiary of the Alliance and Leicester building society, have voted by a comfortable majority to strike and take other forms of industrial action in protest at a 1.5 per cent basic pay offer plus Pounds 300 lump-sum bonus payments. The executive of the National Communications Union is expected to notify the bank that its 3,300 staff will begin an overtime ban from midnight on Wednesday next week. Other disruption is likely to follow unless the bank improves its offer. In the postal ballot 1,317 bank staff supported strike action with 933 against. The result was more overwhelming when staff were asked whether they were ready to take action short of striking with 1,691 supporting that position and 559 against. The turnout was just under 63 per cent. Union officials pointed out that staff attitudes had hardened since last autumn when they had recommended acceptance of the bank's offer in a consultative ballot. The staff agreement ended on July 1. The NCU say the staff feel the basic rise of 1.5 per cent is too low and too much of the money increase is unconsolidated. But the bank said staff could expect actual rises of 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent this year, around Pounds 500 on average. It added the staff are angry that the offer is not generous enough, coming after Girobank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 64.4m in 1992, the best it has ever made and senior management had secured substantial pay rises.</p>

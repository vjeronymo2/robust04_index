			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih at an Arab </F> Committee for the Defense of Yemeni Unity rally in Sanaa on 28  June -- recorded]    [Text] Brother attendees: In your name and on behalf of  our great Yemeni people, the people of September and October, we  extend our greetings, thanks, and appreciation to the Arab  Committee for the Defense of Yemeni Unity.    From this place, we extend our thanks and great appreciation  for the Arab people everywhere, who are siding with our Yemeni  people in this grave ordeal that erupted on 4 May, led by the  traitor, agent and renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    O dear brothers, O great Yemeni people, O sons of Saba' and  Himyar: Just as you held your ground, defended and championed  your will on 26 September and 14 October, you will champion the  justice and dignity of 22 May 1990. [applause]    O brothers and sisters, O sons of our Yemeni people  everywhere: In your name, we extend our great appreciation to  the masses of our Arab nation everywhere in the east and the  Maghreb of the Arab nation, the Gulf, and the Horn of Africa,  who are siding with you in defense of your unity.    You are not only fighting the separatist clique on the  battlefield. You know who has conspired against your Yemeni  unity. [applause]    We are fighting this clique, which we can describe as  traitorous. Today, they are loitering at the hotel doors to  express their loyalty to the regimes that pay them filthy money  and to receive the price of unity and the price of the pure  blood being shed. They are rushing to the doors of hotels,  offices, and embassies abroad. History will not forgive these  agent, renegade traitors. They will not be heroes in making  unity or heroes in achieving victory. History records only the  names of people who make great achievements. [applause]    Successive resolutions are being issued by the Security  Council. In addition, some regimes and brothers in the Arab  world, as well as some friends are shedding crocodile tears over  Yemeni blood. We tell them from this place, the Hall of Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir, the great Arab leader [applause]: Do not shed  crocodile tears, but stop harming our people. [applause] Stop  harming our people and interfering in the internal affairs of  the homeland of September and October. The pure blood being  shed today is shed to entrench Yemeni unity. [applause]    We greet each woman who gave birth to a struggler to defend  Yemeni unity. Our people today are rushing to embrace (?death)  and are acting out of an absolutely free will to defend unity.  The blood being shed today in Dar Sa'd, al-Shaykh 'Uthman,  al-Mansurah, the city of al-Sha'b, and (?Mandar) in Aden, will  not be for secession or to install the secessionist in Aden as  rulers. This pure blood is being shed to preserve unity and  destroy this separatist, rebellious clique.    No matter what successive resolutions are issued, we will  never accept the implementation of a secessionist resolution.  [applause] No matter what successive resolutions are issued --  to install the traitor al-Bid; the treasonous al-Jifri;  al-'Attas, who is loitering at the doors of intelligence  services; and the third traitor who is sentenced to death,  al-Asnaj -- we will never ever accept their installation under  any circumstances.    Dear brothers, we welcome the Security Council resolutions  that call for a cease-fire. We have said time and time again  that we are willing to cooperate with Security Council  resolutions to effect a cease-fire and start dialogue with the  oppressed elements for the sake of unity and democracy in Yemen.  [applause]    We are willing to respond to, and cooperate with, these  resolutions that call for a cease-fire, in spite of the  strenuous efforts and hardship that some brothers have had to  endure to quickly bring about such resolutions. We highly  appreciate their interest in Yemen. We had hoped that the  greatest service they would do to Yemen would be to stop harming  Yemen. [applause]    Dear brothers and sisters: We invite the local, party and  foreign press in our country to head for the battlefield to  ascertain that the cease-fire, which we announced six times, has  been violated and that the traitors, secessionists, outlaws who  departed from legitimacy do not want a cease-fire. We knew  beforehand what they seek to achieve by violating the  cease-fire. They seek to bring in international troops to  observe the situation in Yemen. The [UN] Charter and  [international] law do not allow any observation or  international troops without the approval of all parties. So no  matter how quickly these resolutions are issued, there must be  an approval by the parties in the Yemeni Republic. We are the  major party, the Yemeni people, in the face of the rebels. It is  not the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping,  the Arab Ba'th Party, the Nasirist Party, or any other party in  the Yemeni homeland, but it is the people, who are one party in  the face of the forces of apostasy and secession.    Once again, we call on our brothers, beloved ones, and  neighbors to stop harming us, to stop harming the Yemeni people.  They must be certain that, just as we remained steadfast in the  fighting and confrontation, with our limited potentials, in  defense of the Yemeni revolution from 26 September 1962 until  1970, we are also ready once again to defend the Yemeni Republic  that was declared on 22 May 1990. [applause]    We do not fight on the front as an army, as parties, or  organizations. The Yemeni people are spontaneously and freely  moving to the front to defend unity.    Some are shedding crocodile tears over brave Aden, the  second  capital, fearing it will be destroyed or hit by the machine guns  or the artillery shells of the forces of legitimacy. All these  bullets and shells are fired by those who deviated from  legitimacy. You know about the biased media covering this and  distorting the facts. When the Republican Hospital area in Sanaa  was hit by Scud missiles, the biased media said this destroyed  area and the dead women and children were located in Aden. Such  is the fairness of the friendly media of those who are concerned  about the bloodshed in Yemen. The biased media want to fragment  the Yemeni homeland. We say to them, from this place, that  Yemen will not be fragmented, will not become two Yemens, and  will not become four or even five Yemens. Yemen will remain one  and united. [applause]    They should know that the 2 billion dollars they spent  during  the crisis will not bring them success. The military and  political infrastructure [of the southerners] was completely  destroyed in five weeks, thanks to the will of the Yemeni  people. They want to destroy Yemen unity. Are they ready to  pay another 2 billion? They should spend another 2 billion for  construction, for sisterly Sudan, for Somalia, and for all the  Arab homeland. They should leave Yemen alone. Yemen will  continue to exist on the political and geographical map.  [applause]    No force in the world can change the Yemeni people, remove  them from the political map of the southern Arabian Peninsula,  or move them to any other place. The Yemeni people will  continue to exist on the political and geographical map.    If some regimes are hostile to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is one Yemeni citizen. Why are they  making the Yemeni people pay the price? I did not come to Yemen,  to the homeland, on the political decision of another country.  I am a citizen of this land. [applause]    Why do we not respect people's freedom? Why do they lack  respect for our will, as we respect them and respect  neighborliness? Why do they not stop harming us and stop  interfering in our internal affairs? The Yemeni people have not  interfered in others' affairs.    Dear brothers: In your name, I greet your sons and beloved  ones in the axes of military operations, asking God to grant  them splendid victory. In your name, we thank the brothers and  friends for their sincere support of Yemeni unity.    We hope the other friends will not change their stands, that  they will maintain their stands as they were at the beginning.  Some announced, at the beginning of the crisis, that they  support unity and democracy. However, at the end of the war,  they began to say something else. They began to speak about  stopping bloodshed. We said: Have you received the price? We  hope positions will not change. [applause]    We extend the hand of cooperation to all those who respect  our will, principles, values, ideals, and faith. We extend the  hand of cooperation to all those who respect the will of this  nation. Those who think that Yemenis will bow down must realize  that we bow only to God almighty. [applause] The Yemeni people  will never bow to any force in the world. We fight for our  dignity, for our existence, for our sovereignty, for our belief,  and for living peacefully on our Yemeni land.    Our unity will not (?pose) any danger to any other country.  It is the unity of the Yemeni people and a unity for the Arab  nation, for the good and unionist Arabs.    Dear brothers: God willing, when the war stops the future  will shine, based on national, modern scientific bases, on all  political, social, cultural, and administrative levels. We will  expand local government power in all Yemeni governorates. The  sons of the governorates will elect their administrative leaders  in their areas. [applause] Local governments will have full  control over all their affairs, except for the sovereign  resources of the Republic of Yemen. Citizens will elect their  local councils, governors, and commissioners throughout Yemen.  [applause]    Dear brothers: We are passing through a crisis and a war.  However, the war did not start on 4 May and the crisis did not  start on 2 August. The crisis began when the secessionists took  their government posts after 22 May 1990. Since then, the  Yemeni people have been living a real crisis. The unity  festival lasted only six months. After contacting their  brothers and friends, who are known for their love and respect  for Yemen, the crisis began and the Yemeni people began to  suffer from this crisis.    Our greetings to you all and to the Arab Committee for the  Defense of Yemeni Unity. Greetings to all professors, to all  thinkers, and to all authors. Greetings to all of you in the  name of our Yemeni people, wishing you success and victory.    God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.</p>

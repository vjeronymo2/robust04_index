			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION  </P> <P> The Times' editorial "Evolution Only, Please" (July 21) failed to comprehend  the educational, scholastic and political issues at hand in Sacramento. Forced  teaching of creation is not the issue. The Times used a non-issue as a smoke  screen to twist public opinion and cover up the real issues.  </P> <P> The issues are:  </P> <P> 1) The proposed science framework states that evolution is a fact and places  this as a foundation for the entire work. The state Board of Education twice  asked for its removal but framework authors have refused to make the changes  the board has the authority to require.  </P> <P> 2) The theory of evolution is presented in a dogmatic way, without applying the  scientific standards of testing, verifying, modifying and refuting. It thus is  presented as a "compelling belief," putting it in the category of de facto  religion, even if it is the religion of secular humanism.  </P> <P> Additionally, material should be included in the textbooks that gives students  information by various credible scientists. Yes, there are scientists who do  not accept evolution (Michael Denton, a renowned Australian biologist, is one),  who say that evolution, particularly macro-evolution, cannot be substantiated.  </P> <P> 3) In addition, this commission is suppressing the First Amendment rights of  students and teachers. The Supreme Court in Edwards vs. Aguillard ruled that  teachers have always had the right under the Constitution to discuss creation  in their classes. Honig and this commission are trying to remove these rights.  </P> <P> REV. LOUIS P. SHELDON  </P> <P> Chairman, Traditional Values Coalition  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

Following an  official reception at the Pardo Palace, Goncz's official  residence during the visit, the Hungarian president and his wife  are having lunch with the King and Queen of Spain at the  Zarzuela Palace. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports:    [Begin recording] [Cespedes] President Arpad Goncz's visit  fits in with the Spanish government policy of paying special  attention to central and eastern Europe and coincides with a  good period in Spanish-Hungarian relations. These [relations]  are without problems; trade has increased three-fold over the  last two years. This is a fact underscored by President Goncz  recently at [Madrid's] Barajas airport where he said that his  visit had a strong economic component.    [Goncz in Hungarian with superimposed Spanish translation]  Our political relations are satisfactory and successful but I  have brought with me a very big delegation--virtually an entire  army--of businessmen. I hope that thanks to them the economic  component of this visit will be enhanced.    [Cespedes] The trade balance currently favors Spain by five  billion pesetas, that is a surplus of 153 percent. Spanish  exports went from 4.8 billion pesetas in 1991 to 14.108 billion  in 1993.    Spanish investment is planned in Hungarian wine companies.  After the sale of 76 trains, by the Kaf company, there are  possibilities that the Talgo [Spanish high speed train] will  link Kiev, Budapest and Vienna.    The situation in Bosnia will be an important topic during  the  political talks that Arpad Goncz and [Spanish Prime Minister]  Felipe Gonzalez will hold this afternoon. The Hungarian  president has said that he hopes that the conflict will be  solved without having to carry out the heralded air strikes.  [end recording]</p>

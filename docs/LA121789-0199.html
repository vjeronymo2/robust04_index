			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> TODAY'S GAME  </P> <P> NONCONFERENCE  </P> <P> UCLA (4-0) at NOTRE DAME (1-3), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- Prime Ticket. Radio -- KLAC (570).  </P> <P> The Bruins have lost four of their last five games to Notre Dame after winning  seven straight from the Irish. In an 82-79 Irish victory at Pauley Pavilion  last January, the Bruins were outrebounded, 39-20, and forward Trevor Wilson, a  two-time Pacific 10 Conference rebounding champion, got only two. "They used  three guards, so we elected to put Wilson out on one of the wings and we didn't  get his rebounding," Coach Jim Harrick said. Notre Dame, traditionally among  the nation's best rebounding teams, got 42 points and 22 rebounds from its  forwards, LaPhonso Ellis and Keith Robinson, but still had to rally from a  13-point first-half deficit. UCLA has struggled this season despite its  unbeaten record -- the Bruins have been outrebounded and they are shooting only  42.4% -- but today's game offers a more intriguing challenge, forward Don  MacLean said last week. "We haven't been as high emotionally as we should be,"  he said. "Now that we've got Notre Dame, we're going to get pumped up and ready  to play some big-time basketball." In the absence of Ellis, who is academically  ineligible this semester, Robinson has been Notre Dame's leader, averaging 14.3  points and 6.8 rebounds a game.  </P></p>

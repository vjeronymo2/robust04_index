			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP POLITICAL UNIT SHUNS WILSON'S BID  </P> <P> The California Republican Assembly, the largest and most conservative  grass-roots endorsing body in state GOP politics, shunned the candidacy of U.S.  Sen. Pete Wilson for governor Sunday.  </P> <P> The assembly instead voted, 170 to 78, to issue no endorsement for governor and  "a vote of no confidence" in Wilson.  </P> <P> The conservative group cited Wilson's pro-choice stance on abortion as the  principal issue defeating his bid. But Wilson was also criticized for  "anti-free enterprise" environmental votes.  </P></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits dreams dashed at Daimler-Benz - Christopher Price in Stuttgart outlines the strategy at Daimler-Benz, where earnings are falling towards DM 1 bn RECESSION, ruinous price wars, cancelled aircraft orders, government defence cuts and the costs of structural change conspired last year to dash Daimler-Benz's dream of crashing through the DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) profits barrier. Net earnings are still in reverse, falling towards DM1bn this year. However, there was no need to panic, according to Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman. The group will roll ahead, complementing the strategic restructuring started in the mid-1980s with some very painful short-term measures. Most of these are destined to bite into domestic operations, notably the cornerstone vehicles business, which last year cast off 14,000 of its German workers while other divisions shed 4,000. Mercedes-Benz, which is planning to cut output by 70,000 vehicles this year, will once again bear the brunt with a net loss of 15,000 jobs. Long-term change will affect Mercedes more than other divisions. Production is being steadily shifted out of Germany into new overseas factories which are both closer to customers and cheaper to man than domestic plants. 'We are internationalising our group, not only at every stage of purchasing, production and sales but also in research and design, in public relations work and among our leading staff,' Mr Reuter said. 'By no means does this imply that we have packed our bags and are ready to leave Germany tomorrow.' One aim was to escape from the circumstances which led to last year's disappointments which followed spring forecasts of profits over DM2bn. The European market failed to live up to expectations of a revival. It relapsed into stagnation and recession. Then a collapse in public sector demand was compounded by chaos in the European exchange rate mechanism, he said. The group was trying to escape the clutches of Germany's peculiar business and political climate. The recent federal budget, for example, meant that the group's defence business would lose about DM1bn in sales this year. The government, he complained, was trying to cut spending 'without any rational concept of how to do so prudently . . . all their efforts appear to hinge more on grabbing and hanging on to votes.' In the US, the reopening of the Airbus subsidies issue threatened the core and expanding aircraft divisions with a trade war. Efforts to merge AEG's railway interests with those of Siemens were blocked by a narrow-minded federal cartel office. German trust laws were in desperate need of overhaul, Mr Reuter said. Daimler has acted to escape from the narrow and over-burdened German capital markets with plans for a listing later this year on the New York Stock Exchange. 'Germany's suitability as a location for business and industry is being questioned increasingly,' Mr Reuter said. 'German companies are said to have lost their international lead in technology. Our entire society, the reasoning goes, has lost its ability to act as one, which throws up barriers we cannot seem to overcome. 'Parties and politicians are being stamped as incompetent and denounced as irresponsible, while the media are viewed as the root of all evil.' There was some truth to these beliefs, Mr Reuter said, but Daimler was not a company given to snap judgments and cavalier attitudes.</p>

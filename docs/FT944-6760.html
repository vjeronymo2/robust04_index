			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: London All eyes in the gilts market will be on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he delivers the Budget tomorrow. Most budgets have a theme, such as Mr John Major's 'Budget for savers' in 1990, and this year's effort looks likely to to be, whether or not it is spelt out in public, a budget for gilts. The chancellor is expected to take the benefit of reduced public spending totals, the result of lower inflation and higher growth, in the form of a smaller public sector borrowing requirement. Having thus pleased the gilts market, he can concentrate on pleasing the electorate with tax cuts in his 1995 and 1996 Budgets. The consensus forecast is that he will knock Pounds 5bn off the 1995 - 96 control total for public spending but Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), thinks the cut could be Pounds 7bn. The market is also expecting to see moves to allow an open repo market, which would improve liquidity. One step which might be announced is that income on gilts will be paid gross of tax in future. Gilts have been buoyant in the run-up to the Budget and were boosted last week as investors appeared to switch from shares to bonds in the face of Wall Street's weakness. The Bank of England will hope the Budget is well received; it is revealing details of its latest auction stock on Wednesday.</p>

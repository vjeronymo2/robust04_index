Katrin Linde said in her statement that according to  statutes  of the headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces, the head of  the headquarters must also be head of the army.    The head of the headquarters is Colonel Ants Laaneots.    Nugis, the speaker of the Riigikogu, said the bill  contradicted the constitution.    Linde claimed that according to the law regulating military  service of Estonian officers, any officer older than 60 must be  discharged from armed forces. Einseln is 63. Linde also said  that according to the same law, no officer could be granted  higher military rank than he had had while serving in a foreign  army.    Estonian Riigikogu on May 4 last year adopted a bill making  retired U.S. Colonel Einseln head of the Estonian army.  President Lennart Meri later made him Major General.</p>

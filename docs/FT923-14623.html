			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (5): Time for a bespoke comeback  -Analysis / Bespoke systems are set for a revival - thanks to software packages, which eclipsed them in the 1980s BESPOKE SYSTEMS are enjoying something of a comeback, albeit in a slightly different form. During the 1980s, the idea of getting software developed precisely to one's needs fell from favour as users switched to the growing number of standard packages becoming available for everything from general accounting to specialised applications, such as hospital bed management. Bespoke development is expensive and takes time, whereas a package can go live relatively quickly and more cheaply. In addition, package developers now use so-called fourth-generation languages, which make program adaptation easier, for example to meet an individual user's demand for extra management reports. There are also parameter options, which allow users to tweak a package to fit their year-ends, product codes and other unique characteristics. Oddly, the basic idea of a modern package as adaptable software, which can be used again and again in different circumstances, is contributing in a major way to the revival of bespoke systems, according to leading computing services companies. 'There are probably no more than a dozen big pure bespoke development projects in the UK at present but what we are likely to see is growth in the integration of existing software with some bespoke work,' says Mr Keith Gathergood, managing director of Anglo-French company, Sema Group Systems. 'Systems integration, using existing software kernels, is becoming a very common form of bespoke development.' This is certainly confirmed by some of the companies studied for this issue of Software At Work. RAC and Lloyds Bank have opted for bespoke systems based on existing software, combining faster development with the prospect of getting precisely the systems they wanted. And software developed for a steelworks by Cap Sesa is now being used in a totally different bespoke system. Sometimes kernel software is bought in from another company. Sema is building a Pounds 13m control system for a British Nuclear Fuels manufacturing plant and is buying the data acquisition system from a specialist in that field. 'No-one would build such a data acquisition system from scratch any more,' Mr Gathergood says. 'It's better for us to use our skills to develop the interfaces and the application systems which the customer's staff will use. We might be able to use this interface software in some future contract.' A typical bespoke system project these days is made up equally of existing software, bespoke software and services such as training and support. The impact of fourth-generation languages on the packages business in the late 1980s could also be repeated in the bespoke software market in the 1990s. 'Software development tools now make it more efficient and quite cheap to build a bespoke system, for example by enhancing existing software. We can see organisations building bespoke systems in this way rather than buying software products,' Mr Gathergood says. Customers are told when kernel software is being used, but they are not concerned: 'The user doesn't see the components, only the total system, and as long as it works the way he wants, he is not bothered. 'Indeed, many users take comfort from the fact that the systems company is reusing existing software. The customer knows he's getting proven software and that he's not alone in using it. 'In addition, in a bespoke project, customers like to have something to touch as soon as possible rather than just receive a monthly progress report. With re-usable software there is something tangible available very quickly.' THE revival of bespoke systems in this form has been boosted by two other developments. First, subsidiary companies and even individual departments are becoming more autonomous partly as a result of advances in telecommunications and computer technology, which have allowed offices to install their own local computers. 'Computing used to be controlled by the computing department but these days major systems procurements are being driven by user departments. Most of our contracts are for systems in their own right, so we have no contact with the IT department, apart from when we have to interface the system with a corporate management information system,' according to Mr Gathergood. The second factor has been the trend to wards fixed-price contracts, which theoretically means user departments can go into a bespoke development contract knowing what they are getting and at what cost. This has become such an issue that the Computing Services Association, which represents 80 per cent of the UK computing services industry by turnover, has put together a briefing document for member companies and their clients. THERE are mixed views on whether these two developments mean bespoke contracts are an extension to the traditional computing department or a threat to it. In many of the case studies reported in this issue the option of using the computing department was considered but rejected, generally by agreement. The computing people were already overloaded, or the application was very technical or specialised. But growing use of systems companies by user departments also reflects a general shift of power away from the central computing unit. This has been picked up by computer manufacturers, some of which stress that less than half their turnover now comes from equipment sales. Indeed, the likes of IBM, ICL, Unisys and others have joined the Computing Services Association in recent years. Mr Gathergood plays down the role of computer manufacturers, as might be expected. 'Their whole culture is geared towards selling hardware and getting into systems integration is alien to them,True systems houses have no allegiance to any manufacturer and have the user's interests at heart.' This view, however, is contradicted by Philip Crawford, UK director of the systems operation at computer supplier Bull HN Information Systems. 'Historically the hardware manufacturers were seen as box shifters - and some still are. Even three years ago my group was probably seen as a means to the end of selling hardware. We've now won our independence - but it's been hard-fought internally. The emergence of open systems has made a difference. Services now have to stand on their own: my profit and loss excludes our own hardware.' Mr Crawford also points out that his team now develops software packages to run on competitors' equipment, for example in local government, where IBM and ICL are strong. In bespoke systems contracts the company includes other computers where necessary: two current tenders it is bidding for stipulate IBM or Hewlett-Packard machines. In addition the company includes rival equipment in its bids if it feels the other machines are more appropriate. 'Otherwise, we might gain a computer sale in the short term, but in the long term I am more interested in a good customer reference,' Mr Crawford says. 'Potential customers initially believe we are not independent and I understand that. We have to work to prove our independence but what does independence mean? Given freedom of choice, any systems house will naturally go to the equipment it knows best.' With the expected regeneration of the bespoke-cum-systems integration market, issues like that could soon be back in debate.</p>

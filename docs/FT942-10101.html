			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Technology: Abbey gears up for D-Day - The UK bank's new computer system Next Monday, Philip Hallatt, director of shareholder services at Abbey National, will know whether the project on which he has spent most of the past two years can be counted a success. May 16 is D-day for Abbey - the day when its 2.6m shareholders must receive their dividends. It will give the greatest test yet to the newly-installed computer system set up when Abbey decided to carry out its own registration services in-house. When Abbey converted from being a building society to a bank in July 1989, it bought in registration services from Lloyds Bank, the market leader in registration. But, Hallatt says, Abbey always intended to consider moving registration in-house - conscious that, having begun with 5.5m shareholders, there was a clear prospect of economies of scale not available to all plcs. At first the plans were based on the implementation of Taurus - the London stock exchange's paperless trading system. But when Taurus was scrapped, Abbey knew it would have to look at a system which could cope with a continuing dependence on paper, at least for a while, and chose Computer Management Group, as its adviser in devising a custom-built system. The fact that 95 per cent of Abbey's shareholders are among its 12m customers increased the need to get the system right - because there was more to lose than the mainly small individual shareholdings if they were dissatisfied. 'We had to look at standardising the service provided,' Hallatt says. But that same fact also enhanced the benefits of developing a system which could cross-reference shareholders in their capacity as customers. In time, Abbey is looking to be able to achieve full cross-referencing - facilitating, for example, direct payment of a dividend into a savings account, or share dealing from accounts. One of the most important features of the system is that it is based on relational database theory and techniques. This means that the software can obtain information from the system in a very complex way. As Hallatt describes it, the system should be able to provide information in a way that it was not expected to be able to access when it was set up. 'It's a way of being able to meet unspecified future requirements,' he says. But the greatest technological development, as Abbey sees it, is in the system's use of document image processing. Abbey is by no means the first organisation to use document imaging - essentially a means of storing paper on screen - but it is the first to use the technology to do more than allow the system to act as a 'cupboard'. 'No other organisation in Europe is using DI technology in this way,' says Hallatt. 'In the UK we only see people using DI in storage and retrieval mode, not in interacting.' One relatively straightforward example of how this interacting works can be seen in the handling of change of address forms. A shareholder fills in a form at a branch: when this document is fed into the system, the system itself will check that the shareholder's unique number has been filled in and that the form has been signed. If the form is not properly completed, the system will automatically reject it and send it back to the individual with a standard letter - bearing an electronic signature - explaining what is missing or wrong. If, when the computer checks the form it sees that it is correctly filled out, it will route the screen image to one of the work areas. A screen operator will not see the whole image of the document - he or she will see only the new address to be typed into the database. The system has proved much quicker than previous methods of processing such routine information. Although the processing office, in Sheffield, has been open only since the end of February, it is already turning round inquiries more quickly than Lloyds did. The Sheffield office employs, at present, some 125 staff, while at different times Lloyds had had between 150 and 250 people dealing with Abbey's work. After a 2 1/2 week backlog at Lloyds, Hallatt says, the new system has brought matters 'almost entirely up to date' in most areas. It does, however, raise some issues for management. One is the creation of an environment in which staff are confident in relying entirely on the system. The destruction of the paper forms after a month or so is less striking in this regard than the fact that an individual operator will see only part of the form he or she is processing, and will have to trust that the system has done its part properly. The system will not satisfy the instinctive inclination just to cast a quick glance over the rest of the form. The other issue is how to use constructively the welter of management information that the system will provide. Hallatt is very conscious of the effect on staff morale of finding after a long day's work that the number of transactions waiting to be dealt with has actually increased. The system's ability to provide information down to the level of the individual operator about how long documents take to be processed may also be a mixed blessing. It is an advantage if it is seen as a way of reducing backlogs by shifting the flow of work to teams of operators who are less busy, but it could have an adverse effect on morale if it is seen as a threat by management hanging over an operator. The project should pay for itself within two to three years: although the set-up costs ran into millions, they still amounted to around one year's fees paid to Lloyds. And there could be a further payback. Hallatt says that over the past 18 months, Abbey has been discussing its system with some other large PLCs. 'At the moment, our priority is to ensure that the changeover and aftermath goes smoothly,' he says. 'We believe that by the beginning of next year, we will be in a position to take on other registers on a commercial basis.'</p>

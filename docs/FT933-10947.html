			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: The quick routes to browner, shapelier legs  -A look at ways to reduce the shock when you take off your tights and walk to the beach IT'S summertime. You are heading for the beach and your legs do not look much like Julia Roberts'. What, if anything, can you do? Quite a lot, actually. You have probably left it a bit late for a serious programme of toning and exercising but almost every beauty salon, health club and posh department store has developed a range of treatments which at the least leave the skin softer, smoother and better-textured and just may do a little bit more. Harrods has remodelled, upgraded and altogether made much posher, its Hair and Beauty Salon. More importantly, it includes a much wider range of treatments. You could go in for something as simple as a pedicure and some chiropody or, if you wanted instant toning, you could try special treatments such as Ionithermie, Aromazone, Lymphatic massage or hydro-therapy. This summer has seen a boom in the number of creams, gels and lotions all purporting to turn lumpy, dimpled skin into blemish-free silk. I have tried two - Dior's Svelte Body Refining Gel (Pounds 25) and Shiseido's Body Contouring Complex (also Pounds 25) - and though neither made any significant difference to my shape, the massaging the lotions require and the oils and extracts in them, undoubtedly leave the skin much softer. They are also remarkably unoily so that you do not risk spoiling tights, sheets or clothes. Anybody thinking of spending Pounds 25 on such alluring prospects should understand that no miracles are likely. Probably just as effective at a fraction of the price would be using a body brush (The Body Shop sells them for Pounds 5.50) to brush the skin on your legs for at least five minutes a day. One of our design team, Frances Trowsdale, tried out a few more. 'Decleor has a night and a day treatment,' she says. 'I massaged the night one, Decleor's Firming Body Oil (Pounds 18.30 for 50ml), into my legs after a bath with a gentle body brush using circular movements as instructed. It is a thick pungent oil and should be used at night but never before putting on fine clothes. To my amazement the results were instant - soft silky legs. 'In the morning I used the Decleor Sliming Body Cream (Pounds 27.75 for 150g). This non-sticky non-greasy cream left the skin feeling firmer and the circulation much improved - I feel all that massaging helps.' All legs, of course, look better brown but now we know just how dangerous sitting in the sun is the obvious answer is: acquire a tan before you go on holiday. From a bottle. Jill James tried some. 'The pick of the self-tanning lotions for my (very) pale skin,' she says, 'was Estee Lauder's self-action tanning spray. It was so natural - I tried the medium bronze colouring - that colleagues failed to spot that I had a tan at all. A respray made them take notice. This was because my arms acquired two shades of colour because of my inexperience in applying it. But, where I had managed to get an even cover, it really did look natural. 'The only snags with the spray are that it is difficult to apply evenly and you are advised to leave one hour before you put your clothes back on. This proved tricky on a busy Saturday morning in our house - milkman calling to be paid, paperboy delivering the wrong magazine, son's friends wanting to know if he can go swimming. 'For the face, I liked Helena Rubinstein's Golden Beauty self-tanning lotion. Easier to apply than a spray, this cream gave an even, natural tan and I might be tempted to use it as an all-over cover this summer. But a word of warning - all the tanning lotions left my clothes stained and bra washing was a real chore.' In the city, even the best, brownest, longest legs look better covered. The Sock Shop has splendidly light, flesh-coloured sheers called Cosmetics For legs at Pounds 4.99 a pair.</p>

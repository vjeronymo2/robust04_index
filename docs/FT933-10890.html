			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Chancellor arrives in Brussels MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, was seeking yesterday to play the honest broker between the warring factions in continental Europe as finance ministers met, writes Peter Marsh in Brussels. There were suggestions in the Belgian capital that he would use the UK experience to offer a constructive way out of the exchange rate mechanism impasse, perhaps by suggesting that other countries follow Britain's lead and allow currencies to float outside the system, so allowing lower interest rates. There have been signs of an upturn in the UK economy since Britain left the mechanism last September. However, the chancellor was thought to be keen not to alienate Germany and France. He said the UK would be 'helpful' and wanted 'a sensible solution' that would assist European recovery. Mr Clarke faces domestic pressure to lower base rates, held at 6 per cent since January.</p>

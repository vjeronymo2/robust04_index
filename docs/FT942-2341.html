			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Fresh formula for complex equation: Ways of making higher education in the UK more appropriate to greater numbers Mass higher education in the UK is already a reality. While there has been widespread support for its expansion, debate on how best to organise it and how to fund it is now gathering heat. The proportion of 18-year-olds going into higher education has more than doubled in past 15 years, from 13 per cent in 1980-81 to 31 per cent this year. This growth has been engineered by the government, which had aims to raise the numbers in higher education to 33 per cent by 2000. Higher education in the UK now reaches almost as many 18-year-olds as in Germany (31 per cent) and the US (38 per cent). But such rapid growth raises questions over the quality of higher education, and whether the courses on offer are appropriate to today's needs. They are not suitable, according to Professor Peter Toyne, vice-chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University, who suggests the system is out-dated. 'We are at an important point in history where we are struggling to keep a system afloat which is based on past assumptions. If it's going to go further forward, reform has got to be radical,' he says. Many employers feel that universities in the UK, despite their recent expansion, are still organised along lines developed to educate a much narrower elite in the 19th century. They fear that universities do not take account of the growing demand from employers for a different, more flexible, concept of higher education. For example, the Confederation of British Industry says in its report, Thinking ahead, published this month, that there needs to be more flexibility in universities so that they offer access to people at all stages of their careers, not just for three years after leaving school. 'Higher education is, and must be seen, as a resource for those in employment to update their knowledge and skills as it is for young people,' it says. The CBI wants students to be able to transfer easily between universities, to take career breaks and to follow courses while working. It also wants the proportion of 18-year-olds in higher education to rise further to 40 per cent. But Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, insists there must be 'no reduction in standards'. He recognises that the problem for policymakers is that extra flexibility might lead to adulteration of quality. Last week saw an important attempt in the UK to square this circle. The Higher Education Quality Council, a self-regulatory body of vice-chancellors which has government backing, published a report, Choosing to Change, which advocates a new, flexible system of academic credits and modules. Large degree courses would be split into discrete subject units, or modules. Each module would then be worth a fixed number of academic credits. This would create a 'common currency' for accumulating credits towards a degree - regardless of whether the credits were obtained in conventional higher education or vocational training. The report also recommends the creation of an 'associate degree' mainly via vocational training. With extra credits this could be upgraded into an eventual honours degree, normally gained by three years of purely academic study. The associate degree would also give students a qualification they could use to look for employment after only a short period in higher education; later, they could return to complete a superior, honours degree. Such a system is on the way. Around 85 per cent of UK universities now have some system of credit accumulation, or plans to introduce it. Agreeing a common standard should thus be possible. To make this system work, the report, drafted by Professor David Robertson of Liverpool John Moores University, recommends that universities should also adopt a standard national transcript on which tutors and lecturers would fill in details of students' progress upon completion of each module. Thus students could transfer more easily from one university to another, while employers would have a better grasp of a potential recruit's university career. The CBI is keen on the idea, and believes it would enhance quality. According to Mr Tony Webb, the CBI's director of education policy: 'Degree courses should ensure individuals take control of their learning and develop their core skills. A final grade cannot capture this development adequately. It needs to be complemented by a record of achievement.' But many in the academic community believe the HEQC report goes too far. For example Professor Robertson attacks some modular courses which have already been introduced in the UK as 'phantom' arrangements. These split courses into modules, but 'without necessarily permitting any greater internal choice or flexibility'. Several vice-chancellors have implemented the 'phantom arrangements' which Prof Robertson attacks, and fear that allowing greater freedom to 'pick and mix' would lead to weaker qualifications. Professor Ron Johnston,vice-chancellor of the University of Essex says his institution will introduce modular courses in 1995. But it will be for administrative convenience and to make life easier for mature students taking a degree while continuing a career. A core of compulsory modules will be maintained to ensure students do not avoid important but difficult courses - for example Chaucer in an English degree or maths in an economics degree. Prof Johnston says: 'A lot of students benefit from the traditional degrees even though they aren't equally desirable for some other people. My fear is that the possibility of a sustained three-year period in higher education which is linear and structured could be squeezed out.' Another who is nervous about the more radical suggestions of the HEQC report is Professor Mike Brown, chief executive of De Montfort University of Leicester, the fastest expanding university in western Europe. He also has introduced modular courses but places limits on students' choices. 'We would not want to encourage people that they could just take things off the shelf. We need them to do something which meets the marketplace's needs,' he says, adding that American academics now seem nervous that choice has become too varied, and want to instal more control over the choices students make. There are other reasons to fear that quality will be adulterated. Trying to ensure that credits are fully transferable between institutions means standards may sink to a 'lowest common denominator'. Prof Robertson sets out to answer these objections. He wants more guidance for students, and a quality control 'kite-mark' scheme for educational brochures, to ensure that students do not misuse their freedom to choose courses. Assurance of quality, he suggests, should be an institutional responsibility but it should be buttressed by a central evaluation service for academic credits, a consultative forum with professional bodies and employers and an annual conference on higher education and the labour market. The higher education community will spend the next few months analysing whether these safeguards are adequate. Rigorous quality assurance, if it can be achieved, will be the key to making university expansion work for emp-loyers. The government, in the form of Mr Boswell, welcomed the contribution the report has made to the debate and hinted at government support for the transcript proposals. But for now the interest of the higher education world is on how the government plans to fund the expansion in numbers due to resume in 1997. The debate among politicians over who should pay for mass higher education - in particular whether students should bear some of the extra burden - has barely started. With curriculum reform and restructuring likely to be costly, such issues cannot be ignored for much longer.</p>

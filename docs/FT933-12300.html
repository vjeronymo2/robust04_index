			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Complicated tax rules I WAS ABROAD when the 1993/94 Budget was submitted to parliament. In due course, I saw that the tax dividend credit on shares had been reduced to 20 per cent from the previous 25. I am still not clear as to the effect this will have on my income tax. In April 1993, I had no further tax liability (as a standard 25 per cent taxpayer) on dividends received. Does the new provision mean that I will have to pay the additional 5 per cent when my annual tax assessment is raised? If your income does not exceed the basic-rate limit, you will be liable only to tax at 20 per cent on your dividends (not 25 per cent). On the other hand, higher rate-payers have to pay 40 per cent on their dividends. The effect of these new tax rules for dividends is very complicated for capital gains tax-payers (and, indeed, the rules had to be re-written at the committee stage of the Finance (No 2) Bill). They are difficult to explain in words, but we shall be happy to give you a specimen calculation if you care to suggest some likely figures of (a) UK dividends, (b) foreign dividends, (c) other income, and (d) net chargeable gains. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

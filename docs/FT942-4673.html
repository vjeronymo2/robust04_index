			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late buying spurt takes Nikkei back above 21,000 After a lacklustre morning and afternoon which produced modest gains in light trading, a wave of buying drove the market back above the 21,000 mark in the final minutes of the day, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average saw a day's low of 20,735.05 at the opening but, largely on foreign buying and sporadic bargain hunting after three days of declines, was lifted gently through the morning and most of the afternoon. In the final minutes of trading a barrage of futures-linked buy orders pushed the index up sharply to a close of 21,042.71 for a rise of 316.06, just below the session's high of 21,053.71 recorded seconds earlier. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 gained 3.65 at 307.31 and the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 17.06 at 1,681.58. Volume was an estimated 270m shares. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.68 firmer at 1,389.39. Large-capital and high-technology stocks came back to lead the advance. Oki Electric, the day's volume leader with 12.7m shares traded, climbed Y24 to Y708. Fuji Heavy Industries, the manufacturer of Subaru cars, was up Y14 to Y470 in the day's second highest volume of 5.7m shares. Other auto makers also gained, Mazda Motors roaring up Y33 to Y621 and Isuzu Motors adding Y16 at Y517. Nintendo rose Y20 to Y6,630 in spite of a morning report that the game maker had been found guilty of patent infringement by a US Federal court. The case, which could cost Nintendo Dollars 350m, is being appealed with a damage ruling expected on July 18. More and more traders were talking about higher share prices in the near to medium term. One analyst, basing his optimism on the recent strength in a number of retail areas, particularly ladies' garment sales, suggested that the Nikkei could gain 20 per cent this year. But another area of garment retailing took a beating in today's market. The menswear discounters, Aoki International and Aoyama Trading, dropped Y220 to Y2,380 and Y100 to Y517 respectively. Both companies, especially Aoyama, have been extremely profitable but competition has been mounting rapidly, with many traditional large retailers now moving into deep discounting. In Osaka the OSE average put on 120.21 at 23,802.81 in volume of 110m shares. Roundup Some sharp falls were registered in the region yesterday. BANGKOK was heartened, however, by an easing of domestic political tensions, prompting investors to buy finance and bank issues. The SET index rose 20.38, or 1.5 per cent, to 1,383.39 in turnover of Bt10.06bn, more than double Monday's Bt4.5bn. A two-week hunger strike by a political activist, Chalad Worachat, who was demanding democratic reforms, had increased tension within the ruling coalition. But yesterday political parties agreed to support his latest proposal to set up a committee to study drafting a new charter. The banking sector accounted for almost half of the day's trade. Bangkok Bank closed Bt6 higher at Bt188. HONG KONG encountered futures related selling linked to speculation about today's government property package, aimed at cooling the overheated residential property market, and renewed rumours about the health of the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping. The Hang Seng index lost 135.15, or 1.4 per cent, at 9,247.88 in turnover that rose to HKDollars 3.6bn from Monday's HKDollars 2.8bn. Property issues were the hardest hit. Cheung Kong shed 75 cents to HKDollars 38.25, Henderson Land 75 cents to HKDollars 40.50 and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 51. China stocks were mixed. The state-run Dongfang Electrical Machinery eased back from its high, but still ended with a 10-cent gain at HKDollars 3.275 on its second day of trading. SINGAPORE was mixed, with losses in a few index stocks dragging the Straits Times Industrial index down 24.70 to 2,267.21 in thin volume of 106.1m shares. Fraser &amp; Neave, SDollars 18.30, and Inchcape, SDollars 5.65, dipped 20 cents apiece. Negara Hotel made a further 30-cent gain to SDollars 6.50 on further redevelopment speculation, but profits were taken in Seaview Hotel, driving it down 70 cents to SDollars 10.40. SEOUL remained worried about the North Korea nuclear problem and the composite index ended 8.54 lower at 921.72, after touching 914.94, in turnover of Won585.2bn. Against the trend, institutional demand helped low-priced construction stocks to make gains. Among them, Poonglim Industry and Shinwha Engineering &amp; Construction went limit up by adding Won600 each at Won11,200 and Won15,100 respectively. MANILA saw its fourth consecutive decline as profits were taken in blue chips and foreign institutions sold San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index shed 27.52 to 2,994.54 as turnover rose to 851.3m pesos from Monday's 633.9m. San Miguel 'B' fell 2.8 per cent to 135 pesos and Manila Electric 'B' 2.7 per cent to 357.50 pesos. SYDNEY was supported by buying of industrials, but further weakness in gold stocks left the All Ordinaries index 2.3 easier at 2,070.2. Turnover amounted to ADollars 357m. Brokers said a fall in the price of gold bullion overnight contributed to negative sentiment, and forecasts were that the bullion price would remain under pressure for the next few days. The gold shares index recovered some ground to close 14.6 off at 2,223.4, after a session low of 2,202.5. Fears over the future of mining projects in Papua New Guinea also upset investors after the government there suspended further proposals. Among companies involved in mining in PNG, Niugini lost 5 cents at ADollars 5.10 and Highlands Gold 2 cents at ADollars 1.38. In industrials, News Corp fell 8 cents to ADollars 8.90. Foster's Brewing was steady at ADollars 1.14 after announcing a corporate restructuring on Monday. TAIPEI finished off the day's low on late buying in the electronics sector. The weighted index was down 7.40 at 6,069.85, after 6,028.03. Turnover declined to TDollars 66.2bn from Monday's TDollars 73.8bn. WELLINGTON, closed on Monday, saw the NZSE-40 capital index slip 17.12 to 2,121.88. An announcement that a three-year ban on logging in the Pacific Northwest US region had been lifted triggered a wave of selling in forestry stocks that spread to other sectors. Telecom went against the trend with a rise of 8 cents to NZDollars 5.11. KUALA LUMPUR closed firmer but off its highs after a late round of profit-taking in a session dominated by second line stocks. The composite index added 2.36 at 972.42. KARACHI opened a new account with bullish sentiment in energy stocks, on rumours of favourable treatment for the industry in tomorrow's budget. The KSE 100 index advanced 22.5 to 2,239.32, with Sui Northern Gas up Rs3 at Rs68.50.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> DETECTIVE ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE  </P> <P> A woman detective with the Sacramento Police Department has been charged with  illegally using police computers to help her body-builder boyfriend in a  steroid sales scheme. Vicki Romani, 31, who has been released on bail, is  charged with conspiring with William Cambra to unlawfully use the police  computer and with obstructing justice. Cambra, a former "Mr. California" and  owner of a health club, was arrested last month on charges of conspiracy,  possession and sales of anabolic steroids. He pleaded not guilty in U.S.  District Court in San Diego last week. Authorities accuse Romani of running  vehicle license checks for Cambra on the police computer to screen possible  undercover agents investigating his activities. If convicted, Romani could face  up to five years in state prison.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (42): There is no going back - As many as 19m rural enterprises have mushroomed in China over the past 15 years / Township and village enterprises discover new prosperity IN 1978, Mr Wang Zhou Long set up a small steel workshop outside De Yang, an industrial city in Sichuan province which already boasted some formidable state-owned steel plants. Mr Wang was the village accountant. He had learned mathematics at primary school but otherwise had no formal education. He initially employed 27 people and had, he says, no money, no technicians and no equipment - 'the idea was developed by all of us,' Mr Wang says. 'Everybody wanted to get rich.' Today, De Yang Iron-Steel Plant is the tenth largest township enterprise in China. It has 3,100 staff - almost all of whom previously worked on the land  -and earns a pre-tax profit of Yn80m for the eight townships which own it. Its products sell in 23 provinces as well as Thailand and Taiwan, competing with those of state-owned companies - on what had been farmland sprawls a rough-and-ready collection of furnaces and equipment churning out steel bars and pipes. Mr Wang says he is not a rich man, earning only a salary. But he is a prominent figure in the community as the recently-elected town leader and a member of the National People's Congress. He is ambitious for his company, having opened two new furnaces this year alone at a cost of Yn70m. With Yn40m still at his disposal for further expansion, 'I can negotiate with anybody,' he says. He is discussing the establishment of a Dollars 10m aluminium alloy factory with a Taiwan company. This is just one of the estimated 19m rural enterprises which have mushroomed in China over the past 15 years. Conceived as a means to soak up the surplus of farm labour created by agricultural reform, they have become the most dynamic sector of the economy. The entrepreneurs who run them will have a lasting impact on Chinese life and business culture. The new bosses are people with little or no education or special skills  - in many cases, their schooling was terminated by the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. They are people who instinctively spot market opportunities and exploit them. To an extent not known in Chinese business since the 1949 revolution, they must live on their wits. Many of them are already very rich. Township and village enterprises account for about one-third of China's gross value of industrial output. They employ about a quarter of China's 430m rural workforce, account for about one-third of farm incomes, and are still growing rapidly. By 1992, according to economists at the International Monetary Fund, they accounted for 25 per cent of China's exports, with textiles, clothing and arts and crafts products accounting for nearly half this figure. Their activities range across the whole gamut of products and services where demand had not been satisfied by the lumbering central planning system - from car repairs to to shoes to vegetables. Technically, the enterprises are collectives owned by townships and villages and may be quite closely supervised by town or village authorities. Many are, however, effectively in the private sector. Rural enterprises operate under the advantages and disciplines of the marketplace. They have far greater flexibility than state-owned industry: they do not have to answer to a supervising bureaucracy; they can sell at market prices and set pay levels as they want; because their employees are already housed on the land, the enterprises have no 'iron rice bowl' responsibilities to them; they enjoy tax concessions for their first several years and profit re-invested in expanding production is tax-free. The obverse side of this freedom is the absence of the protection enjoyed by state industries. Rural enterprises have no guaranteed market for their products. They have no access to soft loans. When the economy turns against them - as it did with government austerity measures from 1988 to 1991 - many go to the wall. This makes for efficiency but also for vulnerability. In Xian Yang township near Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where 5,500 of the 15,000 population are employed by 34 township enterprises, the township arranged to inject equity into some of them when bank finance was temporarily cut off this summer because of central government moves to tighten credit. Frustrated by their inability to predict the whims of Beijing, many rural industrialists are becoming involved in both local and national politics. Potentially, they represent a strong middle class political force. As the government seeks to revitalise sick state-owned enterprises which it has long protected, the businessmen who have come up the hard way will be increasingly sensitive to official favouritism towards state industry. As they seek to develop, rural enterprises will face a number of problems. Many bosses complain that China's poor infrastructure hampers efficiency and increases costs. The new culture of competitive, money-making business is to be found in unlikely places. Mr Qiu Guobing, 68 years old and a Communist Party member since 1952, has more than doubled the productivity of his fish farm, a village enterprise just outside Chongqing in Sichuan, since reforms began. He sells his fish by auction to the highest bidder, he runs training courses on fish farming techniques, and his biggest problem is theft. He sees no going back to the starvation he witnessed in the 1970s - 'the People's Commune was said to be a paradise. But it made people foolish. People were cheated,' he says. 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics is very suitable. Local markets everywhere are very prosperous. This way is leading to prosperity.'</p>

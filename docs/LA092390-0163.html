			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> WINNING WITH A SHOCK TO THE BODY POLITIC;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS RESPONDED TO JOHN SILBER'S CANDOR.  </P> <P> Journalists often are the last to learn what is happening, even after it has  happened. The morning after John Silber won the Democratic nomination to be  Massachusetts' governor, the Washington Post said, "Silber gave a voice to the  more conservative and disaffected Democrats but wounded himself repeatedly  through a series of intemperate remarks."  </P> <P> Right. Wounded himself to victory. "Self-immolation" was a Boston press  description of Silber as he rose from a late start, and dead last, to a  landslide victory.  </P> <P> Silber, 63 and on leave as Boston University's president, has a mind full of  sandpapery opinions and a barbed tongue with which he speaks his mind.  </P> <P> The most interesting "shocker" was his his call for the elderly to get on with  dying so government can get on with balancing the budget. Of course he said no  such thing, but a lot of people had fun pretending he did.  </P> <P> During a discussion of health-care financing and terminal illness Silber said,  "Shakespeare was right when he said 'Ripeness is all.' When you've had a long  life and you're ripe, then it's time to go." His quotation from "King Lear"  occurred in the context of facts like these:  </P> <P> In Massachusetts $250,000 or more may be spent on futile medical procedures for  someone terminally ill, yet there is insufficient money for detoxification of  pregnant women addicted to cocaine or alcohol. (The public cost per affected  child: more than $200,000 before kindergarten.) Poor children are contracting  polio, whooping cough and measles because there is not enough money for  inoculations.  </P> <P> Perhaps, said Silber, society's resources are not being allocated properly; the  low-income elderly might like less of society's finite resources devoted to  heroic measures for the terminally ill and more to eyeglasses, hearing aids,  dentures and prescription drugs. Silber's opponent said: "Silber wants to  ration health care for the elderly."  </P> <P> Silber responded that medical care is always rationed, to some extent, by  limitations on resources and by price. And when children are dying of  preventable diseases two miles from where millions are being spent on futile  measures for the terminally ill, that, too, is a form of rationing.  </P> <P> Silber's problem, if such it is, is that he, a former professor of philosophy,  has the habits of a professor. "Typically, I put forward a statement for  examination and then develop evidence and argument toward a conclusion. In the  context of a political campaign, I've discovered that the first thing one says  -- and often it is said to attract attention -- is taken as the sound bite and  the definitive position of the candidate on a subject. If the candidate makes  any effort to enlarge upon that sound bite, he is then accused of having  changed his position."  </P> <P> By the way, the "intemperate" Silber got 55% of the elderly vote.  </P> <P> Silber is a conservative Democrat. Both the adjective and the noun are correct.  </P> <P> As a Democrat he believes in strong, interventionist government. In the context  of the enveloping urban crisis, he particularly favors early intervention in  the lives of poor children.  </P> <P> As a conservative he is offended by the policies and vanities that have made  Massachusetts a byword for mismanagement. And the intervention he favors -- as  with public education, particularly for the poor -- is a conservative's  response to the breakdown of civility and order.  </P> <P> But the importance of his candidacy is not just that he is resuscitating an  honorable persuasion that is no longer adequately represented in the Democratic  Party. His candidacy also is important in vindicating the practicality of  campaigning with edge, bite and mind.  </P> <P> The effort to enforce blandness in general, and squishy liberal consensus in  particular, achieved its greatest success with the Senate's rejection of Robert  Bork, a former professor with temperamental as well as ideological similarities  to Silber.  </P> <P> The confirmation hearings for DavidSouter were instructive about the  consequences of blandification. Souter, a complex and intellectually subtle  man, strove to seem less so than he is, in order that he more closely resemble  the members of the Judiciary Committee. Very prudent.  </P> <P> The uncomprehending media are convinced that Silber was "wounded" by the  attributes that helped him win. The media probably are unaware that they are  making an ideological pronouncement when they describe Silber's (and, it seems  the voters') ideas as "intemperate." The public likes much of what he says and,  even more, likes a candidate who says things that cause queasiness among the  blandness-enforcers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Former members of the Free Papua Organization [OPM]  based in several cities in Papua New Guinea have established a  new organization called the Irian Jaya Development Operation.  Speaking in Jayapura today, (Joseph Tandu), chief of the  Information Service of the Indonesian Embassy in Port Moresby,  said leaders of the new organization had recently invited former  OPM members still living in the jungle to join the movement.  The call to join the movement was made because OPM's earlier  armed struggle and guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian  authorities along the Irian Jaya-PNG border had proved to be  unsuccessful.    Using the new organization based in Port Moresby, OPM  leaders  are now trying to persuade former members who are still living  in the jungle as well as those who have become PNG citizens to  assist the Irian Jaya regional administration in carrying out  development programs. However, (Joseph Tandu) admitted that the  new organization has no clear objectives and the Indonesian  Embassy in Port Moresby is uncertain as to what activities the  new organization has done and will do in the future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- An amendment to the  Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) was adopted today at a meeting of the Second  Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee.    The guiding principle governing the amendment of the CPPCC  Constitution is to highlight the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, basic policies for China's current  primary stage of socialism, and the multi-party cooperation and  political consultation system under the leadership of the  Communist Party of China (CPC).    The amended constitution contains some important additions,  which include: "the Constitution (of China) stipulates: the  multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under  the CPC leadership will exist and develop for a long time to  come" and "the CPPCC is an important body for multi-party  cooperation and political consultation under the CPC leadership."    The second addition above has been incorporated into an  amendment to China's Constitution adopted by the National  People's Congress last year.    The amended CPPCC Constitution also provides for major  duties  and functions of CPPCC organizations, as well as the forms and  procedures of political consultation and supervision.    The amendment says that the CPPCC's main functions are to  engage in political consultation and exercise democratic  supervision, and organize participating parties, people's  organizations and persons of various nationalities and from all  walks of life to participate in running and discussing state  affairs.    Political consultation means holding consultations on state  and local policies and principles, as well as on major issues in  political, economic, cultural and social life, before relevant  policy decisions are made and in the course of implementing such  decisions.    In line with proposals by the CPC, the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress, governments, democratic parties  and people's organizations, the CPPCC National Committee and  local committees may hold meetings for such consultations to be  attended by leaders of various parties and people's  organizations, as well as people from all nationalities and  social sectors.    Democratic supervision means the exercise of supervision, by  making proposals and criticisms, over the implementation of  China's Constitution, laws, regulations, and major policies and  principles, as well as the work of government departments and  workers.    The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the  rights  and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members.    It notes that CPPCC participating units and individuals have  the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and  disciplines, and may, through proposals and other forms, make  proposals to and criticisms of government departments and other  relevant organizations.    Added to the amended CPPCC Constitution is also the phrase  "Hong Kong and Macao compatriots should be encouraged to  contribute to the maintenance of prosperity and stability in  Hong Kong and Macao" and to the development and reunification of  the motherland.    The amended CPPCC Constitution comes into force as of today.</p>

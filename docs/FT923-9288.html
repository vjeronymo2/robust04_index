			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Prima seeks two-month debt moratorium PRIMA Inmobilaria, the big Spanish property developer controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), yesterday asked more than 60 creditor banks for a two-month moratorium on repayment of bank debt estimated to be worth almost Dollars 500m. The banks, called to a meeting in Madrid by the KIO, which controls more than 30 per cent of Prima, are due to respond today. More than half the bank debt is guaranteed against properties owned by Prima. This makes it unlikely that the group will file for protection from its creditors as the big KIO-controlled chemicals group, Ercros, did last month when the Kuwaiti agency refused to continue funding it. The meeting nonetheless increases the sense of crisis surrounding the large industrial empire built up in Spain by the KIO in the second half of the 1980s. It seems likely that banks unable to recoup loans from Ercros will baulk at helping Prima unless the KIO is able to offer them some form of assurance that their exposure in Ercros will be covered. The KIO has moved quickly to shake up its Spanish empire and to distance itself from the long-term investment strategy followed by former managers. By ordering new audits of its Spanish holding company, Torras, and valuing the assets at market value and not, as previously had been the case, at purchase price or inflated book values, the KIO claims to have uncovered financing shortfalls of up to Dollars 3bn in its Spanish investments. Spanish bankers have been irritated at what appears to be a decision to change the KIO's investment strategy in Spain from the long to the short term and the refusal of the Kuwaitis to meet obligations entered into by their predecessors. The new KIO management seems determined to distance itself from strategies followed by earlier KIO leaders and may slowly be gaining the upper hand by simply refusing to fund assets beyond the scope of their own participation in them. While many attractive Prima properties would go to banks if the company defaulted, the property market in Spain is weakening rapidly. Prima's difficulties are largely tied to the collapse of the Spanish and international property markets but the evident lack of enthusiasm in the the new KIO management to fund it through these problems has contributed to a sharp decline in its share price in the last two months. Its condition also affects holders of a Pounds 100m Eurobond launched by Torras in 1988. This bond is partly convertible into Prima stock, and is in technical default because of the receivership at Ercros. None of the bond holders has yet asked its trustees to declare a default but the collapse of Prima shares makes it highly unlikely it will be held for long. Contrary to earlier reports, the National Bank of Kuwait does not hold any of the bonds.</p>

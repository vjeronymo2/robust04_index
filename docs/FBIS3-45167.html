Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan's annual outbound  investment substantially outpaced inbound investment for the  first time in 1993, the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported  Thursday [13 January].    Statistics released by the ministry's investment commission  show that outward investment totaled U.S.$1.66 billion last  year, up a whopping 87 percent from 1992, while approved foreign  and overseas Chinese investment shrank 17 percent to U.S.$1.21  billion, resulting in a U.S.$450 million investment deficit for  Taiwan.    The United States remained the top destination for Taiwan  investors, absorbing about U.S.$380 million last year, which is  nearly twice that of 1992.    Singapore, however, was on top of the growth among all  Taiwan  capital recipients. Taiwan manufacturers invested about U.S.$70  million in the Southeast Asia country last year, representing a  6.9- fold jump from more than U.S.$8 million in 1992. [figures  as received]    Vietnam also emerged as a top priority target of Taiwan  businessmen, with investments leaping from U.S.$20 million in  1992 to U.S.$150 million in 1993.    In term of industries, outbound investments in paper and  paper products, which rose 917 percent for 1992 to U.S.$1.12  billion last year, made the biggest growth.    Of the 19.3 inbound investments, investors from the  Philippines led the list of overseas Chinese with U.S.$50  million, followed by the United States and Hong Kong.    Japan was the largest foreign country with investments in  Taiwan. In 1993 investments in Taiwan totaled U.S.$271 million,  down 35 percent from 1992.    European investors ranked second with their investments  growing 27 percent to U.S.$258 million last year.</p>

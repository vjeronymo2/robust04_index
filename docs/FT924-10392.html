			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Jim Slater's share guide - An intriguing book from a former stock market guru EVERY private investor would like to know how to pick profitable shares. Americans lap up tomes with titles like How to Get Rich without Trying; in Britain, books on the subject are comparatively rare. So a book* by Jim Slater, one time stock market guru, is bound to intrigue any private investor with a good memory. The business media have a tendency to build up heroes who have the 'Midas touch'. In the 1980s, it was retailing stars like Sir Terence Conran and George Davies; back in the late 1960s, the heroes were financial wheeler-dealers like Slater. Many of these heroes fall from grace and such is the case with Slater. He was once a finance director of Leyland Motor and occasional newspaper share tipster. He later formed the conglomerate Slater Walker which went spectacularly bust in the mid-1970s. In the ensuing crisis, he became, in his own description, 'a minus millionaire'. So anyone who reads his book for profit is entitled to ask one question: if he is so smart, how come he made such a mess of things? And there is another angle. Readers might not recall that, back in the 1970s, Slater was prosecuted under section 54 of the Companies Act 1948, which prohibited companies from financing purchases of their own shares. After acquittal by Guildhall magistrates, the DTI appealed and Slater was eventually convicted on 15 charges, and fined Pounds 15 for each. The publicity for the book refers only to Slater Walker as the 'legendary financial conglomerate' and Slater himself skates over his history in the text. There are two references to Slater Walker, both anodyne. There is also one paragraph which begins 'I managed to anticipate the two bear markets of 1973-74 and 1987.' A few people might raise their eyebrows at the first claim. Slater has rebounded. By the late 1980s, he was once again being ranked among Britain's richest people. His views on investing must be worth consideration. And provided the reader regards the book with a cautious eye, there is plenty of useful material. Although Slater deals with turnround situations and shells, the main focus is on growth stocks. He cites 11 key criteria for selecting growth stocks which are worth repeating; a positive growth rate in earnings per share in at least four of the last five years a low price earnings ratio relative to the growth rate the chairman's statement must be optimistic strong liquidity, low borrowings and cash flow competitive advantage something new small market capitalisation high relative strength of the shares compared with the market a dividend yield a reasonable asset position management should have a significant shareholding One key ratio, Slater says, is to divide the price-earnings multiple by the estimated growth rate for the earnings per share. So if the p/e is 15, and the expected eps growth rate is 20 per cent, then the ratio is 0.75. Slater dubs this ratio the PEG (price earnings growth factor) and says you should look for shares where the PEG is not more than 0.75 and preferably under 0.66. He illustrates the criteria with examples and dissects a few balance sheets to help investors spot companies with debt, or cashflow, difficulties. In a recession, finding stocks with strong growth rates, healthy finances and low share prices, is a difficult proposition. It will require research. Even then, you could get it wrong. Referring to Body Shop Slater says that in July 1992, with the shares at 278p, the prospective PEG was 0.85, 'relatively attractive for a leading supergrowth share.' The shares are now 179p. So the book is not a surefire guide to riches, any more than buying shares in Slater Walker was. On the other hand, it is lucid, contains plenty of detailed analysis and general advice for those who want to invest in shares. And it fills a gap in the market. * The Zulu Principle: Making Extraordinary Profits from Ordinary Shares, published by Orion Books, Pounds 18.99.</p>

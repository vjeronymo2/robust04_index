			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Jilin Province, one of the country's major commodity grain  producers, has built an agricultural high-tech development zone  in a bid to boost its farm production.    The newly-built zone, located southeast of the provincial  capital city of Changchun, is an extension of the city's new and  high-tech industry development zone, covering an area of 1,200  hectares.    The province plans to turn the zone into an integrated  center  with agricultural high-tech development, experimentation,  production, processing and marketing.    According to a Changchun-based Agricultural University  professor, the zone will enjoy all the relevant preferential  policies formulated for the city's development zones and  university-run enterprises.    Future research and development of the new zone will focus  on  products including health food, fertilizers and veterinary  medicines, additives, chemicals for controlling plant growth,  and special foods.    Also included are breeding of high-quality strains of  vegetables, animals, flowers and trees, and planting of  high-yield crops.    A high-tech industry official said that the project has  already attracted many investors from Japan, the Republic of  Korea, Canada and the United States.    So far, the zone has set up a ginseng company funded jointly  by China and Canada, one biological product company financed by  a Hong Kong firm and one Sino-American pets company, which are  expected to go into operation soon.    Jilin, rich in agricultural resources, is one of the biggest  corn and ginseng producers in China, but the agricultural  economic returns used to be small because of a disproportionate  emphasis on grain output.    To drive the development of fine-hybrid and high-yielding  grain production, the province has established dozens of  experimental farm zones over the past few years.    It has also made great efforts to bring the role of its  institutions of higher learning into full play. Located in the  new zone, the Jilin Agricultural University has 72 teaching and  research sections, about one hundred laboratories and six  institutes specializing in modern farm technology.    Other institutions involved in the drive are the Jilin  Forestry Institute, Jilin Vegetable Research Institute and the  Jilin Aquatic Products Research Institute.</p>

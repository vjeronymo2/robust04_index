It  had been under the control of Zapata National Liberation Army  (EZLN) guerrillas since 1 January.    Chiapas Government Under Secretary Julio Cesar Cancino has  told television media that Altamirano is the only town in the  hands of the "criminals" (guerrillas). The official did not  provide details on the recovery of Ocosingo or the number of  Army and rebel casualties during more than 24 hours of fighting.    The authorities have only admitted the presence of EZLN  rebels in four municipal capitals (San Cristobal, Ocosingo, Las  Margaritas, and Altamirano). Meanwhile, media sources has  reported there was guerrilla presence in five other towns:  Chanal, Oxchuc, Huiztan, Cuxulja, and Rancho Nuevo. Cancino  said that the Mexican Army is protecting the highways leading to  Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, where "many rumors"  have been heard about the activities of EZLN members.    He stressed the possibility that the strife-torn situation  in  Chiapas as a result of the violent appearance of the EZLN will  end 4 January.</p>

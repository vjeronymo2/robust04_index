			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: China unable to keep pace with aviation demand - Airlines are having to beg, borrow or barter aircraft PASSENGERS on domestic flights in China may be surprised to discover they are boarding a Russian aircraft with a Russian cockpit and cabin crew. The reason: the Chinese simply do not have enough aircraft and crews of their own to meet the unprecedented growth in demand for seats. Indeed, from its decision to lease Russian-built Ilyushins and Tupolevs from the former Soviet republics to its recent announcement of purchases of a dozen Airbuses, with options for 13 more, the aviation business in China is booming. The country's annual increase in air traffic is estimated to be running at about 25 per cent this year - more than double the 12 per cent of the peak growth periods in the US in the 1960s. 'There has not been a single year since 1984 when growth in passenger traffic has not been over 20 per cent,' said a western business executive. 'Even in 1989, when there was a dip for six months (because of the Tiananmen Square crackdown), growth was still over 20 per cent.' With the dramatic increase in domestic air freight and passenger travel, provinces rushed to establish their own airlines, often at the expense of safety and flight efficiency. At last count, China had 25-30 airlines. But its safety record was spotty last year, with at least four publicly reported disasters that killed 276 people. On Tuesday this week two people on a China Eastern Airlines flight to Los Angeles were killed and more than 150 injured when heavy turbulence rocked the aircraft. The aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at a US Air Force base in Alaska. Under the terms of its deals with the Russians, China's state-owned airlines will lease 16 aircraft from the former Soviet republics. In an arrangement called a 'wet lease', the foreign carriers provide the aircraft, pilots, cabin crews, and ground service personnel. The aircraft involved are Ilyushin 86s and Tupolev 154s. The Russians are also selling or bartering Tupolev 154s. While the Chinese use them as a last resort - they use more fuel and are not as reliable - but they are much cheaper than western aircraft. Even China United Airlines, a civilian airline operated by the Chinese Air Force, has announced it will buy another Tupolev to add to its fleet of Tupolevs, Boeings, and Tridents. This is all part of a move by the Air Force to further convert more of its operations into more profitable civilian activities. As Chinese economic reforms spread, the country's airports and aviation infrastructure are unable to keep pace with demand. New airports are being built around the country and old ones are being expanded and modernised. The airline industry is undergoing a comprehensive restructuring. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which formerly acted as a kind of super-agency combining the policy-making roles of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the management of all Chinese airlines, is being dismantled. The CAAC will now operate more along the lines of western regulatory organisations. Airlines can now be categorised into three groups. The first comprises six large state-owned airlines: Air China, China Eastern, China Northern, China Southern, China Southwestern, and China Northwestern. These airlines are free to float bonds and shares, sign joint ventures, and create subsidiaries, but for new aircraft purchases they still need central government approval. The second group of airlines includes Xinjiang Air and Yunnan Air and a few more specialised airlines which CAAC headquarters controls directly. Despite provincial and local government pressure to be free of Beijing's directives, CAAC retains its authority over these airlines to allocate routes. The third includes all those owned by local governments and other shareholders. Shenzhen Airline, for example, is owned by AirChina, the People's Construction Bank, China Travel Service of Hong Kong, and the Shenzhen municipal government. To cope with growing passenger demand, western sources estimate that Chinese airlines will need to acquire 500 planes over the next decade, each with a capacity of more than 100 seats. So far, Boeing is the front runner in this market with about 100 Boeings in service, which is more than any other foreign aircraft flown in China. More are on order. McDonnell Douglas, which has a co-production arrangement with the Shanghai Aircraft Industrial Corporation that makes MD-82s, has produced 35 domestically and is negotiating to produce the newer MD-90. But in the newer, more market-oriented environment, McDonnell Douglas faces a hard time selling its aircraft. Chinese airlines have always tended to favour Boeings. But the boom in the country's air transportation business has also generated problems, especially those of safety,and CAAC has recently announced plans to crack down on the growth in the number of local airlines.</p>

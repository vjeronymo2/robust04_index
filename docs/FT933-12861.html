			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / MPs call for state aid to aerospace THE AEROSPACE industry could suffer 'irreversible damage' without more government support, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday. The Commons trade and industry committee said aerospace was falling victim to heavily subsidised competitors from other countries. Mr Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman, called on the government to multiply its aid to the sector five-fold to Pounds 100m. The report said the UK aerospace industry's sales grew 1.5 per cent a year between 1980 and 1991, less than half the rate of its main industrial rivals. France had overtaken the UK to occupy the number two position behind the US. Without extra government help, the committee said, 'there is the possibility of a gradual loss of market share as its technologies are surpassed by competitors and ageing products fail to be replaced.' It added: 'The damage would be done before it became obvious and would probably be irreversible.' The committee put forward 19 recommendations, including one that the Department of Trade and Industry conduct or commission a regular survey of the level of government support for the industry compared with the support given overseas. Other recommendations include: The DTI funding more prototype development. The government considering launching aid guarantees and defering payback to help companies which develop products without launch aid. The government and the aerospace industry compiling a national technology acquisition plan for both military and civilian needs. Parliament debating the Ministry of Defence's proposed purchase of a US military transport aircraft to replace the RAF Hercules. The report also called for a study of how to assist the conversion of defence resources to civil use. But Mr Cranley Onslow, a Tory member of the committee, said the government should not provide cash for companies to diversify. The Society of British Aerospace Manufacturers said the report's recommendations 'reflect the solid consensus operating within the industry'. The MoD and the DTI said they would be studying the report. The select committee and the society welcomed the DTI's decision to adopt a national strategic technology plan for aeronautics proposed by the DTI aviation committee. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

Khazan: "The Kuchma-Hrynyov Alliance--Biggest </F> Surprise of the Season"]    [Text] The super-bloc of this election campaign, the union  of ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Deputy Speaker  Volodymyr Hrynyov, was met with a certain degree of bewilderment  by the broad segment of quasi-political masses. But despite  being entirely unexpected, it was still immediately perceived as  being fairly strong and flexible. The impression remains,  however, that this compromise union is deficient, due to the  fact that ex-Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Lanovyy is not a  participant. Prior to this time, Lanovyy's views on methodology  for the conduct of market transformations coincided with those  of Volodymyr Hrynyov. Which cannot be said about Leonid Kuchma.  Nor has this strange factor gone unnoticed by observers and  delegates to the III Congress of New Ukraine, from which all  three individuals have sprung.    But Leonid Kuchma did not spend a long time in New Ukraine,  soon making his career as the head of government. While  Volodymyr Lanovyy left New Ukraine over disagreement with the  tactics of the antimarket--in Lanovyy's view--policy of Kuchma  following the II Congress. The New Ukraine leader, Volodymyr  Hrynyov, has evidently embarked upon a path seeking unifying  factors with Leonid Kuchma, not disjunctive ones.    V. Hrynyov's attempt once again to draw V. Lanovyy into the  ranks of New Ukraine at the III Congress 18 November were not  crowned with success. In his presentation to the congress,  Lanovyy expressed a sharply negative assessment of the  Kuchma-Hrynyov alliance. Perhaps not the least  important--although not the most important either--role in the  difficult relationship between Lanovyy and Kuchma was played by  the ugly situation that came about in January of this year, when  the Center for Market Reforms, headed by Lanovyy, presented to  Prime Minister Kuchma--still new in office at that time, a  program of market transformations. But Kuchma, enamored with the  idea of "management of the state sector," failed to attribute to  the program the significance it deserved. His apparatus (V.  Pynzenyk's name was also mentioned here) used scissors and glue  to fashion a motley collection of fragments of diverse--at times  mutually exclusive--economic programs, including the program of  the Center for Market Reforms, into which titanic labor had been  expended, according to Lanovyy. In the final analysis, the  eclectic nature of the policy of the Kuchma Cabinet (along with  pressure from the president's clan) led to his resignation. Not  joining the alliance, Volodymyr Lanovyy is establishing the  Union of Private Property Owners and Entrepreneurs, whose  congress will convene 24-25 December.    So what is this union of Kuchma and Hrynyov based on? It is  most likely based on a certain convergence of positions, for  which Kuchma had to make at least a small shift to the right,  and Hrynyov--to the left, which fixes the position of the  alliance on the left flank, but not far from center. From all  appearances, the prediction of farsighted politicians and  political experts, including the well-known V. Malinkovich, on  prospects for a left-centrist bloc is coming to fruition. We  know that political groups of appropriate orientation formed  prior to this time are beginning to gravitate towards it. The  election results will show whether or not it was worth the  trouble.</p>

The appraisal group consisted of experts from the State  Planning Commission, the state anti-flood headquarters and the  Ministry of Water Conservancy.    The first phase construction started in 1986; the second is  due to start this year and to be completed in 2000.    The Dongting Lake area, known as a natural granary, has been  extended to create a center for major farm products in central  China's Hunan Province.    The total farm production value of the area is over 50  billion yuan (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) annually, one third  of the Hunan Province total.    Dongting, one of the country's largest freshwater lakes, is  a  main channel and storage lake for floods from the Chang Jiang  River and other rivers in Hunan.    The project is aimed to strengthen anti-flood capacity of  the  area and promote local economic development.    After eight years of the first phase construction of the  project, the anti-flood capacity has been improved.    But because of long-time high water levels in the flood  season, floods have left heavy layers of mud in the lake which  have narrowed the flood channel and water areas of the lake.    The second phase construction will consist of seven  projects,  including consolidating and building the lake embankment higher,  clearing the flood channels, flood storage facilities, and  township anti-flood facilities and flood warning  telecommunications system, as well as work on prevention of  snail fever.    The second phase will cost nearly 6 billion yuan (about 700  million U.S. dollars).</p>

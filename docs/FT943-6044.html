			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Satellite lost after engine failure Japan's Science and Technology Agency (STA) lost its Y41.5bn (Pounds 270m) experimental satellite yesterday as engineers abandoned attempts to manoeuvre it into orbit following engine problems, Emiko Terazono reports from Tokyo. The loss of the satellite, launched to conduct tests on communication, has caused deep embarrassment among officials of the STA and the National Space Development Agency (Nasda). Its launch last Sunday marked Japan's first solo development of a two-ton class geo-stationary satellite and Japan had hoped to join the world's leading space powers with its success. Mr Masato Yamano, president of Nasda, apologised to the public yesterday for the failure. The programme had cost the government Y60bn, with the H-2 rocket, which launched the satellite, worth Y19bn.</p>

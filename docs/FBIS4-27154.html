			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ho Yong-pom] </F>   [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of  the National Unification Board, said on 27 May: It seems that,  if North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, it will adhere to the  so-called North Korean-style NCND [neither confirm nor deny]  policy regarding its possession of nuclear weapons and its  nuclear tests.    Deputy Prime Minsiter Yi said the above on 26 May in his  written answer to Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker Namgung  chin, member of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of  the National Assembly, who asked at the National Assembly that  day "If North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, which policy  would it choose, the Indian or the Pakistani-style?"    Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: "India openly confirms its  nuclear tests and possession of nuclear weapons, while Pakistan  does not." He then said: "I think North Korea will adhere to a  not- confirm and not-opening policy." He added: "This is  because North Korea still believes that it can use such a policy  as an advantageous card in talks with the United States, Japan,  and South Korea."</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's disappointing consumer credit figures are meat for the bears of the UK economy. Taken with lower mortgage lending by banks and building societies in January, the statistics point to consumer confidence falling away in the early weeks of the year. Belated appreciation of the extent of April's tax rises may be to blame, or simply renewed caution following unusually high borrowing in December. Either way, the figures are at odds with the strong retail sales recorded in January. It may be that seasonal adjustment over the Christmas and New Year periods made the sales data less reliable than usual. The December sales figure was, after all, perplexingly weak. Other evidence - such as yesterday's report from the Finance and Leasing Association - suggests that demand for big-ticket items such as cars is holding up well enough. February's retail sales figures, expected next week, may help clear up the confusion. On that basis the lowest level of consumer lending since August should not cause too much alarm just yet. The three-month rolling average remains healthy enough, in what can be a highly erratic series. Still, any further fall in the savings ratio - which will be necessary to sustain consumer spending when tax increases start to bite in earnest - should show up clearly in future consumer credit figures. If low borrowing in February establishes a downward trend, there will be reason to worry.</p>

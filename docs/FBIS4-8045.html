			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 10 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Party of  Serbia said this evening that "the bombing of the Serb positions  around Gorazde shows yet again that the international community,  whose position is almost always voiced by its most powerful  members, resorts to the worst possible course of action to reach  peace in the former Bosnia-Herzgovina."    The statement says that daily UN Protection Force reports  from the ground, as well as media reports, showed that the  fighting around Gorazde was provoked by the Muslim forces and  also that it was on a limited scale.    "In spite of this NATO, or rather those who irresponsibly  pull its strings, showed with this attack against the Serb  positions that they have war and not peace on their mind, and  that they are not impartial but support one side in the  conflict."    "The Democratic Party of Serbia regrets that the  international community, having betrayed the role of a mediator,  has through this action become a participant in the civil war in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina," the statement says.</p>

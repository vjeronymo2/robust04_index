			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Private prisons - rewards and reflections (2) Sir, Your editorial, 'Private prisons', was well balanced and full of good sense. The privatisation experiment has thrown up more questions than it answers. We need to know more and a moratorium during a period of reflection would be commendably reassuring. It is extraordinary that a government which has won itself a reputation for deafness rather than deftness (some have diagnosed arrogance) should push on blindly with more private prisons. Here we have in the making another half cocked and reckless adventure which has all the politically explosive potential of the poll tax, the erstwhile unseeing faith in the ERM and education reforms now abandoned. Why do they keep on doing it? Robert Sutherland Smith, 18 Widecombe Way, London N2 0HL</p>

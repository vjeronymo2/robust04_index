			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miguel Angel Rouco] </F>   [Excerpt] An IMF delegation which will handle the auditing  of fiscal accounts will arrive in our country tomorrow with the  goal of persuading the Argentine Government to substantially  reduce its levels of spending.    The delegation, headed by British economist Martin Hardy,  will almost entirely concentrate on persuading the economic  leadership to further reduce its spending in order to achieve an  increased fiscal surplus. The IMF delegates' goal is clear:  Argentina must reduce its spending by at least 10 percent of  the 1994 budget allocations. This is equivalent to about 1.5  percent of the GDP.    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has already said  unofficially that it is impossible, with the current  administrative structure, to further reduce spending.    The economy minister asked his team of assistants to be  extremely careful and convince the IMF auditors of the fact that  a budget cut similar to the one implemented in 1993 is not  viable now because the entire administrative structure would be  affected.    During a meeting with his closest officials, Cavallo  expressed a worrisome omen: "If we implement the IMF petitions,  we run the risk of throwing our entire efforts in the field of  collection, public sector reform, and state streamlining  overboard. We cannot reduce spending any further now. They  cannot expect us to cut back on retiree, Comprehensive Medical  Assistance Plan, and hospital funds." [passage omitted]</p>

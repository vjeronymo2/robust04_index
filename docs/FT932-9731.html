			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB challenges Liffe with Fibor contract THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the Frankfurt-based futures exchange, is preparing to mount a further challenge to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, with the launch of a short-term D-Mark interest rate contract. The exchanges already compete for market share in five-year (BOBL) and 10-year (bund) futures, while Liffe also trades a highly-successful Euro D-Mark contract, based on D-Mark Libor. The DTB yesterday discussed with senior German traders how best to structure such a contract, which is likely to be based on the Frankfurt interbank offered rate. Fibor is the domestic benchmark rate, which takes account of Bundesbank minimum reserve requirements, and is rarely looked at by international investors. A DTB official said it had not yet been decided whether to go ahead with the contract, and admitted efforts to promote Fibor were needed. Although there is currently a sharp focus on German interest rate movements, it is difficult to launch a futures contract without a strong cash market. The German money market received a boost in February, when the Bundesbank started offering new money market instruments called Bulis, but is still in the early stages of development. German institutions that currently use the Euro D-Mark contract would be likely to switch to the DTB since it is owned by German banks, and German institutions have tended to favour their domestic exchange when possible. A Fibor contract could be used for hedging Buli positions, and for spread-trading against the Euromark contract. If plans to link the DTB and the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, go ahead, this could encourage spread trading between Fibor and Pibor (the short-term French interest rate) futures. However, it is usually an uphill battle to win market share from an existing contract.</p>

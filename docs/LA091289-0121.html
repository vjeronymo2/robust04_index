			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL GROUP PULLING OUT OF COMPCARE DEAL  </P> <P> VHA Enterprises, a national alliance of 668 nonprofit hospitals, said Monday  that it will dissolve its joint venture with Comprehensive Care Corp. of Irvine  because it is dissatisfied with the firm's psychiatric and drug treatment  programs.  </P> <P> Business generated by the joint venture last year produced $2.3 million in  annual pre-tax earnings for CompCare, which received 70% of the joint venture's  profits, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> The joint venture was an important profit center for CompCare, a faltering  company that has seen its annual profits plummet from $17 million in 1985 to  $502,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31. CompCare recently agreed to be  bought by First Hospital Corp. in Norfolk, Va., for about $110 million.  </P> <P> Dissolution of the joint venture, called Behavioral Medical Care, would have an  "adverse impact" on CompCare if the hospitals choose not to renew their  contracts, according to proxy documents that CompCare filed Aug. 14.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dissolution Right Disputed  </P> <P> Comp Care and First Hospital officials could not be reached for comment. But  Robert E. Currie, attorney for CompCare, said: "It is the view of CompCare that  VHA had no right under the joint-venture agreement to dissolve the joint  venture."  </P> <P> Timothy R. Cappel, attorney for VHA Enterprises, said that existing contracts  between individual hospitals and Behavioral Medical Care will be honored until  their expiration dates but that "there will be no new contracts and no renewals  of existing contracts."  </P> <P> VHA Enterprises said Monday that it has already formed a substitute joint  venture with Parkside Medical Services, a subsidiary of Lutheran General  Hospital in Park Ridge, Ill.  </P> <P> Cappel said that CompCare had agreed to terminate its joint venture with VHA  but that First Hospital Corp. vetoed the plan.  </P> <P> In response, Cappel said, VHA Enterprises filed a $4-million lawsuit in July  against CompCare, its CareUnit subsidiary and First Hospital.  </P> <P> The suit argues that VHA has a legal right to dissolve the joint venture, begun  in 1983, because CompCare has allegedly failed to perform its "obligations and  responsibilities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ownership Clause  </P> <P> Also, VHA said, terms of the joint agreement allow the venture to be terminated  if one party changes ownership.  </P> <P> Cappel said talks to settle the suit fell apart last week when CompCare  countersued VHA. Among other complaints, CompCare has accused VHA of libel and  slander for circulating a letter to client hospitals of the joint venture that  criticized CompCare's treatment programs.  </P></p>

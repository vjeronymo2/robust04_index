			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps API achieve Pounds 2m midway turnround WITHOUT SEEING any real signs of upturn in the UK economy, API Group, the packaging concern, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.34m for the six months to March 28, compared with losses of Pounds 849,000 previously. Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since February, ascribed the turnround mainly to 'sustainable internal cost improvements' - saving about Pounds 800,000 this time - though the absence of exceptionals helped; last time there was a charge of Pounds 570,000. Last year a hostile bid from NMC, a rival packaging company, was parried, at a time when, according to Mr Dennis Holt, finance director, API was 'leaderless'. He was the only remaining executive director and had only been with the company four months. The defence against NMC had not left API weaker, claimed Mr Holt, though it had cost about Pounds 1m and 'had motivated changes'. Formerly chief executive of DRG, the paper and packaging group, until it succumbed to Pembridge Investments, Mr Woolley is rebuilding API's depleted management team. Mr Eric Holroyd, acting chief executive since last year, is to be replaced by Mr Mike Smith, chief executive of Jefferson Smurfit's print, packaging and converting side, at the beginning of June. Turnover in the six months was flat at Pounds 29.5m and Mr Woolley said he was now looking to expand annual sales to the Pounds 100m-Pounds 120m mark. Thanks to cost reductions - which in the period under review involved the loss of about 140 jobs and significant changes in working practices  - there was now plenty of available capacity to be exploited. 'The kit is up to date and the plant is running better - the building blocks are now in place,' Mr Woolley said. The group was financially well controlled, he added, and 'now it's the sales and marketing side that needs a boost'. For example, Slaters, the image enhancement company, was only exporting about 10 per cent of its output. Earnings worked through at 4.5p (losses 2.7p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.05p (2.75p), in line with the forecast in last year's defence. Net borrowings were Pounds 2.6m, giving gearing of about 10 per cent.</p>

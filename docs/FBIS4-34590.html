			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 20 Jun (EFE) -- The 2,800 inhabitants of  Easter Island, a Chilean possession in the Pacific Ocean located  3,600 km from the continent, are on strike as of 20 June  demanding the recovery of their land from the Chilean Government  and a senator and a deputy to represent them in Congress.    The afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA reported today that the  strike was called for by the Rapa Nui Elders Council and  conveyed in a letter addressed to island Governor Jacobo Hey.    The peaceful strike will continue until a direct dialogue is  held with the Chilean Government to solve a number of conflicts  affecting the island community, according to a note released by  the strikers.    Easter Island, in a tropical climate, lives on tourism  generated by the presence of 867 statues that represent gigantic  figures of up to 20 meters high called "moais," placed in  ceremonial temples called "ahu," which make this territory look  like an open-air archaeological museum.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Pitfalls in pursuit of quality standard Sir, Charles Batchelor points out the need to 'devise a means to allow 96 per cent of UK businesses which employ fewer than 20 people to share the benefits of higher quality standards'. Obviously not all companies have the ability or motivation to take the DIY route. Alternatively, they may be unwilling to pay the full cost of hiring a consultant. There is, however, another way that is beginning to gain recognition among smaller companies - the group workshop approach. A number of group workshops is currently in progress involving typically six to 10 companies drawn from diverse business areas. Not only is that considerably cheaper than hiring a consultant - in fact, less than Pounds 3,000, or less than half the cost - there is also a considerable advantage in group members sharing problems and generating better solutions. One of these groups has completed the workshop stage and we now have the first company to gain BS5750 in this manner.

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STABBED TEACHER'S PLAN TO GET TOUGH TOLD  </P> <P> The Olive Vista Junior High School teacher who was stabbed by one of her  students Monday had decided just weeks ago to "crack down" this semester on  students misbehaving in her English classes, colleagues said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Cynthia Edwards required high standards of work and behavior in her students,  history teacher Fay Denzler said.  </P> <P> Edwards is recovering from her wound at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission  Hills. Hospital officials would not allow her to be interviewed Tuesday.  </P> <P> "She was stricter and gave out more work than I think the students here were  used to," said Denzler, who has taught at the Sylmar school for 20 years.  "She'd told me about two or three weeks ago that she was going to start  reporting little incidents, instead of letting them go."  </P> <P> Edwards, 37, was writing a misconduct report on a boy shortly after lunch when  she was attacked from behind, school authorities said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Custody  </P> <P> The 15-year-old ninth-grader, whose name has been withheld because of his age,  was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is being held at Sylmar  Juvenile Hall, police said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, district officials said the school has been temporarily assigned an  extra police officer, in addition to the one already there. School board  President Roberta Weintraub, who represents the eastern San Fernando Valley,  said that schools in her area for months have been "desperate" for more school  police officers and aides.  </P> <P> "We just don't have the money," Weintraub said.  </P> <P> The district has 302 sworn police officers. Of these, 143 are assigned to  schools. They dress in plainclothes and carry firearms and Mace. All but 22 of  the district's 73 junior highs have a full-time officer assigned to campus.  </P> <P> Rob Pilloud, a social studies teacher who has a class next door, said he rushed  to Edwards' room after students called for help and found her slumped over a  table writing out the telephone numbers of her brother and sister to notify  them of her plight. Next to her was the misconduct slip that she had begun  filling out when she was attacked, he said.  </P> <P> "I asked her if she was all right and she said, 'No, I'm not,' " Pilloud said.  "That's when I saw the handle of the knife sticking out of her back."  </P> <P> Pilloud and others said Edwards is well-liked by students and colleagues,  despite her strict classroom discipline. A 20-year employee of the Los Angeles  Unified School District, Edwards started teaching at Olive Vista in September.  She had transferred there from Robert Louis Stevenson Junior High School in  East Los Angeles to be closer to her home in Palmdale, Principal Charles Welsh  said.  </P> <P> "Miss Edwards didn't put up with any foolishness," Welsh said. "When you walked  into her classroom, you knew who was in charge: Miss Edwards."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minor Offenses  </P> <P> Teachers at the school who know the boy arrested in the attack said he was a  happy-go-lucky, C student, who regularly got into trouble for minor offenses,  such as talking out of turn and not completing homework.  </P> <P> The boy had transferred to Olive Vista from San Fernando Junior High School in  May, 1987, because of behavior problems, Welsh said. He had been in Edwards'  class only since February.  </P> <P> "He was an attention-getter; somebody who wanted to be the life of the party,"  said Linda Ibach, who taught the boy last year in her remedial reading class.  "He has the most beautiful smile you can imagine."  </P> <P> Ibach said that although the boy was a discipline problem in class, he never  threatened anybody with violence. The boy's school counselor, Linda Brigs, said  he had been referred to her a few times for minor conduct problems, such as  talking back to teachers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Surprised'  </P> <P> "I was very surprised and shocked," Brigs said. "He is a very likable guy."  </P> <P> Teachers said in lunchroom interviews that they are not fearful of students at  the Olive View campus.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Michael Connelly and Elaine Woo contributed to this  article.  </P></p>

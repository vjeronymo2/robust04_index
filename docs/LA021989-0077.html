			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 9-YEAR PROJECT FOR TIMEPIECE WITH 1,728 PARTS, 33 FUNCTIONS;  </P> <P> SWISS FIRM TOOK LONG TIME TO BUILD WORLD'S MOST COMPLICATED WATCH  </P> <P> It takes five years for one of the 184 tiny wheels in a new Swiss watch to  complete a single revolution. Another wheel takes a century. Then after 400  years, a lever has to be moved so the watch's calendar won't skip a leap year  date.  </P> <P> It also is the first timepiece to calculate the date of Easter and features a  celestial chart showing the Milky Way and 2,800 Northern Hemisphere stars.  </P> <P> The 18-karat gold Calibre 89, which has a diameter of 3.4 inches and weighs 2.4  pounds, has two dials and 24 hands. Packed among its parts are 68 springs, 126  jewels and 332 screws.  </P> <P> Patek Philippe, the Geneva company that recently unveiled the Calibre 89 to  mark its 150th anniversary, says it hasn't any idea how much it can sell the  watch for, so it plans to auction it off April 9 in Geneva.  </P> <P> "We estimate that it will get between 5 million and 10 million Swiss francs  ($3.2 million and $6.4 million)," said Osvaldo Patrizzi, the watch expert at  Habsburg, Feldman auctioneers of Geneva.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1.2 Million Sale  </P> <P> To date, the highest price paid for a timepiece at an auction was $1.2 million  in 1984 for a clock from the mid-17th Century.  </P> <P> Patek officials say the company did not keep any accounting of how much Calibre  89 cost to make since it was not done for marketing purposes.  </P> <P> But Patek is not likely to be contested in its claim that the Calibre 89 is the  world's most complicated watch.  </P> <P> A team of watchmakers took more than five years to design its 1,728 parts and  four years more to assemble them.  </P> <P> "At some points, we were greatly worried that we would not succeed," said  Jean-Pierre Musy, the head of the firm's Complicated Pieces Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1927 Packard Watch  </P> <P> Calibre 89 has 33 functions. That is 19 more than the firm's Packard watch of  1927, which it bought back last year for $1.3 million.  </P> <P> Calibre 89's features include a daily display of the sunrise and sunset, chimes  that ring on the hour and half-hour, and "power reserve" indicators that show  when rewinding is needed. The mainspring can run for 30 hours.  </P> <P> But the makers' pride is the watch's "perpetual secular calendar."  </P> <P> It takes into account that a leap year is skipped at the turn of most centuries  by the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582. Only the century years that are  exactly divisible by 400, such as 2000 and 2400, have a Feb. 29.  </P> <P> To keep it "up to date," the complicated mechanism makes one wheel turn once  every five years, triggering a 20-tooth "century wheel" to move on by one  notch. A peg gives that wheel an extra push every 100 years, thus disengaging  the calendar mechanism on three out of four century years to skip the leap  year. A lever re-engages the mechanism after 400 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Cog  </P> <P> The date of Easter, which changes every year, is shown on the watch at midnight  of the preceding Dec. 31. Calculating the date for more than 30 years would  require additional mechanisms that would not fit into the watch. So a special  cog allowing the watch to display it must be replaced every 30 years.  </P> <P> Computers helped produce 1,600 blueprints for the watch.  </P> <P> "We could have managed without them," said designer Francois Devaut, who  conceded that he first thought the plan for Calibre 89 was a "utopian idea."  </P> <P> "But it would have taken us an additional four or five years."  </P> <P> Paul Buclin of the assembly team said synchronizing the various mechanisms was  the biggest challenge. It would take about two months to take the watch apart  and reassemble it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Match Quartz Watch  </P> <P> Its accuracy, within one minute a month, does not match a cheap quartz watch.  </P> <P> "But precision is not the most important thing," said Philippe Stern, the  company's managing director. "The tradition of watchmaking is."  </P> <P> Based in Geneva, where the craft dates to the late 16th Century, Patek Philippe  is the oldest family-owned watchmaker in the world. The Stern family bought the  company in 1932.  </P> <P> Stern said the company hopes to make three more Calibre 89s over the next four  years, including one for the its private collection of historic watches.  </P> <P> The first one will be auctioned April 9, along with 300 other precious Patek  Philippe watches, after an exhibition tour of Paris, Milan, New York, Los  Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.  </P></p>

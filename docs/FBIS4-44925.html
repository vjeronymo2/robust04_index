			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sa'id Sunbul] </F>   [Text] The ambassador of China, Yang Fuchang, leaves Cairo  at the end of this week to go to Beijing in order to participate  in the reception of President Husni Mubarak during his visit to  China before the latter part of this month.    The Chinese ambassador in Cairo speaks fluent Arabic, and  even speaks it with an Egyptian accent! He graduated from the  Department of Arabic in Cairo University's College of Liberal  Arts in the class of 1962.    The ambassador told me that his country was being  far-sighted  when it encouraged the Chinese to study Arabic, realizing the  importance of Egypt and the Arab world. This action took place  right after our deceased President Nasir had met with the  Chinese leader Chou En-lai at the Bandung Conference in 1954. In  that year, the two leaders, during this meeting, agreed to  establish cultural relations between the two countries, in spite  of the fact that they did not have political relations.    Shaykh Ahmad Hasan al-Baquri, now deceased, traveled to  Beijing in 1955 at the head of an Egyptian cultural delegation.  This was the first official delegation to visit China after its  revolution against, and overthrow of, the regime of Chiang  Kai-shek. During his stay in Beijing, Shaykh al-Baquri signed a  cultural agreement with the Chinese Government, according to  which the two nations agreed to an exchange of cultural  relations.    It was under the terms of this agreement that the Chinese  Government, in 1956, sent five young Chinese to Cairo to study  Arabic. Yang Fuchang, China's current ambassador [to Egypt], was  one of these five young men. After this group, other groups of  Chinese also came to Cairo to study Arabic, and this process  continued.    In the Chinese Embassy in Cairo there are about eight  Chinese  diplomats who read and speak Arabic. This ability of theirs  enables them to really see what the situation in Egypt is and  enables them to deal directly with the Egyptians instead of  using interpreters.    In spite of how important China is to us, our embassy in  Beijing stills deals with Chinese officials and others by means  of Chinese interpreters! I do not know why the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in Egypt does not draw upon the services of some  Egyptians who read and speak Chinese. In my opinion, this is  something that would help Egyptian diplomats to better perform  their job.    When I visited China in September of last year, I found out  that the government and large companies in both Japan and Korea,  during the last few years, had begun to send large numbers of  young people to China to study and learn Chinese in order to  make it easier for them to deal with China.    China is the future. But the problem of dealing with China  is  that we do not know the language. I imagine that, during his  visit to China, President Mubarak will give this matter in  particular some of his attention, with the result being that  there will be an increase in the number of groups of Egyptians  being sent to China to study Chinese.    Whoever speaks the language of a country can easily open the  closed doors of that country!</p>

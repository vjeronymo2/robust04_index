			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (9): Twin attractions of rural idyll and industrial heritage - Efforts to encourage tourism LIKE other parts of the old industrial north of England, Telford and Shropshire have realised that tourism is big business and that they have a number of assets which can be turned to good account to attract visitors. Telford itself could hardly be described as a tourist attraction. It is a modern town, which in its present form has been built by the Development Corporation. But some of the scenes of dereliction have been transformed by imaginative landscaping and other improvements, so visitors staying in business hotels such as the Holiday Inn or the Moat House will not find Telford unappealing. As well as the modern shopping area with sports grounds and an ice rink in the new centre, there are 450 acres of open countryside in the middle of the town. There is a miniature steam railway and lakeside amphitheatre, the award winning Chelsea garden and the Maxell Japanese Cherry garden. What Telford may lack in historical perspective is more than made good by nearby Ironbridge. The industrial revolution was born at nearby Coalbrookdale, where in 1709 the Quaker ironmaster Abraham Darby discovered the secret of smelting iron ore using coke, which was cheap and plentiful, instead of the more expensive charcoal - a discovery which opened the way to large-scale industrial production of iron. The presence of coal, iron ore and limestone turned east Shropshire into the centre of Britain's iron trade. It was at Coalbrookdale the first iron rails were made for railways, together with the first iron cylinders for steam engines and, of course, the world's first iron bridge in the appropriately named village of Ironbridge. Other industries sprang up alongside iron and coal, particularly pottery and porcelain at Coalport, before the region began to decline in the mid-19th century. The industrial past is commemorated by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum which has seven sites spread over six square miles of stunning scenery. These include Blists Hill, which is a reconstruction of a Victorian working community. At Coalbrookdale, the Great Warehouse contains the story of ironmaking, while the Rosehill House shows how the Darby family lived. Mr Richard Bifield, tourism officer at Wrekin District Council, estimates that in 1989 the area (Wrekin covers greater Telford and the towns around Ironbridge) had 800,000 visitors, compared with 250,000 ten years ago. These visitors spent around Pounds 20m, and more than half of that was spent by leisure tourists. The reason that the district council started to take tourism seriously, however, was that it provided jobs in an area of traditionally high unemployment. Although still a small employer compared to other more established areas, tourism now accounts for 1,400 jobs, or just under 2 per cent of the work force. Ten years ago the sector employed only 170 people. Like Bradford with its photography museum, Burton with its beer museum and Liverpool with the Albert Dock complex, Telford has used its industrial past to establish revenue producing assets, giving it a foothold in an important, growing industry. Of course, there is more to Shropshire than Telford. The county is largely rural, with rolling hills and vales, quiet, picturesque villages and hamlets, medieval castles, ancient churches and grand country houses. Shrewsbury is perhaps England's finest remaining Tudor town, while Ludlow has its Norman castle. There are other 'products' (as such sites are known in the tourism business) dotted around the county, including the renowned Severn Valley Steam Railway and the new Childhood and Costume Museum, both at Bridgnorth; the Midland Motor Museum at Weston Park; and the aerospace museum at Cosford. Charles Darwin, of theory of evolution fame, and Robert Clive - Clive of India - both sprang from Shropshire and their respective birth places are well noted. Although final figures have not yet been established, there were probably more than 1.5m visitors to Shropshire and its attractions in 1990, and they spent a total of Pounds 49m. Shropshire has the beginnings of modest tourism industry, which probably accounts for over 5,000 jobs or around 5-6 per cent of the workforce. The county and district authorities have been examining whether more could be done to encourage extra business. Together with the English Tourist Board and the Heart of England Tourist Board (which covers six counties in the middle of England), the county council and the six district councils have been engaged in a Tourism Development Action Plan. The TDAP, which cost Pounds 300,000 and is now coming to an end after three years, looked at ways of improving standards, at signposting and raising awareness of the county's heritage, at setting up information centres and in training and business advice. It also examined ways in which tourism might move forward. Two main areas were identified: more could be done to develop and widen business tourism and, in the leisure field, more overseas staying visitors could be attracted. Only around 7-8 per cent of visitors to Telford and Wrekin are from overseas. Unlike Chester, York or Stratford-upon-Avon, Shropshire is not on the 'circuit' for visiting Americans. Yet evidence of a rich past is as abundantly evident in Shrewsbury as it is in Chester. A strong promotion in the US might enable the county to tap this potential vein of business. In business tourism, while Telford gets many visitors for strictly business purposes, the idea should be get them to bring their wives and children and stay for weekends. Telford should also try and develop gatherings such as board meetings and conferences. It has the hotels, but should try and broaden their use. While occupancy rates in other main hotels are down to around 50 per cent in the current tourism climate, they were running at over 70 per cent a year ago. With the Gulf war over and people beginning to travel again, there is no reason why Telford and Shropshire should not gain a larger share of niche markets.</p>

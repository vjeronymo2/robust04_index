			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: GMB to press for jobs pledge Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, yesterday warned the Labour leadership that he would campaign for the party to adopt a detailed commitment to full employment by the next election. In two speeches at the Labour conference, Mr Edmonds insisted that the party should adopt a clear employment target and that it should be made public by next year's conference. He would not reveal the target he had in mind for reducing the jobless total, but claimed that the issue of full employment would be 'make-or-break' for the party. He told delegates: 'During the next year we need to mix some concrete in with the rhetoric, and we have to change our attractive slogan into a hard-edged policy with the strength and substance that people can depend on.' Mr Edmonds' comments came as the conference passed a series of composite resolutions committing Labour to full employment without specific targets. The vagueness of these resolutions helped to avoid an open split on the issue between the left and right wings of the party. In recent weeks, Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown have signalled that they want to move Labour away from old-style socialist policies and that they will not set targets for reducing unemployment. Close aides of Mr Brown made clear yesterday that Mr Edmonds would now have to take the battle over full employment to Labour's Economic Commission, which will formulate the party's industrial strategy. They were confident that only three or four members of the commission would support Mr Edmonds and that he would be heavily outnumbered in policy discussions. However, the GMB leader enjoys support from several MPs in the party including Mr Roger Berry, Mr Peter Hain and Ms Diane Abbott, who was yesterday elected to the national executive committee. Ms Abbott lost no time in outlining her commitment to placing employment at the heart of the party's strategy. 'What we need to do now is put in place the targets and put in place the programme,' she said.</p>

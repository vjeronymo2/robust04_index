She arrived here yesterday [15  February] to receive the doctor honoris causa degree of the St.  St. Cyril and Methodius University of Veliko Turnovo  (northcentral Bulgaria).    We considered the problem of former Yugoslavia sharing the  opinion that NATO's ultimatum is absolutely necessary because  the bloodshed there must be stopped and because it is high time  that the international community prove it can really do  something to save the civil population, Prof. Suessmuth told  reporters at the Sofia Airport before her departure.    Prof. Suessmuth and Dr. Zhelev discussed Bulgarian-German  relations. After the meeting President Zhelev told reporters  that Germany's economic presence in Bulgaria should be felt  stronger. Germany can do this using the potential of its large  companies, Dr. Zhelev said. Bulgaria's hope was expressed at  the meeting that Germany would show understanding for its wish  to conclude a debt settlement agreement with the London Club the  soonest possible.    Meeting yesterday, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov considered the  situation in ex-Yugoslavia and the possibilities of expanding  German investments in Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds The slow Chinese burn being applied by the Federal Reserve to the American economy is causing plenty of pain in the US Treasury bond market. Yields are now touching 7 per cent, almost 1.5 percentage points above their autumn lows. Some blame the gradualist quarter point interest rate rises inflicted by the Fed for drawing out the agony. Yet what has caused the retreat is perceptions of future short term interest rates. Forward markets imply that US rates will have doubled to around 6 per cent by the end of next year. If that happened, bond yields could not remain as low as 7 per cent. But then, it could be that it is expectations which have got out of kilter. The Fed may have good reasons for operating on the economy with a scalpel rather than a mallet. The surge in growth in the second half of last year came partly because consumers ran down savings. Unless those savings are replaced by rapidly rising incomes, that growth will be a one-off effect. The surge in housing construction and business investment may also end if growth starts to slow. Since the objective is to restrain growth to a sustainable rate, the Fed will also have an eye to the political risks of dumping the economy into recession in the run up to the next presidential election. Slow rises in interest rates may thus continue. They may even be enough. The bond market will remain sensitive to the inflation threat, but if growth moderates, those interest rate expectations look overdone.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 8 ACCUSED IN THEFT OF SHERIFF DEPT. GUNS;  </P> <P> CRIME: INVESTIGATORS SAY A CONVICTED BURGLAR WHO HAD WORKED AT A DEPARTMENT  TRAINING FACILITY BROKE INTO IT AND TOOK 42 WEAPONS. SOME WERE ALLEGEDLY SOLD  OR TRADED FOR DRUGS.  </P> <P> A convicted burglar who had worked off jail time at the Orange County Sheriff's  Department Training Facility in Orange broke into a shed and stole 42 handguns,  then sold or traded some of them for drugs, Sheriff's Department investigators  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Brian Lee Blomgren, 20, of Fullerton and seven other people have been arrested  in connection with the theft of the handguns, investigators said.  </P> <P> The gun thefts have prompted the Sheriff's Department to take a closer look at  how weapons are stored at the training facility and how the department itself  became a crime victim, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said.  </P> <P> "We thought (security) was pretty good," Gates said. "But the criminal mind can  figure out a way to get into almost anything."  </P> <P> The break-in occurred sometime around New Year's Day, officers said. On Jan. 3,  Blomgren and Bonnie Jean Clark, 21, of Fullerton were arrested on suspicion of  burglary at Clark's home in Fullerton, where 11 handguns were recovered,  investigators said.  </P> <P> Investigators also recovered an undisclosed amount of "rock" cocaine and  narcotics paraphernalia at the residence, according to court documents filed in  connection with the case.  </P> <P> Blomgren and Clark were being held in Orange County Jail on $25,000 bail each.  </P> <P> Two more stolen handguns were recovered and four people were arrested at the  Best Western Stardust Motel in Anaheim last Thursday. Charged with receiving  stolen property were Devin Michael Puckett, 22, of Anaheim, Bradley Dean  Denson, 26, of Fullerton, Gretchen Michelle Ales, 25, of Stanton and Richard  Joseph Johnson, 22, of Stanton. All four also were being held in Orange County  Jail.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department Sgt. James S. Lazzaro, who is heading the investigation,  said there was a "minor pursuit" before the capture of some of the suspects. He  did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Johnson was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting at  Lazzaro outside the motel. In addition, Johnson and Denson were charged with  auto theft -- for allegedly stealing a 1982 Mazda pickup found at the motel.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Nunn, who is handling the case against Puckett,  Denson, Ales and Johnson, would not elaborate on the charges, referring all  questions to the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> In a brief interview at the Orange County Jail, Denson said he knew nothing  about the stolen handguns and was simply "in the wrong place at the wrong  time."  </P> <P> "I was getting a ride home from a friend of mine," he said. "This is way out of  my line."  </P> <P> Ten more stolen handguns were recovered as a result of searches conducted in  Anaheim and Fullerton, Lazzaro said. Altogether, investigators have recovered  23 of the 42 stolen guns. The rest were allegedly sold or traded for drugs in  Orange, San Bernardino or Riverside counties, Sheriff's Department  investigators said.  </P> <P> Investigators provided a few details about the burglary at the training  facility after mention of the incident in Wednesday's Times. Lazzaro said the  handguns -- the majority of them standard-issue Smith and Wesson .38-caliber  revolvers -- were kept in a shed that was not protected by the alarm system  that guards the rest of the training facility.  </P> <P> The training facility, on West Katella Avenue near the Orange Freeway, is used  by several law-enforcement agencies for classroom work as well as target  practice at the facility's two firing ranges.  </P> <P> "This took place when no one was around," Lazzaro said.  </P> <P> Lazzaro would not say what led authorities to Blomgren and Clark. However, he  said that Blomgren had worked at the training facility during his sentence on a  prior conviction.  </P> <P> "They do anything from rake leaves to mow the lawns out there," Lazzaro said.  </P> <P> Blomgren recently finished serving a 180-day sentence for violating his  probation on a 1988 burglary conviction that involved computers stolen from  schools in Anaheim, where Blomgren had been a student. He was back on probation  at the time of the gun thefts.  </P> <P> Blomgren is also suspected of committing two other burglaries at the training  facility -- one in November and one in December -- during which power tools and  air compressors were stolen, Lazzaro said. A stolen air compressor was  recovered during the gun-theft investigation, he said.  </P> <P> Two other people also have been arrested as a result of the gun-theft  investigation. Daniel Drew, 35, of Anaheim, was arrested Jan. 5 on suspicion of  possessing drugs for sale and possessing explosive devices. Steven Adkins, 21,  of Westminster, was arrested Jan. 9 on warrants stemming from drug charges.  </P> <P> Investigators had received information that both Drew and Adkins knew something  about the stolen weapons, but no guns were recovered when they were arrested,  Lazzaro said.  </P> <P> Lazzaro said he did not know what kind of explosive devices Drew had, or what  he might have been planning to do with them.  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Frank contributed to this report.  </P></p>

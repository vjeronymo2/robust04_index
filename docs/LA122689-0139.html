			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HE WON'T LET HENDRIX MUSIC DIE  </P> <P> Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since  the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later  generations.  </P> <P> "It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted  to his music," Voss said recently. "We get the 14-year-olds and the  34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem to know who Jimi Hendrix was.  </P> <P> "There's sort of a gap there -- part of a generation apparently doesn't realize  what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed today."  </P> <P> Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the acid rocker who  used his teeth on the guitar strings in an unsettling, feedback-laden rendition  of the national anthem at the Woodstock music festival.  </P> <P> A former music journalist, Voss, 38, is founder of the Jimi Hendrix Information  Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum of the star's  memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter titled "Voodoo Child," a name  taken from a Hendrix hit.  </P> <P> He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the Seattle-born  Hendrix since the musician's drug-related death in Britain Sept. 18, 1970.  </P> <P> "As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20 hours a week on  Jimi Hendrix," said Voss.  </P></p>

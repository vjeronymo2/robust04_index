			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SAN FERNANDO'S CHARITY  </P> <P> Coach Steve Marden promised his San Fernando High baseball team that he  wouldn't raise his voice this season when a game was in progress.  </P> <P> Throw away the ball? Not a peep. Boot a grounder? Mouth zipped tight. Wild  pitch to the backstop? Marden's teeth gnash, but there are no screams.  </P> <P> "No yelling this year," he said. "Intensity in a game has to come from the  team, not the coach."  </P> <P> If San Fernando continues to play as it did in an 8-4 loss in a North Valley  League opener at home against Kennedy on Thursday, Marden is destined for  ulcers. The Tigers (3-1-1, 0-1 in league play) committed six errors in the  game, which was called after five innings because of darkness.  </P> <P> San Fernando scored two runs in the first off right-hander Cody Beaumaster  (2-0), who gave up four consecutive singles. Kennedy, however, blew the game  open with five runs in the fourth -- or perhaps San Fernando deserves the  credit, whichever is preferred.  </P> <P> With Kennedy trailing, 2-1, Palmer Drain roped a one-out triple to right-center  and scored on a wild pitch by Hector De La Cruz (1-1). Ben Guzman followed with  a bunt single.  </P> <P> Guzman was picked off first, but De La Cruz threw the ball away for an error.  Jack Moussa walked and was also caught off first by De La Cruz, but first  baseman Adrian Diaz threw the ball into left field.  </P> <P> With two out, James Bernas was safe on third baseman Richard Sanchez's throwing  error. Before the mess was sorted out -- Jason Rosen and Garret Anderson  contributed run-scoring singles -- Kennedy (4-0, 1-0) had a 6-2 lead.  </P> <P> Kennedy took advantage of further San Fernando charity in the fifth. Carlos  Rodriguez, who had just moved from right field to third, booted the first ball  hit to him, then threw it into the Kennedy dugout for a double error.  </P> <P> Beaumaster allowed eight hits, struck out five and walked three in five  innings.  </P> <P> Now, how would Marden address his players? With a dressing-down?  </P> <P> "I still won't yell," he said. "I'll just let them know we didn't deserve to  win."  </P></p>

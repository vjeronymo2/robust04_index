He noted that many of the  country's latest hardships were the result of the emulation of  the American monetarist model. "Reforming the Russian economy is  a prolonged process, which will take years," Mr. Soskovets said.    He said he doubted that the United States would provide any  substantial assistance for the development of the Russian  economy and that France was a more proximate and reliable  partner for Russia.    Mr. Soskovets said that Russia and France could co-operate  in  metallurgy and aerospace industry and hold consultations on the  price, investment and banking policies.    The French defence minister, for his part, assured the  Russian vice-premier that his country was prepared "to follow  the logic of partnership" and wished to see Russia "a leading  manufacturing power rather than a supplier of raw materials".</p>

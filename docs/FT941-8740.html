			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Labour police plans defeated An opposition attempt to end the home secretary's responsibility for policing in London was defeated in the Lords yesterday after the government unexpectedly resurrected plans for an advisory committee. Labour and Liberal Democrat peers argued during the committee stage of the police and magistrates courts bill for the establishment of a police authority in London similar to those which supervise the other 50 British forces. Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister of state, said the government would proceed instead with proposals published in a white paper last year for a committee of 12 Home Office appointees to advise the home secretary on London policing. A Labour amendment to establish an authority was defeated by 151 votes to 112. The government's main problems on the bill remain unresolved, however. Backbench Tory peers have twice forced Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, to retreat on plans to increase government control of police authorities. Conservative peers have now tabled a number of further amendments on the government's plans for performance targets for police forces and fixed-term contracts for senior officers. The government's proposals to reshape police authorities have been under consistent attack since they were announced a year ago. Yet ministers appeared genuinely unaware of the full strength or character of the opposition until days before the bill started its parliamentary passage in the Lords last month. Mr Howard has been on the defensive ever since. His first concession, aimed at concern about proposals to appoint independent members to police authorities, was to produce a procedure distancing ministers from the initial selection process. In the face of cross-party criticism in the Lords he then scrapped plans to let the home secretary appoint heads of authorities, and agreed to greater flexibility in authority size. But ministers had again miscalculated. There were still enough Tory rebels to maintain a risk of defeat when the bill returned to the Lords this week. Opponents are now making further demands. They want local authority councillors to retain a statutory majority on the new-style authorities, with the independent members co-opted by the authorities themselves rather than appointed by the home secretary. The government insists its proposals would enhance local control but senior police officers fear that, combined with provision in the bill for the home secretary to set national policing objectives, they would increase centralisation. Mr Howard might decide to use the government's Commons majority to try to implement his proposals. But this would not resolve what is in many ways the biggest difficulty. This bill and the criminal justice bill are the government's centrepieces of the parliamentary session, designed to demonstrate that it is getting to grips with law and order. To succeed, the programme needs the active co-operation of the police service and police authorities - as ministers must have been aware when they decided to abandon most of the more controversial recommendations of the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions. Imposing changes that have been vocally attacked by influential Conservative peers and several former home secretaries might damage morale to a degree that would outweigh the improved efficiency which, Mr Howard believes, would flow from his reforms. Mr Howard yesterday published proposals that will allow appeals against unduly lenient sentences in serious and complex fraud cases. The attorney-general will be given the power to refer such cases for reconsideration by the Court of Appeal under amendments to the criminal justice bill.</p>

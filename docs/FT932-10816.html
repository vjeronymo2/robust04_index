			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commission torn on merger policy SENIOR European Commission competition officials said yesterday they were still torn between changing the rules for examining large EC mergers in Brussels - and possibly upsetting member states - and leaving the current successful system unaltered. Speaking at a conference on competition policy organised by Club de Bruxelles and backed by the Financial Times, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said he would discuss the issue with national governments and competition authorities. If changes to the EC's 1990 merger rules were necessary, he said he would table proposals before the end of June. Anti-trust authorities in France, Germany and the UK are suspicious of the Commission's desire to lower thresholds above which it automatically examines mergers. Consultations with nearly 300 companies and industry associations have already revealed a majority in favour of expanding the Commission's powers. But Mr Philip Lowe, new head of the task force which investigates alleged competition abuse, told the same conference there were concerns such a move might damage good relations between Brussels and national authorities. 'He (Mr Van Miert) is quite aware we don't want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg,' he said. Energy threat, Page 5</p>

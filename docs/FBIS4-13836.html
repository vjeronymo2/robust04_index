			<p>BFN     [Text] In today's meeting of the Supreme National Security  Council, which was chaired by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and  was attended by all members and high ranking military  commanders, the latest developments relating to  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the tragedy of Gorazde were discussed.    The attacks and crimes of the Serbian forces were condemned  and it was announced that the UN Security Council and countries  that had given the aggressors a free hand by their indifference  shared the blame for this immense human tragedy.    It was stressed in the meeting that, in view of the lack of  seriousness shown by the United Nations and NATO regarding the  defense of regions which had been declared as safe havens in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, our country's Foreign Ministry should act  with even greater resolve towards strengthening the effective  cooperation between Islamic countries with a view to lifting the  arms embargo on Bosnia.    It was also decided that the government would set about  gathering extensive relief aid to help the defenseless people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In view of the guidance issued by the eminent leader  [Khamene'i], the constructive role that could be played by  peacekeeping forces from Islamic countries in Bosnia-Herzegovina  was also underlined.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 2 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Justice Minister  Fernando Vega announced today that he will not meet with the  members of the Human Rights Commission of the New York Bar  Association who are visiting Lima because, he said, "I don't  discuss anything about Peruvian sovereignty or jurisdiction with  foreigners."    A group of U.S. lawyers headed by New York Federal District  Judge Jack B. Weinstein arrived in Peru to study the Peruvian  judicial and penal system, especially aspects related to  antiterrorist legislation.    Vega said he had received no request for a meeting from the  U.S. lawyers, but had he done so he would "never" meet with them.    Vega told the media he knew the visitors had come to see  Peruvian prisons, and in this regard he added, "I will send them  pictures of the prisons."    The Human Rights Commission of the New York Bar Association  will meet with Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Lawyers  Association, with representatives of the Pro-Human Rights  Association, and with the Human Rights Commission of Congress.    Avendano said the U.S. lawyers had contacted him, and they  would meet in the Lima Lawyers Association headquarters on 5 May.    Avendano indicated that the visitors want to study the real  situation of the Peruvian criminal justice system.    A few months ago, after paying a visit to the country, a  delegation of jurists headed by U.S. lawyer Robert Goldman  criticized Peruvian criminal legislation in a report that was  rejected by government officials.</p>

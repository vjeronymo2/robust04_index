			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 4 (ATA) -- The National Association of  the Former Political Prisoners and the Persecuted Ones, the  Party of Balli Kombetar [National Front], the Albanian People's  League Party, the Albanian Union Democratic Movement, the  Ecological Party, and other parties consider the existence of  the Greek priest, Anastas Janullatos, at the head of the  Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church as completely  inappropriate and demand his expulsion.    The above political parties and associations support the  Committee for the Defence of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church  of Albania which has accused the Greek Government of  interference into the internal affairs of the Albanian state and  of the Albanian Autocephalous Church on the eve of Easter,  through Anastas Janullatos, who is considered by this committee  as "a foreign and illegal archbishop."    Statements in support of the Autocephalous character of the  Albanian Orthodox Church have been made during Easter also by  the Democratic Party and the Republican one.</p>

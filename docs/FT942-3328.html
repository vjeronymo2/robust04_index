			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Unigate The 6 per cent jump in Unigate's shares after yesterday's full-year results suggests the 7.5 per cent increase in the dividend came as a pleasant surprise. Dividend growth is accelerating after three years of flat payouts at the start of the decade. That might signal success for the restructuring undertaken by Mr Ross Buckland, the chief executive, at what had become an unfocused conglomerate. Look deeper, though, and doubts about long term growth remain. Moreover Unigate is hardly a cash cow. Free cash flow before acquisitions was not quite enough to cover the dividend. Admittedly, this reflects an abnormally high interest payment and a healthy increase in capital expenditure. It also underlines that Mr Buckland's success partly reflects his knack of selling peripheral businesses on high multiples, buying dairies on low multiples and rationalising them at some cost to increase throughput at existing plant. As long as margin pressure on dairy products continues - and there is no guarantee that looming changes to the milk marketing regime will bring relief - this is a sensible strategy. But it requires scope for shuffling group assets. Happily, Unigate still has a trump card in its stake in Nutricia of Holland which is worth around Pounds 200m but contributes less than Pounds 4m in dividends to group cash flow. Were the stake sold and the proceeds reinvested, both cash flow and earnings would be enhanced. That would secure a further dividend progression, but it would be a poor substitute for a real improvement in dairy market conditions.</p>

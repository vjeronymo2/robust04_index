			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE DEPT. AIDE TO LEAVE POST  </P> <P> Assistant Agriculture Secretary Ewen Wilson, one of the Agriculture  Department's top economics officers for four years, said Friday he will leave  government May 6 to seek private employment.  </P> <P> Wilson joined the department in 1985 as deputy assistant secretary for  economics and moved into his current post in 1987. In a letter to Agriculture  Secretary Clayton Yeutter, he said Friday, "The time has come to move on."  </P> <P> The decision means Yeutter will have few, if any, holdovers from the Reagan  era. President Bush has named new people for deputy secretary, undersecretary  for commodity programs and for four assistant posts. There are four other  sub-Cabinet posts; Wilson holds one of them.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication of who will be chosen to replace Wilson.  </P> <P> In an interview, he said that after four years at the department and with a  major transition occurring, "it seemed like the right time" to change jobs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  [C.C.] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] hosted a reception  for a delegation of the National Democratic Congress of Ghana  headed by its General Secretary Huudu Yahaya Monday evening.    Speaking at the reception, Politburo member and secretary of  the C.C., the WPK Kye Ung-tae said the WPK highly estimated the  leadership of Ghana in its strivings to expand and strengthen  the party on a broad mass foundation and for the national unity  of the Ghanaian people and stability of the country and  independent development of the national economy under the  correct leadership of respected His Excellency President Jerry  John Rawlings.    "We express full support to the position of the independent  external policy of the party and government of Ghana advocating  a new international political and economic order, adhering to  the idea and principle of the non- aligned movement and  developing South- South cooperation," he said.    Noting that the international situation now demands the  bonds of friendship and solidarity be further strengthened  between the two parties and two countries striving for national  independence and independent development of the country, he  expressed the belief that the delegation's current visit to  Korea would make a new contribution to the development of  friendly relations between the two countries.    Speaking next, General Secretary Huudu Yahaya said the  chuche  idea is a great idea expounding the position and role of man in  the world, and a new international economic order can be  established only on the basis of this idea.    Ghana always follows with deep interest the development of  the situation in Korea, and holds that the DPRK-USA relations  should be solved peacefully on an equal footing, he said.    He noted that they learn a lot of things from the great  leader President Kim Il-song, the most distinguished man in the  present time. The idea of the great leader who has devoted his  whole life for the people must be followed in many countries, he  stressed.</p>

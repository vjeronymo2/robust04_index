			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Switch in food retailing forecast HIGH STREET food retailing is set to make a comeback, according to a research report from stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson. The study suggests that the relative costs of running high street foodstores are again becoming favourable for the big grocery chains which have drifted to out-of-town sites. Changing trends in demographics and travel, the growing importance of offering frequently purchased fresh foods, and the current availability of cheap sites are all adding to the attractions of running high street stores, the report says. It adds, however, that so far Tesco is the only one of the biggest three chains to have developed a 'fully-articulated strategy to address new town centre opportunities'. Tesco's Covent Garden Metro store in London is seen as the flagship of a nascent high street chain to compete with Marks and Spencer's niche foods business. Your Food: Whose Choice? HMSO.

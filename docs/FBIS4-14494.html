			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>   [Text] Donetsk 31 March, TASS -- As it was expected, the  first round of elections in Ukraine did not bring even a half of  deputies to the new parliament. Only 49 out of 450 deputies  were elected, while the parliament can work if the number of its  members is no less than 226. The Central Election Committee  enacted that the second round must be held until 10 April, and  each election district must establish the date on its own.    The elections in Ukraine were held in the atmosphere of  unprecedented activity. More than 28 million citizens, that is  almost 75 per cent of all voters took part in the elections.    Residents of western Ukraine where the idea of national  independence has been forged for many years were most active.  The dream about breaking all ties with "imperial Russia" has  almost become a religious obsession. That is why almost all  leaders of many nationalist parties strive to run in that region.    The distribution of "colours" of the Ukrainian political  palette was manifested last Sunday. Only nine out of the 49  deputies represent various nationalist parties, 12 deputies --  the Ukrainian Communist Party, which was registered last  October, four deputies -- leftist parties-social and agrarian.  Among the so called "non-party deputies" elected on Sunday,  there are people, who are not independent politicians -- speaker  of the current parliament Ivan Plyushch, former prime minister  Leonid Kuchma, former vice-premiers Viktor Pinzenik and Igor  Yukhnovskiy.    Residents of eastern Ukraine definitely voted for "their own  colour." For example, in Donetsk and Lugansk regions, 11  deputies out of 14 will represent Ukrainian Communist Party.  Moreover, none out of 132 communists running for parliament  there dropped out. The positions of socialists and agrarians  are also very strong.    No doubt, local referendums and public-opinion polls held in  the Crimea and in Donbass contributed to political acuteness of  current election campaign. Despite firm pressure undertaken by  official Kiev, residents of these regions could openly express  their opinions on concrete and vital questions. The bulk of  Crimea's residents confirmed their strive for dual citizenship  and raised their voices against Kiev's dictate.    Almost 90 per cent of residents of Donetsk and Lugansk  regions did not only protected the right of Russian language to  exist here, but confirmed their will to see it fixed by the  Constitution as the second official language along with the  Ukrainian.    Nearly the same percentage of voters supported the immediate  joining of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the  necessity of participating in the CIS interparliament assembly.    Official Kiev will fail to play down the results of the  Crimean and Donbass' referendums and to rule them as illegal,  observers believe. Res dents of the "obstinate regions" who are  tired of prolonged and senseless struggle with the centre  expressed their will and deputies and regional authorities now  have to take it into account.</p>

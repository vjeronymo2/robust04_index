			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FILM PERMIT CHANGES  </P> <P> The Camarillo City Council will consider new guidelines today for motion  picture filming and farmers markets.  </P> <P> The changes to the city's zoning ordinance for film permits have been requested  to conform to state law, according to a California Film Commission official.  </P> <P> "The law attempts to standardize filming permits in California and cut through  bureaucratic red tape," Michael Walbrecht said.  </P> <P> Cities are asked to adopt a process for granting film permits or tell the  California Film Commission why they do not want such a permit process. Only a  few requests a year are received by Camarillo for filming permits.  </P> <P> "What the state is mandating, we've been doing all along," said Tony Boden,  director of planning and community development.  </P> <P> In addition, the council will consider permits for farmers markets.  </P> <P> Only growers who have been certified by the county's agricultural commissioner  will be allowed to participate in the market.

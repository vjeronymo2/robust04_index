			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (5): Plans put into action - The Olympic Effect / Economic and strategic projects that were drawn up for the year 2000 at the time of the Games remain the driving force behind continued optimism WHEN in 1981 Barcelona city hall decided to enter the bidding to host the Olympic Games, it was already looking for a way to realise its pent-up ambitions. Extensive urban plans dating back to 1978 for the regeneration of the city were designed to correct the neglect it had suffered during the Franco regime, when its suburbs grew and the centre became steadily more congested. The success of its Olympic bid gave Barcelona a chance to make up that deficit. 'In the five years before the Games,' said Lluis Armet, the deputy mayor, 'public investment was the same as in the previous 30 or 40.' Putting these plans into action not only took money, but also relied heavily on the enthusiasm of the residents who had to live through the a period when large parts of the city were turned into building sites, or obras, until it became a popular joke that the city be renamed 'Bacelobra'. The city hall made no secret of the fact that it saw the Games chiefly as a means to an end. When earlier this year, it came to shouldering the deficit of Holsa, the publicly-owned Olympic holding company, the central government was not at first happy about forking out more cash. According to Manuel Ludevid, head of economic promotion at the city hall, this was partly because the hall had been responsible for its management and because, he said, Madrid 'suspected, partly correctly, that some projects which were not directly-related to the Games were passed through it'. It was finally agreed that the deficit be shared. What was directly-related to the Games was not easy to define. Only 9.4 per cent of the recorded total figure of Pta 926,439m was spent on sports facilities, for example; the rest on improvements in the transport system, new hotels, telecommunications, the transformation of whole districts, such as Vall d'Hebron and the Olympic Village, and the liberating of land for building. Spain's oldest railway, which ran along the coast and cut the city off from the sea, was ripped up, for example, opening up the previously blighted area for development, and prompting the overhaul of the city's inadequate drainage system. But not included in this total are all the other privately-funded projects stimulated by this wave of urban renewal and upgrading of services. These projects, such as the massive development of the coastal end of Diagonal, the avenue which extends the whole way across the city, will at a slower rate have as significant an impact as in the six years before the Games. One legacy which the city has learnt to build on is the successful co-operation between the private and public sectors. 'The Japanese example is quite clear,' said Mr Ludevid, 'the Miti (ministry of trade and industry) has been doing this for years, and it has had fantastic results.' While the Olympic spirit of co-operation was still at full tilt, an economic and strategic plan for the year 2000 was drawn up by 560 Catalan experts from the government, the unions and business. This is one of the most important factors behind the continued optimism, in spite of the harsh economic climate.</p>

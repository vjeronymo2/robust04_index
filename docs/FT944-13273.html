			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Council finance rules to be eased The government is to relax rules governing the handling of local authority capital assets in a move that may foreshadow further steps to loosen Whitehall's grip on local government finances. Ministers are expected to act soon to change regulations dictating the proportion of newly acquired capital assets which local authorities must use to redeem outstanding debts. They may also relax restrictions on the maximum term over which councils are permitted to take out leases. The likely move follows consultations between the government and local authorities on perceived obstacles to partnerships with the private sector. It will be part of the private finance initiative, designed to mobilise the private sector to meet needs traditionally met by the public services. Under the proposals authorities contributing capital assets such as land to joint ventures with private companies would no longer be required at the outset to redeem debt equivalent to 50 per cent of the value of the assets. In addition, a rule requiring councils to set aside 75 per cent of what they receive on selling the assets in question would be relaxed, with a new 50 per cent level possibly applying. Some ministers are known to favour a further loosening of central government controls over local authorities.</p>

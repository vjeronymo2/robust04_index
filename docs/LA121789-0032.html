			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESKY FURLOUGH PROVES JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND  </P> <P> I picked up (the Nov. 16) Times and, smirking back at me is a picture of Ivan  Boesky as he appeared on his most recent furlough from federal prison. It's  difficult to say whether my dominant emotion at that moment was embarrassment  or disgust.  </P> <P> What are we doing furloughing Ivan Boesky -- or any other criminal?  </P> <P> This man is in prison, for crying out loud! For felonies. Essentially, he stole  from people. And our response is, "Hey, Ivan, take a week off. Go home. Visit  the family. You're cool, guy."  </P> <P> BILL BEDSWORTH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Weir Group - Other Companies Interim figures are due on Thursday, with pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 18m-Pounds 19m, up from Pounds 16.7m, which included a Pounds 2.43m exceptional item for redundancy and reorganisation costs. This would put the Glasgow- based pumps and engineering products group on course to fulfil City estimates of Pounds 40m-Pounds 43m for the full year, compared with Pounds 37.5m in 1993. The company has already said the timing of large contract completions would weight profits towards the second half.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Monday Interview: Tony O'Reilly's independent standpoint  -The boss of H. J. Heinz tells of his plans to break into British media Dr Tony O'Reilly, head of H. J. Heinz, the international food giant, has a mission statement on his desk these days which has nothing to do with the importance of brands or the future of the Irish rugby team, subjects he cares deeply about. His favourite mission statement at the moment is the one produced by advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for the founding of The Independent newspaper promising that it 'should be independent from all groups'. As he plans his counterattack to the proposition likely to be unveiled this week, that could make Mirror Group Newspapers a 40 per cent shareholder in Newspaper Publishing, the loss-making publishers of The Independent, O'Reilly is placing considerable emphasis on independence. Selling newspapers is all about perceptions, the former Ireland rugby international says, and a newspaper sold as independent has to be seen to be so. 'I have no doubt the only way to have a future (for the Independent), the only reason for its being depends on it being even more independent,' says O'Reilly. What will readers think, he asks, if 'suddenly 40 per cent is now owned by a fairly lurid left-wing paper' although he concedes some say the Daily Mirror may not now be as left-wing as it once was. O'Reilly has already made an indicative offer of about Pounds 30m for up to 29.9 per cent of the group. A more formal proposal could be tabled for a Newspaper Publishing board meeting on Thursday. That bid is the latest of O'Reilly's attempts to win a slice of the British national newspaper market. This week will be crucial in determining whether he wins a seat at the top table of British newspaper publishing, to sit alongside the international media magnates such as Conrad Black and Ruper Murdoch whom he regards as his peers. O'Reilly was fascinated by the launch of The Independent in 1986. 'The Independent represented a breaking of the mould in British journalism. In presentation and style it provided something new. Not breathtakingly new but an interesting niche approach to a vibrant market. This was an interesting brand and one I was personally excited by,' he says. Now he is determined to take a stake in the newspaper he much admired and play a part 'in the slow process by which the fortunes of the paper are mended'. He says is not looking 'for something that is going to be a quick buck'. For years O'Reilly has wanted to expand his newspaper interests from his original base in Ireland and in particular into the UK national press. International ambitions Whenever there is talk of a national UK newspaper being for sale, O'Reilly's name always comes up. He failed in an attempt to buy MGN when a majority stake of the group was held by administrators. His international ambitions suffered a setback when he lost out to Conrad Black in the battle for John Fairfax newspapers in Australia. 'We haven't so much been banging on the door (of UK national newspapers) as banging on the side door,' says O'Reilly. He is well known to be one of the most highly paid executives in the world as chief executive of Heinz. He began his rise to the top when, in his own words, he 'redefined what agricultural marketing was all about' by launching the Kerrygold campaign for Irish butter when he was 26. His background in food does not mean he is without serious newspaper credentials. With the help of a management team led by Mr Liam Healey, O'Reilly expanded from his Dublin base to encompass commercial radio in California, Australian Provincial Newspapers in Queensland (controlled by O'Reilly family interests), an outdoor advertising business, half of the cable television business in Ireland and a joint venture with United Newspapers which produces a hybrid of the Daily Star for the Irish market - an edition that sells 90,000 a day. O'Reilly's template for the future of The Independent would involve a spread of minority shareholders to ensure independence. They would then buy all the services they needed, such as printing, on the open market. The would-be shareholder in Newspaper Publishing is not without allies. He has been approached by another potential investor in the company, a newspaper group which he declines to name but whose credentials, he says, are impeccable. 'We have not got another shareholder lined up but we have had an approach,' says O'Reilly, and suggests that the potential shareholder could be on board by Newspaper Publishing's Thursday board meeting - the first to consider the various bids and proposals on offer. He clearly envisages a continuing role for Andreas Whittam Smith, principal founder of The Independent. It would probably not be as central as that being suggested by the consortium Whittam Smith is putting together with MGN. Under this proposal, existing shareholders El Pais and La Repubblica would hold 51 per cent with the founders holding nearly 10 per cent. Whittam Smith would remain editor-in-chief, one of seven directors and possibly even chairman. 'The reality (on Whittam Smith) is that almost like De Gaulle - L'Etat, C'est Moi,' says O'Reilly. However, it is thought that he has identified a candidate who would be brought in to edit The Independent on a day-to-day basis. Clear vision His aim is to have shareholders at Newspaper Publishing with cash, experience and a clear vision of what The Independent is about. He does not believe he can be shut out. Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, has made it clear that he wants to see at least one alternative to the Whittam Smith consortium on the table on Thursday. The Heinz bos says he would be flexible in his approach to the future of Newspaper Publishing and would be prepared to work not only with the founders but also shareholders such as El Pais and La Repubblica. He says that playing rugby for Ireland taught him how to cope with losing. But that is not something he is prepared to do now. 'Although we will not make a solus offer for the entire company, we are very very determined,' he explains. This is a battle he has no intention of losing.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: American Airlines recovers from strike American Airlines yesterday said it was encouraged by its recovery from a five-day strike by flight attendants, which ended on Monday after the unexpected intervention of President Bill Clinton. The airline said it would return to a full schedule of flights by Thursday - Thanksgiving Day. The announcement eased concern over the possibility of widespread disruption of the country's air transport system during the busy holiday period. However, industry observers say the walk-out, which appeared to have been much more successful than American had anticipated, will have an immediate financial impact on AMR, the airline's parent, and could complicate its efforts to reduce its cost structure in the longer term. In New York, the stock fell sharply after two Wall Street securities houses  -Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns - downgraded their ratings. At the close, AMR was Dollars 3 lower at Dollars 65 1/8 in heavy trading. As part of a back-to-work deal brokered by the White House, the airline agreed to re-open bargaining with 21,000 members of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants and submit to a final contract ruling by a federal arbitrator. American yesterday said contract negotiations would begin in about six weeks. Mr Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, the New York investment house, estimated the strike cost American up to Dollars 140m, which he described as 'the saturation point' for the airline.</p>

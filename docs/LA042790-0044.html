			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: CARRICO'S 'TWO MEN OUT' HITS HOME AT THEATRE EXCHANGE  </P> <P> You expect first plays to err on the side of personal indulgence, especially  when the subject matter involves booze and the family. But you seldom see a  playwright's maiden effort sliced into the vigorous shape of Tom Carrico's "Two  Men Out, Runner on Third" at Theatre Exchange.  </P> <P> This four-character drama, in which a grieving father and one of his two sons  drink themselves into an ugly stupor over a two-day drunk, is an uncompromising  X-ray of a self-destructive family in which booze pours like water from the  family well.  </P> <P> The title signals the dilemma: The old man and one son have already been tagged  out but there's a runner on third, the younger baseball-playing son, who's  fighting to break away with his identity intact. The result is a strong first  play by Carrico, notable for the force of its dialogue and a sculptured  dramatic structure that avoids melodrama.  </P> <P> The catalyst for the gathering storm is the death of the mother, whom we never  see but whose presence as the long-suffering spouse hovers over this warring  household. There are glimmers of Arthur Miller in the festering father-son  relationships.  </P> <P> Director Neal Weaver expertly guides his players through their beer-and-Jim  Beam-drenched odyssey. In the early part of the mother's wake, you hardly  notice the presence of alcohol in the family living room (a perfectly modest,  tacky abode designed by Michael Larkins). Nobody's falling down drunk, but then  -- with a start -- you catch the understated image of the father's pants, which  have become wet with urine. Characters don't ruminate about the bottle.  Drinking is a given.  </P> <P> As the father, Jim Kier deftly portrays a confused, possessive dad trying to  hang on to his last son by ridiculing the boy's dreams of being a ballplayer.  That youth, the hope of the play and seemingly the playwright's alter ego, is  rendered with a fervent, lyrical touch by Bill Conroy. As the other son, an  alcoholic lawyer, Tom Willet imperceptibly segues from sobriety to oblivion,  passing out in a trash bin. A minor character, a baseball scout played by  William Barker, jauntily enlivens the action.  </P> <P>  At 11855 Hart St., North Hollywood; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.;  Sundays, 3 p.m.; through May 12. $10. (213) 876-2236.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Vietnam-Era Drama of 'The Watering Place'  </P> <P> The home as a battlefield is also the dark subject of "The Watering Place" at  the Powerhouse, a production notable for vivid direction by Dallas Vogeler and  a scabrous, pugnacious performance by George Murdock, who has a roaring time  telling a Vietnam vet that "war isn't war unless you're killing Krauts."  </P> <P> This early Vietnam-era play, which dramatizes a soldier's visit to his dead  buddy's neurotic family, opened and closed after one performance on Broadway in  1969. Though writer Lyle ("Orphans") Kessler has revised and cut it, it's  watchable primarily because of a strong cast.  </P> <P> The theme that war is bred in the home seems pretentious, and there's no  character to root for. Bobbi Holtzman's demented mother, Chris DeMartino's  self-serving Vietnam vet and Shannon Lee Avnsoe's sexually accommodating,  widowed sister-in-law are too insular to reflect any condition of 1960s  America, let alone Vietnam.  </P> <P> There's something macabre about the production, however, as if Harold Pinter  were paying a visit to "The Addams Family." Murdock has a field day, and  production values, notably Patty Klawonn's domestic set design, are first-rate.  </P> <P>  At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica; Thursdays through Saturdays; 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7  p.m.; through May 27. $12-$14. (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Gathering of U.S. Expatriates in 'Hotel'  </P> <P> The 60th anniversary production of Philip Barry's seldom-staged "lost  generation" play, "Hotel Universe," is a fragile, beguiling experience at the  Shepard Theatre Complex.  </P> <P> Barry's drama of expatriate Americans gathered at a villa in the South of  France was based on his friendship with Gerald and Sarah Murphy and their  glittering life at Cap d'Antibes in the 1920s (the same setting that inspired  F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is the Night"). So it is an unusual pleasure to  run into a production that dares tackle this bubble of a world on its own  terms.  </P> <P> Freud was big in 1930, when the play opened on Broadway, and Barry dappled his  eight characters, their post-World War faiths shaken, in psychological and even  metaphysical analysis as they glide in angst about the starry terrace (a classy  design by David G. Monroe).  </P> <P> Director J. P. Duffy has a keen ear and eye for the work's delicate tone and  most of the actors, coiffed and costumed in Flapper detail, capture the  requisite soul-searching without hamming it up. Plays about the jaded rich are  hard to do today. Especially convincing are Jo Ann Nelson, Paul Carter, M. J.  Clemens, Addy Allison and Kilroy.  </P> <P>  At 6474 Santa Monica Blvd.; Friday, Saturday, 8 p.m.; closes Sunday, 8 p.m.  $15. (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drama of Graffiti Artist in CalArts 'Fall'  </P> <P> Years ago, productions from the CalArts theater department would make periodic  sorties to Los Angeles, and it was always interesting to see what that campus  was theatrically up to. Now we have CalArts once removed in "Fall" at the  Matrix, an agonizing drama of an L.A. graffiti artist, with all the key  creative hands recent CalArts graduates.  </P> <P> The group, playwright Geoffrey Thorne, director Douglas Rushkoff, star Morgan  Rusler, and set designer Alexandra Rubinstein, captures an L.A. artistic  subculture rife with raw energy and frayed nerves.  </P> <P> The downside is the overripe tone, the loose shape, the strident drunken  bellowings of the artist-in-crisis (Rusler), and the failure of the otherwise  gritty production, set in a dim loft, to marshal the relationships and the  plot's lovesick angle into an artful structure. But there's a definable world  presented here, and the promise of this group is palpable.  </P> <P>  At 7657 Melrose Ave.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m.;  through May 26. $15. (213) 852-1445.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Eros at Twilight' at Burbage Theatre  </P> <P> The numbing babble of gab in Jaime Meyer's fanciful comedy "Eros at Twilight,"  at the Burbage Theatre Ensemble, is a grueling ordeal.  </P> <P> Meyer's idea about a man and woman (John Achorn and Melissa Converse) living in  an abandoned lighthouse and searching for their Muses isn't bad. And a couple  of supporting turns are flavorful (Burke Byrnes' Sterling Hayden-like  adventurer and Susan Rome's waitress-turned-mermaid). But the ramshackle  production, the repetitious talk, director Gary Guidinger's lack of buoyancy  and frantic, inane pacing are distracting to the point of oblivion.  </P> <P> Aside from all this, the Burbage might consider a scrub down. It's one of the  drearier theaters in town.  </P> <P>  At 2330 Sawtelle Blvd.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30  p.m.; through June 10. $12-$14. (213) 478-0897.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Post-Apocalyptic 'Strange Voyage'  </P> <P> Another exhausting play in another dreary venue, the Century City Playhouse, is  the Burbage Theatre Ensemble's Bare Bones production of a post-apocalyptic  tragicomedy in two unrelenting acts called "Strange Voyage."  </P> <P> Playwright Nitza Henig's painful variation on "Waiting for Godot" is a test of  the mettle of director Frederick Johntz. He can't salvage this overwrought show  but he cajoles some fetching Laurel and Hardy touches from performers Neal  Lerner and Joseph McCarthy, who give the term "trouper" new meaning.  </P> <P> The dialogue becomes unbearable, by turns giddy and turgid and mind-bending.  That's eternity in the desert for you. The wasteland is briefly enlivened by a  couple of screechy strangers (Louise Bitcon and Gail Shapiro). The world's mad  -- do you hear? Mad.  </P> <P>  At 10508 W. Pico Blvd., Monday through Wednesday, 8 p.m., through May 2. $5.  (213) 839-3322.  </P></p>

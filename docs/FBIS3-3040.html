During the first phase, the deputies discussed a wide range  of topics, ranging from regional economic development to  national development, from micro-economic activity to  macro-control measures. Their topics also covered such areas as  political affairs, economic growth, social development and  culture.    However, the keynote of speeches made by deputies from  various parts of China and Chinese leaders during group  discussions is how to correctly handle the relations between  reforms, development and stability.    That topic is not a new one. Before the convocation of the  current session, Chinese leaders had already elaborated the  issue during various meetings and their inspection tours of  grassroots units.    Chinese Premier Li Peng noted that the deputies have reached  a consensus on that issue during the ongoing session.    Many newspapers overseas have also written articles to  highlight the issue. It can be noted that the realistic choice  by China serves as a new angle for the outside world to have a  new understanding of China and that the choice makes it possible  to predict the country's future.    Media organizations in China have different descriptions of  the topic, with some calling it a "main melody" and others  calling it a "concerto."    Speaking to the deputies from Shanghai, Chinese President  Jiang Z emin described reforms, development and stability as  "three closely interrelated pieces of strategy" on a chess board.    According to Jiang, it is imperative to promote reforms and  development amid stability, while ensuring long-term social  stability through reforms and development.    During the first session of the eighth NPC held a year ago,  the keynote of speeches made by the deputies was "seizing the  opportunity for development and speeding up development."    During the current session, they also called for efforts to  seize the opportunity and accelerate development, and yet they  all emphasized the importance of balancing the relations between  reforms, development and stability.    A deputy from a locality put it well that the change shows  that the Chinese Government has become more experienced and  mature in guiding the country's development and reforms, and  that people have gained a more profound and comprehensive  understanding of the significance of establishing a socialist  market economic structure.    For deputies from all parts of China, the proper handling of  the relations between the three aspects is not a philosophical  question, but a realistic one.    This is because all kinds of people -- government officials,  business executives, workers and farmers -- all face that  question every day, and that the relations between reforms,  development and stability is related directly to the immediate  interests of every Chinese.    While backing that strategy formulated by China's policy  makers, deputies from different localities and industries view  it from different angles, placing emphasis on different aspects.    For example, mayors paid closer attention to social and  price  stability, while deputies from underdeveloped central and  western China emphasized that narrowing the gap between eastern  and western China is essential to China's long-term stability  and social stability.    Meanwhile, government officials from agricultural provinces  and farmer deputies stressed that the farming sector serves as  the basis for development and stability in China.    Business executives asked the government to take specific  measures to arrange the livelihood of workers in financial  difficulty.    The secretary of a provincial committee of the Chinese  Communist Party pointed out that the anti-corruption campaign is  a significant measure to correctly handle the relations between  reforms, development and stability.    Facing both economic achievements that have been scored over  the past few years and deep-rooted contradictions that have  arisen in economic and social life, the Chinese people now need  to explore new approaches of development and push forward  reforms oriented with the establishment of a market economic  structure.    However, reforms also involve the readjustment of the  interests pattern and risks. This constitutes a major  background for the central topic during the current NPC session.    Public opinions overseas have noticed that it is very  difficult to balance the relations between reform, development  and stability.    During the current NPC session, deputies have also expounded  the difficulties China is currently facing in carrying out  reforms and pursuing development.    At the same time, they have also analyzed various favorable  conditions and made proposals for promoting development and  maintaining stability. Many of their proposals have been  submitted in the form of bills to the bill-handling group of the  NPC session.    That indicates that deputies are confident of success of the  policies formulated by the central government.    A number of proposals by deputies coincide with the  government's consideration.    For instance, some deputies were worried that it will be  difficult to keep this year's price index to below ten percent.  Therefore, they asked the government to take effective measures  to curb price hikes.    Speaking to deputies from Hunan Province, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji said that to stabilize the market and curb price rises is  the key to balancing the relations between reforms, development  and stability, and also an important task of governments at all  levels.    Recently, the State Council has mandated governments at all  levels to monitor the change in prices of 22 kinds of  commodities and service items most closely related to people's  livelihood.    When necessary, governments should examine the increase in  prices of some of these commodities and service items and step  in to intervene.    The measure, designed to check prices from skyrocketing, has  been well received by the deputies.    The deputies also spoke of other difficulties and factors of  instability, about which the government is sober-minded. Both  the deputies and the government stressed the importance of  carefully organizing and implementing reform measures this year  and promptly solving new problems that are likely to crop up in  the course of reforms.</p>

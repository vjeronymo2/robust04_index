			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS  </P> <P> THE EMIGRANTS  </P> <P> One of the most profoundly touching celebrations of the American experience is,  in fact, this 1971 Jan Troell film drawn from the first two of Vilhelm Moberg's  quartet of novels about the massive migration of Swedish farm families to the  United States in the middle of the 19th Century. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann  star in this surpassingly fine film.  </P> <P> Monday at 1 p.m., concludes Tuesday at 1 p.m. A&amp;E  </P> <P> THE NEW LAND  </P> <P> The 1972 sequel to "The Emigrants" has less impact than the original-it hasn't  itstsimple, straight-line narrative thrust of family and friends deciding to  leave Sweden to try to build a new life in America-but it is still toweringly  impressive as Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann settle down to their northern  Minnesota homestead.  </P> <P> Wednesday at 1 p.m., concludes Thursday at 1 p.m. A&amp;E Charles Champlin  </P></p>

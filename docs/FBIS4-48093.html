			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 11 May (KNA/PANA) -- The United Nations  human rights high commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso, is expected in  Rwanda Wednesday [11 May] for a meeting with belligerents in the  Rwandan civil war and the United Nations special representative,  Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh.    Ayala Lasso, who has just ended a 48-hour visit to Burundi,  reaffirmed Tuesday in Bujumbura that the high commission was  ready to "cooperate in all the areas related to the protection  and promotion of human rights" in this country. The  commission's future cooperation with Burundi on issues of human  rights, he said, had been identified with the top officials of  the country. Some of these are, for example, support for  judicial institutions, the training of judges, education for the  promotion, and protection of human rights.</p>

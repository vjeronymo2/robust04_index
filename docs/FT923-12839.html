			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kalon bid referral is urged MR MICHAEL Heseltine, president of the board of trade, was yesterday urged to refer Kalon's hostile all-paper bid for Manders (Holdings), its Wolverhampton-based paint-making rival, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in a parliamentary early day motion signed by 49 MPs. Signatories included Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's front bench spokeswoman on City affairs, Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the all-party select committee on trade and industry, and Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West. Noting that a takeover would give Kalon more than 70 per cent of the own-label paint market, the motion argues that a merger would 'threaten a reduction in competition against the public interest.' Kalon's objective is 'to achieve an increased market share of the paint market, and in the process cut 500 jobs from the workforce of a combined group,' the motion states.</p>

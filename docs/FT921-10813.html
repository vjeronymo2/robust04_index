			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Tough soap The Rover's Return has lost a proud regular with the forced resignation of David Plowright as executive chairman of Granada Television. For all his company's Jewels in the Crown, he considered Coronation Street the world's most important programme, and delighted in the thousands who flocked to its local pub on Granada's studio tours, which he instituted. Plowright, brother of actress Joan, stood for public service broadcasting - but not at any price. He was emphatic that quality could not be detached from economic realities and that under-funded television is 'not much fun for viewers or programme-makers'. He was also an unrepentant advocate of regional television - a belief that verged on Manchester nationalism. 'Britain speaking to Britain is a better prescription for a national broadcasting service than Britain listening to London,' was how he put it. Even so, there will be some in the investment community who won't mourn his passing. When it came to TV, Granada often gave the impression of being run far more for the benefit of its programme-makers than of the company's shareholders.</p>

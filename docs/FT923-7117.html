			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / A-level results to reopen education debate A SERIOUS fall in the study of maths and science subjects despite a record number of A-levels awarded this year will reinforce calls for a broader post-16 school curriculum. The principal examination for school leavers entering higher education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland attracted 730,000 entries, a rise of 4.5 per cent. The results, sent to schools and colleges yesterday, showed a record overall pass rate of 79.6 per cent. However, a sharp decline in maths and science subjects in favour of social and business studies will renew debate about the need for a broader and more balanced exam. The fastest growing A-level subjects are business studies (entries up 24 per cent, after a 21 per cent rise last year), social science topics (up 14 per cent) and English (up 9.5 per cent). The number of mathematics students fell 3.9 per cent, and those taking physics and chemistry dropped 4.9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. This follows a 12.8 per cent fall in maths students and a 9.4 per cent fall in physics students in the previous two years. Pupils in England and Wales are not obliged to continue with English, maths or a science subject after the age of 16, unlike most other European countries which require pupils preparing for university to study a balanced curriculum. Calls for a reform of A-levels into a broader exam have come from across the spectrum, from vice-chancellors and the Head Masters' Conference to the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Critics argue the traditional three subject A-level curriculum is too narrow and and point to the waste of an exam which is failed by one in five students. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'Twenty per cent of all A-level and 30 per cent of AS-level entrants have nothing to show for their efforts, making the introduction of new vocational qualifications a desperate need.' The government insists that A-levels set a 'gold standard' and argues that AS-levels, with half the workload of A-levels, allow students to study more subjects and keep their future options open. Lady Blatch, the schools minister, notes that one in ten students in higher educations enter with vocational qualifications. However, this year the number of AS-level entries rose by only 2.3 per cent from an already low base of 52,000. Provisional results, Page 7 Editorial Comment, Page 14</p>

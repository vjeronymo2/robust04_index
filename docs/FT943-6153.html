			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Global investments surge after two years of decline Global investment surged last year after two years of decline, according to an influential United Nations report. The latest World Investment Report, compiled by the UN Conference on Trade and Development, reports that developing nations attracted record investment flows. Worldwide flows of foreign direct investment totalled Dollars 195bn in 1993, up from Dollars 171bn the previous year but below the 1990 peak of Dollars 232bn. However, foreign investment in developing countries rose sharply, and last year's Dollars 80bn total was twice 1991 levels. China was the target for much of the rise with foreign investment last year of Dollars 26bn, up from Dollars 4.4bn in 1991, making it the second largest recipient of such funds after the US. As a result, foreign affiliated ventures were estimated to account for more than a quarter of China's exports of Dollars 92bn last year, compared with 9 per cent in 1989. Unctad points out that most foreign investment inflows to developing nations 'are still concentrated in 10-15 host countries, overwhelmingly in Asia and Latin America'. The world's poorest countries receive little such investment  -a meagre Dollars 300m in 1993 - and their share has been declining. However, fears that eastern Europe would corner funds that would otherwise have gone to developing countries were unfounded, the report says. Inflows into eastern Europe in 1993 were only Dollars 5bn, and the estimated total in the region has reached some Dollars 13bn, little more than that of Thailand. Among industrialised countries, the US has regained its position as the most attractive investment location, with foreign investment inflows of Dollars 32bn in 1993. It is also the largest source of such funds, investing a record Dollars 50bn abroad last year. Within the European Union, Britain is the most popular investment destination, and the second biggest investor worldwide. Outflows from Japan, however, have shrunk dramatically from Dollars 48bn in 1990 to Dollars 12bn last year, reflecting the impact of recession. The foreign investment surge means the influence of multinationals in the world economy continues to expand, Unctad says. The report said about 37,000 parent companies with more than 200,000 foreign affiliates owned over Dollars 2,100bn in overseas assets in 1993. Markets freed to attract investors, Page 4</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front [SKNDF] on 30 March published a white paper  revealing that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are for nuclear  development.    Saying that the Kim Yong-sam clique misled the public  opinion by insisting that the experimental reactors of North  Korea are for the development of nuclear weapons, so as to kick  up anti-North smear campaign, the white paper pointed out that  this is like an act of a thief turning on the victim with a club.    The white paper maintained that the reactors used for the  development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not  the experimental reactor of North Korea, which has generating  capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, but the heavy water reactor in  Wolsong with 678,700 kilowatt and the multipurpose research  reactor in Taedok with 30,000 kilowatt.    Based on accurate materials, the white paper expressed that  the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor for the development  of nuclear weapons disguised as one for commercial use. It added  that it is a plutonium-producing reactor, introduced for the  development of nuclear weapons and not for commercial use, in  view of its purpose and structure. The white paper disclosed  that the Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large amount of  spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used directly  for the development of nuclear weapons.    In addition, the white paper pointed out that the  multipurpose research reactor complex is a reactor exclusively  for nuclear arms development under the veil of research. The  white paper exposed that the multipurpose research reactor is a  reactor for the development of nuclear weapons set up in the  eighties as an alternate project as the attempt to introduce it  for the key role in the nuclear development in the seventies had  failed.    The white paper revealed on the basis of the accurate  materials that the multipurpose research reactor is not an  experimental reactor with a peaceful purpose but for military  use which is used as a diazole in the production of nuclear  weapons, and said the problem lies on the fact it is closely  linked with reprocessing facilities.    The white paper insists that all these facts prove that the  Wolsong heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research  reactor in Taedok are for the military use, and it is South  Korea, not North Korea, which confronts the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula.    The white paper said that the South Korean authorities are  openly claiming the reexamination of the joint declaration on  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and eager to  develop the nuclear weapons by openly calling for nuclear  option. If this is not true, the white paper maintains, the  South Korean authorities must give up the policy of nuclear arms  development pushed ahead in accordance with the anti-North  nuclear smear campaign, and declare the removal of the heavy  water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are  used for the production of nuclear weapons.</p>

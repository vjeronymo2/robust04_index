			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Beach Boys Movie Sued: Irving Music Co. has sued a film production company,  accusing them of lying to win permission to use Beach Boys songs in an ABC  television movie based on an unauthorized biography of the surf-music group.  The Los Angeles Superior Court suit alleges Leonard Hill Productions told  Irving agents that they wanted to use the songs for a "teen-age coming-of-age  story" or in a film about "vacationing kids who liked Beach Boys music." The  ABC film, "The Story of the Beach Boys: Summer Dreams" aired Sunday. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

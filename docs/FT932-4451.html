			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Observer: Urban search Expect an announcement any day of who has got the best-paid job in urban regeneration in Britain - chief executive of the new Urban Regeneration Agency. More than 200 have applied for the Pounds 90,000 a year post. Current favourite for running what has been described as 'an urban development corporation on wheels' is Eric Sorensen, the former civil servant who now runs London Docklands Development Corporation. He'll get a close run from Alastair Balls, another ex-civil servant who is chief executive of the Tyne and Wear development corporation. Tony Pender, chief executive of English Estates since 1979, could also make a good showing - since his organisation will be absorbed by the URA. If it's experience of the private sector that is needed, they could do worse than go for Anne Ferguson, marketing woman of the year 1990, whose job as head of group advertising and sponsorship at ICI has lost some of its glamour following the break-up of ICI. Jan Hall, the ex-ICI manager who heads up Coley Porter Bell, would be another good candidate. Whoever gets the job has an important first task to sort out - defining the new agency's role. Lord Walker, with his beloved Welsh Development Agency in mind, sees the URA leading efforts to attract inward investment from points east. The Environment Department would rather the URA got on with clearing the 150,000 remaining acres of derelict land in Britain's inner cities. The new chief executive will need the wisdom of Solomon to reconcile the two viewpoints.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (3): Scotland ready to rule - Why the Scottish system is increasingly envied south of the border Alumni of Scottish independent schools may soon be running the country. Prince Charles is an old boy of Gordonstoun, one of the remotest schools in the UK based in the northern Highlands, while Tony Blair, the leader of the opposition, is a graduate of Fettes, an Edinburgh boarding school. However, Scottish schools with the exception of Gordonstoun, are not included in the FT-1,000 as they offer Scottish qualifications. Many offer A-levels, but Gordonstoun is the only one to do so exclusively. It is ranked 386th, but the philosophy of its founders was ambitious and the school is even less likely than most to accept judgment purely in terms of its academic results. The others offer more of a 'mixed economy' of A-levels and Scottish qualifications, which are increasingly envied south of the border. Proposals by the Headmaster's Conference  - which includes the top four schools in the FT-1,000  - to reform the A-level structure to allow more flexibility, and by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, representing universities, to reform A-level syllabuses so that five subjects become the norm, would both mean moving in the direction of the Scottish system. However, the mixed Scottish system defies adequate ranking. There is no agreed conversion table between highers and A-levels  - although highers are accepted at most English universities  - and different schools might legitimately have different approaches. Some take highers later because they need more time, others to take extra subjects. For some the final year is irrelevant as they already have the fifth-year highers needed to go to a Scottish university. Therefore, the FT has made no attempt to rank them academically. Examination of the proportions gaining A- and B-grades in highers does, however, suggest that the big-city day schools tend to fare best. Scotland has arguably the two most fiercely competitive markets for day pupils in Britain, in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Both have several well-established day schools fishing from a small pool of families able to pay independent school fees. As the table shows, Dundee and Aberdeen also have big independent day schools. The boarding schools are more eclectic. Fettes, a Victorian-Gothic construction near the centre of Edinburgh, has a strong high-church tradition. Glenalmond  - with architecture designed to match Trinity College, Cambridge  - was set up by Gladstone, the former prime minister, and stands in dramatic open Perthshire countryside. Despite the apparently remote locations, most of the boarding schools are within easy reach of the bulk of the Scottish population. In practice, most boarders tend to be either from Scotland or the North of England, while there is also a pocket of 'expatriate Scots' from London. Glenalmond is trying to encourage more English pupils by promoting the advantages of the Scottish system  - which used to be regarded as a problem. It says the flexibility will attract many, while the rigorous standards needed for medicine degree courses might be easier to achieve if taken gradually via highers. +++++++ End of Leg 5 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Scottish schools also offer a lot for those who want clean air and wide open spaces, and the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme is usually on offer. Gordonstoun has a 150-acre estate, including over a mile of shoreline on the Moray firth, while the big-city day schools also offer pupils outdoors pursuits. Kelvinside Academy, a Glasgow boys' school, has its own house in the Cairngorms for skiing and hill-walking  - a valuable opportunity for inner-city boys. Fees for both boarding and day schools are in line with rates charged for independent schools elsewhere in the UK. Last year's average boarding fee per term was Pounds 3,259, compared with Pounds 3,261 for the nation as a whole. Day schools tend to be cheaper than in England, at Pounds 1,222 per term (against an average of Pounds 1,262). Full details of schools' performance in GCSEs and Standard grades, taken by 16-year-olds, and in Certificate of Sixth-Year Studies, are available from the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

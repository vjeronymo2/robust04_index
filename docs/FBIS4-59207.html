			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held consultations  with Histadrut Trade Union Secretary General Hayim Haberfeld,  Labor party secretary Nisim Zvili, and Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres a short while after the publication of the results of the  straw polls which granted the victory in the Histadrut elections  to Hayim Ramon. Upon leaving the meeting, the prime minister  told correspondents that the Labor party had undeniably been  dealt a blow. However, when the correspondents asked him  whether he intended to call upon Ramon to rejoin the ranks of  the Labor party, Mr. Rabin pointed out that right now he was  only commenting on the Histadrut elections and the immediate  question was which form the internal arrangements inside the  Histadrut would take.    The prime minister said that in his opinion the vote  reflected the feelings of protest and disappointment of  Histadrut members following a long period of Labor rule and this  was a well-known phenomenon. Nevertheless, Rabin stressed that  he was glad that the votes had remained within the left-wing  camp while the Likud had received a serious setback. The prime  minister avoided giving a direct answer when asked about the  anticipated new political alignments, but reiterated that the  government and the Labor party had political goals on the  national level, noting that its leadership would be guided by  considerations on how to achieve these goals.    Hayim Ramon's supporters in the Labor party, members of the  quintet of Labor Knesset Members [MK's], called on the prime  minister to permit the return of Ramon and his associates to the  Labor party. This demand was firmly raised by MK's Ramon and  Burg.    Ramon's arch rival, Minister Shim'on Shetrit, once again  called Ramon a deserter this evening. Shetrit, however, noted  that in politics, coalitions are established even with one's  worst rivals. This implies that the partnership between Ramon  and the Labor party may be renewed in some form.    Some members of Ramon's camp have called for the  establishment of a coalition with the Labor party Histadrut  faction, which will apparently receive 30 percent, or slightly  more, of the vote.    Minister Shulamit Aloni said that the Ramon list would be  prepared to consider such an affiliation. In Aloni's  assessment, negotiations would start this evening and the Ramon  list would join with the Labor party. The country is waiting  for changes in the Histadrut, Aloni explained. Rabin has no  reason to be concerned. On the contrary, social and economic  changes would only stand to his credit. Aloni asserted that the  coalition between SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in  the Histadrut would be lasting and durable, and presented no  problems.    MK Ya'aqov Shamay, head of the Likud list, congratulated  Hayim Ramon on his achievement. Shamay noted, however, that  this did not constitute a political upheaval in the Histadrut  because Hayim Ramon was still a member of the Labor party.</p>

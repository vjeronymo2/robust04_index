			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (24): Forget the peeled prawns, you want macaroni cheese - Luxury does not lie in brand names, nor in goods that used to be scarce. It is a much more subtle commodity DOES Mrs Thing really look the business in her mid-tone full length ranch mink, thrown over an appliqued cashmere twin-set, setting off in her walnut-lined Daimler to eat prawn cocktail in pink sauce at the Tudor Grange restaurant in Something-on-Thames. The poor old biddy, they will say, has clearly lost the plot. Luxury is re-defined in every decade. A raft of traditional luxuries - mink, cashmere, trad' British 'quality' cars and prawns - have been re-classified by fashion, political correctness and increased availability. Mink has suffered all three. Supermarkets sell peeled prawns by the bucketload. The old imagery of luxury was based on the notion of the cornucopia - a hectic abundance of whatever is in short supply. The cornucopia pours forth out-of-season fruit. Luxury was easily defined when the shopping list was short (no Apple Mackintosh, no liposuction) when there was consensus about what was best and when most of the world lived at subsistence level. But postwar technology and marketing have upset the traditional Veblen notions of conspicuous consumption - wotalotigot - by providing an abundance of former rarities (farmed salmon and venison for everyone), and by providing an extraordinary flow of novelties to subvert the traditional status of luxuries (mobile telephones, dental bonding). Even Paul Johnson, the distinguished sourpuss, noted on turning 65 last week the extraordinary range of former luxuries that had become commonplace over his lifetime. He saw the development as one of the compensations for bad manners, worse thinking and social disintegration. J K Galbraith pointed out as early as 1958 in The Affluent Society that 'no useful distinction can be made between luxuries and necessities' (but he was talking about America's Golden Age). Meanwhile marketing has imposed a new definition of luxury - a curious, 1980s notion of luxury as symbolism and reference rather than reality - the world of 'added-value', today's version of 'de-luxe'. Recognised luxury now comes primarily in the marketeer's coinage, the 'luxury brand'. A luxury brand is one believed to confer magic status on its owners. Luxury brands, whatever their origins, are vigorously promoted names in the marketplace now. Their values are totemic ones; the name is everything. In the 1980s wonderful new money and new aspirations emerged in new places. The flaunt-it imperative stretched from Essex to Seoul via Dallas and Tokyo. This coincided with changes in the ownership and control of the majority of specialist luxury manufacturers and design houses in Europe. From the late 1970s on practically every leading couture house and accessory maker was acquired and run by a marketeer who treated the company as a 'brand management' business, owners of a set of rights which could be licensed, franchised and generally deployed to add value. They talked about 'the equity in the brand' - they usually outsourced the product. The new owners did everything in the marketeers handbook: they looked for diversification opportunities (new products to sell under the old valuable name); they looked for new markets, opening the Seoul shop in 1988, just after Atlanta and, above all, they looked for new kinds of people to 'extend the franchise'. These new people were, typically, aspirants, socially mobile Wannabes who had significant disposable income rather than serious money but wanted to relate to the Great World they saw in the raft of 'style' and social magazines that publishing groups produced throughout the decade. These strategies worked well until at least 1989. The accounts of the big luxury brand-owners show super-normal profits through the late 1980s, a quite embarrassing share of which derived from the Far East. It worked because the approach recognised the identities the new people wanted to assume, often 'traditional' European ones. And it worked because it was not that hard - the new funny money seemed to mop up anything it was sent - every office girl in Tokyo with money to burn seemed to have something from Louis Vuitton. At fever pitch, in the late 1980s, it was truly surreal to see the imagery of the 19th century Faubourg St Honore and St James's replicated in theme park concessions round the world.  And of course it was complete alphabet soup with letters everywhere - double Gs for Gucci, the Chanel C, YSL - metallic initials twinkling from all over the New People. Real businesses at scale were built on the luxury branding device - LVMH, the pre-eminent luxury house, is big on the Paris bourse. Factories were filled with tiny religious offerings stamped with the magic symbols. But the scale of the enterprise depended to a great degree on an 1980s cast of mind, an 'everything possible' view, and on what the Japanese call the 'bubble economy'. It is gone somehow, that sublime belief in the magic power of brands; not just because of recession but because each generation learns through the great educator, shopping. Shopping familiarises people with the mechanics of luxury brands, makes them cynical about the promotional devices, the atmospheric outlets, the inventive packaging. They feel eventually they have been there, done that. In the 1980s the learning process was accelerated as more and more brands entered the market. Shopping eventually teaches aspirants that people like themselves buy these brands. The brands' status moves rapidly from desirable to acceptable to unsurprising. New money constantly looks for new ways to express itself. Real luxury continues to move more quietly on different rubber wheels. Real luxury, for seriously rich people, means having your own way. It means servants - whatever you call them - and it means things hand-built for you. In the houses of the seriously rich, often very short on the style the magazines show, there is always something that has absorbed a great deal of money and craftsman time, contrived to do exactly what its owner wants. The Queen's life illustrates this principle vividly. In a plain bathroom wholly unlike any high concept room-set the bath is run by helping hands. In the royal clothes, dowdy to the critics, everything has been elaborately thought through to meet HM's distinct personal requirements. Macaroni cheese and eggs on toast will be available on a 1950s Formica tray exactly when and how she wants them. The 'thrifty' repair and restoration of a host of shabby loved Royal objects will have cost more skilled man and woman hours than a raft of Taiwan-made luxury accessories. The luxury brand names with royal warrants will still do the real discreet hand-made specials for her, their loss leaders. But they will almost certainly have to leave the initials off.</p>

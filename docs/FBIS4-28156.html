			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on 5th Congress of Korean Children's Union" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates an editorial to the 5th Congress of the Korean  Children's Union which opens here today on the occasion of the  48th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Children's Union.    Under the wise guidance of the great leader Generalissimo  Kim  Il-song the flag of the Saenal Juvenile Union, the first  communist juvenile revolutionary organisation of our country,  was carried forward by the anti-Japanese Children's Corps and  then by the Korean Children's Union after the liberation and the  Korean children have vigorously traversed the road of victory  and glory under this flag, the editorial says, and goes on:    The congress will be a congress of loyalty which will  demonstrate the fervent and strong will of the 3 million members  of the Korean Children's Union to walk with fortitude under the  guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il the road of Paektu  hewn by the anti-Japanese guerrillas and anti-Japanese  children's corps members under the guidance of the great leader  Generalissimo Kim Il-song.    In order to smash the anti-DPRK campaign of the imperialists  and the reactionaries of the world and defend and exalt  our-style socialism centering on the popular masses, it is  imperative to direct efforts to preparing not only the party  members and the youth but also the children.    There are no more important task and no greater honour to  our  Children's Union members today than to become true guards of the  Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    The Children's Union members should become loyal and filial  sons and daughters who follow General Kim Chong-il with pure  heart and remain loyal and dutiful to him.    Strictly abiding by the study-first policy of the party, the  Children's Union members should study hard, cultivate communist  moral traits and build their physical strength. And they should  actively participate in socio-political activities and the  do-good-things movement and have the spirit of safeguarding the  motherland against the aggression moves of the enemies and the  readiness to be rifles and bombs as members of the League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] do.    All the members of the Children's Union should, in the  future, too, as in the past, vigorously advance for the  accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of chuche which  started from Mt. Paektu, flying the red flag of the Children's  Union as true young guards of the party, following the WPK and  LSWYK members.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Airline dispute talks to continue TALKS between British Airways management and white-collar members of the GMB general union working at London's Gatwick airport were postponed yesterday and are now due to continue today. The union has warned that travellers might face another strike this week if talks on pay and conditions break down. A similar dispute with the TGWU transport union led to a 24-hour stoppage last week and disruption of most of BA's flights from Gatwick and Heathrow.</p>

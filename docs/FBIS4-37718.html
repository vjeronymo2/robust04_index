			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The Zionist regime's aggressing warplanes carried  out further military operations in south Lebanon last night in  conjunction with intense attacks on residential areas by their  artillery deployed in the occupied areas in the south. This  resulted in human and material losses among the civilian  population.    This was the third aerial attack by the Zionist regime's  fighter bombers on Lebanon's residential areas in the past two  days following the valiant operations by the Islamic Resistance  against the Zionist usurpers. On 'Ashura, the combatants of the  Islamic Resistance attacked the Zionist aggressors inside the  areas they occupy, emulating the lord of the martyrs.    Instead of the Zionist regime terminating its 16-year  occupation of the border strip in south Lebanon under pressure  of international public opinion--by withdrawing--it continues  its policy of blind terrorism with the support of foreign and  international powers. The Zionist regime attacks residential  areas in a blind and cowardly manner with its bombers and  artillery. The Zionist regime's pretext for these acts of  aggression and the repeated violation of international norms is  that it is combating the cells of the Islamic liberation  struggle against the usurpers. In reality, the Zionist regime  is pursuing other political objectives.    Political experts believe that the Tel Aviv echelons are  striving to bare their fangs and talons in these operations  before the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  to the Middle East. This visit implies that the wheels of  diplomatic machinery have been set in motion and therefore the  Zionist regime--this uninvited and inauspicious guest in the  region--feels that before he arrives it should show off its  fangs and talons to its host country to impose peace from a  position of strength.    It is no coincidence that at the same time as the bombing of  south Lebanon the Zionist regime's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  should participate directly in military maneuvers in the  occupied Golan Heights, which belong to Syria. Interesting that  during these maneuvers Rabin expressed his dissatisfaction with  the current talks in Washington and called for direct talks with  Syria.    It can be concluded from such behavior that the occupying  Zionist regime is first willing to embark on all kinds of  atrocities and second is also enjoying international immunity  and the support of world powers in this regard. The Lebanese  Government has realized the regime's political objectives and  has adopted a completely appropriate stance by extending its  serious support to the anti-Zionist resistance as the country's  legitimate right. This means that the Zionist regime will reap  nothing from these crimes but disgrace.</p>

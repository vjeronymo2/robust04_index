			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (1): A fragile confidence begins to return - President Alberto Fujimori's government has embarked on a programme to stabilise and deregulate the economy - and to battle against terrorism A FRAGILE confidence is returning to Peru after a decade of violence and economic collapse. The two men most associated with this dismal decade are - for now at least - safely out of the way. Abimael Guzman, the provincial academic who led the Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso in a battle against the state, is behind bars, his campaign having caused the deaths of 26,000 people and Dollars 22bn of damage. The former head of state Alan Garcia, president from 1985 to 1990, is in exile. His government turned the country into the pariah of international finance by not servicing its foreign debt. Worse: it squandered the resources that it gained by not paying. After a short state-financed boom, the economy collapsed and hyper-inflation, peaking at 397 per cent a month, ensued. The two men were as much manifestations as architects of Peru's ills. The society was as deeply divided on racial lines as any in South America: Sendero's essentially middle-class leadership fed on the resentment among the poor indigenous groups that this fostered. The Garcia government meanwhile represented the corrupt culmination of years of statism which intensified Peru's already profound poverty. Given this, it would be unrealistic to expect an economic quick fix. Nonetheless, matters have improved sufficiently for investors, internal and external, to begin a gradual return to the country. Since the arrest in September, 1992, of Guzman and the detention of other guerrilla leaders, the political risk of investment is viewed as considerably diminished. Furthermore, investor confidence has been spurred by the privatisation plans of the government of President Alberto Fujimori - now apparently moving ahead after numerous delays - and its investment and other reforms. The government is back in the good graces of the international financial institutions in Washington, having cleared its arrears to them and begun negotiations with foreign commercial banks. Its foreign reserves, which were negative at times in 1988, have risen to levels high enough to cover seven months of imports, and inflation is down to double-digit annual levels. In the last few months, the economic picture has improved further. The economy has started to pick up this year, enough at least to erase the effects of a weak 1992 when the austere fiscal targets of an International Monetary Fund programme, terrorism and drought-induced electricity shortages resulted in the economy shrinking by 3 per cent. After falling sharply early in the Fujimori government, inflation became sticky. Now it may be falling again. Mr Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo, the Chicago-educated dean of the economics faculty of the University of the Pacific, says the improvement follows a shift in central bank policy. This year the bank stopped targeting the exchange rate - a policy which led last year to a appreciation of the real value of the Peruvian currency, the sol, to the displeasure of exporters - and now seeks to curb excessive money supply growth. Yet these advances have yet to show through as tangible benefits to a population, nearly 60 per cent of whom were in absolute poverty in 1989, according to the World Bank. Mr Fujimori remains popular because he is seen as having brought security and a more stable economy, not because he has advanced the material conditions of Peruvians. Mr Fujimori, who took office in 1990 for a five-year term, is not a natural economic reformer. It took time for him to be persuaded that privatisation was beneficial. He emphasises his government's pragmatism, which liberal critics read as a suggestion that his market-oriented policies depend on his continued popularity. Although Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister for 23 months until he was sacked in January, has regularly fallen out with the president, he gives him the benefit of the doubt: 'It's true that Fujimori is not a convinced liberal, but in his pragmatism, he has backed a programme that has seen results.' But even Mr Bolona says that the reform is not moving ahead as he would like. 'Until now we are still on track. For two years we were moving ahead with full speed. Now we are moving ahead by inertia.' PART of the problem is the lack of a large team to push economic reform forward. Only a handful of people is helping Mr Jorge Camet, the 65-year-old minister of economy, a much smaller group than those who pursued reform in Mexico, Argentina, or even Bolivia. The small size of the group has also hindered implementation of legislation already passed - the government's labour law reform is an example - because there is nobody to draft the rules. Furthermore, even according to its supporters, the government persists in policies which continue economic distortions. The expensive support of irrigation projects in the north and the continuing import taxes on foodstuffs such as rice, wheat, sugar and milk, which overwhelmingly benefit agricultural co-operatives in the north and do little to help the poorest farmers in the mountains, are two examples. On top of that, according to market-oriented economists, new distortions are being introduced. The government is proposing that a 9 per cent tax paid by employees to Fonavi, the state housing fund, should be changed, leaving 3 per cent to be paid by workers and 6 per cent by the companies that employ them. What is in effect a new payroll tax could well deter future employment and wage increases. Mr Gonzales Izquierdo is also critical of the government for not placing enough emphasis early in its term on social spending, for example on education. Now that is changing, Mr Fujimori is emphasising physical spending - for example on new school buildings and computers rather than on quality of the education. Tackling social problems is hindered by a lack of state resources, brought about by problems with tax collection. Mr Fujimori has acknowledged this as an issue constraining the government. Mr Gonzales Izquierdo says that the state's poor performance in tax collection - along with a foreign debt standing at a worrying five times annual exports - represents an Achilles heel in economic policy. 'In the last three months, in real terms, tax collection has fallen. This is very serious,' says Mr Gonzales Izquierdo. He calculates that tax collection  -which he estimates will turn out at about 8.8 per cent of GDP this year - will fall short of the 9.1 per cent called for in the IMF programme signed earlier this year. (This assumes that the actual size of the Peruvian economy is in line with official figures suggesting a GDP of more than Dollars 40bn, which is almost certainly an exaggeration. Given the size of the informal sector and the high dollarisation of the economy, estimating GDP is pretty much guesswork. Estimates vary between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 40bn. The University of the Pacific, estimating that the informal economy accounts for 40 per cent of all economic activity, has come up with a Dollars 30bn figure.) The government inherited a tax system devastated by hyper-inflation. By the end of the Garcia era, Peruvians were paying only 4.4 per cent of GDP, using official figures, compared with an historical norm ranging from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in exceptional years. The IMF is seeking a tax collection target of 13 per cent (based on official GDP statistics) by 1995. Whether this can be achieved depends on how much GDP is being overestimated. If GDP is really only Dollars 20bn, tax collection must actually rise to a figure of about 25 per cent to meet targets which, given the extent of activity in the informal economy, mean a heavy burden on the minority who pay tax. Thus a potentially vicious circle is developing, with high taxes driving more and more taxpayers either partially or wholly into the informal economy and narrowing the tax base still further. Still, it is credible to argue that the way forward for Peru has been trail-blazed by Chile, which pursued growth by exploiting its comparative advantage in the production of raw materials. In some areas, Peru's comparative advantage is greater than Chile's, and the prices of assets in Peru are significantly cheaper. The question investors are asking, therefore, is whether the government can retain the upper hand against terrorism, and what are the risks of a sharp reverse in economic policy which would, for example, halt foreign exchange remittances. GIVEN the successes against the leadership of Sendero Luminoso, few people in Lima appear to expect a resurgence of the bombings that so sapped confidence in the capital last year. However, a few big bombs could underline the fragility of this view. Furthermore, even if Sendero is defeated in the countryside - and it is still powerful in many areas - Mr Fujimori's policy of arming civilians to fight terrorism means there are many more weapons in circulation in Peru. As has already happened in some zones, banditry - often linked to the cocaine trade - may replace terrorism as the number one security problem. On the economic front, Mr Fujimori says a new constitution - to replace the statist-inclined charter of 1979 - and his two further years in office will be the true guarantor that economic change is permanent. The new constitution, which will be put to a referendum on October 31, contains important changes, some elements of which are seen as necessary - for example a reform of a corrupt judicial system. Yet, because the changes are so wide-ranging - they include a proposal to reintroduce the death penalty - they may encourage a rainbow of opposition, beyond the traditional political parties Mr Fujimori purports to despise. Most opinion polls suggest the new constitution will secure a majority, but unless that majority is large, the temptation will be great for a successor government to change it again. Constitutions in Latin America in any case often mean little. What worries some people in Lima even more is the personal nature of Mr Fujimori's style of government. Mr Fujimori is not viewed as an institution builder, and he has centralised power since he took office. He has done little to establish the rule of law - indeed he undermined it, by suspending the constitution on April 5 last year. Human rights abuses by the security forces continue to bring domestic and international condemnation. 'He has been good at destroying the bad; but he has been less effective at creating something to take its place,' says Mr Augusto Alvarez, economic analyst and editor. While he is still popular with many poor Peruvians, who see him as an outsider, like themselves, Mr Fujimori seems to trust few people. He appears to owe few favours to the traditionally powerful in Peru. Yet, while this has had the benefit of giving him a free hand in policy-making and has freed most of his administration from the taint of corruption accusations, it may also have encouraged policy mistakes. For example, he underestimated the adverse international reaction to his April 5 usurping of the constitution, a reaction that nearly killed off his economic programme. This has also increased speculation about the few people he does appear to trust, in particular his adviser on security and intelligence matters, Mr Vladimiro Montesinos. In a survey carried out by a Lima magazine, the little-known Mr Montesinos - who won a libel action against a publication describing him as a Rasputin - was adjudged the second most powerful man in the country. Mr Fujimori paints himself as a new-style leader in contrast with the corrupt traditional party politicians that went before him. In some senses, this is true: he has no real party, which in part explains, says Mr Enrique Obando of the Peruvian Institute for International Studies, his reliance on the army. Yet in Mr Fujimori's authoritarian streak, many see the stamp of the traditional Latin American leader. Most people believe that Mr Fujimori wants a second term of office, though he denies it, and one of the proposed changes to the constitution would allow him to run again. The president, therefore, has a fine line to walk. To win the election, he may be tempted to depict himself as the only person who can save the country. But to get the economy going again and to reassure investors, he cannot afford to scare people too much about what will happen if somebody else wins.</p>

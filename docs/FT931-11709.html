			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Bonds: US dollar sector set to pick up with issues worth Dollars 1bn expected A FURTHER batch of Canadian dollar Eurobonds was launched yesterday, following a flood of paper at the end of last week, as borrowers took advantage of swap opportunities. Activity in the US dollar sector is also set to pick up. Two supranational agencies, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are preparing to launch new issues totalling Dollars 1bn. The IADB took bids last night for a Dollars 500m 10-year offering. An IADB spokesman said bids were invited from its four regular arrangers - Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and CSFB - and from three rotating houses - Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and IBJ International. The IADB said it was looking for bids within a yield spread of 20 basis points above the comparable US Treasury. The IADB plans to borrow Dollars 4.4bn in 1993, one-third in dollars, one-third in yen and the rest in European currencies. The ADB is also expected to raise Dollars 500m, but no decision on the maturity of the issue has yet been taken. The issue is expected to emerge later this week or next week. Meanwhile, last week's heavy supply of Canadian dollar paper has left dealers with some inventory on their books. The distribution of issues by Credit Foncier de France and the Kingdom of Denmark was proceeding rather slowly, syndicate managers said. However, the World Bank's CDollars 250m 10-year Eurobond, launched yesterday, met firm demand, despite a rather aggressive pricing to yield just 22 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds. Dealers reported strong demand from Asia and North America, mainly because of the World Bank's pedigree. The deal also had some rarity value, since it is the World Bank's first Canadian dollar offering since 1990. The spread on the World Bank Eurobond tightened slightly to 20 basis points once the syndicate was broken. Meanwhile, the development of the collared floating-rate note structure in the sterling market has caught the attention of UK building societies. After the first such issue, a Pounds 100m three-year deal for the Leeds Permanent, via Salomon Brothers last Thursday, a second Pounds 100m deal for Bradford &amp; Bingley via NatWest Capital Markets followed on Friday. The collared structure incorporates a minimum interest rate (floor) and a maximum interest rate (cap), and has become a viable instrument in the sterling market since the latest base cut to 6 per cent last Tuesday. Yesterday, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 100m 10-year issue of floating-rate notes which pay interest at  1/16 point below the London interbank offered rate, with a minimum coupon of 7 per cent and a maximum of 10 3/4 per cent. Save &amp; Prosper, the fund management group, yesterday launched the China Dragon Fund, its first authorised unit trust to invest directly in mainland China. The unit trust will invest up to 10 per cent of the funds in Chinese listed 'B' shares and unquoted Chinese investments. The remainder of the funds will be invested in Hong Kong-based companies with a strong exposure to mainland China, S&amp;P said.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Fears grow over the rise and rise of 'petty councillors' The Heagney brothers, co-directors of the A. Heagney chain of supermarkets in the north-east, think they have seen the future of local government reorganisation. They are convinced it does not work. They are not alone. Businesses in most of the areas of the country so far touched by the local government commission's review initially welcomed reorganisation as an opportunity to save public money and to cut their own compliance costs by reducing the number of councils they had to deal with. But now they fear reorganisation will cost extra money and confuse their position still further. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, wrote to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, saying the review could become 'an expensive hobby for the government', and 'an exer-cise in bureaucratic job creation across the country'. The CBI supports the general principle of unitary councils - where the two-tier system of county and district councils is replaced by all-purpose councils - provided they are of 'reasonable size'. The issue of strategic planning is paramount. They argue that authorities need to have sufficient clout for economic development, planning and transport. Proposals for dismantling the unpopular county of Cleveland and replacing it with four unitary authorities have met with a particularly fierce response. Mr Mike Heagney, one of the two brothers who runs the Pounds 6.5m annual turnover chain, believes he is about to fall victim to the kind of parochialism that he and others in business fear will gain the upper hand if the county is divided into four units, as the government is recommending. He says the success of his shop in Berwick Hills, one of Middlesbrough's less affluent housing estates, is threatened by a development approved last week by Middlesbrough council. The Pounds 13m scheme, championed by the council as part of its City Challenge urban regeneration initiative, involves the construction of a 78,000 sq ft Morrison's superstore. To make way for the store and its 788-space car park in the heart of the 30-year-old estate, Berwick Hills' swimming baths, library, community centre, housing office, youth club, church, church hall and vicarage will all have to be demolished and rebuilt. 'It's being decided by petty, parochial councillors,' Mr Heagney claims. 'The opposition's been enormous and the councillors have totally ignored it.' Cleveland council currently has responsibility for highways and for formulating the county's structure plan, and opposes the Berwick Hills scheme on both these grounds. The districts deny they are parochial. Nor do they accept that four unitary districts would weaken structural planning controls. A joint committee of the four unitary authorities would be set up, says Middlesbrough's chief economic development and planning officer Mr Tony Noble, to deal with any proposed departures from the structure plan and other strategic issues. 'There's no greater danger of succumbing to parochialism than any other structure,' he says. The superstore scheme, he says, will enhance the overall vitality and viability of Berwick Hills. Business feelings are similarly strong in Avon and Somerset, which are to be split into seven unitary authorities. 'I've never encountered such a dog's breakfast before,' says Mr Chris Curtis, director of the CBI in the south-west. 'Absolutely no good to be said for it, any way at all.' The Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative describes the business community as 'outraged' by the recommendations which would have a 'disastrous impact' on the region. Again strategic planning is at issue. Bristol will be unitary, but restricted to its present historic boundaries. The CBI, Institute of Directors and Bristol Chamber had lobbied for an expanded Bristol to include the urban area outside its present boundaries. Most local managing directors, according to a survey by the Bristol chamber, believe the commission's proposals would leave the city too small and under-resourced. But Mr John Irwin, a Teesside director of chartered surveyors Storey Sons &amp; Parker, provides a typical business judgment on the review so far: 'It's a fantastic opportunity to start again. But that opportunity is being missed.'</p>

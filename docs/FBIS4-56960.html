			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- In a communique issued yesterday, the  Army Social Communications Center (Cecomsex) characterized as  "politically-ideologically oriented, Nazi-Fascist, and clearly  illegal and pointless" a decision made by the Rio de Janeiro  State Regional Medical Council [CREMERJ] against General Ricardo  Agnese Fayad of the Army Medical Corps. On 5 May CREMERJ  canceled Fayad's medical license on charges of having supervised  the torture of political prisoners during the military regime.  Fayad is currently serving as the Army's deputy health director.    The communique says: "The Brazilian Army strongly rejects  any  innuendo concerning the behavior of its members when the  appropriate legal procedures have not been followed." It adds  that Fayad, whom President Itamar Franco promoted to brigadier  general on 31 March, "has an outstanding record of services  rendered to the Army and to the nation, both as a physician and  as an officer."    Fayad was charged with having worked for the DOI-CODI  [Internal Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations  Center] at the then 1st Army in the Tijuca district in Rio de  Janeiro, where he allegedly worked with Lieutenant Amilcar Lobo  -- a psychiatrist who had his license canceled by CREMERJ in  1988 -- in evaluating the physical resistance of torture victims  and in providing guidance to torturers.    The Army communique, which is signed by Cecomsex Chief  General Gilberto Serra, adds that pursuant to Law 5526 of 1968,  military physicians cannot be held accountable before regional  medical councils for the technical-professional duties they may  be required to perform as servicemen. Besides, the communique  adds, the amnesty law has rendered any excess that either side  may have committed unpunishable.</p>

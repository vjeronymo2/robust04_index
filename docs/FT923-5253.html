			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (13): The great trek begins - Reforms ease air links with South Africa WHEN Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Airlines, visited South Africa last March, he was effusively welcomed as the man who was going to liberate the South African traveller from high airline prices. Things haven't quite turned out that way, with Virgin still struggling to get the arrival slots at Heathrow necessary to operate a service to South Africa. These difficulties aside, the fanfare which accompanied Branson's visit was instructive, testifying to a public hitherto starved of discount air-fares. Ironically, though it was Virgin which created most hype about the prospect of cut-price rates, it has been the existing carriers who have started to deliver the goods. Nothing symbolised this more clearly than the recent announcement by British Airways that it was introducing a return Johannesburg-London fare of R1,992, a price which South African Airways (SAA) soon matched. A year ago bottom of the range prices for the same route were about R3,200. Lufthansa and KLM have also been offering heavily discounted fares to Europe. These developments are all a function of the liberalisation of South Africa's international aviation policy, announced in April by Dr Piet Welgemoed, Minister of Transport. The main features of the policy, concerning scheduled services, are the deregulation of tariff control, allowing multiple designation of carriers on specific routes, allowing flexibility of provision by designated carriers to match demand and promoting Cape Town and Durban as alternative gateways to the country from Johannesburg. Charter flights will also be encouraged far more than in the past. The new policy has economic and political roots and reflects developments in the domestic and international aviation markets. The economic impetus arose from the shift in government policy, evident for the past few years, to encourage greater competition in the economy through deregulation and to place the economy on a more market-oriented footing. This thinking had already been reflected in the deregulation of the domestic aviation industry which took effect in July 1991. This allows for any airline that has suitable aircraft, and is able to maintain and operate them safely, to be allowed to compete with SAA. Also, with SAA now part of a company (Transnet) operating on commercial lines, a clearer distinction was required between the national interest and SAA's interests. The government has also been persuaded that a liberalisation of international aviation policies will stimulate tourism and trade, and hence economic growth, job creation and the earning of foreign exchange. The main catalyst for change, however, was politics. So long as South Africa remained the political polecat of the world, with many markets closed to it, the government was obviously going to maintain a highly regulated policy environment which protected SAA's financial viability. All of this changed, however, with the start of political reforms in February 1990 and South Africa's subsequent return to respectability. A glance at the apron of Jan Smuts airport in Johannesburg confirms this changed status. Since mid-1991, 10 new airlines have started flying to South Africa - new entrants include Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and China Airlines - bringing the total to more than 30 with a further 25 applications pending. This represents considerable competition for a fairly small market - less than 1 per cent of the world total - in less than perfect health. The total number of passengers flown by SAA in fiscal 1992 declined to 4.93m from 5.05m the previous year driving SAA into a loss position for the year. The exact figures are not disclosed. SAA made an estimated R60m loss in 1991 after profits of R133m in 1989 and R63m in 1990. The new entrants into the market have been mirrored by the increased destinations to which SAA is now flying. The most significant developments here have been SAA again getting permission to overfly Africa to Europe, a right withdrawn in 1963; the resumption of flights to New York, banned in 1986; and the reintroduction of flights to Australia, where landing rights were withdrawn in 1987. Other new destinations include Luanda, Cairo, Milan, Singapore and Bangkok. These developments place SAA in the fairly unusual position, in the international context, of needing to expand its fleet. It has taken delivery of two of the four Boeing 747 400s on order and four of the seven Airbus A320s. While passengers enjoy the fruits of deregulation in the form of lower airfares, they will soon have to get used to higher airport charges as the country's nine airports and air traffic and navigation services are commercialised into two separate state-owned companies. These services currently cost the state about R200m per year and income does not cover costs.</p>

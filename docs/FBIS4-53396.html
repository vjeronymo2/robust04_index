			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] has issued a  directive to kill the leaders of the group loyal to Jose Maria  Sison, Communist Party of the Philippines chief. This was  revealed earlier today by Chief Superintendent Leandro Mendoza,  Philippine National Police [PNP] director for intelligence.    According to Mendoza, the fight between the ABB and Sison  loyalists might commence any day and may trigger violence in  Metro Manila.    Mendoza refused to identify who among the leaders of Sison  loyalists are included in the hit list of the ABB. Mendoza  added that if the killings start, the peace process maybe  affected.    As of now, the PNP is monitoring the activities of the two  groups to prevent the outbreak of violence.    [Begin Mendoza recording in progress] ...because this might  escalate to a point where they will be killing each other. And  in the process, of course, neither of the group will admit to  the slaying. The government might be blamed for the killings.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 20 (CTK) -- "I was assured in the  USA and Canada that Slovakia was viewed as any other European  state," Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told journalists today.  He returned from a week-long visit overseas.    Kukan noted that in the past Slovakia had been omitted when  the applicants for European integration were mentioned. "I was  repeatedly convinced that this would not happen as Slovakia was  considered an equal member of the international community, while  no difference is made between Slovakia and Poland, Hungary and  other European states," he added.    Kukan confirmed he was interested in establishing the  Canadian Embassy in Slovakia. He assured the journalists that  the non-existence of the embassy was not linked to the Quebec  issue, but it was a question of money.    The Canadian Government will either accredit its Viennese  ambassador to Bratislava, or transfer the consular part of its  Prague embassy to Vienna, Kukan reported.    "We have scored lots of points," Kukan commented on the  Slovak offer to train the Pakistani troops of the UN  peace-keeping forces for Bosnia. He called naive the idea that  the Slav states should present their own initiative to resolve  the Bosnian conflict. "Let us be realistic, we have no means of  forcing the Serbs to return to the negotiating table," he stated.</p>

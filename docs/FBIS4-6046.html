			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 16 (AFP) -- The British Embassy  warned foreigners Saturday against travel in Cambodia because  they could become Khmer Rouge [KR] targets as three foreigners  abducted by the guerrillas were reported alive and well.    "We have unconfirmed reports that any foreigners may be  targetted by the Khmer Rouge," an embassy statement said.    "You should take extreme care and should not travel on roads  where the Khmer Rouge occasionally operate," the statement said.    If travel was absolutely necessary, foreigners were advised  to move in convoys.    A senior embassy official would not speculate on whether the  kidnapping of foreigners was a new Khmer Rouge tactic.    But the official said the travel advisory was in reaction to  the "best available evidence" and was designed to "alert but  not alarm" the expatriate community.    Co-Interior Minister Yu Hokkri told AFP that the Khmer Rouge  leadership may have ordered their guerrillas to kidnap  foreigners in order to use them as bargaining chips in the event  of negotiations with the government.    Although the Khmer Rouge strongholds are in the north and  northwest of the country, pockets of guerrillas operate in most  provinces.    Australian former model Kelly Wilkinson, 24, her British  boyfriend, Dominic Chappell, 25, and a British friend, Tina  Dominy, whose age was not given, were reported to be alive and  well, friends in the capital said Saturday.    The trio was spotted by local people near the area where  they  were abducted Monday by Khmer Rouge guerrillas on National Route  4, about 130 kilometres ( [word indistinct] miles) southwest of  the capital.    The American Embassy backed the British advisory "100 per  cent" while the Australians agreed with the need for "increased  vigilance and extreme caution."    An spokesman for Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth  Evans also told reporters in Canberra that the three people  kidnapped were apparently in good shape.    "Elements of the armed forces have made contact with other  Khmer Rouge elements in the province and apparently there are  reports that they are alive and, to all intents and purposes,  well," the spokesman said.    But another Australian official said there was still no  ransom demand and no contact had been made with the abductors.    Two Khmer-speaking Australian police officers, who served  with the recent United Nations peacekeeping mission here, were  expected to arrive soon to help the efforts to secure the  release of Wilkinson and her two friends, an embassy official  said.    Wilkinson's father, Peter, and brother Sean, both from  Queensland, Australia, arrived here Friday and were reported to  have left for the southern coastal town of Sihanoukville  Saturday.    Wilkinson and Chappell run a popular restaurant in the port  and resort town and were returning there from the capital when  they were taken by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.    The Australian's mother, Gabrielle Wilkinson, welcomed news  of the sighting. "This is certainly the news we have been  waiting for -- a confirmed sighting," she said. "That's  wonderful."    Meanwhile a representative of the aid agency Food for the  Hungry International (FHI) said there was no response to a  letter from King Norodom Sihanouk calling for the immediate  release of one of their American aid workers, Melissa Himes.    "There was supposed to be a response mid-morning, then it  was  delayed," the aid agency official said, adding that there might  be news later Saturday.    Himes and two Cambodian colleagues are entering their third  week of captivity.    Police identified their captors as Khmer Rouge, but FHI  spokesman Robin Shell said they appeared to be a rogue unit.  Their affiliation was not clear.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Marian Andel, deputy of the Slovak National Party  [SNS], has told a news agency that he was not aware that the  leadership of the SNS had sent Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman of  the party, to the World Slavic Congress, which was set up in  Moscow at the Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.    Juraj Molnar, together with other foreign guests, sat in the  presidium of the aforementioned World Slavic Congress where  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democrats,  suggested setting up an East European community of Slavic  peoples reaching from the Adriatic to the Kuriles.    Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the Democratic Party, said that  the participation of SNS Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar in  Zhirinovskiy's party congress harms Slovakia's already bad  reputation. He noted that this step is a clear indication of  the political thinking of the highest representatives of the  purified SNS and its closest partner, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].    Ivan Duris, chairman of the Republican Party, said that,  even  if the participation of Molnar in the Moscow Congress of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is an internal SNS affair,  such contact with a nationalistically oriented party is  unsuitable. He said that it appears that the Russian Liberal  Democrats will cooperate with the SNS in the future. However,  this is not a positive signal for foreign countries.</p>

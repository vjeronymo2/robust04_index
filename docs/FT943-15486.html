			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Clinton offers Poles funds to adapt to Nato President Bill Clinton could not give Poland a firm date for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation when he visited Warsaw yesterday, but he offered what the US administration believes to be the next best thing: money to help the Polish armed forces convert their equipment and communications systems so they can work with Nato troops. In a speech to the Polish parliament, Mr Clinton promised to ask the US Congress for Dollars 100m next year to help the 21 countries which have signed up for Nato's Partnership for Peace - a sort of associate membership  -adapt to Nato norms, with a quarter of the money earmarked for Poland. 'We believe that when Nato does expand - and it will - a democratic Poland will be a member,' Mr Clinton said. US officials said the money was very different from the Dollars 10m Mr Clinton had pledged the day before in Riga to the Baltic Battalion, a peacekeeping force set up jointly by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The promise of cash drew a rare burst of applause from an otherwise unenthusiastic Polish parliament, gathered in an extraordinary session to hear Mr Clinton speak. But the parliament, no longer controlled by President Lech Walesa's Solidarity party, clapped only when Mr Clinton ventured a Polish phrase. US presidents once drew emotional crowds in Poland, but five years after former President George Bush visited Warsaw, the thrill is gone. In the past, the US embassy used to pass word of a visiting American president's itinerary through the grapevine, so that the people of Warsaw would know where they could go if they wanted to see him, while not a word would appear in the government-controlled newspapers. Today, the papers publish the complete route, so people will know where not to go if they want to avoid the traffic jams caused by the presidential motorcade. The crowds that gathered to see Mr Clinton for ceremonies at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and at the memorial to the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, were respectable but much smaller than those that greeted Mr Bush. Mr Clinton promised that he would 'not let the Iron Curtain be replaced with a veil of indifference', and reassured his audience that Russia would not be allowed a veto over Poland's eventual membership of Nato.</p>

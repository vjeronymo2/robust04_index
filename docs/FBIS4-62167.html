			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F> and Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- A decision on granting the  status of "associated partnership" to nine countries of central  and eastern Europe as well as the Baltics, which was adopted at  the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Western European  Union [WEU] in Luxemburg on May 9, does not evoke a uniform  response, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin  told a briefing here on Thursday.    "We regard this action as an attempt to find a new model for  military and political cooperation on a limited space in  Europe," he noted. In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this  is at variance with the need for building a truly pan-European  system of security and stability.    It is a mistake to bank on cooperation in which there is no  place for such a country as Russia. Such a trend, if it picks  up steam, is fraught with raising artificial barriers and  creating a threat for a new split in Europe, Demurin underlined.    "We support another way based on the principles of really  broad cooperation between all European states. We stand out for  the WEU to become, in future, part of a pan-European structure  under the aegis of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe," the spokesman continued.    He pointed to Russia's serious interest in developing a  constructive dialogue and practical cooperation with the WEU as  well as its member countries.</p>

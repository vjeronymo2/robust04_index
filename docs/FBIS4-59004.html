			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Insane Fighting in Yemen"] </F>   [Text] The battles raging all over Yemen these days are  unbelievable. Four years after unity between the north and  south, matters between brothers have reached an apogee of  violence and fighting unseen even in very fierce wars.    What recklessness and madness governs the minds of those who  have the power to decide war in fraternal Yemen? What do they  want for their country and united people? Are the brothers in  Yemen going to reap anything but damage, ruin, death, and the  destruction of everything that has been built?    All the mistakes, all the disputes, and all the so-called  deviations and excesses do not in any way justify these violent  forms of fighting and dispute. Who will benefit from the  destruction of Aden or Sanaa airports? What does the bombing  of the presidential palaces and vital installations in Sanaa and  Aden mean? The only people who will benefit are the enemies of  Yemen and the enemies of its people's unity and democratic  march, which was supposed to proceed toward a new era, in which  the Arab people of Yemen could build the foundations of their  progress and harmonize with the spirit of the age.    Faced with these violent, bloody confrontations and the  bitter fighting among the brothers, we in Jordan -- whose leader  patronized the reconciliation meeting and the signing of the  pledge and accord document -- are overwhelmed with sadness,  pain, and outrage. We denounce what is going on in Yemen,  regardless of the reasons and motives, and regardless of who  resorted to violence first. We say: We denounce all the parties  without exception, because now matter how big they may get,  differences between two parties should not reach the point of  shedding the blood of a young man or a child and the destruction  of a house, a school, or a hospital.    As we today stand watching what is going on in the mountains  and plains of that fraternal country, we can do nothing but urge  the Yemeni leaders to resort to logic and spare the blood of  their children. We urge them to preserve their country and  their unity and prevent their country from becoming a new  Somalia or a new Afghanistan, the two countries that symbolize  destruction, chaos, and bloodbaths, where the hungry and  homeless wait for aid convoys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- China is shocked by and  indignant at a statement by the Japanese Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano yesterday that the massacre in Nanjing during the  Second World War is "a fabrication", a Chinese Foreign Ministry  spokesman said today.    In response to questions by Beijing-based foreign  correspondents regarding the Justice minister's remarks, the  spokesman said that the aggression against China launched by the  Japanese militarists in the past caused great sufferings for the  Chinese people and the massacre in Nanjing was one of the  serious crimes committed by the Japanese militarists.    He continued that the international community long ago  reached conclusions on the nature of the war and the historical  facts of the massacre in Nanjing.    He pointed out that the rightful treatment of the issues in  history is an important political basis of the development of  Sino-Japanese friendly relations of cooperation.    The spokesman noted that the Chinese Government has all  along  adhered to the principle of adopting a forward-looking attitude  in treating that sad part of history and drawing lessons from  history, so as to jointly develop friendly relations of  cooperation facing the future. The principle has been shared by  many Japanese Government leaders and persons of insight, the  said.    He added that some Japanese statesmen also made apologies  and  introspection in the cabinet over the Japanese aggression during  the Second World War.    "Now that nearly 50 years have passed since the end of the  war and Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage," he  said, "a Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly  distort the history, deny the historical facts and defend the  Japanese militarists' aggression. We are shocked by and  indignant at this."    The spokesman hoped that the Japanese Government will  earnestly and seriously treat the issue with a view to safeguard  bilateral relations.</p>

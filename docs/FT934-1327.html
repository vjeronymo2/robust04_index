			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / IRA prisoners hold a key to peace progress As the IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, deliberate their response to last week's peace initiative by the British and Irish governments, the 700 IRA prisoners held in jails around the world are likely to play a pivotal role in the acceptance or rejection of the initiative by the republican movement. The fact that the republican movement refers to them as 'prisoners of war' is indicative of the important role Sinn Fein and the IRA expect their release to play in any peace settlement. If the 'war' is declared over, then the logic from their perspective is that all prisoners captured in that 'war' should be released. A Sinn Fein spokesman said at the weekend: 'Prisoners are obviously one of the issues that would have to be addressed if there is to be a meaningful peace process.' He added that the issue of loyalist prisoners - of whom there also 700, mainly in Ulster jails - would be of equal importance to the loyalist paramilitary groups. Mr Danny Morrison, a former publicity officer for Sinn Fein who is serving an eight-year sentence for unlawful imprisonment, is one of the key figures in the prisons directly responsible for organising debates and discussions among IRA prisoners on the peace initiative. In his column published in Republican News, the nationalist newspaper, he has also been one of the leading advocates over the past two years of a peace process and of reaching an accommodation with the unionists. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said last week that there would be no amnesty for paramilitary prisoners. This does not, however, rule out a case-by-case review and the possibility of remission being granted by the attorney-general. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed that the issue of the prisoners in the UK and the republic would be approached 'with flexibility'. He said that the first Anglo-Irish joint Brussels statement in October, which refers to 'doors being opened' in the event of a cessation of violence, implies that the issue of prisoners will be addressed. Most IRA prisoners are serving sentences of 15 years or more, according to Sinn Fein. A total of 90 of the 700 are serving life sentences, mostly for murder. Many of the rest are serving sentences for possession of firearms or explosives. In Northern Ireland someone with a firearm is likely to be charged with 'possession with intent', which carries a much heavier sentence than 'possession' alone. Of the 700, 350 are held in the high-security Maze/Long Kesh prison in Northern Ireland. A further 260 are held in other prisons in the province, some of these being prisoners on remand. About 55 prisoners are held in Portlaoise prison in the Republic of Ireland and a further 30 are held in mainland Britain. Twelve are imprisoned in the US and continental Europe. In the republic four prisoners are serving the maximum sentence of 40 years, an uncommutable sentence except through presidential intervention. This week 440 prisoners from Northern Ireland's jails will be given a seven  -day Christmas release on parole. Significantly, 95 will be prisoners serving life sentences for 'terrorist-related offences', according to the Northern Ireland Office. Sinn Fein said that about 60 would be from the IRA. Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein spokesman, said: 'Those in prison would not have a veto over the people on the outside. 'At this stage though, we are all moving on the same track.'</p>

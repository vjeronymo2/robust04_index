The September 21 FR notice contained proposed amendments regarding acquisitions to be issued through SBA's 8(a) Program and regarding procedures when using GSA's nonmandatory schedule contracts. The December 7 FR notice contained other miscellaneous changes as noted in the Summary above, including provisions regarding the use by one agency of another agency's contracts for FIP resources. Changes in the December 7 FR notice regarding nonmandatory schedules, the Federal IRM Review Program, and the use of other agency contracts (except for contracts and services provided by GSA/IRMS) will be covered in a separate amendment. To expedite issuance, all other amendments are combined in this final rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) All comments were considered and, where possible, incorporated into the final rule. While most of the comments were resolved in the final amendment, a few comments could not be fully accommodated. Also, in an effort to keep regulations to a minimum, where a subject is already covered, additional provisions will not be included. Major comments that will not be reflected in the amendment are addressed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Requests were made for explanations as to when justifications for specific make and model and for other than full and open competition are required for 8(a) contracts. FIRMR &sect;201&hyph;39.601 already requires a justification for specific make and model that applies to all acquisitions, including 8(a) acquisitions. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contains rules governing documentation for SBA's 8(a) Program contracts. Additional FIRMR provisions are not required, but this does not preclude GSA from asking for supporting documentation in specific cases when SBA's 8(a) Program is used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) There were requests to include provisions requiring that agencies be informed of the scope and manner of GSA reviews and that would have the effect of regulating the timing of reviews. These changes are not desirable in view of the changing nature of the reviews program and since agencies are now notified of pending reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Suggestions that agencies, not GSA, make determinations regarding FTS2000 exceptions were not accepted because of GSA's statutory responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Suggestions that were not particularly relevant to the published notices were not addressed in this amendment, but will be reviewed for future bulletins or FIRMR changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Explanations of the changes made by this amendment are shown below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Various sections of the FIRMR are amended to update GSA offices and symbols. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) FIRMR part 201&hyph;4 is amended to change the definition of ``performance validation'' to reflect that benchmarking is not the only method of validation. FIRMR Bulletin C&hyph;4 is also being revised to reflect this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

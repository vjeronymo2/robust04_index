			<p>BFN     [Text] On 21 April, Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), touched on the issue of Japan's bid for a  permanent seat in the UN Security Council [UNSC], and said:  "There are various opinions in Japan, but I feel it is natural  for Japan to be in the UNSC. This view has become widespread  within the United Nations. Regarding Japan's contributions,  however, it would be difficult for Japan to feel it is actually  making contributions unless it actually participates in UN  activities." Ogata, who is temporarily back in Japan, made the  comments in response to a question by an ASASHI SHIMBUN  reporter. She added: "It is desired that Japan participate in  activities in diverse ways, whether it be refugee problems or  development assistance programs. What is important is a  willingness to actively contribute in areas where Japan can do  its best."</p>

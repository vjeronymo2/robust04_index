The venture may include additional companies, independent research organizations, universities, and/or government laboratories which may or may not contribute funds to the project and perform research and development. An independent research organization may perform administrative tasks on behalf of an industry-led joint research and development venture, such as handling receipts and disbursements of funds and making antitrust filings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> intellectual property  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means an invention patentable under title 35, United States Code, or any patent on such an invention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

A cost may not be allocated to an award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been assigned to an award as a direct cost. Because of diverse characteristics and accounting practices it is not possible to specify the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs include general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, maintenance, library expenses, and accounting. ATP shall interpret indirect costs in accordance with 48 CFR part 31 or OMB Circular A&hyph;122, Attachment C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

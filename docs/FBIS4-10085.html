			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Measures Against Corruption"] </F>   [Text] It is undeniable that all sectors agree it is  necessary to fight corruption. Yet, when it comes to making a  decision on concrete measures, there is no more unanimity.  While some people emphasize the legal side of the matter,  advocating the use of laws to fight this scourge, others  emphasize the ethical side, advocating the teaching of  principles to people.    The truth is that both are right. A society without  sufficient legal instruments, both for preventing and for  sanctioning corruption, will have little success in the fight  against it. Yet it is also true that people without principles  are more likely to engage in practices leading to the unethical  and illegal obtaining of wealth.    Within this context, it is highly positive that the first  "heated debate" at the Chamber of Deputies focused on the search  for feasible mechanisms for controlling this scourge. Because  even though Chile has traditionally observed the law and the  standards of morality, there are indications that the corruption  wave affecting other countries might also spread to Chile.    An outstanding point in the broad debate on the subject was  the need to strengthen the structure and functions of control  organs. Proposals were made to expedite and modernize the  procedures of the Office of the Comptroller General of the  Republic and to expand the supervisory duties of the Council for  the Defense of the State and of the Chamber of Deputies.    A proposal was also made to install an Ombudsman [preceding  word in English], or people's defender, and a Superintendency of  State-Run Companies. Within the private sector it was proposed  to impose sanctions against the illegal obtaining of wealth and  the engagement of employees in crimes against the state [delitos  funcionarios]. It was also proposed to reestablish the power  that professional associations had for sanctioning ethical  violations.    The government is sponsoring an interesting initiative,  which  considers the possibility of creating a top-level commission for  proposing the necessary legal amendments to prevent fraud in all  public sector organs.    This initiative, which would in practice call for creation  of  a National Commission Against Corruption similar to the  commission that will be created for fighting poverty, has the  advantage that all sectors of the country will be represented in  it. In fact, all Chileans should obviously engage in the fight  against this scourge, which is the main threat that jeopardizes  a democracy.    In sum, there is pressing need for promptly designing an  appropriate strategy for fighting this fearful phenomenon. Only  in this way will our action reflect our words.</p>

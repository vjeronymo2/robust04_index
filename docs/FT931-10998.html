			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Keating braces himself against chilly wind from the west: State election is crucial to the future of Australia's Labor government MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor Prime Minister, will have his eyes fixed firmly in a westerly direction on Saturday as the results come in from a state election which could make or break his government. The state of Western Australia (WA) is critical to the federal government, which will need to hold most of its six marginal seats in the state to be re-elected. So far, however, the signs are not encouraging. Officially, Mr Keating played no part in the WA state government's decision to go to the polls three months before its mandate expires. But no-one doubts that Dr Carmen Lawrence, the state's Labor premier, called an early poll partly to help clear the decks for a federal election expected on April 3. Labor's strategy is to give WA voters a chance to vent their anger against the party in the state election, in the hope that the faithful will return to the fold in the federal poll. Dr Lawrence, who in 1990 became Australia's first female state premier, has tried to focus voters' attention on traditional Labor issues such as education, health and social justice. But she has found it impossible to distance herself or her party from the so-called WA Inc scandal, which has fascinated Western Australians for the last five years. A government-appointed royal commission reported late last year that the normal processes of democratic government had virtually broken down under Mr Brian Burke, who took the WA Labor party to power in the state in 1983, and his successor, Mr Peter Dowding. Their intention was to build a partnership with local business to encourage economic growth and provide finance for ambitious social programmes. The reality, the commission found, was a network of slush funds, backdoor deals kept hidden from parliament, and 'the secret purchase of political influence'. Satchels stuffed with cash were kept in ministers' offices, political cronies were appointed to highly paid public service jobs, and the commission also found evidence of bribery. The roller coaster crashed in 1990 when a desperate state cabinet replaced Mr Dowding with Dr Lawrence, one of the few state Labor leaders not implicated in the scandal. Several local businessmen have since been convicted of offences related to the scandal, and both Mr Burke and Mr Dowding face criminal charges. Mr Burke's trial is scheduled to begin two days after the election. Surprisingly, Dr Lawrence was given a breathing space by the state's conservative opposition parties, which bickered their way to defeat in the last two elections. However, the Liberal Party and the National Party agreed in November to unite under the leadership of Mr Richard Court, the recently elected Liberal leader and son of a former Liberal premier. Mr Court is no keener to discuss the details of WA Inc than Dr Lawrence, mainly because another former Liberal premier is alleged to have accepted ADollars 25,000 (Pounds 11,160) to help Alan Bond's Bond Corporation win planning permission for a hotel project. But he has successfully limited the damage to the conservative coalition by concentrating on promises to clean up the public service and restore probity to government. 'The royal commission showed that Labor had acted illegally and improperly,' he says. 'They were always prone to put their own political interests ahead of the interests of the people of WA, and Labor voters feel betrayed by that.' Unfortunately for Dr Lawrence, the only other significant issue in the election is the state economy, which grew significantly faster than the rest of Australia in the 1980s, but has slowed in the last two years. Labor is forecasting growth of 4 per cent this year, but the positive message is being ignored by voters who are more concerned about unemployment, currently at 11.1 per cent. The state government's growing desperation was underlined on Monday, when Dr Lawrence suddenly agreed to a televised debate with Mr Court. The debate provided little new information, but Mr Court was clearly the winner because the premier was unable to dent his air of assurance. Opinion polls give the conservatives a state-wide lead of up to 11 points, which would be sufficient for a landslide victory if translated into votes on Saturday. However, even a uniform swing of 1 per cent would be enough to give the conservatives the two seats they require to form a government, while a comparatively modest swing of 4 per cent would cost Labor 12 seats. The result is that Western Australia is almost certain to become the third Labor domino to fall in the last year, following Tasmania and Victoria into the conservative camp. The best Mr Keating can hope for is a narrow conservative victory, followed by a return to the fold by Labor voters in the federal election. But precedent suggests that even this scenario is optimistic.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon warns of extra provisions for bond affair SALOMON INC, the New York securities house, warned yesterday it expected to make new provisions, on top of the Dollars 200m already set aside, to cover a settlement with the US government of last year's bond trading scandal. The announcement came as it reported a drop in first-quarter net income  - from Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.30 a share, to Dollars 190m, or Dollars 1.51 a share - as repercussions from the scandal continued to drag down its earnings. Salomon reserved Dollars 200m in the third quarter of last year to cover the likely fines, damages and other costs of settling the bond scandal with government regulatory authorities and private parties suing the firm. It said yesterday that although the outcome of its negotiations with the government was uncertain, it believed any agreed resolution would require an additional charge, to be taken after the first quarter. However, it did not expect this charge to 'adversely affect the long-term economic prospects of the company'. Salomon's lawyers have been discussing a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government agency investigating the bond scandal, since February. The SEC has faced strong pressure from Congress to impose a large fine on the firm, which has admitted to falsifying bids in Treasury bond auctions. Salomon gave no indication when a settlement might be reached. Uncertainty over the outcome has made many clients wary of giving business to Salomon in sensitive areas such as investment banking and the underwriting of new issues of equity. This was reflected in its first-quarter earnings decline, which contrasted sharply with the record income figures reported by several Wall Street rivals, which have been enjoying a boom in the issuance of new corporate equity and debt. Salomon Brothers, the group's securities arm, reported earnings before tax of Dollars 374m, down 26 per cent from the Dollars 503m reported a year ago. However, the firm said its securities trading and debt underwriting results were 'highly satisfactory'. Phibro Energy, its oil subsidiary, reported a pre-tax loss of Dollars 30m, compared with profits of Dollars 5m a year ago, due to weak demand for crude oil and refined products, narrow refining margins and relatively low price volatility. It also warned it might be unable to recover the Dollars 116m it has invested in Russian oil development and production joint ventures, due to unfavourable Russian taxes and pipeline tariffs, as well as unpaid balances due from various Russian entities. Nevertheless, analysts were pleasantly surprised by the cost-cutting achieved by the new management team at Salomon, headed by chairman Mr Warren Buffett. It has radically overhauled its management systems and pay structures since last autumn. Non-interest expenses in the quarter totalled Dollars 584m, compared with Dollars 696m a year ago, while revenue net of interest expense dropped from Dollars 1.18bn to Dollars 915m. Mr Perrin Long, analyst with First of Michigan, said the cost reduction figures were 'quite positive for the future'. He said any additional provisions for the scandal were 'highly unlikely to significantly impair Salomon's operating ability'.</p>

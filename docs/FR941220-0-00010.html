Production Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With this amendment, EPA allocates to companies that produced methyl bromide in 1991 production up to 10 percent of their baseline allowances for Article 5 countries for the control periods starting January 1, 1994, and ending before January 1, 2001. EPA is setting the level at 10 percent to be consistent with Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol, and to be consistent with the approach used for all Class I controlled substances except for Group VII, the hydrobromofluorocarbons (no additional production for Article 5 countries is granted under the Protocol for these chemicals.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. Use of 1994 Potential Production Allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received a comment that requests a change in the procedures for the use of 1994 production allowances and/or consumption allowances for methyl bromide exports to Article 5 countries. The commenter makes two proposals to rectify the granting of potential production allowances late in the 1994 control period. The commenter requests that companies be able to use production allowances converted from 1994 potential production allowances for six months into 1995. As a less desirable alternative, the commenter suggests that, ``production using the converted potential production allowances could occur in the 1994 control period without the requirement that consumption allowances be available at the time of production.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees with the suggestions for rectifying the late granting of potential production allowances in 1994 because the Protocol establishes strict limits on production for Parties to the Protocol for each control period. Therefore, EPA may not alter the definition of a control period, nor exceed the limits on production for a control period. EPA's regulations lay out a system for allocating production and consumption allowances in accordance with the Protocol to limit production and importation within control periods. Both production allowances and consumption allowances are needed simultaneously, to be able to produce within a control period. To extend the use of allowances from one control period into the following control period would be a violation of the United States commitments under the Montreal Protocol to limit production. EPA will also not allow production without consumption allowances. This would set an unacceptable precedent that is contrary to existing regulatory requirements and the Protocol. EPA suggests that the companies continue to apply for consumption allowances for exports to Article 5 countries and use these to produce in conjunction with existing production allowances and those requested for conversion from potential production allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter added that the time taken to grant the conversion of potential production allowances to production allowances ``requires at least 3 weeks after the documentation is submitted to EPA.'' EPA believes that the average time taken to process a request to convert is five days and almost never exceeds ten working days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

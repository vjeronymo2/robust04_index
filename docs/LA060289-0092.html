			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDI-CAL MOVES TO ENCOURAGE MORE PRIVATE OBSTETRIC SERVICES  </P> <P> In the hopes of encouraging more private obstetricians to treat low-income  pregnant women, state Medi-Cal officials agreed in court documents filed  Thursday to adhere to a higher payment rate for doctors and to speed the  payment of their claims.  </P> <P> A coalition of legal aid attorneys negotiated the settlement to resolve a  class-action lawsuit they filed 18 months ago on behalf of thousands of  low-income women statewide who were unable to find private doctors to care for  them during their pregnancy. In more than a dozen counties across the state,  not a single obstetrician would treat pregnant women on Medi-Cal, the attorneys  charged.  </P> <P> "I hope this marks the turning point in the decline of obstetrical services to  these under-served women and will help bring back the many doctors who have  dropped out of Medi-Cal," said Dr. Benson Harer, chairman of the California  district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  </P> <P> Low reimbursement rates and a cumbersome claims process have triggered a "mass  exit" of obstetricians from the Medi-Cal program that insures about 100,000  pregnant women annually, said Standley Dorn, one of the attorneys who brought  the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Between 1985 and 1987, when the lawsuit was filed, there was a 15% decline in  the number of private physicians in Los Angeles County who provided obstetrical  care for Medi-Cal women. There were also declines of 27% in Sacramento County,  12% in San Diego County and 19% in Santa Clara County, according to attorney  Robert Newman, who also represented the women in the suit.  </P> <P> One plaintiff in the lawsuit, a pregnant Fullerton woman insured by Medi-Cal,  claims to have called 10 obstetricians in her community and found that none of  them accepted Medi-Cal. She charged that when she went in search of a doctor at  an Orange County hospital, she was told that none of the obstetricians with  admitting privileges there accepted Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the settlement, which will not be final until September when  it is scheduled to be approved by a federal district judge in Sacramento, state  health officials agreed to speed the processing of doctors' claims, promising  to pay 90% of them within 25 days and 99% within 85 days. Also, state health  officials will set up toll-free telephone lines to answer doctors' questions,  and physicians will be able to instantly confirm a patient's Medi-Cal  eligibility through a computerized telephone verification system.  </P> <P> Since the lawsuit was filed, the state has gradually increased payments to  doctors for prenatal care, delivery and postpartum care from $650 to more than  $1,000. The settlement commits the state to continue this rate.  </P> <P> State Deputy Health Services Director John Rodriguez said the settlement  'represents "a lot of movement and a lot of progress. . . . I'm glad we got it  settled."  </P> <P> "It's now possible for obstetricians . . . to give care and break even," Dorn  said.  </P> <P> Wendy Lazarus, with Children Now, a nonprofit, children's rights organization,  hailed the settlement's provisions as "a really hopeful sign" for women and  babies statewide.  </P> <P> She said the most recent state health department statistics for 1986 show that  7.3% of the 480,000 women a year who give birth in California receive late or  no prenatal care. Compared to other states, California ranks 36th in terms of  the percentage of women receiving adequate prenatal care.  </P> <P> Studies have repeatedly shown that spending money on prenatal care is cost  effective because it helps prevent the birth of premature, low-weight infants  who are prone to mental retardation and other handicaps that require costly  medical care.  </P></p>

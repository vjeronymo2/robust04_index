			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Fresh Jewish settlement curbs Israel has ordered further curbs on Jewish settlement of occupied Arab lands ahead of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's trip to the US, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The Lands authority has temporarily frozen land allocation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'It (the freeze) is regarding land allocation and it is temporary until the situation is reviewed,' Mr Amikam Shapiro, of the authority said. State-run Israeli television said the freeze was aimed at preventing settlers from circumventing Mr Rabin's earlier halt of some 6,000 planned government-sponsored housing units by building privately.</p>

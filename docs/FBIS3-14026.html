			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Syed Anwar Ghalib: "Prime Minister Benazir </F> Bhutto's Kashmir Policy"]    [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's concern about  Kashmir has doubled now because of the problems in  Kashmir-occupied India and the increased skirmishes between  Kashmiri freedom fighters and Indian troops. That is why she has  announced a nationwide government holiday on 5 February to show  support for the armed efforts of the freedom fighters in  Kashmir. By showing full government support, she has shown  Pakistani Government's moral, political, diplomatic, and native  unity with Kashmir. She has thus stimulated the whole nation  against India so that India can be embarrassed, disgraced, and  humiliated in front of the whole world. The prime minister of  Pakistan had shown unprecedented softness, leniency, pragmatism,  and goodwill about Kashmir during Rajiv Gandhi's government.  This ended during V.P. Singh's time when Mr. Mohan Singh was  appointed the governor. Benazir herself had ended this approach  in the Pakistan memory tent during the golden jubilee  celebration of the Lahore Resolution. This was her most famous  government-sponsored rally. Benazir Bhutto had decided the PPP  policy and political action related to Kashmir on the advice of  ISI and high military officers. She has thus made the anti-India  politics of fundamentalists and religious fanatics ineffective  among the people. The young prime minister using her quick wit  has become the leader of the hot-blooded people who want to  raise Pakistan's flag on Delhi. The United States and India  still consider her more liberal than Nawaz Sharif. However, the  intensity of her attitude towards Kashmir and India will make  her more acceptable to the United States as compared to Mohammed  Nawaz Sharif. The prime minister's belief is based on her late  father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's declaration that if necessary  Pakistan will fight with India for a thousand years. Mrs.  Benazir Bhutto, to counter the great internal pressure over  Kashmir, has decided to follow the policy of going with the  people. The protest strike of 5 February actually declares her  government's intention to make Kashmir an international issue at  any cost and will use its all resources to this end. Benazir  Bhutto's appeal asking people to observe a strike for Kashmir  has been so strong and effective that even her chief opponent  Mian Nawaz Mohammed Sharif has announced his unconditional  support for her. He has announced his decision to cooperate with  the government to help make the government's strike plans  against India successful. This will be the second most important  strike after the Indira-Abdullah pact in which the whole  government machinery will be joined by the joint opposition  groups. After the 5 February strike and using it as a  referendum, the government will find it easier to present a bill  to nullify the Shimla pact in the Parliament. No internal or  foreign efforts can be made to ask for Kashmir's total  separation from India, its joining Pakistan, or becoming  independent as long as the Shimla pact is there. That is why  Benazir Bhutto has decided to follow her new policy.  *</p>

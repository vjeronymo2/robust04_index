			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS FAILING, CHANCELLOR SAYS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: HEAD OF 107 CAMPUSES STATEWIDE COMPLAINS THAT HE'S HAMSTRUNG BY  RULES AND BUREAUCRACY.  </P> <P> After two years as chancellor of the California community colleges -- the  largest higher education system in the nation -- David Mertes has concluded  that the system won't work unless he and his central office staff are given  more authority.  </P> <P> "I've attempted for two years to try to make this system work," Mertes said in  a recent interview at his downtown Sacramento office. "But, frankly, I've come  to the conclusion that unless the community colleges are allowed greater leeway  to conduct their own affairs, we'll never be an effective system."  </P> <P> Mertes, 60, is a 20-year veteran of California community college  administration. He was picked for the chancellor's job in 1988 because he knew  the system well and because of his reputation as a patient, low-key mediator.  If anyone could weave the 107 separate two-year campuses into a coherent  system, it was thought, Mertes could.  </P> <P> But the chancellor said he has been hamstrung by state regulations and  bureaucratic behavior.  </P> <P> "We are treated like a small state agency," Mertes said. "There is just no  understanding that this small office . . . represents the largest higher  education system in the nation."  </P> <P> The problem, he said, is that a number of agencies have some say over how the  system is run. For example:  </P> <P> * The Department of Personnel Administration sets the salaries for top  positions in the chancellor's office, and Mertes says they are not high enough  to attract top candidates.  </P> <P> * The state Department of Finance must approve any reorganization of the  236-person central staff.  </P> <P> * The Department of Personnel Administration has final say over proposals to  move people on the central staff from one job to another. "I can't even  transfer a secretary," Mertes said.  </P> <P> * The Department of Finance must approve spending priorities that are set by  Mertes and the system's Board of Governors for the 1.4-million-student system.  The state agency frequently makes major changes in these spending plans, Mertes  said.  </P> <P> Many agree with Mertes that such actions make it virtually impossible to devise  systemwide programs and policies.  </P> <P> "The toughest system to lead is the one with the most restraints," said a  Sacramento higher education observer who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Unlike the University of California, which has constitutional autonomy, or even  the California State University system, which operates with considerable  independence, the community colleges have remained largely under the thumb of  the Legislature and the state agencies.  </P> <P> Division of authority has been a problem ever since the systemwide Board of  Governors and chancellor's office were established in 1967.  </P> <P> There are 71 community college districts. The largest college, with an  enrollment of 30,877, is Mt. San Antonio in Walnut; the smallest, with an  enrollment of 1,392, is Feather River in Quincy. Each district has its own  elected governing board, which approves academic and vocational programs,  handles labor relations and sets general standards.  </P> <P> Mertes and the Board of Governors monitor the academic and financial  performance of each college, gather systemwide information for the governor and  the Legislature and, most important, distribute state funds, which account for  65% of all community college financing. However, they have relatively little  authority and must depend heavily on persuasion to make systemwide policies  work effectively.  </P> <P> Joshua Smith, Mertes' predecessor, left three years ago with a blast at the  state for not giving him enough authority to do his job.  </P> <P> The next year, major legislation was enacted, and signed by Gov. George  Deukmejian, to clarify the role of the chancellor and the Board of Governors,  provide more money for community colleges and help them with a variety of  academic improvements.  </P> <P> While local colleges benefited, Mertes said, little was done for the central  office or the system as a whole. "What was in the bill to implement a system  was very minimal. It was just Band-Aids," he said.  </P> <P> But some critics blame Mertes for not making a successful transition from  running a community college district (he was chancellor of the three-campus Los  Rios district in Sacramento) to running a state agency.  </P> <P> "He has a lot of people who know what's going on in the community colleges but  hardly anybody who knows what goes on here," said Robert Harris, who is in  charge of education programs in the Department of Finance.  </P> <P> However, many others agree that Mertes faces formidable obstacles.  </P> <P> Mertes is especially irritated because he has not been able to fill six top  central office jobs that were exempted from civil service regulations by the  1988 legislation.  </P> <P> Mertes (who makes $101,000 a year) wants to pay his chief deputy $107,888, but  the Department of Personnel Administration has approved only $86,533.  </P> <P> "Cabinet secretaries -- the top jobs in state government -- pay only a little  more than $101,000 a year," said David Tirapelle, the department director.  "We've been very reluctant to pay community college officials more than state  agency heads."  </P> <P> Mertes has filled top systemwide jobs with administrators temporarily imported  from local two-year campuses, who retain their local salaries, benefits and job  security. They stay for a year or so, then return to their home campuses.  </P> <P> Harris said the Department of Finance has insisted that such  "interjurisdictional exchanges" be terminated by the end of next year and that  the jobs be filled on a permanent basis at salaries agreed to by the colleges  and the Department of Personnel Administration.  </P> <P> Harris also said the Department of Finance would be glad to approve a  reorganization plan for the chancellor's office "if he would just give us a  plan. We ask him for a plan and we get a set of 'options.' We don't want  options; we want to know what they plan to do, and they can't seem to make up  their minds." Harris said he thought Mertes "had the best shot" of any of the  people who have held the chancellor's job "of making the system work."  </P> <P> Harris conceded that the Legislature and state agencies like his pay much  closer attention to the community college systemwide office than they do to the  University of California or the California State University and that "must be  frustrating" to Mertes.  </P> <P> It is so frustrating that Mertes next year will ask California's new governor  and the Legislature for a "fundamental structural change" to grant more  authority to the chancellor and Board of Governors.  </P> <P> "This will only be a system when the priorities are set by the system office  and not by other agencies," Mertes said.  </P></p>

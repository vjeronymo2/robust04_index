			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGNER RUBEN PANIS FOUND SLAIN;  </P> <P> FLAMBOYANT CLOTHIER IS STRANGLED IN HIS WILSHIRE-AREA HOME  </P> <P> Ruben Panis, a high-priced fashion designer who outfitted the likes of Zsa Zsa  Gabor and Mayor Tom Bradley's wife, Ethel, in his signature beadwork evening  gowns, was found strangled in his two-story Wilshire District home Friday  morning, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Family members discovered Panis, 57, in the master bedroom shortly after 9 a.m.  There was no evidence of forced entry into the Spanish-style house on South  Tremaine Avenue, according to Wilshire Division Detective Dan Andrews.  </P> <P> Panis' cars, a 1977 Mercedes-Benz 450 SL and a 1988 Honda Civic, were missing  from his garage and Andrews said the cars represented the only leads in the  case. Detectives were trying to determine whether other items were stolen from  Panis' residence.  </P> <P> "The house is a very nice residence with a lot of antique furniture and  artwork," Andrews said. "We really haven't had an opportunity to inventory it .  . . but the house didn't look disturbed."  </P> <P> Panis' friends on Friday were shocked by news of his death. The flamboyant  designer was described as a jovial and generous man who enjoyed traveling to  Mexico and socializing with the Hollywood stars and society matrons who  patronized his exclusive evening wear shops.  </P> <P> "Everybody loved him," said Bill Sarris, a fellow designer and longtime friend.  "He was a joy to be around. . . . I can't imagine anyone not liking him or  wanting to harm him."  </P> <P> At the same time however, those close to Panis said it was common knowledge in  fashion circles that he was experiencing financial difficulties. His Melrose  Avenue dress shop was seized by the Internal Revenue Service last week for  delinquent taxes. An IRS spokeswoman said that Panis owed about $50,000 in  employment taxes dating back to early 1988.  </P> <P> Employees at his other shop in downtown Los Angeles refused to discuss the  designer on Friday. But a Melrose merchant said Panis' employees were unaware  of the closure until they showed up for work and found the doors locked and IRS  seizure notices posted on the building.  </P> <P> One friend, who asked not to be identified, said Panis had lost interest in the  business he spent 20 years building and had spent most of his time traveling  during the last two years.  </P> <P> "He went from being a workaholic to simply not caring," the friend said. "And  there was no reason for it, because his business had been very successful. His  dresses were expensive."  </P> <P> Panis, who was born in Manila, got his start designing costumes in Las Vegas.  Friends said he moved to Los Angeles about 20 years ago, where he established  himself as a top-flight local designer able to command $900 to $5,000 for his  original creations.  </P> <P> His clothes could be found at exclusive stores such as I. Magnin in the past,  but he sold mostly out of his design shops. Commenting on his typical clients,  Panis once said they were "at least age 50 and rich."  </P> <P> Panis' clients included both Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, as well as actress Rhonda  Fleming.  </P> <P> Sidoione, owner of Sidoione, a vintage clothing shop next door to Panis'  Melrose studio, said: "I've seen Zsa Zsa Gabor's Rolls-Royce parked in front of  here many times."  </P> <P> One of Panis' most loyal customers was Ethel Bradley, who named him her dress  designer for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Panis had recently served  on the city's Cultural Heritage Commission.  </P> <P> "This is a shocking thing," said Mayor Bradley, who had appointed him to the  commission. "Ruben Panis was a gentle, kind man."  </P></p>

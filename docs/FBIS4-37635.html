			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan and Ra'fit Yahya from </F> Islamabad and by 'Abdallah al-Haj from Jeddah: "Pakistan Foreign  Minister to Saudi Arabia With Proposal on Afghan Crisis"]    [Text] Developments on the Afghan front accelerated  yesterday, on the eve of the end of President Borhanoddin  Rabbani's term. Pakistan has undertaken a new initiative to  prevent a likely deterioration in the situation, now that  opponents to Rabbani have threatened to launch a new campaign to  isolate him should he insist upon retaining his position after  the 28th of this month. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ali arrives in Saudi Arabia today for talks on this subject with  Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal.    In a major parallel development, Afghani Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar held a meeting yesterday at his office south  of Kabul, with the ruler of the province of Herat, Esma'il Khan,  after which the two sides agreed to launch an initiative to form  a government of national unity within 12 days of the end of the  Afghani president's term. Ismail Khan left in the evening for  the capital to meet with Rabbani and to inform him of the  initiative that would open the major roads to Kabul after  verifying a ceasefire in its suburbs.    Informed sources in Islamabad report that the initiative of  Ismail Khan, well-known for his impartiality, which has  dispelled the specter of war from his regions, enjoys Pakistani  support. The initiative stipulates the participation of all the  mojahedin parties in the interim government, which will organize  general elections as early as possible and disqualify the  (formerly communist) militias from the new formula for governing.    Moderate Afghani sources did not rule out that the Pakistani  foreign minister would show his support for the initiative,  especially as Hekmatyar is a party to it, because of the support  Islamabad still provides him. Afghani sources indicated the  importance of the position stated by the Pakistani Foreign  Ministry spokesman Akram Zaki, who emphasized the need for the  Afghani president to stick to the agreement, in terms of the  duration of his term, especially as the countries affected by  the Afghani situation have backed the agreement.    Informed sources in Islamabad have told AL-HAYAH that the  Pakistani minister will bring this subject up for discussion in  his meeting with Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. The same sources added  that the Pakistani minister would emphasize, in the meeting with  his Saudi counterpart, Islamabad's insistence that all Saudi and  Islamic humanitarian aid to Afganistan be routed through its  Pakistan's territory.    They thought it likely that this position would be the focus  of debate among Afghani ranks, especially as Afghan officials  believe that Kabul and Herat are capable of taking delivery of  the aid from the Muslim world. Officials believe that the direct  delivery of aid to Afghanistan will be of help in the speed and  distribution to the needy, and in helping it to reach specific  sites.    The Pakistani minister will discuss the efforts being made  to  achieve total reconciliation among the mojahedin leaders, with  the officials he will meet in Saudi Arabia.    Afghani Government sources told AL-HAYAH that Saudi Arabia  is  inclined to expand the framework of participation for Afghan  leaders in decisions to ensure its implementation. At the same  time, Pakistan still sees Hekmatyar as the major player, and  perhaps the only one, on the Afghan scene. This has influenced  the positions of numerous Muslim countries who criticize the  imposition of certain figures on the Afghan scene.    The fear of observers in a number of capitals affected by  the  Afghan question is that Pakistan will go too far in its pressure  on Rabbani and its support for Hekmatyar, particularly if Ismail  Khan fails to persuade the Afghani president to accept what the  ruler of Herat and prime minister have agreed to.    An informed Pakistani source told AL-HAYAH that the  possibility for holding a peace conference in Islamabad, and the  formation of a transitional government in Kabul, would be among  the 10 points the Pakistani foreign minister would discuss with  Saudi officials. The source said that the proposed peace  conference would be along the lines of the Islamabad conference  held in March of last year.    The same source indicated that the Pakistani proposal was  the  same one Hekmatyar had advanced in a press conference held in  Jalalabad (eastern Afghanistan) last Friday [10 June], and said  it was a means for finding a comprehensive solution to the  Afghan question.  <H5>  Not Comfortable </H5>   The Pakistani source reaffirmed that his country is not  comfortable with the Afghani president's position, that he would  remain in power until the end of this year, according to  resolutions adopted by a local consultative council held at his  invitation two years ago. In the press conference the day before  yesterday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman indicated  that the Pakistani foreign minister would go to Jeddah to meet  with the secretary general of the Islamic Conference  Organization, Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, to discuss the Pakistani  proposals, and would then proceed to Iran with the same purpose.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs trawl for pearls of wisdom - How backbench members use written questions IT IS among the most potent weapons in every backbencher's arsenal. But, as Iraqgate has underlined, it is best deployed with foresight and with stealth. The written question is the mechanism through which the most humble MP can most frequently demand at least a scintilla of ministerial attention. Although they get relatively few opportunities to speak in parliamentary debates or to question ministers face-to-face in the Commons chamber, backbenchers can fire off written questions like rounds from a Gatling gun. Literally tens of thousands are tabled every year on subjects ranging from the central tenets of foreign and economic policy to the prevalence of fish-eating ducks in Northern Ireland. The 'written question champ' in the 1991-92 parliamentary session was Mr Paul Flynn, the bearded and garrulous Labour MP for Newport West, with a personal quota of 441. That statistic emerged - where else? - in a written answer. But as new MPs quickly learn, they will seldom glean anything worthwhile from simply jotting down the first question that comes into their head and tabling it. Squadrons of civil servants are used by government departments to field questions as they come in, to analyse them for pitfalls and to draft a suggested response or a menu of options. Extracting pearls of wisdom usually entails outwitting these ministerial 'minders'. If all else fails, departments can fall back on tried and trusted obstructive formulae such as: 'This information is not centrally held'; or 'This information can only be supplied at disproportionate cost.' Past masters of the question-poser's art such as Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for Linlithgow, speak of the need for extreme tenacity if an answer of substance is to be elicited on a sensitive subject area. 'Part of the reason (my questions) are effective is that I then use them in oral debate,' Mr Dalyell says. Experienced backbenchers will submit written questions to get a ministerial comment 'on the record'. Some of the criticism the government has endured as the arms-to-Iraq saga has unfolded has been on the basis of written answers that seemed unremarkable at the time that they were tabled. Some of the previously classified documents released during the Matrix Churchill trial appear to consist of civil servants' advice to ministers and others regarding specific written questions. One of the documents deals with a question tabled in November 1989 by Labour's Ms Marjorie Mowlam, asking what investigations the Department of Trade and Industry had undertaken into Matrix Churchill and the 'possibility' that it was supplying parts to Iraq 'which could be used in ballistic missile development'. The answer - 'All export licence applications are examined carefully. I have no reason to believe that the company has contravened UK export controls' - was deemed 'a firm reply' by the DTI official who proposed it. It did not spell out - as the official's background comments made clear - that some of Matrix's export licence applications to ship products to Iraq had been 'the subject of Ministerial exchanges before licences were granted'. An answer supplied at about the same time to Labour's Mr Dale Campbell-Savours seems to give an even less complete picture of official views on the subject addressed, although it is no doubt factually correct. The question concerned what representations the foreign secretary had received as to 'the activities of Dr Sadel Jawed Kadhum in relation to Iraqi intelligence matters'. The answer by Mr Francis Maude, then foreign office minister - was: 'None.' A page of notes released in the Matrix trial marked 'secret' but whose precise provenance is not clear, refers to 'Mr Campbell-Savours' questions' and notes: 'Circumstantial evidence . . suggests that (Dr Kadhum) may well have links with Iraqi intelligence activities.' Answers supplied to two further questions by Mr Campbell-Savours asking first whether the foreign office had ever given anyone else information about Dr Kadhum's relationship with Iraqi intelligence and second whether it had ever met him to discuss Iraqi intelligence matters were respectively 'No' and 'No.'</p>

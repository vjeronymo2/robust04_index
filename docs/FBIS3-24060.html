			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Veniamin Nikolayevich Potapov, chairman of </F> the Smolensk city executive committee of the CPRF [Communist  Party of the Russian Federation], conducted by P. Privalov: "The  Salvation of Russia Stands Above Differences of Opinion"]    [Text]    [Begin boxed material]    After the elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation, a bold expression became popular: "The second coming  of the communists." For many, the success of the CPRF in the  elections turned out to be perhaps no less unexpected than the  triumph of the party of Zhirinovskiy. As we know, the CPRF  collected 14.78 percent of the votes cast in the election in the  Smolensk region. Although this was less than half of what the  LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] got, nevertheless--it  is the second result. What do the communists themselves think of  this? Our correspondent posed this question to the chairman of  the Smolensk city executive committee of the CPRF, Veniamin  Nikolayevich Potapov.    [End boxed material]    [Potapov] First of all, I believe that most of them who did  not approve of the decision of Zyuganov's party regarding  participation in the elections were convinced that we were  right. The results of the voting took the ground out from under  the feet of politicians who say that Russia is through with  communism. Real prerequisites have been created for a normal and  fruitful discussion of an ideological character, without  application of labels and insults.    Of course, the "second coming of the communists" is a bit  overstated. Fifteen percent, you must agree, is not all that  much. However, the "Choice of Russia" got even less.  Nevertheless, the entire mass media is at its service: Radio,  television, and SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI. I pick up a random copy of  SN. There is a published sampling of five letters commenting on  the results of the election. Four of the letters are in support  of the president and "Choice of Russia" and one is about the  LDPR. Moreover, the last one is written in such a way that, I  believe, does not want no make anyone want to have anything to  do with the "Zhirinovsky followers." Yet, as experience shows,  it is useless for us to submit our material to SMOLENSKIYE  NOVOSTI.    [Correspondent] Much has been said recently about democracy,  pluralism, freedom of speech, and so forth. How do you explain  the situation which has arisen?    [Potapov] Lenin already explained everything, and very well.  The press and other mass media are always partisan. The always  express the interests of certain classes and social groups. They  are always dependant on the publisher, on bribes, on support, on  the moneybag, etc. Once again we have become convinced of this.    [Correspondent] So, perhaps you should follow Lenin's path  and create your own ISKRA?...    [Potapov] That is easy to say. Today even the major  newspapers, as you know, cannot make ends meet. What can you say  about us, who have no money? It is good that the CPRF is somehow  able to publish NASHA GAZETA in Safonov for certain major events  and campaigns. We print leaflets and distribute party  literature. We see our main task in the propaganda of our views.    [Correspondent] And is this all that the city organization  of  the CPRF is doing today?    [Potapov] We are actively participating in the elections,  supporting our candidates, collecting funds for a memorial to  Terkin... In general, however, it is not easy for us today. It  is not simply that there is a chronic shortage of monetary  funds. We do not even have our own accommodations. Despite  repeated appeals to Mayor M. G. Zysmanov, the city mayor's  office has not considered the fact that we are speaking about a  public organization numbering around 700 members for the present  day, and has not resolved this question. Negotiations are  currently being conducted with the oblast property fund  regarding the question of our leasing accommodations in a  building on Krupskaya Street. For the present, however, the  acceptance of new members and the reregistration of communists  is a practically impossible task: There is nowhere to turn.    [Correspondent] Evidently, this is a common problem for all  local sections of various parties?    [Potapov] I would not say so. In the House of Political  Enlightenment which was built with party funds (currently a  music school), facilities have been allocated for parties whose  members in the Smolensk area may be counted on one's fingers. To  put it mildly, we are encountering a certain prejudice in regard  to the communist party on the part of the authorities. And this  despite the fact that we are being controlled by party card  holders.    [Correspondent] Call them "turncoats," as the readers do in  their letters to the newspaper, and we will put an end to the  subject.    [Potapov] Turncoats--that is too simplified. Just look,  practically all the leaders of the current parties were formerly  members of the CPSU. And how they have scattered! The communist  party has always had, as a minimum, two camps. In one there were  those who said about Russia and the Union, "that country." They  were the destroyers. In the other were the ones who said "our  country," the builders. The struggle between them may be viewed  literally over the entire duration of the party's history. The  most striking example is the debunking of Leo Trotsky's theory  of the permanent revolution. In translation, "permanent  revolution" is continuous destruction. The proponents of this  theory are currently implementing it in practice under the mark  of radical market reforms. Moreover, having brought us out onto  the beaten path of "world civilization," our leaders are  concealing the fact that our crisis is taking place on the basis  of the world crisis. In the Summer of 1992, a conference of  heads of state and governments was held in Buenos Aires, where  the synonymous conclusion was drawn that if world civilization  follows the Western path of development, it will find itself in  a dead end. And why do we need to go there?    [Correspondent] Nevertheless, even within the communist camp  there is no unified opinion regarding an alternative path.    [Potapov] Yes, there are differences of opinion. They are  being manifested also in the Smolensk region. But the city  organization of the CPRF believed and still believes that now is  not the time for interparty, and particularly intraparty,  sorting out. We are open to cooperation with everyone who speaks  out against the shock policy of the current government, for whom  it is not differences of opinion which stand above all else, but  the salvation of Russia. During the electoral campaign, we also  collected signatures in favor of the Russian All-People's Union,  helped the party of the cadets, the "Dignity and Charity"  movement, and certain others. Today we consider our closest  allies to be the Agrarian Party of Russia, the patriotic  movement and the Smolensk Popular Assembly.    [Correspondent] There are rumors circulating about certain  contacts of the CPRF with the party of Zhirinovskiy.    [Potapov] We have not had any dialogue with the LDPR. If  they  agree to it, we, for our part, are not opposed. We may say the  same also of the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. In general,  however, we are more worried today about the problems of the  upcoming elections to the oblast duma and the organs of local  self-government. We are proposing already in the near future to  hold an oblast conference of the CPRF, to hear the report of the  executive organs, to define our pre-electoral platform. We  believe that the results of the December elections could be more  favorable for us if the supreme administrative organ of the  oblast CPRF worked out a preliminary decision on tactics and  candidates. This has not been done. I believe we must learn from  mistakes.</p>

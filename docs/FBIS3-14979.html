			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- At a regular briefing at Ukraine's Ministry  of Foreign Affairs on 1 March, Anton Buteyko, adviser to the  president on international issues, outlined the prospects for  the visit of the Ukrainian delegation headed by President Leonid  Kravchuk to Washington: prospects for cooperation in abolishing  nuclear weapons, introducing economic reform, a Ukrainian  national currency, broadening American investment in the  Ukrainian economy, and so on. "We are talking not about  assistance for Ukraine but about the beginning of normal  economic relations between the two states," Anton Buteyko said.    He declined to name specific figures concerning U.S.  financial participation in Ukrainian economic reforms but  stressed that during the visit to the United States of the  government delegation headed by Roman Shpek, this figure was  adjusted three times. Anton Buteyko stated that relations  between the United States and Ukraine became considerably warmer  following the Ukrainian Supreme Council's definitive  ratification of START I.    He also did not exclude the possibility that ratification  certificates with regard to this treaty will be exchanged during  Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the United States. "Our government  delegation left 24 specific projects with the Americans for them  to consider possible investment in the Ukrainian economy. Above  all these are investments in nuclear energy and conversion of  the military industrial complex.    Consultations are continuing with regard to the  Ukrainian-U.S. charter on cooperation. Anton Buteyko told  journalists that if all the formulations are finally agreed  upon, it will be signed by the presidents of Ukraine and United  States during Leonid Kravchuk's visit.    [Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program Network in Ukrainian at  1500 GMT on 1 Mar 94 adds: "Anton Buteyko, head of the Ukrainian  President's Foreign Issues Service, has deemed as an important  step toward the development of bilateral Ukrainian-U.S.  relations Leonid Kravchuk's official visit to the United States,  scheduled for the beginning of March. Speaking at a Foreign  Ministry briefing, Buteyko provided information on the program  of the visit, pointing out that the latter's primary goal is to  outline the major directions for expanding democratic  cooperation, and to strengthen the positive trends in the  relations between the two countries. Buteyko added that there  are plans to sign a Ukrainian-U.S. charter on partnership,  friendship, and cooperation that would blueprint interstate  cooperation in the immediate future."]</p>

In a letter to the U.S. President on the situation of the  Korean peninsula, representatives of the front said the U.S.  concern over the possibility of "nuclear arms development" by  North Korea was a flamboyant hypocrisy.    The letter said:    "The `nuclear issue' of Korea must be resolved peacefully  only through a fair dialogue, not by pressure, military threat  or economic `sanctions.'    "The U.S. Government and Congress must abandon such  dangerous  games as the provocation of a new war."</p>

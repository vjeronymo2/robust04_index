			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Body Shop Body Shop appears in dire need of one of its famously soothing lotions as it continues to ooze bad trading news. The worrying aspect is that much of its weakness appears particular to itself. Body Shop reported a 2 per cent decline in UK sales in the nine weeks before Christmas; its rival, Boots, increased sales of its comparable Natural Collection range by 30 per cent in its final quarter. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Body Shop's high prices are wildly out of line with those of its competitors. Sales are suffering as a result. In the aberrant 1980s, retailers might have got away with selling high volumes of high margin goods. In the current climate, they are only likely to make their sums add up if they sell high volumes of low margin goods or vice versa. Body Shop can recover. The fundamental business is sound enough. International opportunities are still considerable, while its customer appeal remains strong. Its strategic review may well throw up enough innovative ideas to reshape the business. Nevertheless, the days of extraordinary growth must surely have ended - although the market still does not seem fully to appreciate the fact. At more than 20 times consensus forecast earnings, Body Shop's rating may no longer be extravagant; just plain expensive.</p>

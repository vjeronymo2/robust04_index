			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETARYISM  </P> <P> I am somewhat surprised that none of the glowing reviews of "Working Girl"  bothered to consider the clearly discriminatory bias of this otherwise  innocuous film.  </P> <P> In the film the position of secretary is depicted as one worthy only of  derision and shame, whose only legitimate goal is to be promoted out of it.  With the sole exception of the title role, secretaries are portrayed as overly  cosmeticized bimbos concerned with their hair, nails and coffee breaks rather  than the affairs of the business that employ them.  </P> <P> Tess' best friend, apparently typifying the attitudes of these self-loathing  women, is appalled at the presumption of a secretary trying to rise above her  station.  </P> <P> This portrayal is a reprehensible insult to the professional secretary. This is  an important and valuable business position with its own set of standards,  opportunities and contributions to an overall enterprise. Done incorrectly, it  can undermine an otherwise productive and well-run business. Done well, it is  an invaluable enhancement to a business accompanied by a sense of teamwork and  accomplishment.  </P> <P> Above all, the position of secretary is deserving of profound respect and not  the derision heaped upon it by this movie.  </P> <P> LEE GRUENFELD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

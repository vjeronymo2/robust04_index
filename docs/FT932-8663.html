			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Accountability in local government funding Sir, I was interested to read your editorial headed 'Local Finance' (May 13). Certainly the report from the Audit Commission on Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) is a timely contribution to our current review. We welcome its finding that SSAs are a more sophisticated system for equalising needs than any overseas system it examined, as well as an improvement on its predecessor. You and the report rehearse separately the familiar argument that council tax should bear a greater proportion of local government expenditure. As the new tax settles in, this is clearly something that will be carefully considered each year. Your suggestion that local accountability (which we both agree is important) would be enhanced by returning the business rate to local authorities is more questionable. Where is the increased accountability to the local electorate in such a move? Moreover, how can you suggest such a power would require 'capping' while you appear to endorse criticism of identical powers in respect of council tax? Robin Squire, parliamentary undersecretary of state, Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kivelidi, leader of the Party of Free </F> Labor, by Yelena Dikun, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist; date and  place not given: "The `Cook's Children' are Setting Their Own  Table"]    [Text] Recently a number of well-known businessmen  who do not shun politics have decided to set up a "Russian  Business Roundtable." Kivelidi's Party of Free Labor, Volskiy's  Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Zatulin's  "Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and Borovoy's  Party of Economic Freedom have sat down at the new "table." It  is planned to hold a founding congress in May, for participation  in which already more than 5,000 applications have been handed  in. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist Yelena Dikun has met with  "Roundtable" initiator Ivan Kivelidi.    [Dikun] The "organization bureau" of your new association is  made up of people who until recently did not especially regard  each other with favor. What suddenly made you forget about  differences?    [Kivelidi] At one time we all began together, then already  each one tried to completely subordinate the matter to himself,  to his own ambitions. I don't think that in the future we will  succeed in completely ridding ourselves of this, but  nevertheless now we understand we won't achieve anything one by  one. All the entrepreneurial associations failed at the  elections. Only individual entrepreneurs by reason of majority  districts or those who, like Zatulin, "leaned against" some  party got through. This was an instructive lesson for us. The  political consciousness of the entrepreneurs finally has  attained an understanding of the need to unite. The  entrepreneurs, as Konstantin Zatulin puts it, don't move in  formation since this presupposes an alignment in order of size  and clarifications of who is higher, who is greater, who is  richer but, nevertheless, we are not a crowd. And in a position  to jointly insist on common interests.    The economy cannot develop further along the path on which  it  is now going--socialist or post-communist. The government is  forced to take a new formation into account. If it does not  intend to do this, then our critical mass already permits us to  resort to acts of civil disobedience. For example, the strike of  the commercial banks on the day of the funeral of the chairman  of Agroprombank, Likhachev, killed "on order," passed seemingly  imperceptibly; however, it caused extreme agitation in the  government. If later they will treat us like "the cook's  children," we are ready to repeat the strike, moreover no longer  for a single day. Given the present non-payments crisis, this  will bring the situation to a critical point in which the  entrepreneurs themselves are not interested. However, if the  authorities don't take us into account, then we have a right not  to take them into account.    [Dikun] Usually businessmen loosen their purse-strings for  marginally utilitarian policy, for the creation of a lobbying  system.    [Kivelidi] We don't hide that the "Russian Business  Roundtable" is a suprapolitical lobbying structure.  Suprapolitical in the sense that each should rise above his own  personal and political preferences in order to lobby for common  interests. Lobbying is flourishing today in our country all the  same, but it is the lobbying of narrow oligarchic groupings,  which I would call by the simple Russian word "blat" [pull,  protection, influence].    For example, today the government elicits $1.5 billion from  the International Monetary Fund by begging while every oil- and  gas-producing enterprise has unrestricted money in foreign  accounts significantly exceeding this amount. This is not  entrepreneurial money but state money; however, for some reason  it doesn't return home. Why? It's no secret that the prime  minister openly protects the oil and gas industry and that most  favored nation treatment has been created for it. Although it is  not a budgetary sector it does not belong to the  poverty-stricken; on the contrary, it yields great profit.    [Dikun] Ought one understand you that there won't be a place  for representatives of the oil and gas complex at the "Russian  Business Roundtable"? In general, according to what criteria do  you accept into your company?    [Kivelidi] We are open for all public and political  organizations expressing the interests of entrepreneurship. As  regards the big oil and gas "magnates," consulations with them  are now underway. In particular with representatives of the  Russian fuel and energy complex and of Minatommash [Ministry of  Atomic Machine Building]. Moreover, we didn't initiate this  process. The Federation of Commodity Producers, which Yuriy  Skokov heads, has expressed a desire to affiliate with us.    [Dikun] Don't you fear that such a powerful leader as Skokov  is using you in the interests of his own political career?    [Kivelidi] I know Yuriy Vladimirovich as a clever and tough  politician who, in my view, has quite good prospects. However,  there are enough strong personalities at our "table" so that  Skokov will be one of them. Incidentally, after we began  consultations with Skokov, I, for my part, have felt a certain  estrangement on the part of the government. This can be taken as  evidence of the fact that Yuriy Vladimirovich is a truly serious  person.    [Dikun] Ivan Kharlampiyevich, you are chairman of the  Council  for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers. It's clear that you have great  ties in the government. Do they help you to deal with business?    [Kivelidi] Today the Entrepreneurship Council is an orphan.  If previously, when Vladimir Shumeyko supervised and helped it,  we gathered, worked, and succeeded in doing many minor things,  for example, in protecting specific entrepreneurs from the  arbitrariness of local authorities, now the impression is  developing that no one needs this Council. Besides, it is naive  to set one's hopes on some kind of favor from "the upper crust."  I'll cite only one example of such "favor." Before the elections  the president promised to allot 25 billion rubles to the Fund  for the support of entrepreneurship. This is a drop in the  ocean. However, in fact they scraped up only R8 billion with  difficulty. But even that, as a result of secret manipulations,  ended up in the Antimonopoly committee for some reason. From  there it got into a bank by a closed tender which offered it to  enterprises at a commercial interest rate.    The government accuses the entrepreneurs of not developing  industry but at the same time itself does everything possible to  impede it. I am more inclined to production. We produce rather  many different products, for example, television sets. However,  we have been forced to reduce amounts and here and there to  generally curtail production because of a tax policy which  simply smothers us in its embraces.    If one is to be honest, we have already become tired of  feeling the economic models written by theoreticians on our  backs. As we have already determined, they undergo changes  already in the course of being written. In my view practical  activity can yield greater results. The proposals of people of  business precisely also constitute part of the "Entry into  Power" plan drawn up by the "Roundtable."    [Dikun] Does this plan include a demand for the immediate  replacement of the government and the accession of entrepreneurs  to key posts in the executive power?    [Kivelidi] In speaking of accession to power, we mean the  transformation of the state mechanism and the complete rejection  of the monopolistic-totalitarian system which is alive as  before. The usual change of government while retaining the  existing order doesn't suit us. That is why I have regarded the  departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov from the cabinet of  ministers without any especial sorrow. They had only role  functions; they hardly could change anything fundamentally.    In its present role (ipostas) it suits the government to  remain the largest owner and entrepreneur and to regulate  relations between the remaining entrepreneurs on the basis of  the laws which it itself promulgates. It turns out that one  businessman, in the person of the state, gives directions to  other businessmen on how to conduct themselves. Moreover, not  with respect to it--it is separate--but among each other. This  is illegitimate in my view.    We no longer want to convince these people since they can't  imagine another state. It is easier to simply accede to power  and to change everything. The question, of course, is not one of  a coup but of gradual entry, for example, into such a temporary  organ that the State Duma is. For this, certain businessmen will  have to forgo their own vital concerns.</p>

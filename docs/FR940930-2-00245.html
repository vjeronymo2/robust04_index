			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Sponsor Responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Executive Order 12138 of May 18, 1979, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393, as amended, and Executive Order 12432 of July 14, 1983, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198, GNMA anticipates meaningful participation by minority and women-owned businesses (``MWOBs'') and minority and women-owned law firms (``MWOLFs'') in the GNMA multiclass securities program. Sponsors are required to develop and implement a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOBs as Co-sponsors. Also, Sponsors are required to ensure that the trust counsel they engage for transactions develop and implement a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOLFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Co-sponsor Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA considers meaningful participation for MWOB Co-sponsors to be the use of one of the following two options. Sponsors may increase the level of participation by Co-sponsors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Best Efforts Option. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the Best Efforts Option, the Co-sponsor is provided the opportunity to sell at least 10 percent of the transaction, computed on the basis of the original principal balance, for a 24-hour period, prior to the Sponsor's or other's marketing of the allocated percentage of the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Underwriting Option. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the Underwriting Option, the Co-sponsor is provided the opportunity to acquire, at the option of the Co-sponsor, at least 10 percent of the transaction, at prices negotiated between the Sponsor and the Co-sponsor. In addition to the sales price, and in lieu of a schedule of discounts, the Sponsor pays the Co-sponsor an amount equal to 1/8th of 1 percent of the principal amount purchased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Trust Counsel Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA considers meaningful participation of MWOLFs to be at least ten percent of the billing for the work completed for each transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Minority and Women-Owned Businesses as Sponsors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA encourages MWOBs to become Sponsors, either individually or as joint venturers, by providing a 15 percent reduction in the GNMA guaranty fee for transactions closed and securities sold solely by MWOB Sponsors and Co-sponsors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

With respect to Co-sponsors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Certification that the Sponsor has developed and implemented a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by Co-sponsors, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Certification of the extent to which MWOBs have been participants in the Sponsor's transactions as Co-sponsors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. With respect to Co-trust Counsel:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Certification from trust counsel used for transactions by the Sponsor that the trust counsel has developed and implemented a plan that sets goals for meaningful participation by MWOLFs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

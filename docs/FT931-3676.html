			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Danes launch drive in support of energy tax THE Danish presidency of the EC is launching an effort to mobilise support for the controversial energy tax put forward by the European Commission last year to combat global warming. As talks on the tax resume today at an EC finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, Denmark is expected to announce it has scheduled an extraordinary 'jumbo' council of environment and energy ministers of the 12, on April 23 in Luxembourg. The tax plan, part of a package to meet EC commitments to stabilise carbon dioxide emisions at 1990 levels by 2000, has been sidelined since Brussels adopted it last May, and has been made conditional on the US and Japan taking analogous measures. The conditionality is to safeguard European industrial competitivity. The new push comes in the wake of President Bill Clinton's plans to introduce a fuel tax in the US, and growing evidence that the EC cannot meet its emissions targets through more conventional measures. Before Washington's move last month, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, warned that, while Brussels remained committed to the energy tax, its emissions strategy could take a long time to emerge from the EC legislative pipeline. Since then, the commissioner has been co-operating closely with the Danish presidency and, according to his officials, is now 'talking up' the possibilities of achieving a package including the tax. If approved by the 12, the tax would start at Dollars 3 a barrel of oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 a barrel by 2000. The mixed levy would fall half on the fuel content of all non-renewable energy and half on its carbon content. It would be offset by tax reductions in other areas, such as social security and corporate tax payments, which its advocates believe could help job-creation. Spain, however, remains strongly opposed to the tax, arguing that the richer countries which emit most carbon dioxide, and have most resources to spend on energy-saving and clean technology, should be set higher reduction targets. The Commission is looking at ways to rebalance the tax to shift more of the burden from power generation - the costliest element for the poorer member states - to transport. But the senior Commission official warned, 'you would never get agreement on target-sharing' as demanded by Madrid. Recent Commission studies on emissions, revealing that the most optimistic forecasts of emissions by the 12 show that the EC would fall far short of its stabilisation target, have added urgency to the debate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Fresh data show subtle  brightening in some facets of Japan's slumping economy, but no  clear signals of recovery have emerged, the Bank of Japan (BOJ)  said Friday [18 February].    The central bank's monthly economic review adds the words  "on  the whole" to its assessment of weak personal consumption,  indicating a few areas with "nuances" of improvement, while it  deletes mention of strong public investment, a BOJ official said.    The bank stuck to its judgment that "Japan's economic growth  remains weak and no clear indication of imminent recovery has  been identified."    With overall consumption weak, final demand still lackluster  and corporate capital investment still falling, "there has been  virtually no growth in industrial production and shipments, and  inventory adjustments have stalled," the report said.    Labor conditions also continue to worsen gradually, it said.    Private housing investment remains strong, but growth has  slowed in public investment, another recent bright spot,  especially compared to robust year-earlier growth, it said.    Some public works projects have been delayed as local  governments change bidding practices in the wake of construction  scandals. But the official declined to tie the slower public  investment growth to the scandals.    Among personal consumption categories, "sales of washing  machines and personal computers are picking up, and revenues at  major travel agencies in December increased above last year's  level," the report said.    The partial improvements may have been affected by stock  adjustments of household durable goods, higher housing  investment and new products matching consumers' downscale  desires, it said.    But overall, "personal consumption remains weak against the  backdrop of slower employment growth and limited income growth,"  with such factors as cuts in bonus and overtime pay, the report  said.    Personal consumption cannot be judged to be recovering  without stronger income growth, the BOJ official said.    Manufacturing capital investment continued to decline,  despite rises to boost capacity in such areas as semiconductors  and liquid crystals, the report said, citing excess capital  stock, lower use of capacity, low profits and increased shifts  of production overseas.    The report noted that Japan's trade and current-account  surpluses have declined, with exports falling in real terms,  partly reflecting last year's soaring yen, which moved in a  111-113 yen range in January.    Its recent surge to six-month peaks came "as the market  reacted to comments attributed to U.S. officials." The yen  closed Friday in Tokyo at 104.57 yen.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART OF WAR;  </P> <P> PASADENA PAINTER CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF AFGHANISTAN  </P> <P> Hidden under a sheet and surrounded by Afghan rebel soldiers in an ambulance,  Peter S. Adams of Pasadena bumped his way across the legendary Khyber Pass into  Afghanistan.  </P> <P> In billowy shirt and draw-string pants, he had adopted the look of a  moujahedeen, or holy warrior. He wore a traditional Nuristani hat to cover his  golden hair, now dyed black. His long beard and eyebrows were also dyed.  </P> <P> The only trace of his surfer good looks were his blue eyes. He had decided that  contact lens to make his eyes look brown wouldn't be worth the trouble.  </P> <P> But even with the blue eyes, he survived the passage across the border and into  the mountainous, landlocked country of southwestern Asia. And he survived those  six weeks in the fall of 1987 with the rebels, who were fighting the Soviets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Artistic Trip  </P> <P> Peter Adams went to this foreign land not to fight. He went to paint.  </P> <P> He sketched and painted his way across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Tibet,  China and India, creating 200 works of art during his seven-month Asian trip.  </P> <P> For more than a year since his return, Adams, 38, has told the story of his  trip. His Afghanistan paintings also tell the story of a land and a people  wounded and disabled by war.  </P> <P> Last week, as the last Soviet soldier was leaving the country after  Afghanistan's occupation of nine years, Adams spoke about his artistic journey.  His work will be displayed Monday and Tuesday at Monterey Park's Bruggemeyer  Library.  </P> <P> Adams sold about 45 of the paintings from his Asian trip when his work was put  on display last year at Adamson-Duvannes Galleries on the Westside. His works  sell for as much as $15,000 and grace the walls of homes and galleries  throughout California.  </P> <P> Last fall he exhibited pastels from the Asian trip at the Pacific Asia Museum  in Pasadena. David Kamansky, the museum's executive director, said Adams'  "sense of light, color and space is very beautiful" in combination with a  traditional style.  </P> <P> That he went to Afghanistan, Adams said, had as much to do with his desire to  paint and travel as with political conviction or wanting to help Afghan rebels  or refugees. He is largely apolitical, even though his sister, Aileen Adams,  has been active in Democratic party politics. "I don't think of myself as  liberal or conservative, except on particular issues. But I did feel the  Soviets were wrong."  </P> <P> But what he saw inspired him to donate part of the sales from his paintings to  the International Medical Corps. The Los Angeles-based organization was founded  to set up medical clinics inside Afghanistan and help refugees outside the  country.  </P> <P> As much as anything, he made the trip because of his attraction to Asia. "I'm  very much in love with the art, clothes and costumes and customs of the Orient.  There are so many noble and enriching aspects of Asian cultures. Their  histories go back thousands of years -- with buildings, architecture and  fascinating art.  </P> <P> "All this is disappearing and someday will be gone, just as our American Indian  culture has vanished in comparison to what it once was." Adams wanted to record  the culture before it disappeared.  </P> <P> In his Pasadena studio, a light and airy place of skylights and arched windows,  he spoke about his trip. Gold-framed paintings, resting on easels and propped  along the walls, told as much as his words.  </P> <P> The largest painting, a centerpiece work from his trip titled "Afghanistan  Supply Line," depicts the band of 15 soldiers that he accompanied. The scene,  in oil on a 4-by-5-foot canvas, shows the soldiers trekking across a rocky  snowfield. The dawn sky of amber, grays and blues sets off the background of  10,000-foot-high mountains. In the foreground, two soldiers carry AK-47 rifles.  Another rides a burro, and others carry boxes of medical supplies and  ammunitions.  </P> <P> Another painting, inspired by his three-week stay in the Shangri-La-like  kingdom of Bhutan, shows a red-robed holy man leaning on a staff.  </P> <P> A procession of Tibetan holy men inspired another painting. They were gathered  around the Panchen Lama, who was the second-highest holy leader in Tibet until  his death Jan. 28.  </P> <P> Adams' adventuresome artistic career was nurtured by a supportive family, he  said.  </P> <P> His late father was a Los Angeles real estate developer whose first love was  acting -- he had a lengthy movie career that included being a stage husband to  Claudette Colbert and Kitty Carlyle. Adams' father also appeared in such  television shows as "Dallas" and "General Hospital."  </P> <P> An aunt was a sculptor and a paternal grandmother, a painter. And Adams'  maternal grandfather, George B. Seitz, started out to be a painter in  Philadelphia, but instead became a screenwriter, producer and director. Seitz,  who was credited with discovering the late composer George Gershwin, also was  known as a writer, actor and the producer of serials including "The Perils of  Pauline." And, as an MGM director, Seitz helped make Mickey Rooney a star.  </P> <P> Adams first gained confidence as a painter when he was a high school student at  the Harvard School in Studio City. Later, he briefly attended college in San  Diego, because of its potential for good surfing, and came back to Los Angeles  to attend the Art Center College of Design, which is now in Pasadena. But Adams  dropped out at age 20 to become an apprentice of Theodore Lukits, a Hancock  Park painter.  </P> <P> For four years Adams studied with Lukits, whom Adams describes as a  19th-Century-style painter. "It was like stepping back 100 years," Adams said.  Then, as a journeyman, Adams stayed with Lukits for three more years before  setting out on his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Collecting Sights  </P> <P> For the last 11 years, he has roamed the California countryside as well as the  globe in search of images. "Painting gives me a good reason to travel, and I  like color. If I wasn't a painter, I'd be a collector," he said. "You get going  on a painting, and it becomes like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm always racking my brain  and thinking about, how is this going to work and how is that going to work?"  </P> <P> In 1981 he traveled unescorted through China. He was, he believes, the first  Western artist to be allowed to do so. In Afghanistan, however, he was quite  happy to have escorts and translators, he said.  </P> <P> He didn't speak the language, and the approach he took in China would not have  worked in an Afghanistan at war. (In China, Adams used note cards in Chinese to  help him get around. But Adams, who is single, did not dare show the card that  said: "Our eternal destiny is to be together.")  </P> <P> In his travels with the soldiers, Adams never encountered actual fighting,  seeing only the aftermath. Even before crossing the border into Afghanistan, he  spent one long and trying month in Peshawar, Pakistan, waiting to get word from  rebels whom he had been trying to persuade to take him across. In Peshawar he  went to the refugee hospitals almost daily to paint portraits of the wounded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impressed by Spirit  </P> <P> Today, when he looks at the photographic slides he took there, he still is  touched by what he refers to as the undaunted spirit of the Afghan people. As  he showed the slides to a visitor, he pointed out one of the most poignant  images of the trip: a soldier whose arms had been amputated being served a cup  of water by his smiling little son.  </P> <P> In Peshawar, a border city rife with rumors, reports of spies and  counter-spies, and restaurant bombings by saboteurs, Adams said he felt more  frightened than in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> His most difficult time with the soldiers came not from bullets but from fleas.  After staying in a village home, he came away with what he estimated to be  close to 200 flea bites.  </P> <P> And in western China, one unfortunate encounter was with a shopkeeper in a  marketplace who became disturbed by Adams' painting and attracting a crowd. The  man grabbed Adams' brush and ran it across the picture.  </P> <P> "A lot of time painting was kind of a battle. You get this idea that it would  be so serene, Zen and peaceful and meditative. But in a marketplace you get  hundreds of people crowding around and shoving. And you get an audience  applauding."  </P> <P> On Dec. 28, he achieved that odd kind of momentary recognition that only  Hollywood bestows.  </P> <P> The television show "Jeopardy!" referred to Adams when the clue card read:  "While working in the Himalayas, artist Peter Adams had to put vodka and gin in  his paints to prevent this."  </P> <P> Correct answer: "What is: 'to keep from freezing'?"  </P></p>

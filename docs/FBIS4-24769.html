			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chinese Foreign Ministry on 2 June expressed  support for President Kim Yong-sam discussing the North Korean  nuclear issue with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia.    Shen Guofang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry,  revealed in today's briefing that China supports the ongoing  active discussion between the international community and the  countries concerned for the smooth resolution of the North  Korean nuclear issue.    The spokesman's remark hints at the change in the Chinese  Foreign Ministry's stance that had earlier called for the  settlement of the nuclear issue through dialogue among the  parties concerned -- the North and South, the International  Atomic Energy Agency, and the United States.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST CAUSE  </P> <P> "The Old Gringo," Carlos Fuentes' book about the terminal period in the life of  Ambrose Bierce, a journalist for William Randolph Hearst some 80 years ago,  contains a passage which is shocking in the similarity to President Bush's  statement on the rationale for Operation Just Cause in Panama:  </P> <P> "I did it to save lives." Bierce is reflecting on Mexico: "This land . . . He  (Bierce) had never seen it before; he had attacked it by orders of his boss  Hearst, who had enormous investments in ranches and other property and feared  the Revolution; but he couldn't say, Go protect my property, he had to say, Go  protect our lives, there are North American citizens in danger, intervene!"  </P> <P> PAUL MORANDA  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

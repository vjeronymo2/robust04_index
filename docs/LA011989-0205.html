			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: CAST IS NOT NECESSARILY THE ANSWER FOR LEG OF CAT HIT BY  AUTOMOBILE  </P> <P> Q: About 4 months ago, our cat Squiggy was hit by a car. His left rear leg was  broken just below the hip joint. We took him to a veterinarian, and we were  told he would need surgery and a series of X-rays and treatment. The bill was  going to be expensive, and we were unable to come up with any of the money  needed to fix his leg, so we had him put to sleep. Recently, a friend of mine  said that we could have simply had the leg put into a cast. Is my friend right?  </P> <P> B. Bates, La Habra  </P> <P> A: Without seeing the X-rays and the condition of your cat after the injury, it  is very difficult to comment on a surgical evaluation. However, if your cat did  have a fracture of the femur or upper leg bone that joins at the hip, a cast  would have been both impractical and improper. The basics of fracture repair  require that the joint above -- the hip -- and the joint below -- the knee --  be stabilized from moving in order to allow the bone to heal properly.  </P> <P> A cast would not be able to hold the cat's hip joint immobile and still allow  the cat to urinate or defecate. Repair of femoral fracture requires surgical  procedures, such as a pin inside the bone, a bone plate that is screwed into  the bone, or a series of external pins that pass through the bone and are held  rigid by a bar. There may have been some pelvic fractures or injuries that  would also have prevented the use of a splint or cast. Admittedly, surgery is  expensive but probably necessary in this case. I recommend that you talk to  your veterinarian again just to satisfy yourself that everything was proper. I  hope you decide to get a new pet. If you do, I suggest you consider veterinary  pet insurance that is available to help with the costs of such unexpected and  expensive injuries.  </P> <P> Q: I am enclosing some "eggs" that are found here and there after our cat wakes  up from her nap. I am most curious to know what they are, and I am hoping that  you can identify them for me.  </P> <P> Pam McMillan, Garden Grove  </P> <P> A: In the packet with your letter was a collection of tapeworm segments that  have become dried and look like small grains of rice. The tapeworm, as it  matures, will shed individual segments called proglottids, each of which  contains the eggs of the tapeworm. These segments are mobile and will move  about on your cat's coat and stool and into the environment, where they  degenerate, making the eggs available for ingestion by flea larva. The larva  develops into an infective flea, and if your cat accidently ingests one while  grooming, she can reinfect herself with tapeworms. This is the major portion of  the life cycle of the tapeworm. You need to have your cat treated for tapeworms  and should also have her dipped or bathed for fleas to help reduce that  exposure. Treating the house and yard for fleas will be necessary to reduce  their populations and help prevent exposure to your cat. Your veterinarian will  be able to advise you on the best methods for you and your cat.  </P></p>

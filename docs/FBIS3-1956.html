Such an important arrangement gave expression  to regularity in the building of the armed forces in the new  period and represented a major step toward enhancing the quality  of our armed forces.    Why should troop management be placed in an important  position in the building of the armed forces? This is because  troop management is the foundation for all activities of the  armed forces, and the existence and development of the armed  forces cannot be maintained with rigorous and scientific troop  management. In a broad sense, troop management refers to the  organization, coordination, control, and regulation of the  special working and living order and method, and to the  subordinate personnel and equipment of the armed forces  according to relevant regulations and rules. So we may say that  troop management covers everything and has to be conducted at  any time. It is the basic work in the military units, and must  be conducted most frequently, intensively, and extensively. It  constitutes the precondition and provides the guarantee for the  rallying force, combat effectiveness, consolidation, and  development of the military units, and is also closely linked  with the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of  the armed forces. Without unified, rigorous, and scientific  management of troops, there will be an undisciplined, loose,  lax, and disorderly condition, and military units will become  just a plate of loose sand and will lose their combat  effectiveness.    At present, the building of the armed forces is situated in  a  new historical period, and the work of troop management is  getting more and more important. Properly managing troops is  also an important point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas about  building the armed forces in the new period. Along with the  in-depth development of reform and opening and the development  of the socialist market economy, profound changes have occurred  in the overall social environment for the building of the armed  forces. On the one hand, this will fundamentally lay a solid  material foundation for the modernization of the armed forces,  and will further encourage officers and men to update their  mentality, seek more knowledge, and make achievements. This  will thus give new vitality and dynamism to construction and  reform in the armed forces. We should grasp the opportunity,  give proper guidance according to the development of the  situation, break new ground, make advances, and raise the work  of troop management to a new level. On the other hand, we  should also notice that in the course of transition from the old  to new systems, we have encountered and will continue to  encounter many new problems that we did not encounter before in  troop management, and we are required to tell our cadres and  soldiers what to do and how to react and give them timely and  effective answers. Thus, we should find new concepts, means,  and methods to adapt the work of troop management to the  changing situation.    The armed forces are shouldering the military mission in the  new period, and this also sets high requirements for the work of  troop management. Local wars under modern conditions will not  only be confrontations of high-tech weaponry and equipment, but  will, more importantly, also be a trial of strength in the  aspects of personnel quality and troop discipline. The more  advanced the weaponry and equipment, the higher the requirements  for the quality of troop management will become. Happenings in  recent local wars in the contemporary world fully show that the  high-tech war has made the time for the movement of troops to a  stage of calculating minutes and seconds; so only with rigorous  and scientific management can discipline and good combat style  and effectiveness be brought about.    The Army has fine tradition and scientific theory for troop  management. Substantial progress has also been made in this  regard in recent years. However, we should also admit that the  current condition of troop management is still unsuited to the  needs in the development of the socialist market economy.  Strengthening and improving troop management remains an  extremely important and urgent task. All units in the Army must  follow Chairman Jiang's instruction: "Being politically up to  standard, militarily proficient, consistent in keeping the fine  style of work, highly discipline, and effective and efficient in  logistics guarantees." They should study the new conditions and  resolve the new problems in troop management in the new period,  lay a good foundation for the building of the armed forces, and  enhance the quality, efficiency, and combat effectiveness  through the improvement of troop management.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jibril Rajjub, PLO adviser on territorial </F> affairs, by Moti Amir in Tunis on the "Morning Newsreel"  program; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Amir] The PLO leader these days enjoys almost total  support in the PLO Executive Committee and among his advisers.  All of them support his demand to disarm the settlers,  reorganize the settlements before the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, and deploy international observers in  the territories.    'Arafat's assistant Jibril Rajjub told us in an interview in  Tunis that Israel is responsible for torpedoing the Oslo  agreement.    [Rajjub] I believe the PLO cannot resume the peace process  or  negotiations without a new basis. The new basis is solving the  problem of the settlers. I think that uprooting all the  settlers from Hebron is the only solution to return to the  negotiations. Those who killed and those who danced and  celebrated after the brutal massacre in the mosque will have no  peace and there will be no coexistence with them. We will not  give them security while they live in Hebron.    [Amir] What are you afraid of? What can happen in Hebron  now?    [Rajjub] Anything is possible. One day a mad person might  come and do the same thing. No one can guarantee that the  Hebronites will not take revenge. What happened motivates us  all to take revenge and react in the way they see fit. It is  better to solve the whole problem and remove the settlers. I  think we will be traitors if we agree that those who celebrated  the massacre in Hebron will remain in Hebron.    [Amir] Does this mean the negotiations remain deadlocked and  that you are reopening the Oslo agreement?    [Rajjub] Listen, the deadlock happened after the brutal  massacre in Hebron. Negotiations have taken place over six  months following the Declaration of Principles agreement. The  negotiations have always been linked with the security and peace  of the settlers and settlements. What happened proved that  security and peace can be achieved when we send the settlers to  hell.    [Amir] Rajjub announced that Fatah will renew the armed  struggle against Israel. Was this a PLO instruction?    [Rajjub] There has been no decision to end the struggle.  Perhaps the means have changed but as long as there is  occupation and settlers, no orders are given to end the struggle.    [Amir] Will the Fatah Movement initiate a revenge operation  following the Hebron massacre?    [Rajjub] Anything is possible. I think this is a  possibility. No one can tell you that something like this won't  happen.    [Amir] Regarding the contacts between Tzomet and the Labor  Party, total indifference is being demonstrated on the surface.  But Palestinian sources note that including Tzomet in the  government will, in their opinion, restrict the Israeli  Government's freedom of action in the negotiations with the  Palestinians and enable Rabin to act more forcefully against the  extremists among the settlers.</p>

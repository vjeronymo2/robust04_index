			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant recovers to Pounds 1.25m Holmes &amp; Marchant Group, the marketing services company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m for the year to September 30, against losses of Pounds 4.76m.

Lower exceptional costs of Pounds 294,000 (Pounds 3.02m) and a lower charge for discontinued activities of Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 2.96m) were the main factors behind the improvement. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 826,000 (Pounds 1.08m). Turnover fell to Pounds 32.3m (Pounds 33.6m) but operating profit rose to Pounds 2.38m (Pounds 2.3m). Earnings per share came out at 4.1p (losses 18.9p). On prospects the company said there was little evidence that recessionary pressures were easing.</p>

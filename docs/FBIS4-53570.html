			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The outgoing chairman of the  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said Thursday  [19 May] he feels he has finished playing a major role in the  Japanese business community.    Gaishi Hiraiwa made the remark at his last news conference  as  chief of Japan's top business lobby.    He will be replaced by Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota  Motor Corp., as Keidanren chief when he retires from his post in  a general meeting of the organization on May 27.    Hiraiwa, who is also adviser to Tokyo Electric Power Co.,  was  appointed as Keidanren chairman in December 1990.    During his three-and-a-half-year term, he faced various  problems resulting from political turmoil and a prolonged  recession.</p>

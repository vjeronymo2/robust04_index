			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SETTLES SUIT ON BAY  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles on Thursday announced settlement of a $100-million  lawsuit filed by the state over sewage spills at the Hyperion treatment plant,  bringing an end to a series of legal actions and setting in motion drastic new  efforts to reverse environmental damage to Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement, the state will drop its suit and the city will  invest more than $100 million in improvements to its aging sewage facilities,  in new water conservation and reclamation programs and in museum exhibits aimed  at heightening public awareness of the causes of bay pollution and its possible  remedies.  </P> <P> "Instead of having $100 million in fines go to the state treasury . . . it's  going into improving our sewage system," said John Stodder, an environmental  affairs aide to Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> "This is the way controversies between two government agencies should be  handled," Bradley said at a press conference Thursday. "Instead of fighting it  out in the courts, we solved it at the bargaining table."  </P> <P> Bradley called the settlement -- unanimously approved by the City Council in a  closed-door session Tuesday -- a "historic agreement" and said Los Angeles is  on the "cutting edge" of dealing with sewage problems. Virtually all of the  costs will be borne by the city's existing sewage surcharge tax imposed on all  homeowners and commercial landlords, city officials said.  </P> <P> City and state officials and environmental activists said the programs  established in the agreement will help return the bay to a condition not seen  for decades.  </P> <P> Environmental experts agreed that the city has come a long way since 1987, when  Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp filed the suit against the city, seeking  penalties of up to $20 a gallon for two major spills that dumped a total of  more than 5.4 million gallons of raw sewage into the bay.  </P> <P> Since the 1987 spills, the city was also forced to sign a consent decree with  the Environmental Protection Agency, under which it agreed to improve the  quality of the discharge from the Hyperion sewage treatment plant by 1998.  </P> <P> Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, an environmental group, said the city  "has taken the initiative and run with it" in the last two years.  </P> <P> But the agreement signed this week, Green said, is a "safeguard." She noted  that should administrations or attitudes change at City Hall, they will still  be held accountable" for continued improvements to the sewage infrastructure.  </P> <P> Green said that some provisions in the agreement -- such as programs to clean  up Ballona Creek and halt polluted discharges from the Thorton Avenue drain  pipe in Venice -- "are more than we would have had the nerve to ask for."  </P> <P> Clarke Drane, chairman of the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board,  said that the city would have been required to do some of the promised work  under existing state and federal laws.  </P> <P> "But there's a number of things we got them to do that they wouldn't have to do  otherwise," he said.  </P> <P> Drane estimated -- and city officials concurred -- that at least $80 million  will be spent on these additional programs.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the city has established a water reclamation office,  charged with finding ways to capture and reuse waste water.  </P> <P> The city also agreed to enter a voluntary EPA program next year in which it  will help write new regulations for controlling storm water runoff, which  carries road oil, pesticides and other pollutants into the bay.  </P> <P> Other programs under the agreement include a proposed $4-million "inflatable  dam" to be installed in Ballona Creek to trap runoff water for treatment before  it flows into the bay and a $7-million water treatment plant at the Los Angeles  Zoo, where animal droppings are now routinely washed into the city's storm  drains.  </P> <P> Most of the work specified in the agreement involves mechanical improvements to  the city's sewage system. Some of it, such as electrical power upgrading at  Hyperion, have already been completed. It was the electrical failure of pumps  at Hyperion that led to the 1987 spills.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the city must replace the pumping plant at Ballona Creek  and upgrade as many as 27 generators at 19 pumping stations by 1993 and upgrade  the control system at the Venice pumping plant by 1994.  </P> <P> Equally important are growth control measures. The agreement calls on the city  to adopt a new "sewer allocation ordinance," which uses the issuance of  building permits as a means of controlling additional sewage flows to the  Hyperion plant.  </P> <P> The city is also required to complete programs under its 1988 water  conservation ordinance, which requires "low-flow" water fixtures. New homes and  commercial buildings have had to install such fixtures for the past year.  Starting in March, the city will begin handing out do-it-yourself kits  door-to-door for installation in all existing homes.  </P> <P> In an effort to teach the need for continued vigilance, the city agreed to  establish and maintain for five years an exhibit on bay pollution at the Museum  of Science and Industry.  </P></p>

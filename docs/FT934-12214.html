			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (8): Deficit is at a record high - Trade REFORM is rarely painless. Moving ahead rapidly to create a more liberal trade and foreign exchange regime, Sri Lanka has been hit hard by a sharp deterioration in its balance of trade, giving finance officials serious cause for concern. A steady reduction in import tariffs, likely to be continued in next month's budget, and the easing last year of most foreign exchange controls on the current account, have helped to push the country's trade deficit to a record high, in spite of soaring exports. In the first six months of 1993, the trade gap widened by 38 per cent from SLRs24.73bn in the first six months of 1992 to SLRs34.19bn, a level which most agree is not sustainable in the long run. As a proportion of total trade, the deficit remained the same at 21 per cent, but imports continued to grow at a faster rate than exports and from a much higher base. Part of the 35 per cent increase in imports to SLRs95.97bn in the first half of 1993 was a one-off purchase by Air Lanka, the country's civil airline, of two Airbus A340s. Much of the growth came from capital goods used for investment or intermediate goods, such as textiles, which are re-exported. On exports, the outlook is brighter than it has been for some time. According to Mr A. R. Mansoor, minister for trade, the most remarkable development has been the expansion in the range of industrial exports. 'With 500 garment factories on stream, clothes are our top export earner. But, most encouraging of all, we are now selling 2,000 industrial products overseas,' he says. The first half of 1993 saw a sharp recovery in overseas sales of tea, rubber and cash crops following a severe drought in 1992. This, coupled with the continuing success of Sri Lanka's runaway textile sector, saw exports jump by 34 per cent in the first half of the year, putting the country on course for a record export performance in 1993. Exports in the first six months totalled SLRs61.8bn; up from SLRs46.34bn in the same period last year. Textiles and garments led the way with a 31 per cent increase in export value to SLRs30.77bn in the first six months after a record-breaking year in 1992. For the first time, textile and garment exports accounted for 50 per cent of Sri Lanka's total overseas sales. Even in value-added terms, garment exports (imported inputs account for about 60 per cent of the gross export value) have now overtaken the country's traditional tea and rubber export mainstay. In the first half of 1993, Sri Lanka's agricultural exports grew by 21 per cent to SLRs14.57bn, accounting for 24 per cent of total exports. Tea made a strong recovery in the first six months of 1993, up 35 per cent to SLRs9.2bn following last year's drought when it recorded its most dismal performance since 1956. The removal of substantial export taxes on tea, rubber and coconut at the end 1992 saw the elimination of an important structural inefficiency in the economy and did much to improve the prospects for an industry where poor prices and high costs have meant many plantations have made losses. This year the Russians have come to the rescue of Sri Lankan tea exporters after the loss of the Iraq market two years ago due to the Gulf war United Nations embargo and a sharp reduction in tea imports this year by Iran and Egypt, two of Sri Lanka's big markets. Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries imported almost 20,000 tonnes in the first six months and are expected to import about 30,000 tonnes of Sri Lankan tea - mostly of the cheaper variety - out of an expected total of 220,000 tonnes of exports this year. The star export performers in 1993, however, have been other industrial products, up more than 64 per cent on last year to SLRs12.2bn, and going some small way to substantiating Mr Mansoor's claim that the country may soon no longer be a two-horse export economy of tea and textiles. Fastest growing of all the export items in this category has been polished diamonds, up almost threefold to SLRs2.53bn in the first half, with exports of manufactured rubber goods not far behind. But Sri Lanka's economy still has a long way to go before it can shake off the suspicion it is still over-reliant on just a few dominant sectors. After all, tea and textiles alone accounted for 65 per cent of the country's total exports in the first six months of this year.</p>

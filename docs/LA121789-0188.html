			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TEN INVITES PENN ST.;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: ILLINOIS PRESIDENT SAYS CONFERENCE EXTENDS AN OFFER, AND NITTANY  LIONS AGREE IN PRINCIPAL TO JOIN.  </P> <P> Penn State has accepted an offer to abandon its independent status in football  and join the Big Ten Conference, a high-ranking conference official said  Saturday.  </P> <P> A news conference probably will be held in Chicago some time this week to  announce that the Big Ten will be expanded to include Penn State, said Stanley  D. Ikenberry, University of Illinois president.  </P> <P> Ikenberry is chairman of the Council of 10, the Big Ten's association of  presidents.  </P> <P> "We have reached an agreement in principle that Penn State will join the Big  Ten," Ikenberry said. "We think that if Penn State were incorporated in the  conference, it would be a natural and happy extension of the conference."  </P> <P> But Bryce Jordan, Penn State president, would not say Saturday whether Penn  State will make the move.  </P> <P> "I'm not in a position ethically to make a positive response," Jordan said.  </P> <P> Penn State has similar academic and athletic interests as current Big Ten  institutions, Ikenberry said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> He said Penn State has been negotiating actively to join the conference during  the past three months.  </P> <P> As the 11th school in the conference, Penn State would join Wisconsin,  Michigan, Illinois, Northwestern, Indiana, Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio State,  Michigan State and Purdue. The conference probably would keep the name Big Ten,  however, Ikenberry said.  </P> <P> Penn State belongs to the Atlantic 10 Conference for basketball and other  sports, but has always been an independent in football.  </P> <P> The Washington Post, meanwhile, said only a number of competitive, financial  and contractual considerations remained before the move was made. That could  delay Penn State's entry into the conference until the mid-1990s, the Post  said.  </P> <P> Asked if the deal had been made, Minnesota Athletic Director Rick Bay told the  Post: "That's the way it sounds to me."  </P> <P> However, it appears the Big Ten presidents moved ahead without consulting their  athletic directors about the move.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed there wasn't any dialogue with the athletic directors prior  to them (the presidents) getting to this point," Bay said. "We need to be  involved at some point in these discussions, but I don't know when or if that  will occur."  </P> <P> Ohio State Athletic Director Jim Jones was also concerned about the move. "I'm  scheduled for the next 15 years in football," he told the Post. "Does that mean  I have to pick out an opponent every year to drop? Are we going to play a  round-robin (conference season)? . . . There are a lot of things to be  determined before I'm ready to say whether this is a good idea."  </P> <P> The decision to issue an invitation to Penn State apparently was made in  Chicago last Sunday, the first day of the Council of 10's two-day semiannual  meeting.  </P> <P> Penn State football Coach Joe Paterno said Friday: "The schools in the Big Ten  are similar institutions to ours academically. It would be a great thing for  the prestige of this institution to be identified with those people.  </P> <P> "Athletically, it would be a plus in just about every area."  </P> <P> Penn State has rejected the idea of joining a proposed conference that has been  under discussion since June. Meetings have been held on the possibility of  forming an eastern conference that could include such schools as Syracuse,  Pittsburgh, Boston College, Temple, Rutgers, West Virginia, Florida State,  Miami, South Carolina and Virginia Tech. But such a conference would probably  not include all sports, which Penn State wants.  </P> <P> Paterno, speaking during a news conference to discuss Penn State's Dec. 29  Holiday Bowl game against Brigham Young at San Diego, said he understood Jordan  would make an announcement next week.  </P> <P> Paterno said joining the conference might be too tempting to miss, with his  scheduled retirement coming in three years at age 65.  </P> <P> "Any time you get into a new challenge it kind of gets the blood going," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Financial Industry Adopts New Program for  Resale of Loans Without Consent of Borrower    The financial industry has developed a "loan participation  program" as a means to dispose of and create liquidity for loans  and reduce bank assets. The program includes conditions such as  1) sale of right to principal and interest to investors; 2)  absence of right by investors to demand repayment; and 3)  assumption by investors of any risk associated with failure of  borrower to repay loan. The program differs from past programs  to attain liquidity of such assets in that the liquidity can be  established without the consent of the borrower because the  investors will not possess the right to seek direct repayment of  the loan. Private-sector financial institutions exercise a  strong desire to reduce assets for the purpose of enhancing net  worth and reduce risks associated with fluctuating interest  rates and it appears that they will begin in earnest to attain  greater liquidity through the new program by the end of the  current fiscal year.    Under the new program, banks will sell the right to receive  principle and interest on loans to investors, but assume  responsibility to collect principle and interest from borrowers  and make payments to investors. Banks will charge a fee for the  collection services.    The contracts to be concluded between banks and investors  will provide that the investor assumes the risk in the event a  borrower defaults on a loan and that the investor will forfeit  the right to demand repayment from the debtor. The contract will  also provide that when the borrower defaults because of  bankruptcy, banks will endeavor to recover principal to the  degree feasible. City banks played a central role in preparing a  report which covers the details of the new program.    The new program, in contrast to the former "loan transfer  program" wherein loans were resold to attain liquidity of such  assets, carries the major difference of not granting investors  the right to seek repayment in the event of a default. However,  fees payable by investors will be set at lower levels.    Since investors will not have the right to demand repayment,  borrowers are not faced with the risk of being asked by  purchasers of the loans for repayment. This means that banks  will not be required to obtain the consent of borrowers for  resale of the loans. In Japan, it was difficult to obtain the  consent of borrowers for the transfer of loans, but the new  program provides for immediate liquidity of loan instruments.    Under the new program, banks transfer default risks to  investors and loan principal and interest payments become the  property of investors.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson plans to get back on firm financial footing BROWN &amp; JACKSON, which operates the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores, yesterday announced a series of proposals which are designed to put it back on a firm financial basis. It hopes to be able to pay a nominal dividend for the current year. The shares rose from 7 3/4 p to 9p. A revolt by institutional shareholders last year led to the departure of Mr Bryan Duffy, the group's chairman and chief executive. A new management team was installed and Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, was appointed to undertake a review of the company's condition. The group now plans to raise Pounds 15.6m through an open offer and placing, on a 1-for-1 basis at 7 1/2 p. It is to ask the Court for permission to reorganise the capital, which will cut the issued capital by Pounds 68m. It is selling two subsidiaries, Advanced Technology Industries and A&amp;G Imports, and concentrating on the core business. The sale of ATI will result in the cancellation of Pounds 10.6m worth of convertible preference shares. Brown &amp; Jackson also announced the appointment of Mr John Jackson as chairman. Mr Jackson is vice-chairman of Ladbroke Group, the leisure company, and holds a number of other non-executive posts. The group also reported audited results for the nine months to September 30 1991, showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.9m and a retained loss of Pounds 28.1m. The estimated loss before tax for the full year was Pounds 7.3m and the retained loss Pounds 21.6m. Adjusting for the effect of the proposals, the group's debt at September 30 would have been Pounds 15.8m and its net assets Pounds 19.5m. The group also said it had agreed to pay Pounds 3m in settlement of a claim by the administrative receivers of Lowndes Queensway, the carpet and furniture retailer from which the Poundstretcher business was acquired.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan Vice Premier Ivan Gutsu stated that the  merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems was a  political move rather than an economic one. He suggested in an  interview with Interfax today that Kishinev [Chisinau] would  follow the experiment with great interest, however, Moldova did  not as yet intend to participate in it. Gutsu emphasized that  Moldova would strengthen its national currency unit -- lei, the  exchange rate of which had been stable for the last months.    "To have our own national currency does not harm economic  relations between the CIS states. Moreover, after the Moldovan  Parliament ratified the agreement on joining the CIS and the CIS  economic union signed by Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, these  relations will become closer. We will consider the issue on  participation in the customs union and in the single payment  zone," Gutsu said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the Four Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conservancy fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta conservatio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), a member of the family Branchinetidae, was described from specimens collected at the Jepson Prairie Preserve, located in the Central Valley east of Travis Air Force Base in Solano County (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). The animal ranges in size from 14 to 27 millimeters (0.6 to 1.1 inches) long and is most similar in appearance to Lindahl's fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However, the female brood pouch is fusiform and usually ends under abdominal segment 8 in the Conservancy fairy shrimp, whereas the pouch is cylindrical and usually ends under segment 4 in Lindahl's fairy shrimp. The large, oval pulvillus at the proximal end of the basal segment of the male antenna appears similar in both species, however, the terminal end of the distal antennal segments of the Conservancy fairy shrimp are distinctive (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Conservancy fairy shrimp inhabits vernal pools with highly turbid water. The species is known from six disjunct populations: Vina Plains, Tehama County; south of Chico, Tehama County; Jepson Prairie, Solano County; Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Glenn County (Joe Silviera, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993), near Haystack Mountain northeast of Merced in Merced County; and the Lockewood Valley of northern Ventura County (Michael Fugate, University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1991). The pools inhabited by the Conservancy fairy shrimp are large, such as the 36 hectare (89 acre) Olcott Lake at Jepson Prairie (Eng, pers. comm., 1990). The Conservancy fairy shrimp has been observed from November to early April. The pools at Jepson Prairie and Vina Plains inhabited by this animal have very low conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinity (Barclay and Knight 1984; Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). The Conservancy fairy shrimp is usually collected at cool temperatures and appears to be relatively long-lived (Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992; Patton 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The longhorn fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta longiantenna <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), a member of the family Branchinectidae, was described from specimens collected at Souza Ranch in the Kellogg Creek watershed, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of the City of Concord, Contra Costa County (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). It ranges in size from 12.1 to 20.8 mm (0.5 to 0.8 inches). This species differs from other branchinectids in that a portion of the distal segment of its antennae is flattened in the antero-posterior plane rather than the latero-medial plane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The longhorn fairy shrimp inhabits clear to turbid grass-bottomed vernal pools in grasslands and clear-water pools in sandstone depressions. This species is known only from four disjunct populations along the eastern margin of the central coast range from Concord, Contra Costa County south to Soda Lake in San Luis Obispo County: the Kellogg Creek watershed, the Altamont Pass area, the western and northern boundaries of Soda Lake on the Carrizo Plain (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990), and Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the Central Valley (Dennis Woolington, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). All vernal pools inhabited by this species are filled by winter and spring rains and may remain inundated until June. The longhorn fairy shrimp has been observed from late December until late April. The water is grassland pools inhabited by this species has very low conductivity, TDS, and alkalinity (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The vernal pool fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta lynchi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), a member of the family Branchinectidae, was described from specimens collected at Souza Ranch in the Kellogg Creek watershed, Contra Costa County, California (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). It ranges in size from 10.9 to 25.0 mm (0.4 to 1.0 inches). This species most resembles the Colorado fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Branchinecta coloradensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). There are several differences in the antennae of the males of the two species, including the basal segment outgrowth below and posterior to the pulvillus, which is ridge-like in the vernal pool fairy shrimp but is cylindrical and often much larger in the Colorado fairy shrimp. The shorter brood pouch of the vernal pool fairy shrimp is pyriform, whereas the longer one in the Colorado fairy shrimp is fusiform (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

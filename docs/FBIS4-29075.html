			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 (YONHAP) -- In the wake of North  Korea's abrupt decision to quit the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), hawkish voices are growing louder in the Japanese  Government calling for the United Nations Security Council  [UNSC] to adopt a resolution on immediate, rather than gradual,  economic sanctions against North Korea, a senior Foreign  Ministry official said Wednesday.    The official said, "Japan had demanded that the UNSC adopt a  warning resolution first before monitoring the situation and  passing a sanctions resolution against North Korea. But now  that North Korea has withdrawn from the IAEA, Japan does not  have any ground for proposing milder and gradual steps by the  international community."    At a recent meeting with South Korea and the United States,  Japan had proposed that the Security Council adopt a warning  resolution first before taking the second step of imposing  relatively mild economic sanctions. Under this proposal, if  North Korea did not accept IAEA inspections despite the U.N.  measures, the council would take strong action including  suspension of trade and remittances from Koreans residing in  Japan.    But with the Stalinist state's withdrawal from the IAEA, the  Security Council may adopt a strong sanctions resolution from  the outset that includes suspension of remittances by  pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan to North Korea, the official said.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Government may send Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa to the United States late this month to discuss  future measures after a U.N. resolution is adopted, as the  tension on the Korean peninsula continues to rise.    Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata talked with U.S.  President Bill Clinton over the telephone Tuesday, promising  that Japan will cooperate with the Security Council within the  limits of its Constitution if sanctions are slapped on North  Korea.</p>

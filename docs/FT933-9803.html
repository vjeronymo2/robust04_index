			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wholesale Fittings 19.5% fall WHOLESALE Fittings, which distributes industrial and commercial electrical products, finished the year ended April 30 with a drop of 19.5 per cent in pre-tax profits. However, the dividend is being maintained at 11.7p as the directors are confident that recent and continuing actions will maintain the strong financial base. Market share had improved and sales for the opening quarter showed a volume increase. The 1992-93 profit was Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 2.51m) from sales of Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 62.2m). Strict control of costs necessitated a 7 per cent reduction in staff as well as closure of the Telford branch. Earnings per share were 9.83p (11.7p). The final dividend is again 8.47p.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ares-Serono plunges 40% in third quarter Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based biotechnology drugs group, has reported a 40 per cent slide in net income in the third quarter to Dollars 8.3m, mainly because of a surge in research spending. Sales were flat at Dollars 149.6m, reflecting the group's rapid adjustment to the removal last year of many of its products from the approved medical list in the Italian market. R&amp;D spending rose more than a third to Dollars 35.1m, as the group stepped up its efforts in developing products in the field of immunology/oncology. Pre-tax profit fell 40 per cent to Dollars 10.4m.</p>

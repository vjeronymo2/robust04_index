			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japanese banks will beef  up their risk and subsidiary disclosure system from the coming  March book closing in line with proposals made Friday [25 March]  by a Finance Ministry panel. The proposals were made in an  interim report compiled by a disclosure study group under the  Financial System Research Council, an advisory panel to the  finance minister.    The report calls on financial institutions to improve their  disclosure periodicals, featuring recommendations to start  disclosing operational results at securities and trust banking  subsidiaries and to upgrade explanations of risk managements.    A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters, said the  Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan is to revise its  disclosure standard based on the report for its members that  virtually covers all private banks in Japan.    It will start with their business results for the current  fiscal year ending March 31, the official said.    Under the banking law, private banks are required to publish  the disclosure periodicals every year, and they follow the  standard decided by the federation.    While urging further improvements in disclosing information  on subsidiaries on a consolidated basis by parent banks, the  report stresses the need for securities and trust banking  subsidiaries to offer their own operational results.    "The significance of disclosure (at such subsidiaries) is  great because of their importance in management strategy (of  parent banks) and their large scale (compared with other  subsidiaries) and operational divergence with the parent  financial institutions," the report says.    Banks were allowed to enter securities and trust banking  businesses through subsidiaries in April last year under  financial system reform.    The Finance Ministry official said disclosure at those  subsidiaries will include earnings and assets. But the  recommendations are limited to domestic subsidiaries, and the  report leaves disclosure of overseas subsidiaries for further  study due to "diverse business fields and scale."    On risk management, financial institutions are urged to make  "easy-to-understand explanations" of their strategies and  systems on interest rate, credit and other risks, thus upgrading  from the current disclosure limited to their awareness of risks  and management of assets and liabilities.    But the report calls for further study on implementation of  a  numerical measurement of risks while closely following the  effects of "explanatory disclosure" and the ongoing  international discussions on such risk-management benchmarks.    The ministry official said the panel will set up a working  group on the issue.    Meanwhile, the report urges banks to make the disclosure  periodicals more "convenient and easy to understand" since they  are offered primarily to depositors at branch offices.</p>

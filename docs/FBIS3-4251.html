			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by staff reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447): </F> "More on the Two Conferences: Taking the Overall Situation Into  Consideration in 1994"]    [Text] A series of economic structural reform plans,  especially that for the tax-sharing system, have deeply touched  the deep-level issue of the interest relationship between the  central authorities and various localities. This topic  inevitably became the focus of discussion of central leaders and  local officials at the recent "two sessions" [National People's  Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference]. Against this background, the repeated calls of  major newspapers in Beijing for subordination to the overall  situation and strengthening macro regulation and control have  attracted even greater attention.    While attending National People's Congress deputies group  discussions as an observer, this reporter often heard officials  from underdeveloped areas ask the central authorities for  preferential investment and taxation policies, and officials  from developed areas also expressed their hope that the central  authorities would continue to "provide water for breeding fish"  and allow their localities to retain more revenue. The central  authorities, for their part, stressed that the most important  thing was for the whole nation to be of one mind, push forward  reform, establish the relevant mechanisms, and act in accordance  with the laws of the market. The central government repeatedly  stressed the necessity of controlling the growth rate and the  scale of capital construction, while a few local officials  continued to talk about grand capital construction plans a great  deal.    Should the whole nation be of one mind and be subordinate to  the overall situation? Or should the whole nation, like last  year, blindly compete for more construction projects and  investment and be overeager for quick success and instant  benefits, ignoring the impossibility of supplying funds and  materials, causing an imbalance in supplies, finance, credit,  and foreign exchange, further deteriorating inflation, seriously  affecting the improvement of comprehensive results, and landing  the economic development in a strange "hot" and "cold" cycle?  This question gives various localities much food for thought.    The reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and  investment structure has extensively touched upon many  deep-level difficult problems in ideological concepts, the  readjustment of interests, and specific operations. It has  involved the issue of readjusting the interest pattern by  breaking barriers between departments and between regions and  has addressed sensitive questions, such as the redefinition of  the scope of macro regulation and control, the scientific  division of the limits of authority in economic management  between the central government and local governments, and so on.  How can the strengthening of the central authorities' economic  management authority be ensured and can various kinds of power  in macro regulation and control be concentrated in the central  authorities while continuing to give play to the enthusiasm of  both the central authorities and various localities? This is a  problem which has not been properly solved ever since the  founding of New China and which has not yet been completely  solved despite attempts since the beginning of reform.    In view of the serious consequences of the overheated  economy  last year, rational Chinese have come to understand: Strict  control over the scale of fixed assets investment has a bearing  on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability  this year.    The central government hopes to benignly integrate results  with speed and build a market pattern with a unified standard by  formulating and promulgating the "Budget Law" to strengthen  macro regulation and control and to control the scale of capital  construction and the speed of construction in various  localities. Another means of macro regulation and control is the  tax-sharing system. According to the financial budget this  year, 75 percent of the value-added tax in various localities  shall be handed over to the central financial departments, and  this means the amount of taxes handed over to the state will  grow as speed increases. This move should result in more  effective macro regulation and control.    What is worthy of attention is that, according to the  financial minister's report, after the implementation of the  tax-sharing system, the growth rate of local financial revenue  will be higher than that of the central authorities, half of the  central financial revenue will be returned to the localities,  and the central authorities will not take away large amount of  financial resources from the localities. Therefore, local  governments have no reason not to favor the tax-sharing system.    This year, reform is facing a severe test. The situation  also demands the establishment of a sense of taking the overall  situation into consideration and demands a strengthening of the  central government's authority. This is because reform is no  longer characterized by spontaneously moving forward from bottom  to top and delegating power and interests from top to bottom; it  has moved on to unified coordination and organized  implementation from top to bottom. The process of reform has  changed from moving one single item after another forward and  conducting operations in batches to moving forward as a whole  and making breakthroughs around focal points. The establishment  of a sense of the overall situation is more necessary, and the  way to guide reform is shifting more and more from pushing  forward with policies to pushing forward with laws. It is  precisely this point that requires local officials to understand  that the central leaders have really given a great deal of  thought to stressing the establishment of the market economic  mechanism as the most important thing. They should not worry  about gains and losses that have resulted from preferential  policies, and it is also necessary to strengthen macro  regulation and control to do away with the practice of being  small but complete, to break regional monopolies, to give play  to the strong points of various localities, and to develop the  entire economy in a coordinated manner.    Adopting the policy of subordination to the overall  situation  and strengthening macro regulation and control do not mean a  return to the old path of the planned economy; rather, they mean  that the entire nation, with one mind and one goal, will  establish the operational mechanism of the socialist market  economy, and the central government will more effectively give  play to the means of macro regulation and control to ensure that  the entire economy will develop in a sustained, healthy, and  stable [chi xu jian kang wen ding 2170 4958 0256 1660 4489 1353]  manner.</p>

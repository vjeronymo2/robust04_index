			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dewar warns on pension funds SURPLUSES arising in the pension funds of nationalised industries should not be seen as a windfall for the Treasury, Labour said yesterday, arguing that gains must be used for the benefit of pensioners. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said pensioners were 'rightly suspicious' when they saw evidence that the Treasury 'had its eye on pension fund assets.' Trustees of British Rail's pension scheme are due to meet Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, today.</p>

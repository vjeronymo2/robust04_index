			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the NYSE, however, the efficiencies sought to be obtained by eliminating the differential charge on odd-lot limit orders would only be achieved if the odd-lot system was used in a manner consistent with traditional odd-lot investing practices of smaller investors rather than as a professional trading vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange has identified and informed its members about several practices that it believes are not consistent with traditional odd-lot investing practices and whose use constitutes an abuse of the odd-lot system. These practices include unbundling of round-lots for the purpose of entering odd-lot limit orders; failure to aggregate odd-lot orders into round lots; entry of both buy and sell odd-lot limit orders for purposes of capturing the spread in the stock; and order entry practices intended to circumvent the round-lot auction market. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See NYSE Information memo No. 91&hyph;29, July 25, 1991. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31048 (August 18, 1992), 57 FR 38706 (August 26, 1992), Odd-lot limit orders are executed upon the occurrence of the first round-lot transaction in the security, which is at or better than the specified limit, following receipt of the order by the odd-lot system. See NYSE Rule 124. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's proposal identifies additional types of odd-lot limit order trading which the Exchange believes are not consistent with traditional odd-lot investment activity and should not be permitted to use the odd-lot limit order service. Specifically, the proposal would preclude the use of the odd-lot limit order service, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  for (1) index arbitrage, (2) other types of program trading, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  or (3) any pattern of activity that would suggest day trading. Examples of this latter practice could include among other things, entering multiple off-lot limit orders to buy and sell the same security on the same day or odd-lot limit orders to buy and sell a group of stocks on the same day where it appears or is established that the intent is to capture the spread in these stocks by buying on the bid and selling on the offer. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Upon approval of this proposed rule change, the Exchange intends to advise its members and member organizations, through an Information Memo, that these types of trading practices may not be effectuated by means of the odd-lot limit order service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Such trading would not be precluded from using the odd-lot system if odd-lot market orders were utilized. Also, such prohibitions do not extend to PRLs (part of round lots) because they are executed outside of the odd-lot system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does permit odd-lot limit orders to be entered in conjunction with a program trade where such orders consist in the aggregate of a relatively small part of the overall program. The term program trading is defined in NYSE Rule 80A as either index arbitrage or any trading strategy involving the related purchase or sale of a group or basket of 15 or more publicly traded securities that have a total fair market value of $1,000,000 or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does recognize, however, that some types of buying and selling on the same day may be appropriate and cites as an example buying stock using an odd-lot limit order and subsequently entering a stop loss sell order against that position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing the NYSE stated that the limitations on use of the odd-lot limit order system are intended to address specific types of trading activity, and are not intended to limit access to, or use of, the system by individual market participants or any class of market participants for any authorized use of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal member organizations will be expected to establish appropriate systems to monitor odd-lot activity to ensure that the practices noted in the Information Memo are not engaged in. The Information Memo makes clear that the Exchange intends to initiate appropriate regulatory action if it finds that member organizations have permitted such trading practices, either for proprietary accounts or for the accounts of customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE's odd-lot order execution system is intended to provide efficient execution of odd-lot orders at the best prices available. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  The Commission agrees with the NYSE that the odd-lot limit order trading practices identified in the proposed Information Memo are not consistent with traditional odd-lot limit order investing practices. Such practices could undermine the integrity of the system and contravene the odd-lot order system's purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28837 (January 29, 1991), 56 FR 5660 (February 5, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this context, the Commission notes that the NYSE's odd-lot order trading system is predicated on the specialists' willingness to provide execution and price guarantees to odd-lot orders, the majority of which are entered for smaller retail accounts. These transactions are too small to be handled efficiently through the regular Exchange auction process. These orders generally are used by retail investors to buy or sell a small amount of stock and are not used in short term trading strategies. As a result, Exchange specialists are able to provide execution guarantees to odd-lot limit orders without charging an additional handling fee. The use of the system as a day trading vehicle or as part of program trades to capture the bid ask spread through odd-lot limit orders could reduce specialists' willingness to provide cost-efficient executions of odd-lot limit orders. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the NYSE to preclude use of its odd-lot limit order system for index arbitrage, program trading, and day trading. Ensuring the odd-lot limit order system is only utilized for the types of orders it was intended to accommodate will help to ensure the continued economic liability of the system which should ultimately benefit all investors consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

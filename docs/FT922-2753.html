			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (8): Small fare in the iron rice bowl - Industry: central planning still dominates a rigid system JUST outside the city of Yueyang in Hunan province is a new coal-fired power plant, built with British government finance by GEC and Babcock Energy of the UK, as well as Chinese contractors. Because the province's need for electricity was urgent, it was constructed at speed, However, from the first day of its operation late last year, the plant has made a substantial operating loss. Hunan province fixes the price at which it may sell electricity to the grid at Yn0.25 per kilowatt hour. But the cost of production is Yn0.35, in which a large element is the price of coal, fixed by the central government in Beijing. Provincial officials say that next year, the province will adjust electricity prices. Zhang Shang Zhi, the plant's manager, admits that he does not have much control over the situation but says that electricity prices should be freed step by step: 'We do not want the price to be completely freed because we are afraid of the inflation we had before.' Mr Zhang's predicament seems a potent symbol of the problems afflicting China's state-owned industries. In spite of the attempts to introduce greater efficiencies and to make managers responsible for their finances, even new factories run up against the rigidities built into the socialist, centrally planned economy. One third of state enterprises are loss-making and another third barely break even. The problems in the way of improving industrial efficiency include: absence of financial and managerial autonomy, poor management skills, production quotas set by the state, a rigid pricing system, overmanning, inability of wages to provide incentive to better performance, lack of proper accounting, failure of the banking system to assess creditworthiness before providing credit, and failure to use the bankruptcy law. Under the iron rice bowl policy, most industries remain completely responsible for the housing, medical care and pensions of employees and their families. Some industries have large stockpiles of unmarketable products and large bad debts. Subsidies and directed credits to these industries swallow a significant amount of the national budget, which is in deep deficit. Most daunting for reformers wishing to tackle state-owned industries is the fact that most of these problems are linked. It is difficult to address one without coming up against the need to address the rest. To attack all at once, in such a large country with industries spread nationwide, might seem almost an impossible task. In spite of the growth of privately-owned industry, especially in the south, and of local industrial enterprises run by villages or townships, medium and large industries owned by the central or provincial governments still account for about half of China's industrial output and for 18 per cent of the labour force. As a report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation notes: 'The government has been hesitant, in view of the enormous difficulties, to act decisively on the important issue of management/ownership of state-owned industrial sector and on fundamental reform to the price structure.' However, some measures have been taken over the past year. And following the new push to reform given this year by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, officials responsible for drawing up reform plans are talking with new determination about the need for reform. The contract responsibility system, under which managers take responsibility for their finances and may re-invest above-target profits in the business, has been in operation for some time but has had limited success. There is no clear way for responsibility to be taken for losses: very few businesses have been put into bankruptcy and many managers, like Mr Zhang, can do very little to avoid making a loss or are unable to streamline their workforces. There has been a move to put some industrial workers on contracts, but the vast bulk of them continue to be tied to the iron rice bowl. More recent actions include a reduction of mandatory production quotas, and adjustments to tax and depreciation rates. Fan Hengshan, senior economist in the central government's commission for restructuring the economic system, says that planners have to distinguish between different reasons for enterprises' making losses: poor management, the economic environment, or the political or systemic structure. Too little attention has been paid to managers' skills and to giving them a true role. Officials 'are too used to the planned economy and too used to taking over the responsibilities of managers', Mr Fan says. 'It is important to change the function of the government from giving orders to providing services, giving suggestions and working with them.' Mr Fan sees action being taken on various fronts. Because some factories are being closed down, creation of a social security system has become a priority. Price reform is proceeding, especially in grains. However, he sees improvement of the management of enterprises as the highest priority. As one means of achieving this, Mr Fan and other planners believe that the share-owning system should be introduced as widely as possible in state-owned industries. They see it as shaking up managements, separating management from ownership, and providing incentives to employees. Under most experiments so far, employees receive shares, which pay dividends if warranted, but they are not allowed to sell them outside the company. However, the aim is to groom companies for eventual stock market listings. Regulations designed to provide the backing for the new shareholding culture are due to be published soon. One of the main obstacles to reform of industry is the massive bureaucracy behind it; the dozens of ministries and other government agencies overseeing industry and commerce. Their officials enjoy the iron rice bowl and may resist reform of industry because they have an interest in maintaining the status quo. Relaxing the reins constricting China's industries, and nurturing managers' skills so that they can choose their products, materials, staff and pay levels, and marketing and financing methods, will be a challenge stretching over many years. In spite of the growth of private and rural industry, and the consequent smaller share of the economy taken by the state sector, it will be essential for the country's future economic health that the challenge is met.</p>

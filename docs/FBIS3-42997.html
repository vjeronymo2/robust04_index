Chernousov, Immunology Institute, Russian Federation  Ministry of Health; UDC 612.017.1.083.3(575.172)]    [Text] Much attention is currently being devoted to  indicators of the immune status of healthy people in different  regions of the country [1]. Persuasive evidence was obtained  indicating that the body's immune system reacts very sensitively  to various unfavorable effects, and it can be used to test for  these effects [3]. Indicators of the immune status of people of  different regions differ [1]. Such research has special  significance in the country's ecologically unfavorable regions  as a way of revealing the extent of the immune system's  disturbance and the need for purposeful clinical examination and  treatment and for measures by which to improve the health of the  people.    One of the ecologically unfavorable zones requiring special  attention is the Aral zone, including the Republic of  Karakalpakstan, where examination and treatment results for 1989  [2] reveal elevated morbidity characterized as the  immunodeficiency syndrome and as the autoimmune and allergic  syndromes (Table 1). Study of the immune status of the  population of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is required if we  are to plan measures to reduce overall morbidity.       Table 1.

Diagnostic questionnaire cards  developed by the Immunology Institute of the Russian Ministry of  Health [5] were filled out on each subject. Immune status was  evaluated in accordance with procedural recommendations of the  USSR Ministry of Health [5], including level I and II tests.  Determinations were also made of the concentration of the  rheumatoid factor, and of antibodies to thyroglobulin and  trinitrophenyl in blood serum by triphasic immunoenzymatic  analysis (IEA). The absolute and relative leukocyte and  lymphocyte counts were estimated by the commonly employed  procedure using Zadorozhnyy's stain, while T-lymphocytes and  their subpopulations were determined with monoclonal antibodies  obtained from the Immunology Institute using a flow-through  cytometer. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM was  determined by Mancini's method, while IgE was determined by the  IEA method. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils was evaluated on  the basis of absorption by latex particles. The t-test was used  for statistical treatment.  <H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>   According to WHO data diseases associated with disturbance  of  immune system function fall within so-called immunopathological  syndromes (infection, allergic, autoimmune). They manifest  themselves as chronic inflammatory diseases, as the absence of  resistance to infections, and as allergic and autoimmune  afflictions. Questionnaire results revealed that 37.3 percent of  the surveyed population suffers diseases falling within these  syndromes.    Table 2 gives the average immune status indicators for the  Karakalpakstan population, as well as for residents of  Semipalatinsk and workers of an antibiotics plant (Moscow) and  the Khimplast Plant (Nizhniy Tagil), used for comparison  purposes (the data were obtained by associates of the Immunology  Institute of the Russian Ministry of Health).       The first interesting thing analysis of the results shows is  an extremely low concentration of T-lymphocytes and their  subpopulations in Karakalpakstan residents in terms of both  percent and absolute content (see Table 2). While the  concentration of lymphocytes is 63.2 +/- 1.29, 70 +/- 0.7 and  62.02 +/- 0.45 percent in subjects from Semipalatinsk, Moscow  and Nizhniy Tagil respectively, for Karakalpakia this indicator  is 52.58 +/- 0.52 percent. The absolute number of lymphocytes in  subjects in Karakalpakia is also significantly reduced. The  concentration of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes among  Karakalpakstan residents is 39.8 +/- 0.46 percent, while in the  indicated cities (Semipalatinsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil) it is  34.4 +/- 1.1, 45 +/- 0.7 and 35.81 +/-0.39 percent respectively.  In this case the absolute number of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes  in Karakalpakstan residents averages only 498  cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. All of the indicated differences are  statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).    An evaluation of the frequency of deviations of the percent  and absolute concentrations of lymphocytes from average standard  values in Karakalpakstan residents (Table 3) revealed that the  lymphocyte count was less than 19 percent for 10.9 percent of  the subjects, the indicator was above 37 percent for only 6.03  percent of the subjects, and the absolute lymphocyte count of 33  percent was less than 1,200 cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. There were an  especially large number of people with an absolute concentration  of CD1[.sup]+[/]- and CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes below  standard indicators (53.2 and 64.6 percent respectively).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

2.5                  |4.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Phagocytic activity of leukocytes was significantly higher  among Karakalpakstan residents when compared with residents of  Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil: 85.4 +/- 0.56, 64.8  +/-0.86, 71 +/- 0.7 and 58.5 +/- 0.99 respectively. The  percentage of persons for whom the phagocytosis indicator was  above standard values is 65.8 for Karakalpakstan residents (see  tables 2, 3). Such an increase in phagocytic activity is  possibly associated with a source of constant infection.    Evaluation of the B-system of immunity in Karakalpakstan  residents revealed a significantly higher concentration of IgG,  IgA, IgM and IgE than in the residents of the cities used for  comparison. Thus, while the concentration of IgG, IgA and IgM in  residents of Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil was 1337.4  +/- 21.8, 1313 +/- 27 and 1095.3 +/- 13.17 for IgG, 190.3 +/-  6.82, 215 +/- 9.1 and 220 +/- 5.7 for IgA, and 156.7 +/- 5.3,  140 +/- 5.1 and 144.4 +/- 4 for IgM, these indicators for  Karakalpakstan residents were equal to 1497.6 +/- 17, 265.3 +/-  5.6 and 167.1 +/- 3.9 respectively. The percentage of people for  whom these indicators were above normal was 1.14 for IgG, 17.8  for IgA and 12.9 for IgM (see Table 3). The percentage of  persons with hypoglobulinemia did not differ from the union-wide  value.    Additional research characterizing activity of the immune  system did not reveal gross disturbances, and the levels of the  rheumatoid factor, antibodies to thyroglobulin and  trinitrophenyl fluctuated within normal limits.    The morbidity structure of the Karakalpakstan population is  dominated by autoimmune diseases, which exceed union-wide  indicators by 2-8 times, while the frequency of diseases falling  within the infection syndrome exceeds the union-wide indicator  by 2.5-4 times (see Table 1).    When taken together, these figures are very similar to  laboratory data and morbidity indicators obtained in surveys of  elderly people [4]. It may be hypothesized that the residents of  the indicated regions are exposed to unfavorable factors that  lead to the described changes in immunological indicators, which  manifests itself phenomenologically as early aging and as  diseases associated with immunodeficiency. However, additional  research will be required to establish a direct relationship  between this morbidity and disturbance of the immune system.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   1. The relative and absolution numbers of T-lymphocytes and  their subpopulations are reduced among residents of the  Karakalpakstan Republic.    2. A higher concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE and  higher phagocytic activity of leukocytes are typical of  residents of the surveyed region.  Bibliography    1. Alekseyev, L.

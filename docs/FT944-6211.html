			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Amendments in wake of changes in accounting - Profit-related pay The rules governing profit-related pay schemes are to change with the aim of ensuring that, after a recent change in accounting practice, tax relief for PRP can continue to be linked as closely as possible to profits which genuinely reflect the efforts of the employees in the scheme. Under the proposed changes, the following could be taken into account or left out of account in drawing up profit and loss accounts for PRP purposes: profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation; costs of a fundamental restructuring having a material effect on operations; profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets; the tax effects of any of these items. The proposed changes will replace the current treatment of 'extraordinary items' for PRP purposes. This will apply to profit and loss accounts for profit periods beginning on or after the date of Royal assent to the finance bill. The PRP legislation provides that 'extraordinary items' may be left out of account, or taken into account, in drawing up profit and loss accounts for registered PRP schemes, notwithstanding the accounting requirements imposed by the Companies Acts. At the time the legislation was introduced, 'extraordinary items' were defined, in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 6 (SSAP 6), to include a range of items which could not be said to reflect the efforts of the workforce. The recent replacement of SSAP 6 by Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS 3) has altered the definition of 'extraordinary items'. Many items which might previously have been treated as 'extraordinary' for accountancy purposes may no longer be so treated. That change makes it more difficult for businesses to draw up PRP schemes under which PRP is closely linked to profits which genuinely reflect employees' efforts. The Inland Revenue announced in July that this change would require an amendment to the tax legislation. The chancellor proposes to replace the reference to 'extraordinary items' in the PRP legislation with a reference to the following three categories of 'exceptional items', which FRS 3 requires to be shown separately on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit: profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation; costs of a fundamental restructuring having a material effect on operations; profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets.</p>

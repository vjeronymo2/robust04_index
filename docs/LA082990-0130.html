			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS ACCUSE D.A. OF GOP POLITICS IN PROBE OF SECURITY GUARDS AT POLLS;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: CAPIZZI DENIES CHARGES AND SAYS U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE REVIEWING  FINDINGS IN '88 INCIDENT TO DETERMINE IF CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED.  </P> <P> A group of Latino community leaders angrily charged Tuesday that Dist. Atty.  Michael R. Capizzi is playing politics with his department's criminal  investigations by not resolving a civil rights case involving Republican  officials who support his election campaign.  </P> <P> At a press conference, 17 Latino representatives complained that it has been  nearly two years since county and federal authorities began investigating  whether Republican Party officials working with Garden Grove Assemblyman Curt  Pringle's campaign violated civil rights laws by hiring uniformed security  guards at polling places on Election Day in 1988.  </P> <P> They pledged to keep public pressure on the issue by forming a new organization  called Americans for Constitutional Justice that will organize pickets at  political events -- especially Capizzi's -- beginning Thursday.  </P> <P> "We have concluded that the district attorney is prejudiced, biased and is  either conspiring to protect those responsible for hiring, instructing and  posting the uniformed security guards or is incompetent," said Rueben Martinez,  a Democratic activist and leader of the group.  </P> <P> Latino leaders charged that some Latino voters were intimidated by the guards  and did not vote. Republican officials involved in the decision -- including  members of the county GOP Central Committee and Pringle's campaign -- say the  guards were hired in response to rumors that illegal voters were being bused in  by Democrats.  </P> <P> "First there was the conspiracy by some county Republicans to deny Hispanics  the right to vote," Martinez said. "Is there now a second, even more serious  miscarriage of justice by the district attorney preventing a proper criminal  investigation?"  </P> <P> Capizzi said Tuesday that the investigation is substantially complete and the  findings are being reviewed by federal authorities in Washington to determine  if charges should be filed. He also said that to avoid the appearance of a  conflict of interest, he turned over the authority for the case to Deputy Dist.  Atty. Wallace J. Wade last fall.  </P> <P> "I can speak from my perspective that politics are not involved," Capizzi said.  "It sounds like maybe from their perspective, the answer would be different."  </P> <P> Capizzi, a Republican who is facing a run-off election for the district  attorney's post after being appointed to the seat last January by the Orange  County supervisors, also said he did not believe that it was improper for his  office to conduct the investigation while he is seeking election.  </P> <P> "The district attorney's office is a nonpartisan office, so I don't think  there's any conflict at all," he said. "There is no legal basis for my  non-participation."  </P> <P> Wade said his office gave its findings from the investigation to federal  authorities before June.  </P> <P> "I know they're considering a couple of things that I'm not at liberty to  discuss, but how it's going to come down in the final analysis, I don't know,"  he said.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors in Santa Ana declined to comment on the case and others in  Washington were unavailable Tuesday.  </P> <P> Martinez said Americans for Constitutional Justice is a bipartisan  organization, and one woman attending the press conference identified herself  as a registered Republican. Several members, however, are Democratic activists  including Martinez and Evelyn Colon Becktell, who is running against state Sen.  Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) in the November election.  </P> <P> Martinez said the group is not affiliated with Capizzi's opponent in the  November election -- Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James Enright -- or with  Pringle's Democratic opponent, Tom Umberg.  </P> <P> He also said the organization has renewed a request made last fall to state  Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to intervene in the investigation because of a  conflict of interest in the district attorney's office. The group is also  asking for inquiries into the length of the investigation by the Orange County  Grand Jury and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.  </P> <P> Rep. James Bates (D-San Diego) has already asked that Congress conduct an  inquiry into why the investigation has taken so long.  </P> <P> "We have been cheated; we have been lied to; we have been denied our dignity as  American citizens; we have been treated without respect; we have been made  fools long enough," Martinez said.  </P></p>

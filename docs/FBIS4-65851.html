			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic Populist  Party's [SDPP] deputy group chairman Nihat Matkap criticized the  return of Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar to his  position today.    `No one should expect us to accept this situation,' Matkap  said.    Tasanlar was removed from his position after the roughing up  of demonstrators and SDPP Deputy Salman Kaya by the police  during the May Day celebrations in Ankara. He was reinstated  today as the investigation on him proved him to be not guilty.    In a written statement Matkap said that the government  agreement of the SHP and senior coalition partner True Path  Party [TPP] had promised to remove all obstacles on  democratization of the Turkish society.    He recalled that civil servants and workers who sought their  rights have been beaten up by the police over the last six  months, while the shariah (Islamic law) supporters who stoned  the U.S. Embassy and TPP headquarters were allowed to carry out  their rallies in the streets without police retribution.    `Most recently, press members and participants of the May  Day  celebrations were beaten up,' he said, adding that one deputy of  their party was also beaten up the same day.    `As a consequence of these unfavorable developments, the  security director was removed from his post, was returned and it  should be recalled that a number of deputies from our coalition  partner had been opposed to his removal at that time,' he said.    Meanwhile, a statement by the Ministry of the Interior said  today that Police Chief Mehmet Okur, officers Mithad Budak and  Suleyman Yalman will be tried on charges of police brutality for  the beating of Kaya.    If convicted, they will receive prison terms ranging between  three months and three years and suspension of their civil  servant status.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Nigerian finance minister sacked Nigeria's military government yesterday sacked the finance minister, Mr Kalu Idika Kalu, architect of the country's suspended economic liberalisation policy and leader of a lobby for deregulation. Mr Kalu's sacking was reported in the government-owned Daily Times newspaper. There was no official announcement and no reason given. No replacement has been named. His dismissal may be part of a reshuffle in which the ruler, General Sani Abacha, has fired senior military officers. In 1986, Mr Kalu negotiated with the World Bank and introduced stringent reforms, opening the way for new loans and debt rescheduling. He was a lone voice for free market policies in a civilian cabinet at first dominated by supporters of government regulation of the economy. He then became sidelined by the increased role of the military since Gen Abacha seized power last November. In January Mr Kalu had to present a 1994 budget that contradicted his own policy prescriptions and ended Nigeria's eight-year experiment with structural adjustment.</p>

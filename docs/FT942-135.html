			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Observer: Get real Brazil's army has taken to the streets again, but the troops and armoured cars on display are this time guarding the country's new currency rather than planning another coup. The currency, the Real, comes into force tomorrow and the Central Bank has called in the army to ride shotgun as it distributes the newly minted notes and coins to state and private banks. The exercise has proved to be one of the country's biggest security exercises since Brazil's criminals specialise in mass hold-ups of armoured cars. Although the changeover has gone reasonably smoothly, the army may still be asked to restore public order next Monday when many Brazilians will have their first chance to change their old notes for new. The problem is that the banks, the stock exchange and indeed the whole country will close in the afternoon because that's when Brazil is playing in the next round of the World Cup.</p>

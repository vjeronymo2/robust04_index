			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Loss cut at Applied Holographics Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted maker of hot stamping foils and embossed holograms, cut pre-tax losses by Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.62m for the year to March 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 5.19m to Pounds 4.89m. Mr David Mahony, chairman, said that a significant contributor to last time's loss was the US subsidiary, Applied Holographics Corp, which was a cash drain on the company. That company was now jointly-owned with CFC International, a Chicago-based foil and coating company, and has been renamed CFC Applied Holographics. It was now trading at break-even, Mr Mahony said. The foil company, Transfer All Purpose Foils, continued to maintain market share in depressed conditions both in the UK and continental Europe, he said. Losses per share were 9.1p (17.3p restated).</p>

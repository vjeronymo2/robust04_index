			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining or molding processes. AAMA stated that its definition is consistent with the statute and an improvement over the proposal in that it (1) eliminates the conflict between regulations and normal business practice, (2) eliminates the ability of a manufacturer to generate a considerable amount of U.S./Canadian value added for the assembly operation that the proposed regulations would allow prior to the ``final assembly,'' (3) eliminates ability of a manufacturer to shift value added simply by establishing ``transfer'' prices for all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment that is produced prior to ``final assembly,'' and (4) eliminates the burden on a manufacturer associated with changing systems simply to meet NHTSA's proposed definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also recommended that the agency change the proposed definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> final assembly point, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in a manner consistent with its recommendation concerning the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> final assembly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That commenter also stated that the proposed definition creates ambiguity by introducing the term ``pre-final assembly,'' and that the proposed regulation does not state how this equipment is to be treated for determining origin. AAMA recommended a specific definition for ``final assembly point.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford stated that it agrees that in-plant pre-assembly and manufacturing should be included in the domestic and foreign content of the vehicle and the value treated as operations of an allied supplier. It argued, however, that the proposed definition of ``final assembly'' goes beyond the point that most manufacturers track parts cost. Ford stated that operations performed at the final assembly point, including body assembly and painting, are usually not contained in the manufacturer's final assembly bill of material. Ford argued that in-plant pre-assembly should include only machining, stamping, molding operations, and engine or transmission assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIAM stated that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and vehicle body are fastened together. That organization argued that the Labeling Act defines final assembly as the time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included.'' AIAM stated that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect to the automotive manufacturing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota also argued that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and vehicle body are fastened together. It stated that for any vehicle, regardless of the sequence of assembly operations, there is always a point where the engine is united with the body. According to Toyota, section 210(f)(14) defines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> point of final assembly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in terms of completeness. That commenter argued that the proposed final assembly points for the body and chassis are inconsistent with the Act because all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of the vehicle are not yet present and included with the vehicle at those points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota also stated that the point of final assembly must serve as the point before which assembly labor is included in the calculation and after which it is not. That manufacturer stated that the proposed regulation is not clear with respect to whether labor used in manufacturing the body after the point at which it emerges from painting but before it is attached to the chassis or cradle is included or excluded. Toyota stated that only by specifying a single point of final assembly can this technical problem be solved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other foreign vehicle manufacturers made similar comments. Nissan stated that an appropriate point to be identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just before the attachment of the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly begins should be defined as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would be more consistent with the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point,'' where all components and parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda took a different position in its comment. That manufacturer stated that it strongly supports the agency's proposal to treat in-house production of parts and components as if the equipment were produced by an allied supplier. Honda stated that this is necessary for consistency among manufacturers. Noting that the agency proposed to define  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> final assembly point <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a particular phase in the assembly process, Honda stated that the proposed treatment of this issue is sensible. According to that manufacturer, defining ``final assembly point'' as the moment in the process at which the body leaves the paint shop is generally appropriate. However, Honda requested clarification of this definition with respect to the substantial additional ``pre-final assembly'' work that remains to be performed on its vehicles' doors after the body leaves the paint shop. Honda argued that door subassembly labor should be included within computation of U.S./Canadian value added, and stated that it assumes this subassembly labor would be included under the proposed regulation because the work is performed off the main assembly line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW stated that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body leaves the paint shop. That company commented that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented, however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages. That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires, and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that the comments concerning the proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and ``final assembly point'' raise two important, related issues: (1) What operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly'' and therefore excluded from parts content calculations, and (2) Whether the proposed regulation distinguishes such operations in a manner that is appropriate for all manufacturers. As discussed below, after considering the comments in light of these two issues, the agency has concluded that definitions along the lines of those recommended by AAMA should be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

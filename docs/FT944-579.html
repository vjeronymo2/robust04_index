			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Private View: 'Oh no, it wasn't like that at all . . .' - Snow White, alive and well in the Black Forest, tells Christian Tyler how her life has been misrepresented by Disney and the press Following the princess's instructions, I crossed the Rhine at Strasbourg and drove south down the E35 Autobahn. After 30kms or so I turned the car's nose towards the distant hills of the Black Forest, still shrouded in morning mist. For half an hour I motored through a picture-book landscape of sloping pastures and timbered farmhouses with overhanging eaves and elaborately carved balconies. 'Follow the signs to Willingen,' she had said. 'You'll find us on the edge of the woods above . . .'(she named a village, begging me not to reveal it). 'Take care on the bends,' she added. 'I dented the BMW coming up the other day.' The woods in the little valley had been cut back to make room for a cluster of what looked like municipal starter-homes. But the cottage beyond them was instantly recognisable, even though the turf had gone from over the porch and the facade had been rendered in pebble-dash. There was a burglar alarm above the mullioned window. I crossed the stream and parked beside a pink glass-fibre flamingo which stared into an ornamental pond. A modern extension projected into the back yard where a circular clothes-line swayed under the weight of many small garments. Having heard the scrunch of tyres on gravel, the princess was waiting at the door. She was thick-set to the point of plumpness and her hair was grey. But her movements were graceful and her manner was confident. Behind the old-lady spectacles, the beautiful eyes were wide and candid; her complexion, the legendary complexion, looked as smooth as a girl's. 'Come in, come in,' she said gaily. I ducked and entered the poky front room, startled to see how little it had changed. There were knick-knacks on the mantelpiece, an oil cloth on the table and a television and video recorder tucked discreetly under the staircase. For the rest, the place was defiantly antique, as if the world had not moved in 57 years. The princess made coffee and I came quickly to the point. Have you seen the video that Disney has just released, I asked. 'We thought it charming,' she replied, 'quite charming. But not very accurate.' She sighed and smiled in the same breath. What vexed her most, strangely enough, was the film's treatment of her stepmother, the wicked queen. 'You know, I am certain she never meant to harm me,' the princess declared firmly. 'She was jealous, of course, of Papa's affection and she did behave very badly. But it was me who decided to run away from home. I was rather naive in those days,' she added with a coquettish glance. What about the disguise, I said, and the poisoned apple? The princess laughed. 'Oh, the pedlar outfit wasn't any sort of disguise. She was frightened of meeting the boys, that's all. But she wanted to see if I was all right and she brought me a few little things: some pink laces, and a comb - and the apple.' Which nearly killed you. 'Well, yes. But it could have been something else I'd eaten.' According to the original story, I said, your stepmother was invited to the wedding, was given a pair of red-hot shoes and made to dance until she dropped. 'Good gracious, no]' exclaimed the princess. 'Really, one can't believe anything one reads in the papers these days. People are not as horrid in real life as you people seem to imagine.' I was stung by the rebuke, but forbore to quote my impeccable source. 'No,' she continued, 'mother did rather overdo things - she loved parties, of course - and she put her back out, poor thing. She died not so long ago: a choking fit, the doctor said.' This was disappointing news. I began to wonder if my journey had been a mistake. Princess, I said, you are called 'Snow White', aren't you? 'Well, it is something similar. Schneewitchen is what darling Papa used to call me.' What is your real name? The princess looked prim. 'I think I should not answer that,' she said. I asked her about the seven dwarfs and her countenance softened once more. The 'film people' had taken liberties with their characters and names, she said. I thought it wise not to repeat some of the names the Disney studio first came up with: Flabby, Goopy, Gabby, Nifty, Jumpy and Awful. 'The boys were rather hurt, because they were never so untidy or ill-mannered as they were made out to be. But I think they saw the funny side.' The gold mine (it is a diamond mine in the film) had been closed by the owners, she explained, and 'the boys' had been offered redundancy cheques. They had formed a workers' co-operative and with help from the bank had continued mining until the better seams were exhausted. The bank refused, however, to put up the investment needed to open new galleries. So what do they do now? It was a story which has become familiar all over Europe. The one we know as 'Doc' had taken up medicine and was running a successful practice in a village near Schonwald. 'Happy' had a public relations job with the Black Forest tourist board, while 'Sneezy' had moved to Basel where he tested anti-histamines for a well-known pharmaceutical company. As for 'Grumpy' ('not Grumpy, please, he is a sensitive person'), he owned a woodworking studio nearby where he and a couple of apprentices turned out high-quality souvenirs - rustic chairs, cuckoo clocks and so forth - for the summer tourist trade. Every Sunday he played the church organ. Less fortunate were 'Bashful' and 'Sleepy'. Officially unemployed, they made a modest living as local handymen and landscape gardeners. They were the only two who still lived permanently at the cottage. 'There is a little money left over from the mine and I help when I can. So you cannot say any one of us is badly off,' the princess said. I coughed apprehensively and asked about 'Dopey'. Snow White clapped her hands. 'You would never guess, now, would you? Go on, guess]' I scrabbled for an answer that would sound neither offensive nor yet unrealistic. The princess laughed triumphantly: 'A computer programmer - in Stuttgart]' So it is just the three of you living here now? 'What do you mean?' I shifted uneasily, uncertain how I was to introduce the topic. I mean, I said, after you and the prince, er. . .went your separate ways. 'You have been misled,' said Snow White, and her eyes flashed. 'Where do you get such information? Well, really]' So it's not true? 'Of course it's not true] We live very happily, always at the Schloss, and I come over here as often as I can to keep an eye on things.' I'm sorry, I said. It's just that I read. . . 'I shall forgive you. It is no secret that Karl can be a little. . .difficult sometimes, especially now that he has retired from the bank. But then so can I. We are none of us getting any younger. I should say we are still very much in love.' You didn't know each other very well before you married. . . 'No we didn't, not at all. It was love at first sight, everyone knows that. It may not be fashionable to marry so quickly these days,' she continued, her lips pursed. 'I notice also it is not so fashionable to learn good manners at table. That does not make it wrong.' At the end of the film, I said, he carries you off on his horse towards a fantastic castle. Was that Neuschwanstein, which mad Ludwig II of Bavaria built? 'That's right. Karl was a little naughty, pretending to me to own such a place. I think it was because he loved me and wanted to make a big impression. He had only rented it for the wedding and the reception, and of course our first night.' Snow White looked down demurely. Millions of people all over the world feel nostalgia about your story, I said, especially at Christmas. Do you feel nostalgia too? 'About the big forest, I do. Oh, and for the little animals, which were so tame and so sweet. They are too afraid to visit us now.' Do you have any regrets? 'I was lucky to be born as I was, and I had some bad things happen, too. But no. The world has changed very much, of course, but in so many ways it is better.' She waved her hand round the room. 'What use is regret? We have money enough, we play and sing, we have our jokes. And we shall all be here together for Christmas. Look, I am making a special pudding.' How do you feel about the old days? 'You know, it is so long ago. For me it is like. . .like a fairy-tale.' And you lived happily ever after? 'Well, why not?'</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE REFERENDUM SOUGHT ON VOTER APPROVAL OF CITY'S GENERAL PLAN  </P> <P> The Lawndale Planning Commission will ask the City Council to hold a citywide  referendum in November on a much-debated ordinance that requires the city to  submit its General Plan to a vote of the electorate.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected at its March 16 meeting to decide whether to put  the controversial law, known as Ordinance 82, on the Nov. 7 ballot.  </P> <P> Ordinance 82 was adopted by the City Council in 1963 in response to a  successful petition drive. It requires the city to seek voter approval for  Lawndale's General Plan, a formal document that sets forth the city's  development goals and development guidelines.  </P> <P> If there is a vote in November and Ordinance 82 is approved, the General Plan  could go before the voters in April, 1990.  </P> <P> Although it was adopted in 1963, Ordinance 82 was never followed because the  state attorney general's office in 1974 issued an opinion stating that the law  was unconstitutional. Relying on that opinion, the City Council in 1976 adopted  the city's first General Plan by a 4-1 vote. It did not go before the  electorate.  </P> <P> In the past year, Lawndale activists Steve Mino and Herman Weinstein have  challenged the 1974 state ruling, saying that a legal opinion cannot overturn a  law adopted by initiative.  </P> <P> Mino and Weinstein urged city officials to seek a re-evaluation by the state.  They were elated when, in December, state legal officials reversed themselves  and issued a finding that the 1974 opinion was "erroneous."  </P> <P> The December opinion, written by Deputy Atty. Gen. Rodney O. Lilyquist, has  broad implications that could affect all development in Lawndale, according to  City Atty. David J. Aleshire.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, we believe this issue must be resolved either through the courts  or through the ballot box," Aleshire said in a 15-page analysis prepared for  the Planning Commission's meeting Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The new opinion raises a number of significant legal and practical questions,  including whether voters today would agree with the thrust of the 1963  petitions, Aleshire said. "It is unclear whether Ordinance 82, which was never  voted upon (by the electorate), would reflect the political sentiments of  Lawndale residents today," he said.  </P> <P> Also at issue, Aleshire said, is whether Lawndale has a valid General Plan  since it was not adopted by the electorate. State officials have declined to  express an opinion on that, Aleshire said.  </P> <P> In his memo to the commission, Aleshire argued that the four-year time limit  for residents to challenge the plan has expired. "Applicable statutes of  limitations bar any challenges to the 1976 General Plan," he said.  </P> <P> Mino, in an interview Thursday, said he supports the Planning Commission's  recommendation that Ordinance 82 be placed on the Nov. 7 ballot.  </P> <P> He said he does not oppose the plan itself, but believes residents should be  able to vote on whether to adopt it. He said plan changes such as variances and  zone exceptions are made too readily by the council, and should also be subject  to a citywide vote.  </P> <P> City officials and residents generally agree that, as Aleshire said, the 1976  plan "is out-of-date and needs major revision."  </P> <P> A series of hearings should be held to solicit public comment and help achieve  community consensus on development goals, said Gary McDonald, chairman of the  Planning Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revised General Plan  </P> <P> Regardless of the outcome on Ordinance 82 -- whether or not the General Plan is  subject to voter approval -- the city should proceed as rapidly as possible in  updating the General Plan, McDonald said.  </P> <P> If the council puts Ordinance 82 on the November ballot and voters ratify it, a  revised General Plan could be ready for voter consideration in April, 1990,  McDonald said.  </P> <P> It could cost as little as $5,000 to put Ordinance 82 on the Nov. 7 ballot,  which also will list local school district candidates, he said. But if each  resident is to be provided a copy of the voluminous General Plan, the city's  costs could mount to as much as $200,000, he said.  </P> <P> The commission Wednesday ducked the question of whether amendments to a future  General Plan, or to the General Plan adopted in 1976, should go to voters.  </P> <P> The recent state opinion said that Ordinance 82 does not contain a requirement  for a citywide vote on plan amendments.  </P> <P> In an attempt to cover amendments, Aleshire drafted a proposed ordinance that  would require a vote of the electorate on "major" plan changes, which he  defined as those that would affect more than five properties or a substantial  part of any portion of the plan.  </P> <P> But the Planning Commission voted 5-0 to reject the proposal. Now the City  Council must decide whether plan amendments should be submitted to the  electorate. This would be a cumbersome process that could drastically slow down  development in Lawndale, Aleshire said.  </P></p>

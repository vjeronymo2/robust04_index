			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Time is running out for improving relations - Agreement is still far off in the merger talks between the professional bodies Time is running out for a secretive series of discussions between the principal UK and Irish accountancy bodies. Regardless of the outcome, the clock may also be ticking for the very future of these bodies themselves. At several gatherings on the relatively neutral territory of KPMG Peat Marwick's Salisbury Square offices in London, senior representatives of the six leading professional bodies have been trying to find some common ground over the last few months. Top elected officials and secretariat staff have come together from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima). The chairman of this working party is David Bishop, a partner in the management consultancy practice of KPMG, and the immediate past president of the Certifieds. His specialism is change management. This job is probably the hardest he has ever taken on. It is an unusually powerful gathering. The names of the different organisations are hard to squeeze into a single paragraph. Their combined membership is about 200,000. And the amount of time and effort put in by their senior figures to collaborate is probably unprecedented. But it may all be wasted. Fundamental questions still divide many of those assembled round the table. And they have just one more meeting next week before producing in mid-November a final report from the incompatible proposals in the draft discussion documents now circulating. What is most remarkable to any outsider who cares to take an interest is that there are so many professional accountancy bodies; and that there has been no significant merger since 1957, when the Society of Incorporated Accountants merged with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Since that time, there have certainly been some bloody attempts. All have failed. The Scots spurned combination with the English institute in 1989, partly from fear of being subsumed by a Sassanach body. Discussions between the English and the certifieds in 1988 and Cipfa in 1990 also foundered. Most painful was the 1970 attempt between the certifieds and the English institute. Its failure led to the creation of the cumbersome Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), nominally representing the six organisations, but staffed and chaired by the English institute, which also dominates CCAB's representation on international bodies. Ever since a gulf has opened up, widened by new, alien forms of training - such as masters of business administration - poaching recruits who would have traditionally become accountants; and by growing competition between the bodies in marketing their qualifications in this country and overseas. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the original timetable, in which the Bishop working party was to report back in July, has been delayed. It has been only through careful diplomacy that all the participants have remained around the table up till now. It would be nothing short of a miracle if they emerged in agreement at the end of this month. Two principal models are up for discussion. The first is rationalisation: combining the different bodies while supposedly preserving their different strengths. It is the approach favoured by the English institute, which argues for fewer bodies in the public and members' interests. It is apparently endorsed by Cima, but would probably require separate regional bodies for Scotland and Ireland. The second model is harmonisation: to increase co-operation while maintaining separate identities. The Scots maintain their reservations about being swallowed up and turned into a regional administrative body with control in London. Their traditional ability to be flexible would be lost. The other bodies also have serious doubts about how effective full-scale merger would be in the short-term, and would prefer to move in that direction more slowly. As a result, there is a complex array of intermediate approaches, with closer involvement on issues such as training, ethics, discipline and international affairs, while the governing bodies remain separate or delegate some partial authority to an over-arching body. But these debates have become a sideshow to what many see as the main motivation behind the discussions: the destruction by the English institute of the certifieds. There is growing disillusionment with the way the process has been handled. At its crudest, this is a class issue: the smooth old-school ties of the chartered accountants who moved through university and training-while-earning with accountancy firms, against the more aggressive, opportunity-seeking bovver boys who often had to fight much harder to gain chances to train. It is reflected in a snobbishness in some quarters about the perceived need to maintain the value of the chartered accountancy qualification. But that attitude has also led to the complacency from which the English institute is now suffering. The certifieds have seen their reputation, student numbers and financial strength grow in recent years, both in the UK and overseas. Travel to eastern Europe, China and even some accountancy firms in Britain, and their qualification has become the one of choice. As their own enrollment has dropped off, the chartereds have jealously fought back, though not entirely successfully. They began a programme of training outside public practice, though just a few dozen have taken up the idea. They have launched a foundation headed by a former ambassador to provide assistance in eastern Europe. There is a review of training under way, reflecting the need for far greater flexibility in both subject matter and how training is structured. The indications are that the English institute has no interest in merging with the certifieds except on extremely dominant terms. What some believe it wants to do is to take on the association, either by swallowing it entirely or merging with other professional bodies so it can attempt to defeat it in head-on competition. Critics point to efforts at the CCAB by the English institute to steamroller through rationalisation as a topic for discussion; and to conduct market research on members of the bodies with questions deliberately phrased to elicit responses suggesting rationalisation as the only answer. There are certainly legitimate points for debate about the certifieds: the nature of the exams, how they are marked, how often people are allowed to re-take them and still qualify, and so on. Equally, there are arguments about the sustainibility of the Scottish and Irish bodies as separate entities, and about the nature of the qualification at Cipfa, which focuses on a sector in flux. None of the bodies can claim anything like perfection in the services they provide. Combining any of them would require careful compromise. There also is a more fundamental question about whether accountancy is truly a cohesive profession with a core that can be accommodated in a single body or set of exams. But the arrogant atmosphere that many of the bodies seem to be detecting in the current discussions is not conducive to constructive resolutions. A change in this attitude is necessary if anything in the public and members' interests is to emerge.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Keating to act on Aborigine land rights MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is to present draft legislation to his cabinet on Monday setting out a system for deciding land claims lodged by Aborigine groups. The legislation could then be delivered to parliament in a matter of weeks. In Canberra yesterday, Mr Keating said the proposed legislation would allow Aborigine groups to choose either federal or state jurisdictions, recognised by the Commonwealth, for the hearing of native title claims. Some states had argued that all native title decisions should lie in their hands. However, Mr Keating added that decisions over the economic use of native title land would remain exclusively with Commonwealth-approved state tribunals. 'Existing grants of interest will be validated and be secure, and the states and territories will continue to have the capacity to manage land if they meet the standards of the Commonwealth bill,' he said. Mr Keating indicated that native title could, under the government's legislation, co-exist with some existing leasehold titles, but he did not detail which leases would come under this category. Aborigine groups have been pushing to extend an earlier proposal that mining leases should be the only significant class of leases not to extinguish native title. They have been seeking to ensure that native title could sit alongside pastoral, tourism or forestry leases, and revive once these expired. The issue of Aborigine land rights has been contentious for the past 18 months. In May 1992, the High Court quashed the notion that Australia had been unoccupied before European settlement and indicated that native title could apply where Aborigines had maintained close association with the land. This prompted an outcry from the mining industry, generated concerns among international investors and pitted some state governments against the Commonwealth.</p>

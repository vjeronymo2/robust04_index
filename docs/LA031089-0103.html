			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AVOIDS IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ROBERTI;  </P> <P> ROBBINS OPPOSES GUN BAN, YET DOES NOT VOTE  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) on Thursday could have joined a majority of his  colleagues in voting to approve a controversial bill to ban the sale and  possession of military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> Or he could have sided with opponents of the bill by Senate President Pro Tem  David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Instead, he abstained from casting a vote on the measure, which was approved  and sent to the Assembly by a 27-12 margin.  </P> <P> "I did not want to make any comment critical of Sen. Roberti," Robbins said.  Even though Roberti pressed him to support the measure, Robbins said: "I didn't  feel I could give him what he wanted, but I felt that the kindest I could be .  . . was to sit quietly at my desk."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Roberti Unaffected  </P> <P> Roberti acknowledged that he urged Robbins to support his bill but did not  consider it "untoward pressure." He quickly added that he was not offended by  his colleague's abstention.  </P> <P> The bill would ban the manufacture, sale, general possession and transfer of  semiautomatic military assault weapons, such as the Soviet-designed AK-47. It  is sponsored by top law-enforcement officers throughout the state.  </P> <P> While he did not object to the measure on the floor, Robbins in an interview  criticized Roberti's bill and said he opposes gun controls.  </P> <P> Robbins said that if Roberti's proposal is approved in the Assembly and signed  into law by Gov. George Deukmejian, it would be a step toward further  restrictions on guns.  </P> <P> "I feel that this bill which deals with weapons like the AK-47 could  potentially be used against individuals and law-abiding citizens who have small  weapons for protection in their homes," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constituents Speak  </P> <P> Robbins said that calls and letters to his office have overwhelmingly opposed  Roberti's bill. He said the tally was 1,361 against and 398 for the measure.  </P> <P> While Robbins was abstaining, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), a former Los Angeles  police chief, championed the opposition. He assailed the proposal as an  unconstitutional restriction on the right to bear arms.  </P> <P> Besides Davis, another San Fernando Valley-area lawmaker, Sen. Newton Russell  (R-Glendale), opposed the Roberti bill. In addition to Roberti, among those  favoring the measure were Sens. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Herschel  Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles).  </P></p>

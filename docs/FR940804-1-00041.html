			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1991, the State of California established the NCCP program to address the conservation needs of natural ecosystems throughout the State. The initial focus of this program was the coastal sage scrub community. The San Diego fairy shrimp is found in vernal pools and not coastal sage scrub. The San Diego fairy shrimp is being considered under the MSCP and MHCP programs. These programs, under development by the County of San Diego and its coastal cities, are being integrated as components of the NCCP program. However, these programs are still in the developmental phase, and it is uncertain as to what degree they will be successful in providing protection for this species. For example, two alternatives of the MSCP (coastal sage scrub and public lands) would not provide adequate preservation for the San Diego fairy shrimp because much of the shrimp's habitat (vernal pools) would be excluded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the discharge of fill into waters of the United States, including navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other waters. The Clean Water Act requires project proponents to obtain a permit from the Corps prior to undertaking many activities (e.g., grading, discharge of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps' jurisdiction. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit Number 26 (see 33 CFR 330.5(a)(26)) to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands totalling less than 10 acres. Under Nationwide Permit 26, proposals that involve the fill of wetlands less than one acre are considered authorized. Where fill would adversely modify between 1 to 10 acres of wetland, the Corps circulates a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine whether or not an individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than 10 acres of wetlands. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require the avoidance or mitigation of environmental impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, unless when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resources would be adversely affected by the proposed activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Diego fairy shrimp could potentially be affected by projects requiring a permit from the Corps under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Although the objective of the Clean Water Act is to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters'' (Pub. L. 92&hyph;500), which include navigable and isolated waters, headwaters, and adjacent wetlands, no specific provisions adequately address the need to conserve candidate species such as the San Diego fairy shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even if the Corps establishes jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over vernal pools, this does not ensure their protection. At least two vernal pool complexes under Corps jurisdiction in San Diego County have been destroyed or degraded without a section 404 permit (Jim Dice, Calif. Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data files). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act can incidentally afford protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp if they co-exist with species already listed as threatened or endangered.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pogogyne abramsii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (San Diego mesa mint),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pogogyne nudiscula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Otay Mesa mint),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Orcuttia californica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (California orcutt grass),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eryngium aristulatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> parishii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (San Diego button celery), and the Riverside fairy shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Streptocephalus wootoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are listed as endangered under the Act and occur in the same habitat as the San Diego fairy shrimp. However, these species are generally not found in the same vernal pool complexes as the San Diego fairy shrimp. The Riverside fairy shrimp and San Diego fairy shrimp co-exist in only three vernal pool complexes in San Diego County. Within a vernal pool complex, the San Diego fairy shrimp does not often occur in the same pools as listed species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  president of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska,  told SRNA [Bosnian Serb news] agency this evening that the Serb  side would support Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  proposal on establishing a one-year cease-fire in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and on solving disputed issues through  arbitration. Saying that Kozyrev's initiative "deserves great  attention," Krajisnik added that the Serb side would support it  "if arbitration agents who will reach a just solution are  found." Krajisnik stressed that the Serb side believed that it  was necessary to agree on a cessation of hostilities and replace  the war with political negotiations, but without "prejudicing  solutions."    "We would be ready to accept arbitration, but the Serbs have  had negative experiences with the work of the international  community which has on several occasions displayed bias and  sided with the Muslims," the president of the republic of Srpska  assembly said. "In any event, we advocate the establishing of  peace and talks, but without a solution being imposed on any  side in the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik  said.</p>

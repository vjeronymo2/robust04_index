			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWISS TO HUNT CEAUSESCU'S HIDDEN FUNDS  </P> <P> Several Swiss lawmakers pledged help Sunday in tracing money that Nicolae  Ceausescu reportedly hid in Swiss banks, but they said there was not yet proof  any money had been transferred to Switzerland.  </P> <P> Heinrich Ott, one of seven Swiss Parliament members meeting with Romanian  officials, said there were reports that the executed Communist dictator had  deposited $400 million in gold in Swiss banks before his ouster Dec. 22.  </P> <P> Other reports suggested assets totaling up to $1 billion may have been smuggled  to Switzerland or other foreign countries, Ott said.  </P> <P> Heinrich Rittmeyer, another lawmaker, said the process of finding Ceausescu's  missing millions could take years.  </P> <P> Ott said a Swiss inquiry into possible Ceausescu bank accounts included asking  central banks in other countries to try to trace Romanian funds transferred to  Switzerland.  </P> <P> "We are all convinced that if it can be verified that there is a fortune of the  Ceausescu family, it must be returned," Ott said. "We have a moral  responsibility."  </P> <P> The delegation, which included lawyers and doctors, also discussed Swiss aid to  Romania, Ott said.  </P></p>

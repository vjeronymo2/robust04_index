			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood warning Shares in Sherwood Group, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks maker, fell 19p to 151p yesterday after the directors warned that 1993 profits would be hit by tough trading conditions in Europe. The group, which relies on overseas sales for about half its turnover, said the adverse effect would not exceed Pounds 1.3m. Pre-tax profits for the year, to be announced on March 28, are not likely to be below Pounds 18.4m. The directors expect to increase the final dividend to 1.9p, giving 2.9p (2.6p) for the full year. In 1992, pre-tax profits were Pounds 16.9m on turnover of Pounds 143.5m. Sherwood said conditions in Europe had continued to deteriorate in the last quarter, particularly hitting the Dutch and German lace operations of Dentex. The managing director of Dentex had resigned, and a restructuring plan was being put in place. In addition, greater than expected losses were incurred on the closure of its German curtain operation.</p>

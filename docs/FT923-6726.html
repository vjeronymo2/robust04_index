			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Baghdad buys Australian wheat Iraq has used part of its gold reserves to buy about 900,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia since the end of the Gulf war, Mr Clinton Condon, chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, said yesterday, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Mr Condon said Iraq used gold bullion to pay for most of the wheat, delivered in a number of shipments over the last 18 months. line The deal would be worth about Dollars 135m at yesterday's asking price of Dollars 150 per tonne. Mr Condon said further sales to Iraq were expected, in spite of Baghdad's unpaid debt of about ADollars 600m (Pounds 226m) for wheat delivered on credit before imposition of UN sanctions after the war.</p>

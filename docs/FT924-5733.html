			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Lower interest rates depress growth at Lowndes Lambert LOWER INTEREST rates restricted growth of pre-tax profits at Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broker, from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 4.24m in the six months to September 30. Interest receivable fell to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 2.79m), mainly because of lower rates. Lowndes, which listed its shares on the Stock Exchange last year, increased earnings per share to 10.9p (10.4p) and the interim dividend to 4.5p (4.2p), helping push its shares up 11p to close at 300p. Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said good progress was made 'despite the hostile economic climate, both for UK-based activities and most of our overseas subsidiaries.' The group reported an increase in brokerage fees and commissions to Pounds 25m (Pounds 23.6m). Growth was particularly strong in the UK, where brokerage income expanded by 15 per cent. Mr David Margrett, managing director, said rises in UK commercial insurance rates, which averaged between 15 and 20 per cent, over the last six to nine months had helped. Although Lowndes saw reduced activity in its speciality business of broking professional indemnity cover for architects, it had increased its involvement in other professional areas. Income from marine and aviation business advanced by 11 per cent on the back of hardening rates and greater market share. Expenses rose from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 24m, amounting to 96.2 per cent of brokerage compared to 98.5 per cent in the same period last year. Share of associated companies' profits rose to Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 5.72m), partially reflecting the disposal of an investment by Lowndes' part-owned French subsidiary. Associated companies generated profits of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 863,000).</p>

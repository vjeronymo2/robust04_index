			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Capt Lt A. Chebotarev: "Running on the Razor's </F> Edge"]    [Text] They stood surrounded by shore patrol and police.  The young AWOL seamen looked at them fearfully. This time their  attempt was unsuccessful. But is there a guarantee that there  won't be another?    Mass flight of young seamen from units and from ships began  around the Spring of 1990. It was then that talk went on about  the insolvency of the ruling party's military policy, and about  the inability of the leadership of those days to solve the  country's concrete problems. But the CPSU ceased to exist, and  the Soviet Union followed it into history. However, the problem  of desertion grew even more acute. Now not only young seamen but  also ones with a year or two of service were fleeing. The  reasons were the most diverse--from a sick mother to jeering and  humiliation. But the main causes were disorganization and  impunity.    I'm not about to analyze the state of affairs in this area,  but I would like to describe the things I've witnessed, and my  experiences on a few occasions when I took part in court  examinations as an inquisitor.    It is said that a few years' work in court was enough for  Balzac to write for decades about the human passions he had  witnessed. This came to mind as I looked at a familiar young lad  standing under escort. I was to process several detainees  through the military medical board. One of them, unwashed and  suffering scabies, evoked pure human pity in me. It was not  until the following day, when he called out my name, that I  remembered who he was--he had changed that much. The story is  tragically simple. Before joining the army he got in with some  criminals. They stole everything they could get their hands on,  along the entire southern Crimean shore. Then he was drafted.  Upon graduating from his training subunit he received the rank  of junior sergeant.    He didn't have much longer to serve. Even so, he ran away.  Back in with his criminal friends. More stealing. It all ended  with a high-security prison colony. Moreover the trial was held  at the time when he would have been returning home from service.  He had a choice, and he made it.    Last summer a seaman went AWOL off a neighboring ship. An  officer rode out after him, found him, but too late to bring the  runaway back to the unit. Perhaps out of the joy of having  liberated himself from service, the former seaman got drunk and  then went to the river for a swim. Whether he jumped in or dove  in, I don't know, but he broke his back. His mother weeps,  naturally, the grief is so great. She blames herself for not  making him stay in, it would have been better if he had finished  his tour.    The most widespread means of flight is with the  participation  of parents. I'm certain that had it not been for relatives, many  wouldn't even have thought of going AWOL. As far as I know, the  passports belonging to civilian Smirnova and Mr. and Mrs.  Poalelunzh, held as a pledge against their son, are still lying  in the safe in the commander's office.    After working 5 years with the personnel I became convinced  that the runaways often develop a reluctance to serve because  they were not prepared for service. The young person leaves the  safety and warmth of his home for a life of hardship.  Sweepdowns, physical loads, and then rough handling by others  make their impact as well. Experiencing discomfort from the  disturbance of the accustomed rhythm of life, the seaman seeks  solutions, of which there are two. The first is to get a hold of  one's self and serve out one's tour normally. The second is to  go back, back home, where one's parents are always waiting. Upon  returning home, as a rule the AWOL seamen go to the military  commissariats and procuracies. There statements are always the  same--they were belittled, they were humiliated. Then, after the  runaways are reassigned to their respective military units,  their complaints disappear. Such was the case in my experience  with seamen Smirnov, Yesipov and Makhanov.    I've always wondered about one thing: Why, after so many  years of existence of the runaway problem, hasn't a system of  effective measures to prevent such violations and avert their  consequences not been developed?    There are many questions, but no one is offering any  answers.  As always, officers and warrant officers end up having to carry  additional loads. But isn't this out of their line?</p>

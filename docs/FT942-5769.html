			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / VAT rebate claims for hospitality under threat Over-enthusiastic claims by companies for rebates of value added tax on business entertainment expenses yesterday prompted HM Custom &amp; Excise to threaten a clampdown on corporate hospitality. Custom &amp; Excise believes that goods or services bought for the purpose of business entertainment should not be eligible for VAT refunds, even if they are also partly used for other more serious and sober business activities. European and English law has long prevented VAT relief on pure business hospitality, but it has left a grey area when it comes to other business activities which include an element of entertainment. In the light of a series of contradictory VAT tribunal and court judgments, Customs said yesterday it would put all appeals on entertainment-related cases on hold while seeking guidance from the courts. The problem started with Plant and Repair (South Wales), a small Cardiff-based company, which tried to claim back as office expenses some of the VAT on its costs for maintaining a box at Cardiff Arms Park, the Welsh national rugby stadium. The company insisted it used the box primarily as an office and only incidentally for entertaining clients at the weekend. The VAT tribunal was unconvinced and forbade any rebate. It took the same sceptical view of a rebate claim from Thorn-EMI, which asked for its VAT back on some of the costs of running its hospitality chalet at the Farnborough Airshow. But the High Court upheld the company's claim in March, arguing that its chalets were temporary offices and that it was possible to apportion its expenses between business and entertainment costs. Customs said yesterday it would take the case to the court of appeal, while conceding in the meantime that companies may claim back VAT on their non-entertainment costs. It also said it would consult companies to assess their views. Mr Andrew Ball, a tax partner with accountants Touche Ross, said: 'It is extraordinary that Customs is appealing.' He added that he did not believe most companies offering corporate hospitality at events such as Wimbledon or Glyndebourne even attempted to claim VAT rebates. Those affected were more likely businesses attending trade fairs. Whatever the ultimate finding, it will have little impact on Plant and Repair and its box at Cardiff Arms Park. The company has since gone into liquidation.</p>

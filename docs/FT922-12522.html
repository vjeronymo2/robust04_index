			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez slips 18% LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French water and construction group, yesterday announced an 18 per cent fall in net profits in 1991 from FFr1.42bn in 1990 to FFr1.17bn (Dollars 210m). The decline was due to a steep increase in provisions on its leisure sector construction interests and on the Channel tunnel project. Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said the group was showing signs of recovery from last year's difficulties and that its net profits for this year 'will be close to the level of profits for 1990'. Lyonnaise which, like Generale des Eaux, the other big French water and construction group, has recently diversified into new areas of activity and different countries, had forewarned the stock market of the fall in net profits in January when it cautioned that profits might have been reduced by as much as 20 per cent. As a result its shares were relatively stable after the announcement in Paris yesterday, slipping by just FFr1 in a buoyant stock market from FFr514 to FFr513. The group was forced to make hefty exceptional provisions of FFr2.1bn last year mainly because of the effect of the economic slowdown on its leisure and hotel construction projects. It was also affected by the dispute over extra costs with Eurotunnel, its client on the Channel tunnel scheme, and by the poor performance of Westburne, its Canadian subsidiary involved with building materials and electrical equipment distribution. However, Lyonnaise, which has made a number of sizeable asset sales in the past year, helped to compensate for hefty provisions by making gains of FFr1.9bn on such disposals. At an operational level the group said that the economic climate had affected all its businesses in and outside France. However, turnover rose by 21.5 per cent to FFr87.5bn during 1991. The rate of turnover growth on a comparable basis - excluding the effect of changes in exchange rates - was around 10 per cent. Despite the decline in net profits, the board proposed holding the dividend at FFr10 a share, given the more encouraging outlook for the current year.</p>

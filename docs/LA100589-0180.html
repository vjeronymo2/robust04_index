			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAIIAN AIRLINES' UNIONS TO VOTE ON 5-YEAR CONTRACTS  </P> <P> The Newport Beach investor group bidding for ailing Hawaiian Airlines said  Wednesday that it has reached tentative agreement with all of the carrier's  unions on new five-year contracts that call for wage freezes in the first 36  months.  </P> <P> Approval of the contracts by the carrier's pilots, flight attendants,  machinists and other union workers in votes scheduled for this week would clear  the way for the completion of the sale of HAL Inc., the airline's holding  company. The buyer is a group headed by attorney J. Thomas Talbot and former  baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.  </P> <P> The buyout, which calls for the payment of $22 a share for at least 51% of the  airline holding company's stock -- at a total cost of $22 million -- is  contingent on the unions agreeing to wage and working-condition concessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holder Approval Needed  </P> <P> As of Wednesday, Talbot said in a telephone interview, outside shareholders  have tendered 233,000 shares, and the HAL board has agreed to sell 1.1 million  shares to his group, HAL Acquisition Inc, giving it control of 68% of the  holding company's 1,953,000 shares.  </P> <P> A subsidiary of Japan Air Lines holds a 20% stake in HAL through the purchase  last year of a large block of preferred stock. The Talbot group has not said  whether it will also try to acquire those shares. At $22 a share, buying all  outstanding shares would cost $43 million.  </P> <P> The acquisition also is contingent on the Talbot group securing financing and  on the approval of existing HAL shareholders. The holders are scheduled to meet  Oct. 23. Talbot declined to discuss the financing arrangements but said they  are expected to be in place Friday after the unions vote.  </P> <P> To accommodate the union ratification votes on the new contracts, HAL  Acquisition has extended the deadline for its tender offer until midnight  Tuesday, and Talbot said the deadline is likely to be extended through Oct. 23  if the unions accept the agreements.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> ONCE BURNED: Judging from his annual financial disclosure report, Senate  Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is still smarting from the firestorm of  controversy he sparked among Jews earlier this year by suggesting that at least  $330 million in U.S. foreign aid could be shifted from Israel to Eastern  Europe, Panama and the drug-fighting countries in Latin America.  </P> <P> In a special cover letter attached to his 1989 report, Dole emphasized that a  $2,000 honorarium he received from the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce  did not go into his pocket.  </P> <P> In fact, he said, the money never even touched his hands. "No honorarium from  this organization was accepted," he wrote, "but was donated instead directly to  charity by the sponsoring organization."  </P> <P> Dole reported no honorariums from pro-Israel groups.  </P> <P> FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Also in the quest for honorariums last year, Rep. Charles  Hatcher (D-Ga.) may have set a new record for the largest number of fees  received by a member of Congress in a single day. On June 19, 1989, Hatcher  took in 19 honorariums ranging in size from $150 to $1,000 each.  </P> <P> Total receipts: $4,400.  </P> <P> Just reading the list of Hatcher's benefactors on that day could inspire a  healthy appetite. They include the California Pear Growers, California Bean  Growers, California Beet Growers, California Apricot Growers, the Prune  Bargaining Assn., California Kiwi Fruit Commission and California Grape and  Tree Fruit League.  </P> <P> Hatcher's administrative assistant, Krysta Harden, explained that the groups  got together and invited Hatcher to talk with them at a joint meeting in  Sacramento shortly after he was appointed chairman of an Agriculture  subcommittee that holds sway over the domestic marketing of these fruits.  </P> <P> HOUSE CALLS: Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) was only 31 when he was  elected to the California Assembly in 1963. Now, his son Peter, 30, seeks to  follow in his father's footsteps -- by running for a seat in the Maryland House  of Delegates.  </P> <P> Peter Beilenson, a Baltimore physician, is challenging three incumbent  Democrats in the September primary. With three seats open, the three biggest  vote-getters will be nominated. In the heavily Democratic district, winning the  nomination is tantamount to election.  </P> <P> Beilenson, who would be the only physician in the Maryland Legislature, is  running on a slogan: "Baltimore needs a doctor in the House."  </P> <P> His father has advised him to go door to door, as he did in his own first  Assembly race. Beyond that, the younger Beilenson, a father of three himself,  said: "His biggest help is that he and mom baby-sit our kids so my wife can  join me campaigning."  </P> <P> OOPS! Although most members of Congress rely on their staffs or their  accountants to fill out the annual financial disclosure report, Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.) clearly does it himself.  </P> <P> On a page provided for them to list their "liabilities" -- mortgages, personal  loans and other debts -- there was a large ink blot. Something had clearly been  inked out.  </P> <P> And underneath, in hand-printed capital letters, was this notation: "Oops!  Wrong page."  </P></p>

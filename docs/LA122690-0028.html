			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF KGB BACKS DOWN ON TOUGH REMARKS  </P> <P> The head of the KGB, the Soviet security and intelligence service, sought on  Tuesday to soften the impact of his recent tough speeches with a renewed  commitment to political reforms at home and improved relations with the West.  </P> <P> Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, chairman of the Committee for State Security, as the KGB  is formally known, told a press conference that his harsh words, particularly a  weekend speech to the Soviet parliament, had been misunderstood and were not  intended as a call for a return to the grim regimes of the past.  </P> <P> "There is no return to the old ways, neither in domestic policies of the Soviet  Union nor in its relations with other states," Kryuchkov declared. "Even if  someone in this country did try to turn back, he would become bankrupt  immediately because we have entered a new phase in our forward movement, both  domestically and internationally.  </P> <P> "We are not going to shift into reverse, though certain corrections need to be  made in our developments. That's perfectly natural. Our course leads us forward  on the road of renovation and progress."  </P> <P> Only Saturday, however, Kryuchkov called for a return to the Soviet Union's old  economic system with its state ownership, central planning and government  management, arguing that this was necessary at least for a time to stabilize  the country.  </P> <P> He also criticized essential elements of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  planned reforms and said that the KGB was waiting instead for a new set of  orders giving it broader powers to pull the country out of its deepening  political and economic crisis.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov in addition accused the West, particularly the U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency, of attempting to destabilize the Soviet Union by further  undermining its economy, encouraging ethnic tensions and infiltrating the new  pro-democracy and free-trade-union movements.  </P> <P> Even the food that the West is now shipping to the Soviet Union, often at  reduced prices or financed by low-interest credits, is suspect, Kryuchkov  warned, for nearly half of it does not meet Soviet standards.  </P> <P> "As for my statement being controversial, this too is natural," he said Tuesday  at the outset of a Kremlin press conference. "It would have been strange indeed  if a speech by the chairman of the KGB were met with unanimous applause and  approval. Western countries differ in their understanding of what is happening  here -- there is both hope and apprehension."  </P> <P> With a smile and bonhomie that reflects his KGB nickname, "Cherub," Kryuchkov  continued for more than an hour in what a senior foreign policy adviser to  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bluntly described as "damage control."  </P> <P> "The cables we have received from our missions abroad about the reaction to  Kryuchkov's speech on Saturday have been disastrous, simply disastrous," the  official said. "What he said may have been well intentioned, but even at home  some people concluded that the KGB was longing for a return to the Stalin era.  </P> <P> "In foreign countries, everything he said was taken as evidence we were moving  toward that dictatorship (Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze warned about  when he resigned. Kryuchkov can't take his words back, but he had better  explain them. That was made clear to him by the president."  </P> <P> The U.S. State Department on Monday denounced Kryuchkov's charges as  "completely unfounded and inaccurate" and expressed concern that "such a senior  official would use such outdated and inflammatory rhetoric."  </P> <P> Confronted with the task of convincing skeptical audiences at home and abroad  that the gentler, kinder KGB of the past year and a half is not just a mask for  the same ruthless organization, Kryuchkov insisted that he had simply been  misunderstood.  </P> <P> He did not accuse the West of economic sabotage, as it had seemed from his  speech Saturday to the Congress of People's Deputies, he said, but  characterized the sharp practices of some Western firms as "akin to economic  sabotage, which is not the same thing."  </P> <P> "We are speaking about the firms that are insolvent themselves and that would  like to take advantage of the situation to make money," Kryuchkov explained.  "As long as Soviet business has not reached a sufficient level in its  development, it will be making mistakes, and we will have to learn by our  mistakes."  </P> <P> And the Soviet Union is "grateful, very grateful" for the Western assistance  and advice it is now receiving, he repeated several times, and Moscow does not  regard it as a way of subverting the country into full-scale capitalism.  </P> <P> Even his hard-edged warnings about increased espionage by Western intelligence  agencies, pursuing different tactics and using new techniques, need to be  understood properly, Kryuchkov said.  </P> <P> "Well, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, do we really think spies are dropping  out of the skies?" he said. "I wouldn't want you to think that we ourselves are  doing nothing in this respect. We are working too.  </P> <P> "And I can understand when the United States tries to evaluate the situation in  this country, to determine the direction in which we are moving, when they show  interest in certain problems like our nuclear potential. . . . So, they are  working, and the most important thing for them here is -- pardon me -- not to  get caught."  </P> <P> The KGB is, in fact, developing its contacts with the CIA and other Western  intelligence agencies and starting to cooperate, Kryuchkov continued. Recently,  it gave the CIA updated Soviet projections of likely casualties from a war in  the Persian Gulf, apparently based on its first-hand knowledge of the Iraqi  army, its weaponry and fighting capability.  </P> <P> The message of goodwill was the same on domestic issues -- and a marked  contrast not only to Kryuchkov's speech to the Congress of People's Deputies  but also to recent television appearances and newspaper interviews in which he  has warned of KGB preparedness to act, even with force and at the risk of  bloodshed, if the crisis here deepens.  </P> <P> "We will act in strict compliance with the law," Kryuchkov told a Soviet  journalist who asked about his plans -- left vague in his speech -- to deal  with what he called "destructive forces." "I believe the most important tool  will be political methods -- that is the main thing. . . .  </P> <P> "You can take any position now, but it is crucial that it be constructive," he  continued. "You can engage in a struggle, but it is important that this  struggle proceeds within constitutional limits. You can even say you are  against Soviet power and agitate against it. Still, this is not a crime. But if  you resort to violent methods, to unconstitutional means, then you become an  object for our activities."  </P> <P> If Gorbachev used his presidential powers to declare a state of emergency, to  rule by decree or to remove local or regional governments, the KGB would  implement those orders, Kryuchkov told the Soviet journalist, all the while  downplaying those possibilities.  </P> <P> "I worry about the situation in the country, about the possible course of  events, and as KGB people we are working on the different options for the  country's development," he said in that earlier interview. "I believe our duty  is not to allow any dictatorship, but to act within the framework of law.  </P> <P> "If things went wrong, however, the question of extraordinary measures might be  put on the agenda. I am confident if the president uses them, it will not be a  return to the past in any way. It will be just setting an order everybody is  missing, and the right, leftists and centrists are demanding it."  </P></p>

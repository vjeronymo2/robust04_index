			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Property: Delightful duo in the best of Bath WHOLE HOUSES in the magnificent Royal Crescent in Bath appear rarely on the market as only six have not been divided up. So, two on sale side by side at the same time represents an extraordinary opportunity. Most of the other houses in the crescent are begrimed in soot but numbers 21 and 22 stand out for their scrubbed Bath stone and for the famous yellow door of No 22. The Yellow Door Dispute was high theatre early in the 1970s when its owner, the redoubtable Annabel Wellesley-Colley, decided to paint it that colour. Why yellow, when all the other front doors were white or natural wood (as they remain)? She was protesting against the council's act of painting yellow parking lines on the 18th century pave in the crescent. She was taken to court but fought her case to appeal and, eventually, secured the right to paint her front door as she wished. And yellow it remains today - as are the lines in the street on the side next to the top lawn, for which residents pay Pounds 8 a year for their private use, behind rails and inside a ha-ha. Of all Bath's townscapes, the Royal Crescent gives the grandest sense of Palladio transposed to Somerset. Built in 1767-75 by James Wood the younger, it was the last part of the original schemes for Bath. It still astonishes for the contrast verging on absurd between the urban sophistication of its great curve and the quasi-country of the lawn and Victoria Park, even though sheep and cattle no longer graze there. One repaired to the Royal Crescent 'to breathe the fresh air of better company,' wrote Jane Austen, disparaging the vulgarity that, by her time, had taken over the Assembly Rooms and Pump Room in the centre of town. The two houses, on sale separately or together through Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley (0285-659771) at guide prices of Pounds 900,000 and Pounds 975,000, share a huge attraction. Both are in tip-top condition, re-leaded, re-plumbed, re-roofed, glazing bars put back and stone cleaned. Each has a self-contained basement flat, six bedrooms and six baths. The hall floors have diamond patterns in white Bath stone and black slate; and icing sugar plasterwork abounds. In this 18th century oasis, the living rooms will look their best if the new owners follow the Georgians and keep to polished floors and rugs. The view on the crescent side looks across the lawn down to the centre of Bath; at the back, it is up the hill through a forest of chimneys. The curve of the crescent makes the back gardens private, so that only the next-doors can see you sunbathing. Most of the street is round the bend. Who will live in one of the world's best addresses? For an extended family, the pair of houses would be a fine place. There is plenty of room to include grandparents, maiden aunts and unemployed young - and to give parties. That is what these grand houses were designed for. Help will be essential, but a cleaner can be found in Bath for around Pounds 3.50 an hour. And when mother tires of cooking, the dining room of the Royal Crescent Hotel makes an excellent, although not cheap, neighbourhood watering hole.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Recession forces new rise in PSBR GOVERNMENT finances continued to show the scars of recession last month as the public-sector borrowing requirement jumped to Pounds 2.18bn from Pounds 1.66bn in October and only Pounds 293m in November last year. The Central Statistical Office said the deficit for the first eight months of the financial year amounted to Pounds 22.3bn compared with Pounds 9bn in the same period of 1991-92 and the latest official forecast of Pounds 37bn for the total 1992-93 PSBR, announced in last month's Autumn Statement. November's deterioration in the UK's finances was slightly less than the consensus forecast on financial markets, where the figures had little impact because the government has overfunded its borrowing requirement so far this year. Looking ahead, however, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London, warned that a further worsening of the PSBR might lead to a tax-raising spring budget. Privatisation proceeds in November were close to zero for the second month running. Over the eight months to November, public borrowing, excluding privatisation receipts, was Pounds 27.1bn, nearly twice the Pounds 14.1bn of the same period of 1991.</p>

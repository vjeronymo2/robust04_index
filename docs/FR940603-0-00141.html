			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One example of an appropriate use of an exclusionary clause may be where there is a merger of two corporations served by two credit unions which will continue to serve their groups as they had prior to their sponsors' consolidation. Addition of an exclusionary clause to the field of membership of one or both of the credit unions may be the best way to clarify the division of service responsibility within the new corporate entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When an exclusionary clause is included in a federal credit union's field of membership, NCUA will strive to define as precisely as possible: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The identity of the group to be excluded; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the exclusion is to apply to the entire group or only to those who are actually members of another credit union; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the exclusion is to apply only to the current members of the group or to future members as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V_Special Situations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are some instances where, because of overriding policy, special common bond rules apply. To ensure quality service to as many low-income and senior citizens as possible, NCUA has established broader common bond rules for federal credit unions seeking to serve those groups. Further, to expedite service to groups in industrial parks, shopping centers, and similar areas, the documentation requirements for federal credit unions seeking to serve these groups have been simplified. Finally, to ensure consistency throughout the credit union movement, NCUA has centralized decision making for the corporate credit union program in the Central Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V.A_Low-Income Credit Union Groups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> V.A.1_General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A low-income credit union is defined in Part 701.32 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations as one where a majority of its members either earn less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or whose annual income falls at or below 80 percent of the median household income for the nation. In documenting its low-income membership, a credit union that serves a geographical area where a majority of residents fall at or below the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-income members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A credit union designated by NCUA as serving predominantly low-income members has greater flexibility in accepting non member deposits insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. It also may participate in special funding programs such as the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions if it is involved in the stimulation of economic development and community revitalization efforts. A credit union participating in the revolving loan program is also eligible for technical assistance. The requirements for participation in the revolving loan program are set forth in Part 705 of NCUA's Regulations. Only operating credit unions are eligible for participation in the revolving loan program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A federal credit union charter applicant meeting the definition of a low-income credit union should forward a separate request for low-income designation, along with appropriate documentation, at the time the charter application is submitted. A charter applicant's low-income designation will be based on its primary field of membership and not on its actual members as is the practice for operating credit unions. In most cases, if the credit union qualifies, NCUA will grant the charter and low-income designation simultaneously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A low-income federal credit union charter applicant may contract with a third party to assist in the chartering process. Even after the charter is granted, a low-income credit union may contract with a third party to provide necessary management services. Such contracts should be for a duration of one year subject to renewal. However, within three years of commencement of operations, the credit union should no longer require such services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> V.A.2_Special Common Bond Rules for Low-Income Federal Credit Unions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, a low-income credit union is chartered as a community or associational credit union. A low-income credit union that has a community common bond may include the following language in its field of membership: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Persons who live in [the target area]; persons who regularly work, worship, perform volunteer services, or participate in associations headquartered in [the target area]; persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress which are located in [the target area]; incorporated and unincorporated organizations located in [the target area] or maintaining a facility in [the target area]; and organizations of such persons.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recognition of the special efforts needed to help make credit union service available to persons in low-income communities, NCUA permits credit union chartering and field of membership amendments based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons. The association must be defined so that all its members will meet the low-income definition of Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. The association, in documenting its low-income membership, may use the same types of documentation as is currently permitted for determining whether a community is low-income under Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a proposed low-income community or associationally based federal credit union may include in its field of membership, without regard to location, another group constituting an occupational, associational or community common bond. Except for the operational area requirements, the proposed credit union must meet all the requisites for including the group in its charter. Moreover, the proposed credit union must take care to ensure that it will continue to meet the requirements for low-income status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> V.A.3_Special Common Bond Rules for Other Federal Credit Unions Seeking to Serve Low-Income Persons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interest of making credit union service available to persons in low-income communities, NCUA also permits any occupational, associational, multiple group, or community federal credit union to include in its field of membership, without regard to location, communities and associational groups satisfying the low-income definition of Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. The associational group may be formed for the sole purpose of providing eligibility for federal credit union service, but must comprise only persons meeting NCUA's low-income definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The federal credit union adding the low-income community or association must document that the community or association meets the low income definition in Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations, just as is required for a designated low-income credit union. A federal credit union adding such a community or association, however, would not be able to receive the benefits, such as expanded use of non member deposits and access to the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions, offered to low-income credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A federal credit union that desires to include a low-income community or association in its field of membership must first develop a business plan specifying how it will serve the entire low-income community. The business plan, at a minimum, must identify the credit and depository needs of the low-income community or association and detail how the credit union plans to serve those needs. The credit union will be expected regularly to review the business plan as well as loan penetration rates in the community to determine if the community is being adequately served. NCUA will require periodic service status reports on its service to the low-income community and may review the credit union's service to low-income persons during examinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.B_Retiree and Senior Citizen Groups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special common bond rules also apply for providing service to retiree and senior citizen groups. It is NCUA policy to encourage federal credit unions to bring credit union service to senior citizens (aged 50 and over) and retired persons. To help in this effort, federal credit unions may form associations of such persons for the sole purpose of providing eligibility for credit union service. Except for the minimum age requirement of 50, the definition of a senior citizen is left to the credit union's discretion. Moreover, the only documentation requirement for including such an association in a federal credit union's charter is a written request from the credit union; no request from the group or copy of the association's charter or bylaws will be needed. In all other respects, however, the requirements for including an association in a federal credit union's field of membership apply, including those relating to the credit union's operational area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.C_Employees at Industrial Parks, Shopping Centers, and Similar Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

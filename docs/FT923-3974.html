			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Profits leap to HKDollars 1.62bn at Hopewell Holdings HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 126 per cent jump in net profits to HKDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 209.6m)for the year to June, compared with HKDollars 718.9m a year earlier. However, the bulk of the rise in earnings was from one-off property sales and interest income from the proceeds of last year's HKDollars 5.8bn rights issue; their combined contribution came to more than HKDollars 900m. The figures were in line with expectations, having been artificially boosted by the sale of the group's Broadwood Road luxury residential development site just before the year end. This helped nudge up earnings per share by 1 cent to 42 cents, despite the dilution from the rights issue. Hopewell is going through a lull, while investors await returns from its big infra-structural projects in China and Thailand. Earnings are expected to increase in 1993, but only through further property disposals; and then in 1994, it will receive the first returns from its long-awaited Shenzhen-Guangzhou super-highway. The company said the first phase of the toll road would be open to traffic next year. This would ensure a sizeable early completion bonus equivalent to the toll revenue up to the contract completion date of June 30 1994. Analysts believe this could contribute about HKDollars 500m. Hopewell is developing commercial centres in 10 of the interchanges on the first phase. Meanwhile, it is finalising negotiations for the second stage of the highway which will stretch from Guangzhou to Zhuhai. The size of Hopewell's Shajiao 'C' power project was recently expanded from two to three 660MW units, as a result of soaring demand for power in Guangdong Province; the turnkey construction contract has just been signed. Power stations, transport networks and related property projects have become the three core operations of the group; other non-core assets will be sold to fund the company's aggressive expansion programme and provide some profit in the interim period. Hopewell will pay a final dividend of 16 cents, making a full-year payout of 30 cents.</p>

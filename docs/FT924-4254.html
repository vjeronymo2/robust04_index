			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: My Father's Vertigo - Dance The trappings which surround Amanda Miller's My Father's Vertigo for London Contemporary Dance Theatre - an incomprehensible title; a portentous programme note about 'the need to dwell' - are tiresome. They reflect something of the taste current in Frankfurt, where Miss Miller (American-born) works with William Forsythe's company. And, as with Forsythe's works, this obscurantism seems a ploy to disorientate the viewer. Yet what we saw on Tuesday, when LCDT gave the piece its first London showing, was choreography of real interest. The score is an atmospheric string quartet by Fred Frith: music that shimmers, is haunted by echoes and odd glissandi beneath its melodies. Miss Miller's writing (for a cast of five men and six women: uniformly excellent) stresses a sinuous, smoothly muscled language that can look at moments as if action is slowed down, its fluidity almost oily, its pulse irregular as movement slips forward and seems on the point of losing balance. As with Forsythe's work, there is emotionally potent lighting which shifts our perceptions about the dancers through arbitrary change. (There are also hints of the greyness favoured in Frankfurt in the costuming of men in grey tops, black trousers, women in grey frocks, black stockings). The dance style is unified by its insistance on flowing activity, even if its incidents do not at first seem to cohere. Yet as ideas are repeated, transferred among the cast, the choreography tells of a concern with how energy may move through a body, how muscular force is expended. The music's second movement proposes contrasting quartets for men and women, each with an observer watching from 'outside' the action as a dynamic and emotional counter-weight. A later duet between Andrew Robinson and Tom Ward is a fascinating conflict between opposing physiques. Towards the work's end, odd activity - Kenneth Tharp indulging in mute and mimed conversation - seems set to distort the mood. And with every switch of action, Miss Miller's movement world remains intriguing. Visually the piece is austere, very well lit. The spectral appearance of what I take to be a head of a women by Titian on the grey gauze backdrop is curious, but curiously effective. In matter of composition, My Father's Vertigo offers a subtle sense of form and language. It is a bold addition to the repertory, and, as I have mentioned, is danced with grand assurance by its cast. This second LCDT programme also includes Mark Morris's Motorcade - its dancing still not quite quick enough in musical response - and Rikud, last's years brutish acquisition from Liat Dror and Nir Ben Gal, which I prefer not to watch. London Contemporary Dance Theatre is at Sadler's Wells Theatre with this programme until December 5.</p>

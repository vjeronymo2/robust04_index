			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China has readjusted  the plan of launching its first "Fengyun 2" stationary  meteorological satellite due to an accidental event.    The event took place while the satellite was tested in the  technical zone, which damaged the satellite and the workshops on  the testing site.    The satellite was originally planned to be launched by the  "Long- March 3" carrier rocket in the Xichang Satellite  Launching Center recently.    China is making great efforts to complete the follow-up work  and ensure the full implementation of this year's launching plan.</p>

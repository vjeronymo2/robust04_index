			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KILLINGS MAR QUAYLE VISIT TO MANILA;  </P> <P> 2 U.S. CIVILIANS SHOT SHORTLY BEFORE VICE PRESIDENT ARRIVES  </P> <P> Gunmen believed to be Communist rebels ambushed and killed two American  civilians working at a U.S. air base today shortly before Vice President Dan  Quayle arrived to discuss the future of U.S. military installations here,  police said.  </P> <P> As Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, arrived, hundreds of leftists burned his  effigy and an American flag while chanting, "Bases out! Quayle go home!"  </P> <P> A Pentagon statement in Washington said the victims were civilian employees of  Ford Aerospace Corp., a contractor at Camp O'Donnell. The camp is a U.S.-run  facility about 50 miles north of Manila and 12 miles from the U.S. Clark Air  Base.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presidential Guard Killed  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a member of President Corazon Aquino's presidential  guard, about a mile from where she will meet with Quayle on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The attacks followed a series of bombings this month and came amid growing  opposition to U.S. military installations in the Philippines.  </P> <P> The Americans, whose names were not immediately released, slowed their car as  they approached a dump truck and a jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60 miles  north of Manila, police said. Six men sprang from the jeep and riddled the  Americans' car with gunfire, according to Police Lt. Pepito Pimentel.  </P> <P> The assailants then opened the car door and pumped bullets into the victims,  Pimentel said. The attack occurred about 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokesman for the Philippine Constabulary in  central Luzon island, said the assassins were believed to be members of the New  Peoples Army, which operates in the area.  </P> <P> In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James Rowe as he was driving to the  headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group in Quezon City, near  Manila. In October, 1987, rebels killed three Americans in simultaneous attacks  outside Clark Air Base.  </P> <P> The United States operates Clark, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller  installations in the Philippines, but there are increased calls for an end to  the U.S. military presence.  </P> <P> Quayle arrived in Manila about 7:30 p.m. from Japan for a visit expected to  focus on the future of the bases, which operate under a lease that expires in  September, 1991.  </P> <P> Acting Foreign Secretary Manuel Yan said Quayle was bringing a letter from  President Bush believed to include a proposal to begin talks on extending the  lease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Noisy Demonstration  </P> <P> Two hours before Quayle's arrival, about 150 members of the League of Filipino  Students and the Youth for Nationalism and Democracy reached the airport  terminal and began a noisy demonstration against the visit.  </P> <P> Protesters shouted, "Quayle go home, bases out!" and "Yankees go home!" They  carried banners reading, "Quayle visit -- a curse."  </P> <P> After negotiations with police, the group agreed to pull back about half a mile  away along the main road into Manila. Police estimated that the crowd grew to  nearly 1,000 by the time Quayle arrived.  </P></p>

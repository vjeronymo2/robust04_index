			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nazlan Ertan] </F>   [Text] Ankara--Azerbaijan's acceptance to sit at the same  table with representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh in peace talks in  Bishkek does not mean Baku has recognized this enclave as a  party to the Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijani Ambassador to Ankara  said Tuesday [10 May].    On the eve of the three-day peace talks hosted by  Kyrgyzstan,  Ambassador Mamed Novruz ogly Aliyev told the Turkish Daily News  that Azerbaijan still regarded Nagorno-Karabakh as part of its  territory and not as a separate party to the conflict. Novruz  ogly's remarks flatly contradicted those of Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the upper chamber of Russian Parliament, who was  quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Azerbaijan had  stated its readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as "one of  the parties in the conflict." Shumeyko's remarks coincide with  new Armenian attacks north and east of Karabakh and a new round  of peace talks in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, between  Parliament leaders from Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and  Kyrgyzstan, as well as representatives from Karabakh. "We have  sat at the same table with representatives of Karabakh in  international meetings before. We have no objection to their  presence. Be they of Armenian or Azerbaijani origin, they are  representatives of our people in this enclave and we are ready  to listen to their problems. But we do not recognize them as a  party to the conflict," Novruz ogly said.    "They are there as the representatives of Karabakh.  Nagorno-Karabakh has no Parliament and no parliamentary  leader," he said, referring to the self-declared Karabakh  Parliament that previously passed a resolution of annexation to  Armenia. "They will not have the same status at the table as  the other participants."</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Little hope of agreement on EC farm prices EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers last night held out little hope of reaching agreement this week as they started talks on farm prices and milk quotas for 1993-94, reports Reuter from Luxembourg. Although the Danish EC presidency was pressing hard for agreement, few ministers believed a deal was now likely because of the political uncertainty in Italy and a new French government. 'It's quite hard to see we'll get solutions in these circumstances,' said Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture The commission has proposed a relatively modest price package with reductions for cereals and other products agreed under last year's farm reforms, and a freeze for most other items. Milk quotas would be unchanged except for Italy, Spain and Greece which would get increases. Butter prices would fall 5 per cent. Danish officials said they would still try to forge a deal even if it meant stretching the meeting over several days.</p>

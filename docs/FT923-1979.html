			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT relief is limited MY WIFE and I have been in self-employed partnership for over 30 years. During this time, we have run three separate strands of activity under different trading names - each filing its own accounts, but with common resources operating from our flat. We made one of these a limited company because of the higher risk but it still operated without employees, and using the common facilities of the partnership. We have received an offer for the limited company and its one product activity. The Inland Revenue guidelines on CGT retirement relief for 'family businesses' indicate that relief is only available to full-time family directors. Over the years, the activity of the limited company has become the principal source although our other work as a self-employed partnership has continued inseparably from the limited company. Our drawings from the company go into our main partnership account (with all other income) on which we have always been taxed as self-employed people. Can we qualify for the CGT retirement relief if the limited company is sold? We are both over 60. You and your wife do not appear to satisfy the arbitrary criteria for relief under section 163(5) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. However, the solicitor who acts for you in the sale of the shares will be best placed to advise you, since he or she will have ready access to the relevant facts. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

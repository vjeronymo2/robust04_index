			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: FAT SUBSTITUTE  </P> <P> Question: For some time, I've been thinking of going on a diet because I know I  should lose about 40 pounds. But I've heard about a new product that is  supposed to look like fat and to taste like fat, but which doesn't have any  calories.  </P> <P> I think something such as this would make dieting much easier, and I'd like to  know if you have any idea when it will be available.  </P> <P> Answer: One of the nation's leading food producers is working on a product  called Olestra, which, as you say, is supposed to look and taste like fat but  is calorie-free. The product's technical name is sucrose polyester.  </P> <P> Although Olestra has been under development for several years, it will probably  take several more years before it reaches the market. There are always  rationalizations to delay going on a diet, but the best time is always now.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  strongly indicated Tuesday that the government will move to  raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent in the  planned sweeping tax reform.    Hata told the budget committee of the House of  Representatives that the tax burden should be spread thinly and  shouldered by as many people as possible in order to secure  fiscal resources in the face of the rapidly aging society.    He said the tax rate on consumption in Japan is the lowest  among the 25 nations belonging to the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD).    The remarks are the latest signal of the government's  intention to boost the ratio of indirect tax in the taxation  reform that the government has pledged to realize by the end of  the year.    The draft bills for the reform are scheduled to be compiled  by the end of June.    Hata also reiterated the next general election should be  held  under the new electoral system.    A government panel is drawing up a new electoral map in line  with the political reform law passed in January, which  stipulates the replacement of the current multiseat  constituencies with a system of combined single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation.    Hata, who leads the first minority government in four  decades, has repeatedly dismissed opposition calls for snap  polls under the old system to restore stable government.    Over questions of the economic conditions, Yoshio Terasawa,  Economic Planning Agency director general, said the nation's  economy has yet to get back on a recovery path.    Terasawa, while pointing to some bright signs, said the  economy is by and large in a slump, with capital investments,  corporate earnings and the employment picture remaining weak.    Asked about his view on the political realignment, Hata said  he is looking for a change to a bipolar political landscape with  the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a counteralliance as the  two major players.    He said the policy gap between the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan, SDPJ] and its partners  in the ruling coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has narrowed through policy discussions.    With the LDP being one major power, it is hoped that the two  leading players will control the political scene, Hata said.    The SDP walked out of the coalition after it was infuriated  by the formation of a new Diet group by some coalition members  without consulting the SDP.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Investment programme leads to loss at Division Shares in Division Group, the first UK virtual reality company to float on the main market, rose 8p to 146p yesterday, despite half-year figures showing a loss of almost Pounds 1m. The company warned a month ago that it would incur a deficit, tempering the news with the announcement of a strategic alliance with Hewlett Packard, the US electronics group. Division floated in May last year at 40p. The operating loss before tax and interest in the six months to the end of April amounted to Pounds 945,000. After Pounds 53,000 in interest received, the loss to shareholders was Pounds 982,000 or 2.6p a share. No dividend will be paid, in line with company policy. Turnover was Pounds 2.11m, against a comparable Pounds 914,000 and equal to turnover for the whole of 1993. Mr Iann Barron, chairman, said the loss reflected investment in product development and marketing. There had been signs of increasing maturity in the virtual reality - advanced computer simulation - market. In March the company delivered what it believed was the world's largest virtual reality system to Matsushita of Japan. A development team had been established in North Carolina and expenditure would continue at a high level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marat Zubko: "Russia Will Sink Reactors in Kara </F> Sea"]    [Text] Helsinki -- The Norwegian ecological organization  "Bellona" has found out the details of the forthcoming removal  from combat service of 150 nuclear submarines in the Northern  Fleet.    "Bellona" members Nils Bemer and Tomas Nilsen [both names as  transliterated] have gained access to Northern Fleet documents  which state that in accordance with the START II treaty within  the next few years Russia must destroy 150 nuclear submarines  with 278 reactors on board.    The authors of the report assert that so far only two  submarines have been dismantled in the Northern Fleet but that  nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactors of 34 ships.  The main part of the submarines will be dismantled in  Severodvinsk: There they will extract 206 reactors and 45,000  used fuel elements from the submarines' bellies.    The Norwegians claim that new dry docks and storage  facilities for radioactive waste, and moorings for the  submarines which have been written off are to be constructed on  the Kola peninsula.    The construction should have begun already but so far the  majority of establishments are at the planning stage, the report  says.    Of course, some of the fuel elements, the "Bellona" experts  estimate, could be sent to the "Mayak" storage facility in  Siberia. But what is to be done with the other fuel elements,  the reactors themselves, and their reactor rooms? In this  connection Bemer and Nilsen have the following to say:    "Of the documents we have read and the talks we have had  with  knowledgeable people it has become clear to us that the Russian  authorities have two possible courses of action. The first is  to return to the practice of submerging radioactive waste,  including reactors, in the Kara Sea, which Russian renounced a  few years ago. The second is to construct a major new storage  facility somewhere in the Northwest of Russia.    "However," the report's authors continue, "it is known that  the storage facilities existing on the Kola peninsula are  already full and there is no money to construct new ones. So we  believe that the most feasible option is connected with burying  the waste at sea. Perhaps that is why Russia is not signing the  London convention which bans the discharge of waste into the  seas and oceans...."</p>

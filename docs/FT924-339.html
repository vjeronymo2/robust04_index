			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Tietmeyer joins calls in support of ERM parities SENIOR European monetary policymakers yesterday sought to stave off market pressure on the European exchange rate mechanism. The comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, and Mr Henning Christophersen, European Community commissioner for economic and financial affairs, came as the Danish central bank trimmed two of its pivotal money market interest rates. Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday that there was no reason to change the parity between the D-Mark and the French franc. At the weekend, Mr Christophersen said he expected no change in the value of the Irish punt and Danish krone in the ERM, and forecast 'no exchange rate realignments in the next four months'. As currency traders and securities dealers returned to quiet continental markets after the Christmas break, the Danish central bank took advantage of the calmer conditions to cut the rates it uses to steer money market rates to 13 per cent from 14 per cent. The 1 percentage point reduction in the fixed yields offered by the Danish central bank in its transactions with 14-day certificates of deposit and on a 15-day money market repurchase deal followed a similar cautious relaxation of policy by the Irish Republic on Christmas Eve, when the Irish central bank cut its overnight support rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Quotidien de Paris, Mr Tietmeyer said that he saw no reason to overhaul the European Monetary System. He said that financial markets had failed to appreciate France's low inflation, balance of payments surplus, low wage costs and good competitiveness. 'The markets still have not grasped how strong the fundamentals are,' Mr Tietmeyer said. His remarks echoed comments made by Mr Christophersen in an earlier interview on German radio. The EC commissioner said there was a 'a very healthy, a very positive development with low inflation rates' in Denmark, Ireland and France. All three countries had lower inflation and lower public deficits than Germany, he said. Mr Tietmeyer attributed recent pressure on the franc to a debate among French opposition politicians over whether to keep the franc fort policy after the national assembly elections in March. 'I hope this debate in France on the strong franc will soon be over,' he said. Mr Tietmeyer said he was pleased that Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the former finance minister who has been mentioned as a possible prime minister if the rightwing opposition parties win the elections, had said clearly that they favoured keeping the strong franc policy. Currency traders are still likely to test ERM parities once trading returns to normal in the new year. Analysts point out that daily intervention by the French central bank to support the franc continued at a relatively high level in the weeks before Christmas. According to economists in London, financial markets will want clearer evidence of a prospective fall in German interest rates before they would be prepared to relax pressure on the ERM. There was little sign of a change in attitude at the Bundesbank over the holiday period. Currencies, Page 25 Week Ahead, Page 6 Bonds, Pages 16 and 18</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Better secret than sorry Nobody with a rational cast of mind can imagine a settled solution to the problems of Northern Ire-land - or certainly not one that could be in place this century. There is, however, a faint chance, a sliver of hope, that the cycle of violence may be brought to an end somewhat sooner than that. This hope has been kept alive, even nurtured, by the weekend storm over the government's back-channel contacts with the IRA. Let us take each of these propositions in turn. The first tells us why the news from the six provinces is always so doleful. There is not space enough, nor time, to go through the long history that led to the establishment of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on the same island. The elusiveness of a solution to the consequent troubles is sufficiently demonstrated by reminding ourselves that the Protestants are a separate tribe from the Catholics. There is a sad record of mutual hostility. You have only to read republican literature, or see the anger in the face of the Reverend Ian Paisley, the Buthelezi of Belfast, to appreciate that. No arrangement that completely satisfies the one tribe will be acceptable to the other. Establishing a united Ireland tomorrow might create a new Bosnia in its north-eastern quarter. So might a unilateral withdrawal of troops; likewise the creation of a quasi-independent state of Ulster, followed by the relieved turning of John Bull's back on the lot of them. Fully incorporating Northern Ireland into mainland British institutions would not bring peace from the republican side. Going back to the use of internment of known terrorists would at best deliver only a temporary respite from the killing. It did not work last time, and would not again. Wiping out the opposing terrorist groups is not an option for a liberal democracy. In short, there is no military solution, and no plausible political solution. This might appear to invalidate the proposition that there may be a way to end the violence. Yet by all accounts Ulster is war-weary. There is a strong desire for peace. This is recorded in many opinion polls and has recently been made clear in statements and marches on both sides of the border. Partly for this reason, and partly as a result of a perhaps over-optimistic reading of intelligence gathered from and about the IRA, the British government has perceived an opportunity. We do not know precisely when this shaft of light struck Whitehall, but the documents released yesterday suggest that it was in February this year, or possibly earlier. The government took its chance, and launched the peace initiative that was nearly destroyed by Sunday's news that it has been in communication with the IRA. No one can be happy at hearing that ministers have failed to be wholly open and frank about their actions, particularly when political honesty is in such short supply. That said, it can hardly be denied that Mr John Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew were correct to use an intermediary to explore, supposedly in secret, the possibility of a ceasefire by the Irish Republican Army. The fact that they did so was heavily disguised by protestations that they were not negotiating with terrorists. Nor were they, but nobody with any sense would have assumed that there was no means of communicating with the opposing forces. All that has happened over the past few days is that the prime minister and the Northern Ireland secretary have been caught using weasel words in a worthwhile cause. It looks as if they have got away with it, and rightly so. Rightly? Forget, just for the moment, about Mr Major's weak points. His peace initiative is too important to be stopped in its tracks by the unserious custom of finding fault with his motives, or his methods or, alas too often, his results. Admittedly his score in all three areas is less than perfect. Mr Major's attempt to find a formula that brings peace may be founded on the ignoble proposition that, if he pulls this one off, his reputation will be restored. His method, that of the whip, has involved at best verbal acrobatics - and at worst statements that do not convey the whole truth. It is evident that the balancing act that gave so much hope last week nearly came unstuck this week; the curse of our butterfingers prime minister may be that much of what he touches seems to fall through his fingers. Yet the potential prize, a cessation of the random killings of innocent civilians, is too valuable to be lost by reminding ourselves of one politician's negative characteristics. It took courage for Mr Major to assume personal responsibility for negotiating a settlement. Cynics will point out, yesterday's documents in hand, that he had reason to believe that a ceasefire was about to be announced by the IRA. This does not materially diminish the political risk he took. As we can see, the IRA is not easily pinned down, and it was always possible that the veil of secrecy would be sundered. That is what has now occurred. It has not destroyed the government. Conservatives united behind the prime minister yesterday, in itself a striking indication of the ripeness of the time for his peace initiative. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the larger Unionist party, cemented his alliance with the government by opening his remarks with the observation that Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland speaks for Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein. Labour has held its hand, knowing the penalty for appearing to jeopardise the chances of peace. Thus fortified, Mr Major will press on. The back-channels will be used again, if necessary. The IRA may have been given an overdose of what Lady Thatcher called 'the oxygen of publicity'; it should now announce the permanent ceasefire that the government repeatedly calls for in the published documents. The Protestant paramilitaries should do likewise. There is no reason not to, so long as the government is committed to giving the voters of Northern Ireland the power to decide on any arrangement that may be made about their future. There may be no obvious political settlement of this tribal conflict, but at least getting everyone to lay down their guns and rely on negotiation and the democratic process would bring a period of respite. Ireland's history suggests that the odds are strongly against success. Mr Major may fail. Yet he is right to carry on, secret communication links and all.</p>

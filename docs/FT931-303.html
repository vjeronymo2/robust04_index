			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Timex demonstration ends peacefully A BIG demonstration outside the Timex plant in Dundee passed off noisily but without violence or arrests yesterday, James Buxton writes. A bus carrying leftwing demonstrators from Glasgow arrived nearly 1 1/2 hours late after twice being stopped by police. More than 400 demonstrators gathered outside the plant to protest at the actions of the US-owned electronics company, which last month sacked its 340-strong manual workforce after a strike and hired 200 new workers. The demonstrators jeered as buses carrying the new workforce went through the plant gates but did not attempt to block their path. Last Monday 16 people were arrested outside the plant in the worst picket line violence seen in Britain for several years. Ahead of yesterday's demonstration trade unionists appealed to demonstrators to stay within the law. The appeal was aimed at leftwing groups such as Scottish Militant Labour, which took part in last Monday's demonstration and which said it planned to bus in demonstrators yesterday. Police stopped the bus carrying demonstrators from Glasgow near Perth and again in Dundee. Tayside police said they had wanted to check numbers and search for weapons to avoid a repetition of last week's violence. The demonstrators missed witnessing the arrival of the new Timex workers but were in time for a rally in support of the sacked workers.</p>

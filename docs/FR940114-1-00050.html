			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Health/Medical Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should integrate occupant protection into health programs. The failure of drivers and passengers to use occupant protection systems is a major health problem that must be recognized by the health care community. The SHSA and the State Health Department should collaborate in developing programs that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Integrate occupant protection into professional health training curricula and comprehensive public health planning;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Promote occupant protection systems as a health promotion/disease prevention measure;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require public health and medical personnel to use available motor vehicle occupant protection systems when on the job;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide technical assistance and education about the importance of motor vehicle occupant protection to primary caregivers, (e.g., doctors, nurses, clinic staff);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Include questions about safety belt use in health risk appraisals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utilize health care providers as visible public spokespersons for belt use and child safety seat use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide information about availability of child safety seats through maternity hospitals and other pre-natal and natal care centers (see Program Component VI: Child Passenger Safety Program); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collect, analyze, and publicize data on additional injuries and medical expenses resulting from non-use of occupant protection devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Child Passenger Safety Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should vigorously promote the use of child safety seats. States should require every child up to 40 pounds to ride correctly secured in a child safety seat that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see Program Component II: Legislation, Regulation, and Policy). State and community child passenger safety programs that will help to achieve that objective should be established to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Educate parents, pediatricians, hospitals, law enforcement, EMS and the general public about the safety risks to small children, the benefits of child safety seats, and their responsibilities for compliance with child passenger safety laws;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encourage child safety seat retailers and auto dealers to provide information about child seat and vehicle compatibility, as well as correct use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require safe child transportation policies for certification of pre-school and day care providers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require hospitals to ensure that newborn and other small children are correctly secured in an approved child safety seat or safety belt upon discharge;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Make child safety seats available at affordable cost to low-income families; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encourage local law enforcement to vigorously enforce child passenger safety laws, including safety belt use laws as they apply to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. School-Based Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should incorporate occupant protection education in school curricula. Buckling up is a good health habit and, like other health habits, must be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The State Department of Education and the State Highway Safety Agency should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ensure that highway safety in general, and occupant protection in particular, are included in the State-approved K&hyph;12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establish and enforce written policies requiring that school employees operating a motor vehicle on the job use safety belts; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encourage active promotion of regular safety belt use through classroom and extra-curricular activities as well as in the school-based health clinics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Worksite Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should encourage all employers to require safety belt use on the job as a condition of employment. The Federal government has already taken that step for its employees. Private sector employers should follow the lead of Federal and State government employers and comply with all applicable FHWA Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) regulations requiring private business employees to use safety belts on the job. All employers should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Establish and enforce a safety belt use policy with sanctions; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conduct occupant protection education programs for employees on their belt use policies and the safety benefits of motor vehicle occupant protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Outreach Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in occupant protection education by involving individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens public support for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs. To encourage community involvement, States should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LUCERO, SCHWARTZ REV UP THEIR WAR ON WHEELS AT FAIRGROUNDS  </P> <P> It's only 25 yards from the starting gate to the first turn on the 190-yard  oval at the Orange County Fairgrounds. But that short straightaway has been the  scene of one of the biggest feuds in American speedway motorcycle racing.  </P> <P> Defending U.S. champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and 1988 champion Steve  Lucero of Riverside have staged a two-month battle in scratch main events.  </P> <P> Schwartz, 33, and Lucero, 25, have been involved in four incidents in the past  10 weeks and still they have managed to combine to win seven scratch main  races. Schwartz won the event five times in the first seven weeks and Lucero  has won the past two weeks.  </P> <P> But the two have also paid a price for their bitter feud. Each rider has been  disqualified twice for their roles in the incidents.  </P> <P> "The Feud at the Fairgrounds" began on Friday the 13th of April and came to a  head two weeks ago when Schwartz clashed with promoter Harry Oxley in a small  office near the pit area where a confrontation deteriorated into a pushing  match.  </P> <P> Schwartz, a 17-year veteran who has raced internationally, says, "I think Steve  is out to get me. I fear bodily injury every time I'm in the same race with  Steve Lucero."  </P> <P> Lucero, the strongest and most aggressive rider on the circuit, said, "It's  just racing. Downright hard racing between the two of us, and one of us can't  handle it."  </P> <P> All the incidents have occurred in four-lap scratch races where riders line up  four abreast at the start. Traditionally, the rider who gets off to the  quickest start and is first to reach the turn usually goes on to win the race  on the narrow track that was originally built for equestrian shows.  </P> <P> The majority of crashes on the track -- where riders reach speeds of only 40  miles per hour -- come at Turn 1 as the four riders fight for the lead. Track  announcer Larry Huffman once compared the race to Turn 1 as "a calvary charge  into a closet door."  </P> <P> "I would say that 98% of the race is getting through the first turn," Lucero  said. "It's a major, major part of the race. My feeling is this: I'm going  through that turn first no matter who's in my way.  </P> <P> "I don't care if it was my wife, my mother or my grandmother racing against me,  I'm going to race as aggressively as I can to get through that turn. We're  talking about my livelihood."  </P> <P> Lucero, who began riding junior speedway when he was 10 years old, estimates he  lost at least $1,000 when he was disqualified twice by referee Phil Moon for  dangerous riding. But he said he won't back down to Schwartz or any other  rider.  </P> <P> Schwartz, an often-volatile rider, has other ideas. He doesn't know how the  feud began, but insists he won't continue riding under the present  circumstances.  </P> <P> "All of this has taken the fun out of racing," Schwartz said. "I'm really upset  because nobody . . . the referee or the promoter, has done anything about this.  I've told Phil Moon, 'Steve is out to get me.' All of this has made me  seriously consider retiring after this year."  </P> <P> The fourth incident was May 25, when Schwartz fell on Turn 2 of the third lap.  Moon ruled that there was only incidental contact between Schwartz and Lucero  and that Schwartz had intentionally gone down in hopes of getting a restart. (A  restart is granted when half the field falls before half the race has been  completed.)  </P> <P> Moon declared Lucero the winner and Schwartz went straight for promoter Oxley.  Asked what happened, Schwartz said, "I pushed him, we shoved each other and  then he choked me."  </P> <P> Does Schwartz have any second thoughts about attacking the promoter?  </P> <P> "I have no remorse whatsoever," he said. "I've been treated poorly, and the  promoter thinks all of this is great for his business."  </P> <P> Oxley, who witnessed only the fourth incident between the riders, said he  received reports on every incident while on business in England. He praised  Moon's officiating of the incidents and blamed both riders equally for their  roles in escalating the feud, both on and off the track.  </P> <P> "Racing is a hard business with an element of danger," Oxley said. "When you  mix in some animosity between two very emotional, high-strung individuals like  Bobby and Steve, it's very difficult to deal with.  </P> <P> "I think Bobby has reached a point in his career where he doesn't need to worry  about an incident that might put him in a cast. But Steve isn't 100% wrong  here. Bobby is falling down awfully easy. He's gotten a little gun shy."  </P> <P> Moon said he has talked to both riders and has carefully watched both riders  since the first incident on April 13.  </P> <P> "I don't know what sparked the incidents, but most of the problems have have  started in the pit area before the races," Moon said. "Since Day 1, when I  started in speedway 20 years ago, we've always had two riders who haven't  gotten along.  </P> <P> "This is a little different because we're dealing with two champions. My  concern, as always, is with rider safety. I don't want someone else hurt  because there's some bad blood between the riders."  </P> <P> Former two-time world champion Bruce Penhall of Laguna Niguel has witnessed two  of the incidents from his private box at Turn 1 and also has expressed concern  for other riders' safety.  </P> <P> "What bothers me is that I'm afraid someone is going to get hurt," Penhall  said. "If something were to happen to either Bobby or Steve, they'd have to  live with that the rest of their lives.  </P> <P> "There's going to be accidents in racing . . . it's part of the game. There's  going to be a minimal amount of bumping on a small track like Costa Mesa. But  there's no room in the sport for dangerous riding.  </P> <P> "I think Steve has gotten very frustrated that Bobby wins so much. He can't  beat him, so he's decided to go through him. Now, Steve has Bobby right where  he wants him . . . looking over his shoulder to see if he's coming."  </P> <P> The Schwartz-Lucero feud certainly isn't the first in speedway. Local favorite  Rick Woods battled Mike Bast in the 1970s and Alan Christian battled with Bast  in the 1980s.  </P> <P> The bad blood between Christian and Bast reached its height in 1980 when  Christian won 13 consecutive scratch main events at the Fairgrounds. Christian,  competing in his 20th season, works next to Lucero in the pit area. He has  watched this latest battle escalate over the past few weeks and says money --  riders can earn up to $1,000 on a scratch main event -- is the root of the  problem.  </P> <P> "I talk to Steve all the time," Christian said. "You have two hard riders who  are having problems at the best-paying track on the circuit. You want to win at  Costa Mesa more than anywhere else.  </P> <P> "I understand what they're going through. I look back at what happened between  Mike and myself and I understand how these things tend to snowball when you're  racing against the same guys, four nights a week.  </P> <P> "I got tired of Mike Bast ramming into me, and one night, I jumped off my bike  and got into a fist fight with him on the track. It started with an incident  and then you feel you have to pay somebody back.  </P> <P> "I'm not proud of the fight with Mike, but it happened. After that (fight), we  stayed away from each other. He ran into me for the last time after the fight.  Sometimes, something like that has to happen to end a feud."  </P> <P> Another round of this war on wheels could unfold tonight on the Fairgrounds  oval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FEUD AT THE FAIRGROUNDS  </P> <P> Defending U.S. champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and 1988 champion Steve  Lucero have been involved in four racing incidents in 10 weeks at the Orange  County Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> April 13: In the scratch semifinal, Lucero is disqualified for dangerous riding  after he collided with Schwartz. Schwartz goes on to win the scratch main  event.  </P> <P> May 4: In the scratch main, Schwartz is disqualified for falling on Turn 2  after bumping into Lucero. Referee Phil Moon rules Schwartz fell intentionally  in hopes of getting a restart. A press release the following week says Schwartz  was disqualified for "bad acting."  </P> <P> May 18: Lucero is disqualified for ramming Schwartz into the crash wall at Turn  1 in the scratch main event. Schwartz wins the main event, and Moon fines  Lucero $100 for dangerous riding.  </P> <P> May 25: Schwartz and Lucero bump on Turn 2 of the third lap in the scratch main  event and Schwartz falls. Moon rules Lucero the winner because half the race  was completed. Schwartz confronts promoter Harry Oxley and a pushing match  ensues.  </P></p>

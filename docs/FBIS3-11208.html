The  Peruvian economy had shrunk by an amazing 20 percent during the  two previous years and inflation was running at 7,000 percent.  A U.S. company that specializes in risk analysis rated Peru as  the most dangerous place in the world to do business.    Over a span of less than four years, President Fujimori has  managed to overcome formidable obstacles. His government has  dealt such a heavy blow to the Shining Path that many Peruvians  who had to emigrate -- and even some tourists -- are returning  to what used to be battlefields. Fujimori's free trade policy  has curbed inflation and turned our country into the fastest  growing economy in the Americas. It is hardly surprising that  he now enjoys overwhelming popularity among his fellow  countrymen.    Despite all this, Fujimori has been unable to achieve one  crucial victory -- to be accepted by the U.S. Government. Some  U.S. officials say Fujimori's achievements will always be  stained by the harsh tactics he used to redress that state of  affairs. In April 1992, President Fujimori dissolved Congress,  suspended the Constitution, and took almost total control of the  country on the grounds that this was the only way to prevent the  savage Shining Path from seizing power and to end dilatory  tactics in the Peruvian Congress which thwarted the economic  reform. Peruvians applauded Fujimori's decision to wage a war  against the guerrillas and to undertake economic reforms.    The United States, however, condemned his actions and  suspended its economic aid even though Fujimori kept his promise  of holding Parliamentary elections to draft a new Constitution.  Human rights associations and leftist groups displayed more  concern about this than about the suffering of the Peruvian  people when their lives were at the mercy of Shining Path  terrorists -- at the mercy of whom they still are to a certain  extent because the Shining Path killed 750 people last year.  U.S. Congress leaders and President Clinton contend that it is  impossible to settle the issue of U.S. economic aid to Peru  unless Fujimori takes additional steps to strengthen the  democratic process and to improve respect for human rights in  Peru.    Nevertheless, the Clinton administration does not consider  democracy to be a top priority when dealing with countries that  are more strategically important. Washington openly endorsed  Yeltsin when he dissolved the Russian Parliament last year.  Fujimori argues that Yeltsin undoubtedly drew his inspiration  from Peru and that Russian intelligence services consulted their  Peruvian counterparts before Yeltsin's action.    Private investors have already reached their own conclusions  concerning Peru and are expeditiously acting to support our  country through their investments because it offers so many  possibilities, is making headway to consolidate its stability,  and its president enjoys enormous popularity at home.    It is high time for the Clinton administration to give up  its  hypocritical and moralistic attitude, which it readily overlooks  whenever interests dictate, and to resume its economic aid to  Peru.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Observer: Say Hello to Jack's halo Jack Welch, boss of General Electric and patron saint of American management, is under the media microscope. Time, Newsweek and Forbes all ran lengthy pieces on him this week, and Fortune did a job on him a few weeks back. All dealt with the same basic theme: whether the alleged fraudulent trading at GE's broking subsidiary Kidder Peabody, which has cost GE hundreds of millions of dollars, is evidence that Welch's halo has slipped. This week's stories are mostly anodyne, and have an air of damage limitation. The earlier Fortune cover story was hard-hitting; it blamed the Kidder case squarely on GE's corporate culture and linked it with earlier examples of corporate wrongdoing. Welch's hard-driving style, the piece implied, might be forcing GE executives to cut corners. Time, by contrast, interviewed Welch and concluded that he was still basically OK. Forbes did the same and concluded he was absolutely fabulous. Round one to Fortune, round two to GE's media relations people. In fact, Fortune's case looks to be based on a false premise: that without Welch, GE would be white as snow. Like many another old-established company, GE has its roots in the days of cartels and monopolies. A recent book on Welch, Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will, remarks that when GE lost its first anti-trust lawsuit in 1948 it only got its wrist slapped. 'Subsequently,' the book says, 'some GE middle managers imagined themselves immune to punishment, expecting their bosses to wink at wrongdoing that helped a business grow. Partly as a result, the company was caught many times in illegal actions.' Over the years, Welch has done a great deal to change the GE culture. The job of GE people, he once told shareholders, is 'to set and meet aggressive targets - always with unyielding integrity'. One more push, perhaps.</p>

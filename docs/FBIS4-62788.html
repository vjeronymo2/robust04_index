			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin will  be the strongest candidate in the upcoming presidential  elections, State Duma deputy Yegor Gaydar said.    Speaking before an audience of students and scholars at the  Moscow State University on Monday, Gaydar said his Russia's  Choice bloc will support Yeltsin.    He said the elections will not be easy, but Yeltsin has the  best chances of all democratic candidates. Gaydar stressed that  lawmakers must join their efforts in order to stop local  conflicts and ward off the danger of communist revenge.    To this end, the bloc will be reorganised into a party with  fixed membership. Draft charter and programme of the new party  are already ready. The founding congress will be held in Moscow  on June 12-13.    Gaydar believes that Russian business people may count on a  certain place in the political arena only if they team up with  intellectuals.    Speaking about privatisation, Gaydar described it as a "task  which has no optimum solution, only a more or less acceptable.  We have to make not an ideal, but possible decision."</p>

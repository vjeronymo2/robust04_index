			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea notified its  allies and members of the U.N. Security Council Monday of its  decision to propose a contact with North Korea for an  inter-Korean summit.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the notices were  sent to Japan, the United States, the permanent members of the  Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) right after the morning's unification-related ministers'  meeting decided in favor of the proposal.    Chang again welcomed the agreement on a South-North summit,  saying that it moves forward inter-Korean relations in dealing  with the nuclear problem.    "The significance lies in the fact that the South Korean  Government will secure a role," said the spokesman.    He predicted that the talks leading up to the inter-Korean  summit will progress in pace with the third round of high-level  dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, adding that North  Korea's intentions must still be confirmed beforehand.    If it comes off, the summit will serve to revive the  activities of various inter-Korean committees, including the  joint Nuclear Control Commission to implement simultaneous  nuclear inspections between the two sides.    "Inter-Korean dialogue will progress in a mutually  complementary fashion with North Korea-U.S., North Korea-IAEA  dialogue," Chang said. "South Korea and the United States will  keep in close consultation."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent: "Plan To </F> Sink Old N-Subs To Be Ditched"]    [Text] Plans to sink redundant nuclear submarines and parts  of civil reactors at sea are to be abandoned by the Government  following its decision yesterday to accept the international ban  on dumping nuclear waste at sea.    As a result, all Britain's military and civil nuclear waste  will be buried on land. Most of it is destined for the proposed  repository under British Nuclear Fuel's Sellafield complex in  Cumbria.    Planning permission for the preliminary phase of a  repository, a 700 metre-deep rock laboratory, will be sought  next month by Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal  company.    This plan involves sinking two shafts and building galleries  to test whether the geology under Sellafield is suitable for  construction of full-scale repository. Even on the most  optimistic forecast, this would not be ready before 2010.    The Government's decision to abandon sea dumping, announced  by Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, was  rather reluctant. She said it remained the Government's view was  that decisions on disposal of waste should be taken on economic  and scientific grounds and in both areas there were good  arguments for disposal at sea.    However, the Government "recognises that the weight of  international opinion on the matter means that such dumping is  not, in any event, a practical proposition."    The Ministry of Defence has seven redundant nuclear  submarines waiting for disposal, three at Devonport and four at  Rosyth. The original plan was to scrap the uncontaminated parts  and fill the reactor compartments with concrete ready to sink  them at sea.    Although they are now destined for years of "floating  storage", the reactors will eventually have to be cut up and  placed in concrete containers for disposal in the civil  repository. The same is true of the concrete shields of civil  reactors.    The Nirex rock repository plan is running into opposition  from some local people in Cumbria and environmental groups. The  nuclear industry hopes to avoid a public inquiry at this stage  and hold one in five years, when it has proved that the area is  right geologically for a full-blown repository.    Objectors will demand a public inquiry immediately, because  they believe the rock laboratory is a pilot project for the full  repository.    The proposed rock laboratory, should it prove suitable,  would  be adapted to be part of the repository.    Three thousand jobs will be created for eight to 10 years in  the construction phase, which would be as large a job as the  Channel tunnel. Only 300 people would be needed to run the  repository itself, which is expected to take all Britain's  intermediate and low level waste to the year 2050.

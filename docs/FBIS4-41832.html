			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Dorofeyev: "Duma Has Its Own Thoughts on </F> Crime"]    [Text] The fact that a wave of crime is lashing Russia  today is obvious to everyone. Criminal terror, even if it is  not aimed at a specific person, can affect anyone with a stray  bullet or shock wave.    The crime situation has reached a dangerous limit which  requires urgent measures to be taken. Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin offered his vision for a way out of the  crime crisis in his 14 June edict "on urgent measures to protect  the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of  organized crime." We shall not recount its content, it is  known. But it is no secret either that this edict has generated  a far from homogenous reaction among Russia's political circles.  Virtually all factions of the State Duma unanimously denounced  the president's scenario for urgent measures to fight crime.  Why? Here are the opinions of representatives of various  factions and deputies' groups.    "It seems to me," believes V. Sheynis ("Russia's Choice")  "that there is a very dangerous game involving political slogans  under way. Both the president's team and the State Duma members  are taking part in it. The situation which is taking shape  around the struggle against crime is reminiscent of the one  which occurred last summer with the sovereignization of former  autonomous regions. At the time both the president and the  Supreme Soviet were seeking to win the support of the autonomous  regions and rushed to surrender their positions quickly. There  was a game of give-away.    "Something similar is happening now. But something more  dangerous. Indeed, the situation regarding the rampage of crime  perturbs and affects everyone. But how to fight it? Through  fly-swatting, that is by adopting widely publicized acts,  including acts connected with the violation of constitutionally  guaranteed human rights, or by waging a hard struggle against  crime?    "The main problem here is by no means the lack of a  legislative base, as many people believe. Even the base which  exists is adequate. That the organs which must engage in this  and their cadres, orientation, and conduct are not appropriate  to the situation which has now taken shape is another matter.  In my view that is the main problem where the main efforts  should be made.    "As for the president's edict itself, it would be far more  appropriate for it to be submitted to the duma as a draft law."    The viewpoint of A. Lezdinsh ("12 December" deputies' group)  is virtually the same as what V. Sheynis said. He also believes  that with the existing legislative base the law enforcement  organs are quite able to struggle against organized crime.  Especially since as a result of protracted talks on this  subject the technical equipping and quantitative composition of  the internal affairs organs staffers has nonetheless increased.  The edict signed by the president, in A. Lezdinsh's opinion, if  it is fulfilled will return Russia to a time over 50 years ago,  to an era when the qualitative borders between legality and  tyranny were eroded.    The edict, A. Lezdinsh believes, will not lead to the  stepping up of the struggle against crime but on the contrary  could very well serve as the fuse for large-scale conflicts with  the participation of large groups of the population. And at the  same time a lever to the transfer of the state's management to a  totalitarian regime. This edict, the deputy believes, must be  repealed as regards the section which contradicts the  Constitution and we must return to the package of draft laws on  the struggle against crime which the president and government  promised three months ago to submit to the Duma.    While in no way casting doubt on the right of the country's  president to issue edicts regulating relations in society, V.  Zorkaltsev (Russian Federation Communist Party faction) also  voiced his negative attitude toward the question. The document,  which affects the interests of the overwhelming majority of  people and makes it possible to defend their interests by  invading their private lives must be drawn up only in the form  of a law, whose draft could very well be submitted by the  president. Provisions like detention for 30 days, the checking  of private accounts, the virtual abolition of concepts like  commercial and banking secrets -- this is all absolutely  intolerable. Unfortunately the edict does not even provide for  measures of liability for militia staffers for the actions they  perform.    But there is one phenomenon which already as it were stands  outside the framework of this edict and which cannot fail to  alarm us. I am sure, V. Zorkaltsev believes, that it was  received with approval by the overwhelming mass of Russians.  But you only have to recall a newsreel of the thirties. In  that newsreel citizens were also going to show trials carrying  placards reading "Shoot the enemies of the people!" They walked  with confidence. This situation must not be repeated today.  Because in the ordinary people's consciousness the idea still  lives that the only important thing is for order to be  introduced, even if it is with an "iron hand." But that "order"  will be a screen for settling accounts and winning political  stability, the deputy is convinced. Because what is needed is  not en edict but a law on the struggle against crime adopted by  the Duma, approved by the Federation Council, and signed by the  president, he believes.    V. Isakov (Russian Agrarian Party) is now less sharp in his  description of this Russian president's edict. He believes that  this document abolishes fundamental guarantees of law and order  and legality stating that citizens' rights and freedoms can be  restricted only by the law. The very fact of the edict's  publication violates the norms of the Constitution and of the  criminal procedure code.    It is not even a case of how serious the restrictions  envisaged by the edict are, the deputy believes. Ultimately the  supreme measure is not envisaged in them. But the very fact  that the president is invading this sphere is evidence that he  may reach it in the future since the norms and restrictions  envisaged by the Constitution no longer exist.    To a lawyer it is obvious, V. Isakov continues, that the  edict has no mechanism of implementation. The constitutional  principle of the law's supremacy has not been repealed by  anyone. And in court, when a law and an edict clash, lawyers  will be obliged to apply the law. Thus the result of the edict  is in fact not to step up the struggle against crime but to  weaken and disorganize that struggle.    The deputy is convinced that the struggle against crime must  be waged on the basis of the existing legislative system.  Undoubtedly, by improving it, in the sphere of monitoring  incomes, for instance, and of the liability of state employees  and special protection for witnesses....    Actually, there are also different viewpoints in the Duma.  In the opinion of Democratic Party of Russia leader N. Travkin  we can no longer deal with crime by civilized methods and we  must not argue with the edict but rapidly adopt laws which make  it possible to wage a real struggle against crime. Deputy V.  Lipitskiy also advocates extraordinary measures, believing that  the president's edict has merely defined measures which the Duma  should have adopted.</p>

The Commission's Chairman Nikolay Demenev has reported to  Interfax that the appeal was filed in response to the  Shchelkovskiy Town Court decision to dismiss the election  results as invalid because of the violations exposed in the  commission's work.    In an interview with Interfax Demenev denied that  Zhirinovskiy's victory had been rigged as a result of improper  votes counting. In his opinion, not a single electoral  commission member shares Zhirinovskiy's views or sides with him.  "We were politically impartial and absolutely objective. As  for insignificant irregularities, they can be found in any  electoral commission", Demenev declared. In his opinion, this  legal case is "explicitly" political, and its aim is to strip  Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary mandate.    "To stop at nothing to discredit electoral commission  workers  is base", Demenev said.    Legal proceedings against the electoral commission were  initiated by Oleg Novikov, a candidate to the Duma from that  district. The commission's appeal will be considered next  week-end.</p>

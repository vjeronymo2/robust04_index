			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Economy slows enough to fall off its cycle: Fears that the lengthening downturn is more serious than just a cyclical matter STOCK MARKET investors have delivered a damning judgment on the current state of the Japanese economy. On Friday, the Nikkei index fell 325 points after the publication of the Bank of Japan's latest report on economic trends, which showed business confidence at its lowest level for five years. Yesterday, the Nikkei tumbled a further 430 points to 16,953, below the psychologically important 17,000 level. The economy is entering a critical period, as a slowdown which started early in 1991 reaches and exceeds 15-18 months, the average duration of post-war downturns. The stock market's latest plunge will increase the calls for government action to halt the slide. Businessmen, led by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, want to see further cuts in interest rates and an increase in spending on public works. So do financiers, concerned about the debilitating impact of slow economic growth on share and land prices. So do the US and the EC which are convinced that the slow down in Japan's domestic economy is fuelling a rapid expansion in the country's trade surplus. Pressure from all these quarters will come to a head in the next few weeks as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, prepares for the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Munich early next month and for parliamentary elections in Japan at the end of July. The government and the Bank of Japan insist there are no plans for new economy-boosting measures to follow the interest rate cuts and public works programme announced in April. But there is a growing belief in Tokyo that the authorities are preparing for action. The government's official view is that the economy is going through nothing more serious than a cyclical slowdown, albeit one that is particularly severe. The Economic Planning Agency believes a recovery will start in the autumn and stands by a forecast of economic growth of 3.5 per cent for the current financial year ending March 1993. But private sector economists believe the target is unattainable. Many have cut their forecasts to 2 per cent and below. For the US or Europe, this figure would be quite acceptable for an economy moving through the bottom of the economic cycle. However, Japanese officials and businessmen, accustomed to high-speed growth, regard anything below 3 per cent as a recession. The economic data offers plenty of evidence in support of those calling for immediate government action. But it is not conclusive - there is enough positive data to give the authorities good grounds for waiting a little longer. Last week's Bank of Japan report was on the face of it gloomy - it showed the index of confidence among manufacturers plunged from minus-5 per cent in February to minus-24 per cent in May. For non-manufacturers the index fell from 17 per cent to 1 per cent. The report also forecast a 2.1 per cent decline in capital investment in the financial year, including an 8.9 per cent fall in investment in manufacturing. But the survey also found the odd chink of light - including hints of a recovery in business sentiment in the autumn. Government officials were quick to seize on this point as possible indication of a pick-up in the economy later this year. The EPA said: 'There is a bottoming-out of sentiment. Businessmen don't see things getting any worse.' Government officials will also take comfort from a report to be published today which is expected to show GNP expanded by an annualised rate of around 4 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. This is much better than had been expected a few months ago - an indication that authorities have been right in emphasising the resilience of the Japanese economy. However, GNP data from the first quarter is a better guide to the past than to the future. Growth in the second quarter is likely to have been much slower. For example, there is no sign of a recovery in machinery orders, an indicator of likely future trends in capital investment. The latest figure, for April, showed a 20.9 per cent decline from the same month in 1991. Similarly, despite steep cuts in industrial production, companies are failing to reduce their inventories of unsold goods as fast as they planned. There is good news from some corners of the economy - notably a modest recovery in housebuilding - but it is outweighed by the bad. Furthermore, a mountain of debt from the 1980s overshadows the economy. Figures published yesterday show how the burden of servicing loans taken out for speculative stock and property investments in the 1980s is driving more and more companies into bankruptcy. Banks and financial institutions, dragged down with estimated bad and doubtful debts of more than Y40,000bn, (Pounds 172bn) could find it hard to finance new loans in future. It is in this context that the debate over possible action to boost the economy is gathering pace. The Bank of Japan's position is that it is still monitoring the effect of the last cut in the official discount rate in April, when it was reduced by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent. For its part, the ministry of finance is resisting calls for extra measures to follow the package announced in April when some public works spending planned for the second half of the fiscal year was brought forward to the first six months. However, finance ministry officials acknowledge that some extra spending will be needed to fill the gap created in the public works programme in the second half of the year. The question is how much. Officials opposed to increases in public borrowing argue that as little as Y1,000bn extra should be spent. At the other extreme, leading politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic party want a supplementary budget of Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn. Given that the financial year is less than three months old, the authorities may be tempted to wait in the hope of an autumn recovery. World Stock Markets, Page 39</p>

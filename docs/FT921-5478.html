			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Directors urge radical extension of free market COMPANY DIRECTORS yesterday urged an incoming government to adopt sweeping economic reforms based on the application of market forces and the eventual abolition of income tax and other direct taxes. The Institute of Directors published its 112-point programme as a challenge to the three main political parties as they prepare their general election manifestos. The tone of the document is uncompromising. It advocates a free market economy untrammelled by subsidies or any form of government interference. Among the more provocative recommendations are the abolition of capital gains and inheritance taxes as well as income tax, the privatisation of all remaining state-controlled enterprises - including motorways  - and the introduction of tax relief on health insurance and private education. Although the IoD said it was aiming its broadside at the three main political parties, it is clear that the document only has a prospect of acceptance by a Conservative administration. Even there, support could be less than total. The institute, under Mr Peter Morgan, its director general, and his predecessor Sir John Hoskyns, is regarded as one of the more influential policy organisations of the right, although it has no direct political affiliation. However, there is an assumption that Mr John Major is not as keen on some of the IoD's ideas as was Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Morgan said at a London press conference yesterday that a refocusing of the balance between government, markets and the individual was the theme of the document. 'It outlines what company directors want the new government to do and what they do not want it to do.' All the measures advocated were designed to increase the size of the market and to improve the effectiveness of its operation. They could reasonably be introduced in the lifetime of a parliament. 'Their adoption will create favourable conditions in which directors can lead their businesses and create wealth. The prosperity of everyone in the UK depends on their success,' he said. A complete overhaul of the tax system would include establishing a single rate of income tax. This would fall to 20p in the next parliament and subsequently be abolished altogether. The cost of abolishing a range of direct taxes would be met by limiting the growth of public expenditure to half the growth in the economy. Two new government departments are advocated, one for the market, based on a reformed trade and industry department, and the other for human resources, to be responsible for ensuring that education, training and employment policy is geared to the needs of the individual.

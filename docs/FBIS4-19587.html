			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: </F> Antidumping -- Definitive Duties on Imports of Silicon Carbide  From China, Poland and Ukraine -- Also (Possibly) Exports by  Russian Independent Producers"]    [Text] Brussels, Brussels, 14 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The  [EC] Community Council has introduced definitive antidumping  duties on imports of silicon carbide from China, Ukraine and (at  a much lower level) from Poland. A duty has also been fixed for  silicon carbide from Russia, but, at the same time, the  Commission has accepted undertakings offered by the official  Russian exporter, namely V/O Stankoimport (Moscow), and the  antidumping duty therefore does not apply to this exporter  which, in practice, is the only one. The duty introduced is  therefore a "residual" duty of a prudential kind: the rapid  development of the economic system in Russia could, says the  Council, entail the appearance of new producers and exporters  working independently from the State and which would not be  linked by the Stankoimport commitments. The duty would therefore  apply to them. To complete the picture, it must be added  that:     -  Procedure concerning Norway was closed as Norwegian  producers did not have any further recourse to dumping  practices;    -  Procedure was also closed concerning the Republics of  the former USSR other than Ukraine and Russia as they do not  export silicon carbide (they had been automatically involved in  the procedure as, in the beginning, the procedure covered the  whole of the USSR as a single bloc). Antidumping measures on  silicon carbide had been adopted by the Community in 1986 and  should normally have expired in 1991. Nevertheless, the CEFIC  (European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations) had  called for reexamination, noting the risk of serious injury, on  behalf of Community producers Pechiney Electrometallurgie,  Elektroschmelzwerk, Samatec and Navarro. The product in question  is largely used in the manufacture of ceramics, plastic  materials, high quality refractory products, etc., and also --  in a specific form -- in foundry and blast furnace operations.  Community production has been falling since 1990 despite  increased consumption and the market share of Community  producers has fallen from 61.1 percent in 1988 to 42.8 percent  in 1991. China has also taken a considerable market share (1.1  percent in 1988, 15.3 percent in 1991). The market shares of  Poland, Russia and Ukraine have increased but to a lesser  extent. All exporter countries except Norway practised prices  lower than Community prices: Poland -- 29 percent; Russia and  Ukraine -- 23 to 49 percent; China 50 to 71 percent. In  addition, China, Russia and Ukraine did not respect price  commitments undertaken during the 1986 procedure (commitments  which were, on the other hand, honoured by Norway and Poland).  On the basis of the above data, and taking the United States as  a "reference country," the Commission has evaluated the  following average dumping margins: China 72.5 percent, Russia  23.3 percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent. Norway  has not practised dumping. At the same time, the Commission has  established the fact that dumping practices caused injury to  Community producers. This injury would increase with expiry of  1986 measures. Already two production plants (one in France,  the other in Italy) have had to close down, and this has a  negative effect on users as competition is reduced. The Council  shared the Commission conclusions and decided by majority vote  to introduce the following antidumping duties: China 52.6  percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent, Russia (for  possible independent exporters) 23.3 percent. The United Kingdom  voted against the decision. In the meantime, the Commission has  accepted the undertakings offered by current Russian producers  to limit the volume of their exports to "a nonprejudicial  level." The Commission considers that Russian authorities are  able to guarantee respect of these commitments given that  exports are carried out through the State trade body  Stankoimport. It is to be stressed that, within the advisory  committee (where the Twelve are represented), reservation has  been expressed by some delegations against acceptance of such  commitments. The Committee then reported to the Council and the  Council did not find a sufficient majority to oppose the  Commission's intentions. The Commission was therefore able to  approve its decision.</p>

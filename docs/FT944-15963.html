			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (1): A mountain of choice - Peter Whitehead finds FT readers have very varied tastes when choosing their top resorts For the third year in a row Val d'Isere has been voted the FT readers' most popular skiing resort. The French resort topped the readers' list of favourites, polling 65 of the 440 votes cast. It is particularly popular with expert skiers. And while it was also favourite with intermediates, they put Courchevel and Meribel close behind. When it comes to skiing regions, it is a different story. Votes for resorts in the Trois Vallees skiing area - Courchevel, Meribel, Val Thorens and Les Menuires - put it way ahead of any other linked area. The most striking result of the survey, however, was the astonishing variety of resorts favoured by FT readers. There were 110 different resorts mentioned as favourite resorts by the respondents to the questionnaire. That so many people have so many good things to say about so many different resorts is an indication of the enormous variety of skiing available and the generally high standards set by most resorts. Resorts from as far afield as Mount Hotham in Australia, Chapelco in Argentina, several in North America and a host of little-known retreats in every corner of Europe were featured. The questionnaire was only included in the UK and European editions of the FT, hence the heavy bias towards European resorts. And as the bulk of respondents were from the UK, it is unsurprising that French resorts featured prominently at the top of the table. Indeed, France's big three - Val d'Isere, Courchevel and Meribel - polled more than a third of the votes. The scale and variety of the skiing available at these resorts is what readers mentioned over and over again, with many expert skiers citing the excellent off-piste skiing at Val d'Isere. Scenery is quoted by many favouring Zermatt, Wengen and St Anton. Many people cited getting away from the crowds as reasons for their choice. Susan Jane McCartney of London likes Hinterstodder as it is mainly Austrians who go there. And Christina Cock also chose an Austrian hideaway, Galtur, because it is 'at the end of the valley, so has little traffic and few tour companies'. The train is popular in Wengen and views of the Matterhorn swayed a number of respondents into voting for Zermatt. Erica Platter of South Africa said she preferred Les Gets because it was 'still a real village with heart and soul, not some artificial tourist trap full of tinsel and flash'. And Martin Woodhead of Saffron Walden, Essex likes it so much he has bought a chalet there. Courchevel attracted such comments as 'unrivalled variety of terrain with superb snow record and immense lift system', and 'long, long empty runs'. The long season and exquisite scenery of Zermatt were what prompted Anthony Leech of London to name it as his favourite, while Peter Clarke of Chichester, West Sussex said: 'Tough skiing and best food in the Alps.' Tudor Jones of Gloucestershire called Zermatt the 'nearest place on earth to heaven'. Lorraine Geddes of Inverness said Val Thorens was her favourite, in spite of its looks: 'Ugly and cold,' she called it, 'but superb easy access to wonderful off-piste and no need to queue'. Of Val d'Isere, Kristine O'Brien from London said: 'I never get bored,' although she did point out that it was not good for small children. Chris Scanlon of Maidenhead, Berkshire, has a special reason for favouring Val d'Isere: it is where he met his future wife. And Ian Britton remembers Wengen as the place where his girlfriend accepted his proposal of marriage. Champery was chosen by Martin Wood of London for its 'quiet, civilised village, its rapid access to the Portes du Soleil and short airport transfer'. Kathryn Long of London has mixed feelings about Jackson Hole: she said it was her favourite for the skiing and the snow - 'but the town of Jackson is as dead as a doornail'. Ozlem Peksoy of Istanbul, an expert skier who has skied widely in Europe, was loyal to his home country's resorts when it came to picking his favourite: 'Palandoken, Turkey is extremely exciting, sometimes dangerous, with steep long tracks and natural moguls,' he said. Janet Iliffe of Surrey, was impressed by the 'American attitude to service' and voted Breckenridge her favourite. And 'queue discipline, efficient lifts and the general atmosphere' led Sam Eadie of Cheam, Surrey, to put Vail top. Graham Burnett of Staffordshire, said of the Bulgarian resort of Vitosha: 'Probably the only resort where you can ski all day and be at a state opera house on time in the evening.' Favourite tour operators were many and varied: 68 different tour operators were chosen by readers as their favourite. Those mentioned most frequently as top preferences were Supertravel, Bladon Lines, Mark Warner and Inghams. The Ski Company's luxury appealed to many readers and good things were also said about smaller companies such as Ski Scott Dunn, Powder Byrne and Ski La Vie, with skiers liking their flexibility. It seems that staff are the key: clients who liked the people with whom they came into contact tended to be enthusiastic about that company. Even so a quarter of those replying to the questionnaire said they preferred to make their own arrangements. Many thanks to all readers who wrote about their skiing experiences and technique tips. We enjoyed reading them but lack of space means that, sadly, we have not been able to include them in Pink Snow.  ----------------------------- FT READERS' TOP 10 SKI RESORTS  ----------------------------- Resort                   Votes  ----------------------------- 1    Val d'Isere            65 2    Courchevel             45 3    Meribel                41 4    Zermatt                32 5    St. Anton              16 7=   Champery               13 7=   Camonix/Argentiere     13 8    Wengen                 12 9    Val Thorens             8 10=  Tignes                  7 10=  Jackson Hole            7  -----------------------------</p>

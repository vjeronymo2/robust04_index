			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Talk of plots as PLO seizes its own guards THE ARREST by the Palestine Liberation Organisation of several bodyguards at its headquarters in Tunis appears to reflect continued and deep divisions within the organisation over last month's historic Israeli-Palestinian accord. PLO officials were quoted as saying that the crackdown followed two foiled attempts on the life of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman.

Leaders of 10 rejectionist groups based in Damascus, and the Hamas Islamic resistance movement, last week agreed to create a new leadership for the six-year-old intifada uprising in the occupied territories and step up attacks on Israeli targets. Further PLO-Israeli talks towards implementation of the outline deal begin on Wednesday in Cairo and in Taba, the Egyptian Red Sea resort. David Horovitz adds from Jerusalem: Two Israeli hikers, shot and bludgeoned to death in the occupied West Bank on Saturday, were buried yesterday as Israeli ministers vowed not to let their killers undermine the peace accord. Two rival groups opposed to the autonomy deal - the PFLP and the Moslem fundamentalist Islamic Jihad - each yesterday said they were responsible. Most of yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting was devoted to discussion of the killings and of an attempted raid on northern Israel by the PFLP early on Saturday. 'The war continues,' said Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister. 'In the past it was a war against Israel, and today it is a war against peace with Israel.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, in order not to double-count the subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program, we have adjusted our preliminary calculations. Under this program, the MOI required rice millers to purchase rice from farmers at a price ten percent above the prevailing market price. To partially cover the additional payments to the farmers, the MOI provided interest-free loans to the rice millers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our preliminary results of review, we calculated a countervailable subsidy under this program based on the ten percent government-mandated price premium paid to the rice farmers. If we were also to calculate a benefit from the interest-free loans provided to the millers to finance this program, we would be double-counting the benefit conferred on the subject merchandise under this program: once, as grant payments provided to rice farmers, and again as the amount of interest savings incurred by the millers from the interest-free loans used to pay the rice farmers the price premium grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid this double-counting, and to calculate properly the full amount of the subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program, we compared the amount of the ten percent premium paid for paddy rice purchases to the amount of the interest savings from the MOI loans. Because the amount of the interest savings was greater than the amount of the premiums paid on purchases of paddy rice, both the rice farmers and the millers received benefits under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since section 771B of the Act applies to this review, the benefits provided to both rice farmers and millers are deemed to be conferred on the subject merchandise. (See Comment 6 for a discussion of section 771B of the Act.) Therefore, to determine the net benefit to the millers under this program, we calculated the difference between the amount of interest savings under this program and the ten percent premium provided to the rice farmers. This change results in a revised benefit to the millers under this program. The benefit to the paddy farmers remains the same as in the preliminary results. Thus, by dividing the sum of these two benefits by the domestic denominator and applying the export adjustment factor, the net subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program is 0.02 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Respondent points out that the preliminary results have no effect on the cash deposit rate and requests that the Department rescind any instructions to Customs issued upon publication of the preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No instructions were issued to Customs following the publication of the preliminary results.

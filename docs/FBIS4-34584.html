			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" of interview with Oscar Salas Moya, the </F> reelected Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, secretary general, by  Edwin Miranda; place and date not given]    [Text] [Miranda] Please give us your general opinion on the  results of the 10th COB Congress.    [Salas] Right from the start, the COB assembly decided to  reorganize the Bolivian labor union movement. Reports by the  seven COB working committees all reflect the workers' demands on  the need to defend their and the country's interests.    We attained our first objective: the first proposal  regarding  changes and amendments to achieve a modern labor organization in  keeping with the current political situation in the country and  world was approved in a political document of the 10th COB  Congress.    The assembly has ended, and the results of the COB Congress  are quite clear and objective. The COB ratified its strong  opposition to neo-liberalism, to the government's socio-economic  policy, and ratified the prospect of changes within the COB to  safeguard its institutional existence.    The Congress fulfilled the objectives established at the  start as a result of the vision and responsibility entrusted to  it by its grassroots.    [Miranda] What does the approved political document state?    [Salas] This document will guide the COB's organic life for  the next few years. Aside from the documents that were approved  -- the congress discussed three documents -- I want to point out  something very important that the workers must follow: To uphold  the proposals referring to the struggle and life of the Bolivian  workers.    More often than not these documents do not tacitly express  the legitimate rights of the working class of a nation. In my  opinion the most important thing is to organize, guide, and meet  the workers' most urgent needs.    Political parties should not impose their policies on the  workers. The charges made against me in this regard are false  and by no means reflect the truth.    Obviously I am a member of the ASD [Democratic Socialist  Alternative], but this in no way means I will blindly follow the  ideology of my party. There is enough will and autonomy to  adopt decisions and I will see to it that these principles are  respected.    [Miranda] What political tendency will the COB follow?    [Salas] One thing is clear: Oligarchy and U.S. imperialism  is  spreading in Bolivia, seeking to impose a long-term hegemony  that will affect the Bolivian economy, society, and politics.    We are fully aware that this foreign intervention policy  causes suffering to the people and affects the country's  interests.    The policy that will guide the COB's organic life will be to  implement a labor policy that will prevent that hegemony.    We will wage a total struggle against imperialism and to  adopt a staunch civil resistance to neo-liberalism in Bolivia.    [Miranda] What are the positive results of the COB Congress?    [Salas] A political debate within the Bolivian labor sector  is necessary, absolutely necessary. It improves the  organization's life and guides fellow workers. I maintain,  however, that the legitimate interests of the workers are  paramount.    I am absolutely convinced that any political stance within  the COB is important and deserves to be respected within the  democratic framework that has characterized the activities of  the workers in the labor union.    Ideological confrontations are normal. However, I insist  that the workers' plans come above everything else.    I urge miners, peasants, railway workers, labor unions, and  all other COB members to place the unity of the working class  above any ideological disagreement.    They must place the unity of peasants, of those who do not  earn a salary, above everything because only thus will the COB  be strong enough to defend the interests of the working class.</p>

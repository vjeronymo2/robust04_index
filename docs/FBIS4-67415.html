			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Protecting the ozone layer from further  depletion is everyone's concern -- from the use of aerosol  sprays to the safe disposal of cholorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and  halons in appliances.    Yesterday, the Department of Environment and Natural  Resources (DENR) signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with  multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) and the Land Bank of  the Philippines for the launching of a phaseout program for  Ozone Depleting Substances.    Under the MOA, MFIs like the Asian Development Bank and the  World Bank are to provide funds to local appliance manufacturers  for a shift from the use of ozone depleting substances to  non-ozone depleting substances.    Manufacturers concerned are those producing refrigerators  and  air conditioners that use CFCs such as freon and fire  extinguishers that use halon.    The MFl grant amounting to some $7 million will be loaned to  the private sector via the Land Bank.    In his speech at the signing of the MOA, President Ramos  stressed his government "has always stood firm in giving top  priority to the improvement of the environment," even as he  urged Congress to consider as priority measures those concerning  environmental protection.

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation did its third liver transplant  overnight Tuesday, on a 49-year-old San Diego man.  </P> <P> The six-hour surgery on the man, who declined to be identified, began about 6  p.m. Tuesday, a Scripps spokeswoman said. He needed a new liver because of a  condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening and inflammation  of the bile ducts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a Whittier woman who underwent a liver transplant at Scripps last  Friday was upgraded earlier this week to serious but stable condition.  </P> <P> Those two transplants followed the July death of the first person to undergo  the operation in Scripps' new program.  </P></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Countdown to de-regulation 1986: British Gas privatised as a single entity and monopoly supplier to 18m households. 1988: MMC asked to examine reasons for the slow development of competition in the industrial supply market. April 1991: British Gas agrees tough pricing formula with Ofgas. Formula restricts price rises to 5 percentage points below inflation for five years. October 1991: Office of Fair Trading calls for removal of British Gas monopoly and separation of pipeline and marketing operations. Part of supply market to small businesses opened to competition. December 1991: British Gas agrees with OFT to halve its share of the industrial market by 1995 and to set up 'Chinese walls' between its pipelines division and other operations. May 1992: Ofgas forces British Gas to cut household prices. July 1992: Ofgas and British Gas clash over rate of return its pipelines division can earn. Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, threatens MMC referral. August 1992: Mr Cedric Brown appointed British Gas chief executive. The day before taking over he asks for MMC review of all British Gas business. Sir James counters by referring British Gas to the MMC over return on pipelines business. March 1993: Ofgas tells MMC that British Gas should be broken into 12 regional companies with a separate pipelines network and gas-purchasing arm. August 1993: MMC recommends break-up of British Gas by 1997, and phase-out of the tariff market monopoly by 2000-2002 secretary, says break up unnecessary but accelerates proposed MMC timetable for phase out of British Gas monopoly. The timetable proposed yesterday: February 1994: Government and Ofgas to produce consultative document on new market structure. April 1996: British Gas monopoly to end. Non-domestic market to be opened to full competition, and new gas suppliers free to serve any domestic customer, subject to 5 per cent market-share limit for first 12 months. April 1997: Limit to be raised to about 10 per cent. April 1998: Abolition of all controls on gas market.</p>

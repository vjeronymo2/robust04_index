			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP SPORTS;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY NOTHING NEW FOR CITY FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The new-look L.A. City football playoffs will start tonight amid old-look  controversy.  </P> <P> District officials have long tried to devise a format that will please coaches,  but the latest attempt doesn't seem to have done that.  </P> <P> In this season's realignment, for instance, all 12 teams in the 4-A Division  qualified for the playoffs, which would have worked better with only eight  teams. Included were Crenshaw (2-7), Chatsworth (2-7) and Reseda Cleveland  (0-8-1), the bottom three seeded teams that most coaches figured should not  have been included. The top four seeded teams -- Carson, Wilmington Banning,  Dorsey and Granada Hills -- got first-round byes to make the brackets work  properly.  </P> <P> Then Cleveland, devastated by injuries and academic ineligibility, decided  Monday to forfeit its game against Woodland Hills Taft.  </P> <P> Last season, there were 16 teams in 4-A and 12 made the playoffs. The Southern  League, which is in the same conference as Carson, Banning and Dorsey, was  moved to 3-A this year. The 3-A Division now has 37 teams, and 16 qualified for  the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes High girls' tennis team dethroned two-time defending champion  Corona del Mar in the Southern Section Division 4-A championship match Tuesday  at the Claremont Tennis Club.  </P> <P> The match ended in a tie, 9-9, but Palos Verdes (21-0) was awarded the victory  on games, 77-67.  </P> <P> In 3-A, Westlake High of Westlake Village relied on strong doubles play and  upset top-seeded Calabasas, 10-8, and in 2-A, Sunny Hills defeated top-seeded  Los Alamitos, 12-6. In 1-A, San Luis Obispo defeated Cate, 11-7. Brentwood  turned back La Mirada, 10-8, for the Small Schools title.  </P></p>

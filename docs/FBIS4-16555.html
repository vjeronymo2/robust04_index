			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Timofeyev report under "NATO News" rubric: "Let Us </F> Delay Partnership"]    [Text] Of course, the bombing of Serbian positions by NATO  air forces could not fail to affect the prospects of Russia  joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Although, as  Boris Yeltsin bluntly stated on the last day of his visit to  Spain, "for the time being we are not linking the signing of the  document and the complication of the situation in Bosnia. But  we are in no hurry to sign it."    Indeed, is it worth rushing if the partnership program  claims  that stability and security in the Euroatlantic region can be  achieved only on the basis of cooperation and joint actions, yet  it is not even thought necessary to brief Moscow about NATO's  bombing of the Serbs?    But in that case what is going to happen on the date of 21  April announced by the mass media, when Andrey Kozyrev is due to  set off for Brussels in order to sign the document? We have  learned that there are no official understandings with NATO  about this time frame. And not everything about this program is  clear to the Russian parliament yet.    At a parliamentary committee hearing Thursday [14 April] on  the subject of "The Partnership for Peace Program and the Future  of the CIS," there was a question about how much participation  in the program will cost us. According to the military, during  the initial stage the resources allocated to the Defense  Ministry within the 1994 budget are quite sufficient. True,  fears are still being expressed that the NATO partnership will  restrict the potential of the Russian military-industrial  complex in the arms trade. Defense industry workers themselves  believe that participation in the program is unlikely to affect  exports substantially because we have already been squeezed out  of international weapons markets.    By all accounts the signing of the program has been  postponed  because, Kozyrev stated, we are interested in much more serious  relations precluding surprises and unilateral measures,  especially military ones.</p>

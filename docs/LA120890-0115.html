			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAGON PENN, WITH NEW NAME, BACK IN COURT FOR NEW TRIAL  </P> <P> Meecee Parks, formerly known as Sagon Penn, was back in court Friday as the  defendant in another Superior Court criminal trial.  </P> <P> Parks is charged with two counts of altering a court-issued temporary  restraining order to make it appear that the fiance of his ex-girlfriend was  forbidden by court order from seeing the woman.  </P> <P> Parks is also charged with one count of battery on the man, who is now married  to the former girlfriend.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Anear presented his case to the jury Friday. The  defense phase of the trial will be presented Monday morning by attorney Mary  Franklin.  </P> <P> In his opening statement, Anear told the jury that Parks was "essentially  making a constant nuisance of himself" and was a "pest" to his former  girlfriend, Donna Vanessa Parks.  </P> <P> Testifying Friday was Maurice Bell, the man now married to Donna Parks. Bell  said that Meecee Parks was "irritated" and "mad" when Parks arrived at his  fiancee's apartment on the night of Aug. 14.  </P> <P> Bell quoted Parks as saying, "If I can't have them, no one will," which Bell  said referred to his fiancee and her child.  </P> <P> Bell testified that Parks grabbed him several times, hit him on the chest, then  pulled up his shirt and said, "See, no bruises, no proof."  </P> <P> When Parks was known as Sagon Penn -- he legally changed his name several  months ago -- he was acquitted twice on charges of killing a San Diego Police  officer and a civilian ride-along in a highly publicized incident with racial  overtones.  </P></p>

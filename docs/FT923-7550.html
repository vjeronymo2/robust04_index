			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Revenues from state sell-off may beat target THE GOVERNMENT could raise more than the Pounds 8bn expected from privatisation in the current financial year, giving it scope to consider raising additional funds to help curb its rising deficit. Cash already received and funds due from sales that have taken place is set to yield Pounds 6.74bn of the targeted Pounds 8bn for 1992-93. A further Pounds 1bn is to be raised from the sale of government loans made to privatised utility companies, including BT and the electricity sector, taking it to within Pounds 250m of the target figure. This could be covered by the repayment of part of a further Pounds 650m tranche of electricity company debt. The government can take this on to its books in 1992-93 or 1993-94, allowing a degree of flexibility in its planning. The Treasury is not thought to be pushing for extra privatisation cash this year, over and above the budgeted Pounds 8bn. But pressure to drum up more money could grow if the public sector borrowing requirement moves too far above the Pounds 28bn forecast. The government will not officially revise this forecast ahead of the autumn statement in November, but a deficit of well over Pounds 30bn is widely expected because of the severity of the recession and its impact on public spending and tax revenues. The Treasury would be reluctant to take privatisation proceeds that would otherwise accrue in future years simply in order to maximise the present year's takings. But analysis of debt and equity assets still owned by the government in privatised companies suggests it could comfortably realise the Pounds 11bn of proceeds budgeted for during the next two financial years. This is without taking into account likely proceeds from the sale of British Coal and British Rail and the possible sale of part or all of the Post Office. The government's most valuable stake in a private sector company is its 22 per cent of BT. This could raise more than Pounds 4bn. Treasury takes stock, Page 5</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: A cloud in the Mexican sky THE NORTH American Free Trade Agreement has become the most cherished foreign and economic policy initiative of President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, in the three years since it was first proposed. Significant delay, or even rejection, of Nafta is unlikely to lead to national economic collapse, but would probably damage US-Mexican relations, reduce Mexican economic growth, and affect the race to succeed Mr Salinas. Indeed, so much has the Mexican government invested in the treaty that officials refuse publicly to speculate on the consequences of rejection, repeating that the treaty's approval is 'inevitable'. Soon after the US judge's decision on Wednesday, that the treaty must be delayed on environmental grounds, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican trade minister, insisted: 'This decision will absolutely not delay the process of negotiation.' However, news of the judge's ruling caused an immediate drop in the Mexican stock market, which closed down 30 points (1.81 per cent) in unusually heavy trading. It opened lower yesterday but recovered its losses to close slightly higher. Foreign investors also shied away from Mexican paper in the US, where Mexican par bonds showed a large one-day move by falling from 73 1/8 to 71 7/8 on Wednesday. If Nafta were delayed, Mexico's economy would be the first to suffer. The government has had to run a budget surplus and keep real interest rates above 5 per cent so as to cool the economy and finance a huge trade deficit. It was hoping that Nafta's passage would attract more foreign capital to Mexico, and thus raise growth before the presidential election next year. If the fate of Nafta were still not sealed early next year, its fortunes and the Mexican presidential campaign would become intertwined. The nationalist opposition, led by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is likely to argue that the government made a bad error in betting so much on the good intentions of the US, and it would offer voters a more independent foreign and economic policy. Rejection of Nafta would probably feed the old Mexican distrust of the US, and partly reverse the recent improvement in US-Mexican relations. Ramifications would also be felt throughout Latin America, where many leaders see Nafta as an indicator of US interest in the region. Mr Salinas would be awkwardly placed if the treaty were called off. His government could be under domestic poliical pressure to re-affirm Mexico's sovereignty by launching a nationalist initiative, but foreign investors would be seeking a signal that his government's pro-market economic policy was on course. The president is likely to try for a middle course, sending appropriate signals at home and abroad, but there can be little doubt his prestige, and that of pro-US technocrats in his government, would be badly hurt if Nafta were derailed.

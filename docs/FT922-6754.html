			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Babcock in Pounds 56m Greek power deal GREECE'S Public Power Corporation (PPC) has awarded a Dr19.6bn (Pounds 56m) contract to Babcock Energy Systems, the British engineering company, to upgrade a power station at Lavrion, near Athens, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The PPC intends to help reduce atmospheric pollution in Athens by developing generating capacity outside the city and converting diesel-fired units to natural gas during the 1990s. Babcock was the lowest bidder, ahead of Ansaldo of Italy and Asea Brown Boveri, the PPC said. The project involves transferring a steam turbine from the Keratsini power station in Athens to Lavrion, 40 miles from the capital. The turbine will be linked to two existing gas turbines to form a combined cycle unit, raising the plant's capacity from 114 to 180 MW. The project is due for completion in 1994. The Keratsini unit, formerly Athens' main power station, is closed for much of the year because of pollutants from its diesel-fired generators. The PPC plans to convert Keratsini to use Russian natural gas in the mid-1990s.</p>

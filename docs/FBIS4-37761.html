Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf and  religious affairs, has explained that the new edition is similar  to the one which was printed in Germany in 1980 in three sizes.    The minister added that the Holy Book will be of medium size  and will be offered to citizens as part of the faith campaign  led by the struggler leader Saddam Husayn. He said the ministry  will print another 15,000 copies in the next few weeks in the  form of sections of the Holy Koran to be used in the mosque  religious courses held throughout the country during the summer  holidays.</p>

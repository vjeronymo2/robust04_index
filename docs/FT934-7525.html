			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Management: Why it's hard to be a good parent Few issues generate so much heat within companies as the relationship between headquarters and the rest of the organisation. Not for nothing do managers still chuckle cynically at the old jibe: 'I'm from head office and I'm here to help you.' So it is surprising that there has been little useful business school research into how the relationship can be made more effective. Six years ago academics, Michael Goold and Andrew Campbell of the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, produced a book which delved deeply into the way head offices advise, control and otherwise add value to their constituent businesses - or 'parent' them. Called Strategies and Styles, it examined the 'parenting' styles of 16 leading British companies and analysed whether their methods were appropriate to their portfolios of businesses. The book proved influential in several respects. It established that it is hard for a head office (or 'corporate centre', in current jargon) to be good at more than one distinct parenting style. It demonstrated that the sustained success of Hanson and BTR has been partly because their styles have been better matched to their types of businesses than those of past conglomerates such as ITT. It underlined that the hands-off style used by GEC and other UK companies in electronics was inappropriate and had hindered the creation of globally competitive businesses. And it showed that shifting one's style is harder than changing one's business portfolio. But, to judge from their recent public statements, several of the companies most praised in the book have forgotten its lessons and seem to be drifting towards a muddy and ineffective middle-of-the-road style. The most notable nascent offender is Hanson, with BTR not far behind. In 1987 Goold and Campbell identified three parenting styles. 'Financial control' companies, epitomised at the time by Hanson and BTR, along with Tarmac and GEC, tend to delegate strategic decisions to the managers of a diverse portfolio of business units, which have few if any dealings with each other. The centre's main role is to agree demanding short-term financial targets for the businesses and to monitor them ruthlessly. 'Strategic planning' companies, exemplified by BOC, Cadbury Schweppes, United Biscuits, BP and others, focus on only a few 'core' businesses. The centre participates actively in formulating their strategies, aiming to help them make better decisions. It often initiates strategies which involve inter-related businesses. 'Strategic control' companies, including Courtaulds, ICI and Vickers, sit squarely in the middle. They have a strong commitment to decentralisation and they control their businesses against demanding targets. But they also have extensive strategic planning processes through which the centre seeks to add value by reviewing, challenging and monitoring the strategies of each business. Goold, Campbell and a colleague, Kathleen Luchs, have revisited the original material in the light of the companies' experience since 1987. Their two-part review, published in the October and December issues of Long Range Planning journal*, makes instructive reading. They find it 'ironic' that Hanson has said repeatedly over the past year that it will focus on seven 'core' businesses and that BTR has claimed it is successful in global as well as regional businesses. Just as odd is BTR's declaration that it intends to share technology across businesses. These pronouncements have obviously been meant to reassure investors that neither company is losing its way. But that is precisely what they seem to be doing - again assuming they mean what they say. As the Ashridge trio points out, the essence of the financial control style remains its ability to improve performance in autonomous businesses. It 'is much less suited to a portfolio of 'core' businesses, or to (ones) engaged in fierce global competitive battles, in which different national businesses must co-ordinate strategies to achieve success'. The academics warn financial control companies explicitly 'to avoid blurring their strategies by claiming that they can also handle the sort of businesses that require a strategic control or even a strategic planning style'. For admirers of Hanson and BTR, a further concern must be Ashridge's new evidence of how hard it is to make effective use of strategic control, the centre ground towards which the two companies seem to be drifting. All five of the original study companies in this category have had trouble, mainly because their portfolios were too diverse for it to work well. 'The old idea that a decentralised structure, coupled with a modern budgetary and planning system, could allow a competent corporate management team to add value to almost any business fails to stand up,' concludes the Ashridge team. Hence, in part, the decisions of Courtaulds and ICI to demerge themselves. Strategic control also requires a difficult balance of tightness and looseness. To strike that balance, head office needs to know a lot of detail about its various businesses. None of this is to argue that the boundaries between the three styles are watertight and that limited aspects of strategic control cannot be grafted on to either of the other styles. But a company's parenting style is usually based on a set of deeply embedded attitudes and practices which are mutually consistent. Alter one of them and you may reduce the effectiveness of the whole system. Changing a parenting style is a far more complex and risky process than most companies and investors seem to think. Head offices are not leopards, but nor are they chameleons. *Pergamon. Tel 0865-794141.</p>

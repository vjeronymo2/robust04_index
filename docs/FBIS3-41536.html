This was the result of a meeting of representatives from  over  a dozen international organizations and East Asian nations to  coordinate the fight against seawater pollution in East Asia.  The project was sponsored by the UNDP and the Global  Environment Foundation (GEF).    According to the agreement, the IMO, as an executive body of  the agreement, will consult with East Asian countries about  personnel training, funding, information exchange and the  management of experimental zones.    The three-day meeting was held in this coastal city in East  China's Fujian Province.    Three experimental zones were designated -- respectively in  Xiamen, Malacca in Malaysia and Batangas in the Philippines --  to provide other East Asian countries with experience for the  comprehensive control of coastal waters.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): Landmark rulings - Canada / New national policies in Canada will bring vigorous competition between the telephone companies and cable-TV operators Canada has moved more cautiously than many other industrial countries to lift the regulatory barriers which have long stifled competition in the telecommunications market. The slow pace of change has given consumers fewer choices and has arguably held back technological innovation. On the other hand, Canadians continue to enjoy one of the world's most efficient phone systems, and among the lowest charges for basic service. However, the winds of change are likely to blow more strongly in the wake of a series of landmark rulings in mid-September by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The CRTC's new policy, which is expected to form the regulatory framework for the next 10 to 20 years, opens the way for much more vigorous competition between the established provincial phone companies, cable-TV operators and the plethora of resellers which have recently gained a toe-hold in the long-distance market. (Resellers offer discount prices by leasing lines at bulk rates from the phone companies). 'The Commission has determined that barriers to entry, as well as restrictions on the participation of telephone companies in emerging information and transactional telecommunications service markets, should be removed,' concludes the CRTC in its 165-page report. Under the ruling, the hefty cross-subsidy between long-distance and local calls will be significantly reduced by allowing local phone companies to push up their charges by as much as 40 per cent over the next three years. At the same time, the CRTC will relax price regulation replacing a rate-of-return yardstick with a more market-oriented system of price caps - 'this should lead to price stability for consumers and and greater flexibility for telephone companies to invest in a more modern infrastructure and to introduce new services,' says the CRTC. These reforms are likely to encourage newcomers to enter the local market in competition with the provincial phone companies, such as Bell Canada (Ontario and Quebec), BC Telecom (British Columbia) and AGT (Alberta), which presently have a monopoly on local services. But the telcos will also be free to spread their wings, both as carriers and content providers. Although they will not for the time being be granted broadcast licences, they will be able to provide distribution facilities for broadcasters, including cable companies. Analysts at Nesbitt Burns, a Toronto securities firm, predict that the ruling will benefit almost every sector of the telecommunications industry. The big phone companies 'asked for a more freely competitive market where they would have the flexibility to use their experience, expertise and considerable reach to offer a broad range of services to customers,' Nesbitt Burns says in a report. 'This decision goes a very long way in that direction.' Resellers are likely to reap the benefit of lower charges for access to the telcos' switching facilities - 'in the medium-term, the advent of local competition could lead to some profitable expansion opportunities,' adds Nesbitt Burns. Cable-TV operators will also be able to broaden their horizons, without any siginficant erosion of their existing businesses. Within each sector however, there are bound to be winners and losers. Judging by recent experience in the long-distance market, where competition began in 1992, some surprises are also in store. The telephone companies, which have long had a reputation as slow-moving behemoths, have turned out to be unexpectedly agile. Bell Canada has cut its long-distance charges by an average of 30 pc since 1987, and by up to 60 pc for high-volume users. Productivity improvements, including the elimination of 5,000 jobs, have shaved 11 per cent off Bell's operating costs per access line over the past five years. By contrast, business has been unexpectedly tough for the plethora of newcomers in the long-distance market. Unitel, which pioneered competitive long-distance services, lost CDollars 82m in 1992 and another CDollars 525m last year. Most resellers do not expect to be in the black until 1996 at the earliest. STN, one of the most aggressive resellers, recently announced a thorough restructuring, including the departure of its chief executive, after seeing its share price tumble from a peak of CDollars 7.63 in the second half of last year, to little more than CDollars 2 in mid-September. Even before the recent CRTC decision, the phone companies had begun to secure their position in the converging worlds of telephony, broadcasting, computers and consumer electronics. Stentor, which is the long-distance consortium of provincial telcos, unveiled plans earlier this year for an open-access, interactive broadband network. The coast-to-coast project - known as the Beacon iniative - involves an investment of about CDollars 8bn, and aims to reach 80-90 per cent of Canadian homes and businesses within the next decade. Stentor is also in the process of setting up a multimedia company to develop suitable content for the system. The cable-TV industry is smaller and more fragmented than the phone business. But cable companies have the advantage that more than four in every five Canadian homes have access to cable, one of the highest penetrations in the world. Their ability to offer competitive local phone service is growing with the gradual installation of fibre-optic networks equipped with two-way switches. By far the best-placed cable company is Rogers Communications of Toronto. Rogers, whose interests include a stake in Unitel, the long-distance operator, struck a deal earlier this year to buy Maclean Hunter, the third biggest cable operator. Once the purchase is finalised, Rogers will have a 31 per cent share of Canada's cable market. The Rogers-Maclean Hunter deal could be the start of a period of consolidation, which would put the cable industry in a better position either to forge alliances with the phone companies, or to challenge them head on.</p>

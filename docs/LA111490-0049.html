			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BUTTERFLIES': VIEW OF A MARRIAGE  </P> <P> "Apocalyptic Butterflies" is a war play. Its battlefield is a small kitchen in  a small house in Fryeburg, Me. Its combatants are Hank and Muriel, and its  skirmishes continue the one martial confrontation that will never be fought to  more than a draw: the War Between Men and Women.  </P> <P> Playwright Wendy MacLeod doesn't dig too deeply into character in her  razor-sharp domestic comedy at the Zephyr Theatre, and needn't to prove her  points. Her antagonists are not merely icons for an unhappy wife turned harpy  and an inadequate husband turned Neanderthal bully. They are signposts of  disaster for any relationships in which self-motivation and self-gratification  erode the structure of the union itself.  </P> <P> An earlier play than MacLeod's "The House of Yes," currently at Las Palmas  Theatre, "Butterflies" is painted in broad strokes, and the madness of  MacLeod's method is reminiscent of that earlier "War Between Men and Women,"  the culmination of James Thurber's lifelong exploration of the battle of the  sexes. The edge of both humorists' wit is sharpened by an underlying  bitterness. As Thurber applied his discomfort with relationships to  illuminating their absurdity, MacLeod uses her discomfort with their modern  equivalent to define some of the timeless barriers in domestic partnership.  </P> <P> MacLeod puts it right on the line, and so does Stephen Caffrey in his  no-holds-barred direction. He calls a shrew a shrew and a clod a clod, but  never allows his actors to overindulge. They shriek at each other interminably,  but within the director and playwright's outlines. They're crying for  understanding and, like many couples, can't do it at normal volume.  </P> <P> Paul Raci and Elizabeth Hanley are the foes, and handle the couple's anger with  compassion and a great deal of humor. But they're somewhat overshadowed by  Megan Mullally's gem of a performance as Trudy, a woman Hank picks up during  "24 hours on his own." Mullally pinpoints all the facets of Trudy's twisted  logic, and her line readings glisten with comic brilliance. Peg Shirley  provides gentle wisdom as Hank's mother, and Jerry Tullos has a nice nuttiness  as his father, though Tullos, the only cast member using a New England accent,  lets it slip a couple of times.  </P> <P> MacLeod wants us to laugh at her couple's plight, and we often do. We know that  as soon as they sit down and start to communicate, half their battle is won,  even though we go along with Thurber's prophecy that there will never be a full  armistice.  </P></p>

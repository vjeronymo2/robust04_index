			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CPRF on S. Korea's Nuke Development" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] called a press  conference for domestic and foreign reporters here today and  published a memorandum on the promotion of nuclear arms  development in a planned way in South Korea and systematic  abrogation of the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearization.    The memorandum says:    The North and the South of Korea, in the joint declaration  on  denuclearization, solemnly declared at home and to the world  that they would use nuclear energy only for a peaceful purpose  and not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium-enriching  facilities. But South Korea, contrary to the declaration, has  extracted plutonium in secrecy with disguised nuclear  reprocessing facilities and purchased nuclear material from  third countries and systematically diverted it to nuclear arms  development. Worse still, it is now openly claiming that the  joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the North  and the South has become invalid in actuality.    The memorandum further says:    Though South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test  facilities in the Taedok complex as peaceful atomic facilities,  all the data available prove that they are reprocessing  facilities.    South Korea, regarding the introduction of reprocessing  facilities as "one of the two main axes" of the strategy of  nuclear bomb development, concluded a contract on technical  services and supply for the building of reprocessing facilities  with the S.J.N. Company of France in the 1970s. When the  contract got infeasible, the "Fifth Republic" introduced  post-irradiation test facilities from the company under the  crafty cloak of "chemical treatment substitution program." They  completed the building of the facilities in November 1985 and  put them into full-dressed operation in 1987.    The post-irradiation test facilities are, to all intents and  purposes, reprocessing facilities equipped with the structure  and processes necessary for the extraction of plutonium, that  is, facilities designed to put spent fuel strong in  radioactivity into the shields, transport, dissolve and cut it  by remote control and analyze and separate it.    The South Korean authorities, in league with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], have systematically  reprocessed at the post-irradiation test facilities  insufficiently spent fuel discharged from the pressurized heavy  water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor and  extracted a large amount of plutonium every year. According to  preliminary data, the total quantity of extracted plutonium  amounts to 50 kilograms. Nevertheless, the IAEA has closed its  eyes to the post-irradiation test facilities of South Korea,  while making a case of our radiochemical laboratory which is  peaceful nuclear facilities.    South Korea has also imported in secrecy plutonium necessary  for nuclear arms development from long ago.    No sooner had the chief executive of the "Sixth Republic"  issued "declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula and building of peace" on November 8, 1991 than he  concluded a "joint agreement on reprocessing" with the United  Kingdom and allowed a special office of the UK to be set up in  Seoul. The "agreement" stipulates that spent nuclear fuel  discharged from atomic reactors of South Korea should be  transferred to reprocessing plants of the UK to extract  plutonium, which should be carried back to South Korea.    Under this "agreement," South Korea is shipping in [word  indistinct] dioxide of plutonium and uranium.    Foreign media express strong concern over this move of South  Korea, saying it is evident that South Korea is going to follow  in the footsteps of Japan which intends to stockpile as much as  84 tons of plutonium by 2010.    South Korea is trying to legitimize and enlarge the  introduction of plutonium from abroad.    The South Korean authorities began to promote the  development  of a fast breeder reactor entering the 1980s and recently chose  a remodeled light water reactor and announced that they would  complete the designing by 2001 and put it into operation by 2007.    By the development of "a remodeled light water reactor using  plutonium as nuclear fuel" they mean to continue to produce and  introduce a large amount of plutonium by diverting world public  attention elsewhere.    They have also laid artificial hurdles in the way of  implementing "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the  Korean peninsula" which the North and the South adopted and  effectuated reflecting the unanimous desire and will of the  entire fellow countrymen.    Especially, the present South Korean authorities have worked  in a planned and systematic way to destroy it. They first  argued for "nullification in principle" of the joint declaration  on the denuclearisation over the "nuclear issue" of the North  and then asserted that it was "abrogated in fact" and at last  declared it "practically null and void," reducing it to a mere  sheet of paper.    The South Korean authorities are calling for "nuclear  sovereignty" and "counterdevelopment of nuclear weapons" and  resorting to despicable acts to conceal the reality of their  nuclear armament.    The South Korean authorities must open to the public the  amount of plutonium they have illegally secured and immediately  shut down the post-irradiation test facilities, that is,  reprocessing facilities.    The memorandum strongly protests with the IAEA against its  application of a double standard.</p>

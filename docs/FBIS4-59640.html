			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natasha Bukhari] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Nominees for the new Palestinian self-rule  authority in Jericho and Gaza, though enthusiastic about the  future are reluctant to assume the task, a PLO official said  Monday [16 May].    "It is a difficult responsibility that requires a lot of  work  in light of the uncertainty of the situation in the self-rule  areas," said the official who asked not to be named.    He added that the reluctance of some nominees to accept  offers by the PLO to assume positions of authority in Gaza and  the West Bank town of Jericho was understandable as the task of  members of the new Palestinian authority is "nothing to be  envied for."    Asad 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was offered a position in the new  Palestinian authority, told the JORDAN TIMES that he has not yet  made up his mind on whether or not to accept the offer.    "There is a very thin line between the enthusiasm I feel  about the offer and the political suicide I might be committing  if I do accept," Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, who currently heads the  'Abd-al-Hamid Shoman Foundation said.    He said fear of political suicide stems from three  "legitimate" reasons; the first was the "not-so-promising  Israeli attitude."    "The Palestinian right to self determination does not seem  to  be a real concern for the Israelis and there are no guarantees  that it will ever be," he explained.    The second reason for Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's reservations is  his "lack of confidence in the ability of Western and  international communities to convince Israel to ease the  pressure off the Palestinians and help them accommodate their  needs in the coming stage."    "Last but not least," he added, "I have my doubts about the  Palestinians' competence in managing, organising and running the  self-rule areas in a manner that would meet the expectations of  people in the occupied territories."    Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman said that he realised that a decision on  his part should be taken soon, but that before he makes any  decision on the matter, he has to make "a clear cut evaluation  of the whole situation."    Commenting on the reluctance of other Palestinians leaders  to  be part of the new Palestinian authority, Ibrahim Qub'ah, a  member of the Palestine National Council (PNC), said that in  many cases, personal interests rise above national ones. He  said that it was every Palestinian's duty to participate in  forming and serving the new authority.    "All competent politicians should help found the new  authority, it is their duty towards their country," Mr. Qub'ah  said. Asked whether he would accept such an offer, he said that  there were more qualified politicians for the job than he was,  but that he will be willing to accept a councilling position in  the authority.    Mr. Qub'ah added that despite the refusal of very few people  to assume leading positions in the future authority, there are  unqualified Palestinians seeking high power positions.    "I would suggest the opening of training centres for our  unqualified young men who will eventually take over."    He said that to ensure a solid base for competent authority,  a scientific approach should be adopted.    "We can train and teach our people the science of management  of utilities exactly like we trained the police forces," he  added.    Salih Ra'fat, a member of the Palestinian Democratic Union  (FIDA) said that some leading Palestinians had their political  reasons for turning down the offer of participating in the new  Palestinian self-rule authority. One such leader, according to  Mr. Ra'fat, is Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who led the Palestinian  delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks with Israel.    "He (Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi) disagrees with Yasir 'Arafat's  ruling  methods," Mr. Ra'fat said.    FIDA has opposed the self-rule agreement signed in Cairo on  May 4 called on the Palestinian people to strive to eliminate  the "restrictions imposed on them by the agreement," Mr. Ra'fat  said.    He added that being part of the new Palestinian authority  was  one medium to do so and that they (FIDA) would like to see more  of their members nominated for leading positions in the new  authority.    Two FIDA officials, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Azmi Shu'aybi,  have  been nominated for the new authority," but we are working on  including at least one more FIDA official," Mr. Ra'fat said.    He said that he "respected" Hanan 'Ashrawi's decision to  decline the appointment in the new authority in order to devote  herself and her efforts to the Independent Palestinian  Commission for Human Rights, to which she was recently elected  as commissioner.    "It is only natural for Ms. 'Ashrawi to refuse the offer,  for  she has chosen the duty of monitoring the performance of the new  authority," said Mr. Ra'fat.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Pashto </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY commentator -- read by </F> announcer]    [Text] On the fifth anniversary of the escape of the  occupying Soviet forces from Afghanistan, events in the country  are moving in two different ways. The Islamic State of  Afghanistan, as the center of the gathering of real mojahedin,  is defending the results of the jihad. And the mojahedin  continue to sacrifice themselves in continuing their holy jihad  to eliminate the last remnants of the foreigners' hirelings like  the infamous Karmal-Dostam group. But Golboddin Hekmatyar, the  known wheeler-dealer of the period of jihad, has, in alliance  with Parcham and Khalq, the two factions of the Communist Party,  started a rebellion against the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the  Islamic State. Golboddin, on the one hand by his coalition with  the so-called National Movement, which is headed by  nation-seller Karmal, has embarked on the killing of the people  of Kabul. On the other hand with the atheist Tanay [exiled  former defense minister under Najibollah] he gathered around him  the band of Khalqis and instructed him to embark on the  establishment of the so-called peace movement outside  Afghanistan.    It is not without a reason that at the time of the attack by  Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam and on the occasion of the fifth  anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan,  once again the communist Shahnawaz Tanay raises his voice, and  in cooperation with Golboddin he expresses his opposition to all  jihadi leaders and Afghan mojahedin. This shows that to reach  his sinister goals, Golboddin is serving as an instrument for  the reunion of Khalqis and Parchamis. But for the mojahedin the  fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet occupier from  Afghanistan serves as a strong motive for the consolidation of  the jihad's trenches against the defeated communists of Khalq  and Parcham and their ill-nature. The heroic affirmative  response of all jihadi organizations to the holy jihad against  the Karmal-Dostam militia reflects this fact. The situation of  the country and the coordination of the jihadi organizations to  crush the Karmal-Dostum militia show that the mojahed Afghan  nation is determined to completely eliminate from the Islamic  State the twin movements of Tanay and Dostam on the sixth  anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces. And Golboddin  who against the wishes of all mojahedin of the Hezb-e Eslami  [Islamic Party] has formed an unholy alliance with them will not  have a better fate than them.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 June -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  trenchantly rejected State Duma attempts on 22 June to question  the legitimacy of Russia signing NATO's Partnership for Peace  program. On that day, the communists' faction called for the  signing of this document "to be deemed invalid," comparing it  with the "Barbarossa Plan," under which Hitler invaded the USSR.    In the words of the minister, who stressed that he was  speaking as a deputy of the lower house of parliament, "It was  simply the voice of traitors" speaking at that 22 June session  of the State Duma. A group of politicians, he went on, took the  liberty of speaking utterly disgracefully. It appears that some  people would like to revive the image of the enemy. "We are  talkin here of red- brown [communist-fascist] political  mongrels. The communists left millions of people to rot in  camps and the fascists killed millions of people."    Andrey Kozyrev said that "one of the parties involved in all  of this or, rather, its faction in the State Duma, enjoys  material and organizational support from neofascists in the  Federal Republic of Germany." It is no coincidence, he added,  that "in his book, Zhirinovskiy proposes giving away Russian  lands--Vyborg and Kaliningrad.... This is probably his German  neofascist friends ordering the return of Russian lands, the  trade in Russian lands."    Noting that he will answer for his words, the minister said:  "I do not think this is the stance of the faction, but it is the  stance of certain politicians. This is treachery against  Russia, and it was this that came from the red-browns on 22  June."    In the minister's words, Russia is building partnership  relations, based on equality, dignity and, acknowledgement of  its role as a great power, both in the West and the East.  Everyone is well aware that our cooperation with NATO is an  element of a global picture. It represents no threat at all to  our neighbors. On the contrary, it is an element of improvement  and cooperation, Andrey Kozyrev added.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (16): Service in high demand - Training from a distance is the task of Ace-Hi in the Highlands and Islands, but it needed the right technology to hold 'conversations' with trainees / Remote working in rural areas FEW would deny that the quality of life in the Highlands and Islands is high, but there is little highly-paid work. Ace-Hi is a government-funded organisation set up on a Scandinavian telecottage model which trains people, mostly women, to become teleworkers or teletrainers. Ace-Hi's chief executive officer, Caroline Hay, believes there is a large resource of highly skilled people in the highlands and islands, especially among women. It might take as many as three flights and a ferry to reach the Invergordon telecottage, so remote teletraining is vital and the service is much in demand. 'Three years ago we did a pilot training scheme for women in Ross and Cromarty who were housebound by caring commitments,' explains Hay. 'We had 100 applications for places.' Ace-Hi sought technology that would enable its DOS-based PCs to connect via a modem, and provide interactive 'conversation' with the trainee. There were three criteria: a simple, friendly connection process for the end-user; cost; and the degree of interactivity - 'there were only a handful of possibilities three years ago. Microcom won on simplicity of use, but as an unexpected bonus we also got easy file-transfer,' says technical officer Colin Craig. Hay is working on a vocational qualification for teletrainees, which she says must preface any large-scale attempts to train and market telework services. But already she notes a pattern of co-operation among the four now fully productive workers trained in the 1991 pilot. They have several contracts of their own, but other work is shared. 'Skills such as word processing and other business tasks are easily done from home,' she says. 'It's a better-paid alternative to seasonal work in the tourist industry or waitressing.'                       *      *      * TECHNOLOGY FILE The Association of Community Enterprises in the Highlands (Ace-Hi) trains small groups throughout the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles, who link up with their computer tutors. It is a limited company with charitable status Software: Ace-Hi has 50 copies of Microcom's Carbon Copy software for Windows. Version 3.1 offers remote control and file transfer capabilities for IBM and Windows 3.1 environments.

The installation went live in 1988. Supplier: Microcom was founded in the US in 1980 and has 10 employees in the UK office set up in 1986. Turnover exceeds Dollars 4m. It acquired Carbon Copy in 1989 and now has more than 800,000 installations worldwide. The company concentrates on remote computing solutions such as networking and internetworking products, and created Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) on data compression for modems. Cost: Carbon Copy costs Pounds 145 (list price), available through VARS. Contact: Martin Perry, general manager at Microcom UK. Tel: 0483 740763</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] What alliances can be formed in the next Congress  that will open on 10 August 1994? This seems to be the question  the political parties that will be represented in Congress are  already asking themselves. A question that, for the moment, has  no answer. For some, the question involves electoral  calculations for 1996, and for others, only a question of  presence or leadership within Congress. Thus, each group has its  own expectations. Some are interested in the presidency of the  Congress, while others probably are not.    There exists a partisan thesis according to which the forces  of the center left and the left join together for the purpose of  isolating the Social Christians and the government parties. The  MPD [Democratic Peoples Movement], the ID [Democratic Left], DP  [Popular Democratic Party], PRE [Ecuadoran Roldosist Party],  Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action, CFP [Concentration of  Popular Forces], Alfarist Radical Front, National Liberation  Party, and the Socialist Party of Ecuador could join together,  leaving aside the Social Christians and the government, so that  the former will be "burned" by their association with the  latter. Supporters of this thesis appear to be primarily certain  leaders of ID and DP. This strategy, however, seems not to  appeal to many, especially the people of the MPD.    Yesterday, Juan Jose Castello, leader of the now powerful  MPD  bloc, said he did not view an alliance with the DP as having  great possibilities "due to the rightward leaning position  adopted recently by the president of that party, Osvaldo  Hurtado. If they want a congressional accord, they will have to  change their positions" said Castello, who seemed yesterday  rather contrary to entering any alliance.    For its part, the Social Christian Party (PSC) seems to be  interested in forming an opposition bloc that would exclude the  government and the center-left parties. The idea is to  stigmatize the center-left parties as parties of the government.  This is more or less the same tactic; everyone wants to place  their rivals next to the discredited government.    For that reason, Jaime Nebot's party seems interested in  seeking an alliance with the MPD, CFP, PRE, and the  independents, placing Fernando Larrea in the Presidency of  Congress. The PSC believes it is of no advantage to occupy the  Presidency of Congress because it always imparts to the occupant  the "repellant" odor of governmentalism.    This possibility, however, does not seem very likely either  because of the intransigent position of the MPD, which would  become the "starlet" of Congress. Castello was very clear  yesterday when he said he did not rule out the possibility of an  arrangement with the Social Christians, "if and when they  renounce their interest in privatization." That is the  touchstone: privatization would align the Social Christians with  the government, or it will not pass. The Social Christians are  faced with a dilemma: either they support privatization in which  they believe, and they appear to be allies of the government, or  they take a position contrary to privatization, just to lend  credibility to their opposition.    An MPD-PSC pact would appear to be asking the impossible,  but  nothing can be ruled out in politics. MPD voters, however,  surely would not like to see their deputies reach an agreement  with the greatest defenders of privatization.    There are also those who hope to form an opposition  coalition  called the "dignity" bloc. The idea, conceived by deputy-elect  Frank Vargas, is that all of the left and left-center parties  that have not been in government form a coalition, even knowing  that they will not constitute a majority.    HOY has learned that Vargas wants to have talks with the  leaders of the MPD, the Socialists, National Liberation, CFP,  and other parties that have never been in power.    This possibility, however, also seems remote because it will  be difficult to find deputies willing to enter the congressional  fray, knowing that they will not be in the majority, which is  the only way they can enter legislative commissions. What could  be called macropolitics -- that which is designed to find an  alternative to presidential power -- is faced with  micropolitics, plagued by immediate interests, and which  contemplates the possibility of present power. "A bird in the  hand is worth two in the bush," several possible Vargas allies  must be thinking, before supporting the remote and still  uncertain chances of the general [Vargas].    These are all possibilities that are bandied about, ideas  that circulate, but as yet there is nothing definite. A few more  days will decide. For now, all that is certain is that no one  wants to be the government's allies.</p>

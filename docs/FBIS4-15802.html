			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 11 April -- Reports by the Black Sea Fleet  press center on the course of events in Odessa on 10 April  accuse Ukraine of an armed attack on Garrison 318 of a fleet  division belonging to the Black Sea Fleet conservation which, as  the Black Sea Fleet press center stresses, was in the "best  traditions of the SS Galicia division."    The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that  the reports of the Black Sea Fleet are a provocation and an  outrageous lie. There was no "attack" in Odessa. In reality, a  group of officers was detained: Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy  Starikov, and Aleksandr Zelenko, but they were detained for  unlawful actions during an incident concerning the piratical  seizure from Odessa of valuable navigational equipment on 9  April by the Black Sea Fleet hydrographic vessel Cheleken.  Apart from refusing to heed an order from a senior naval  officer, the abovementioned officers called on their  subordinates, who had arrived on board the Cheleken, to "aim  their weapons at the Ukrainian seamen; to prepare to fire; and  to fire at will." The statement from the Ukrainian Ministry of  Defense press center states that such actions by the officers  led to the emergence of a real threat to the security in the  port of Odessa.    The actions of the command of Garrison 318 were directed at  provoking an armed conflict between the servicemen of the Black  Sea Fleet and officials of the port of Odessa, the border  guards, and the personnel of the Ukrainian Navy. Officials of  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and law enforcement bodies are  investigating the circumstances of the incident, which could  have caused the deaths of the personnel. All the actions are  taking place in accordance with the current legislation of  Ukraine. There were no cases of violence in relation to the  division's personnel and none whatsoever in relation to members  of their families.    The statement says that there is no doubt that it was a  planned provocation aimed not only at seizing valuable equipment  but also designed to disregard Ukrainian laws. The press  service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense categorically rejects  the untrue information that is being circulated by Russian mass  media. Not only does it not conform to reality, but it also  undermines trust and sows hostility between the friendly peoples  of neighboring countries. Ukraine has proposed that Russia's  Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs send their  representatives to take part in investigating the incident.</p>

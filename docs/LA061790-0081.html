			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD FACES HARD CHOICES IN TRIMMING $2.8 MILLION  </P> <P> For the last three years, Oxnard has been able to use reserve funds to fend off  a government administrator's most dreaded foe: a deficit.  </P> <P> But the fiend has returned with a price tag of $2.8 million, and officials for  the city -- operating on an annual budget of $61.7 million -- have vowed not to  touch its reserves, which have dwindled to a dangerously low level.  </P> <P> As the city begins to discuss ways to chop the deficit, many residents fear  that, without the use of reserve funds, the hungry deficit will eat away at  city services such as police and fire protection.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, voters overwhelmingly rejected a 5% utility-tax increase  that city officials had hoped would solve the city's financial crisis by  generating $5 million annually. The loss at the polls came despite a $40,000  publicity campaign for the measure, funded primarily by developers and city  employee groups.  </P> <P> City officials have said service and personnel cuts are now inevitable. The  City Council began meeting last week to discuss which cuts to make and how deep  to make them. But council members decided to delay final decisions until  Tuesday, when the results of a long-awaited management audit are to be  released.  </P> <P> In an effort to balance the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, City  Manager David Mora has compiled a list of 64 personnel cuts -- including 16 in  the Police Department and eight in the Fire Department.  </P> <P> An early target for cuts, the Colonia Youth Boxing Gym was taken off Mora's  cost-cutting list last month after several Latino parents urged the council to  spare the gym, which costs the city about $44,000 a year and serves about 50  boys a day.  </P> <P> While some city officials have characterized the city's fiscal situation as a  full-blown crisis, others are more optimistic. "This is not the end of the  world, and we are acting like it is," Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said at the  beginning of last week's budget hearings.  </P> <P> This year's deficit is primarily the result of several unexpected expenditures,  including a $690,000 increase in the cost for workers compensation and $460,000  to remove asbestos from city buildings, Mora said.  </P> <P> "If we didn't have these new elements, we'd be balanced," Mora said.  </P> <P> Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer said Oxnard's long-term budget  problems have developed because of a series of revenue losses beginning in  1986.  </P> <P> For example, that year the federal government ended a revenue-sharing program  that generated $2.2 million a year for Oxnard. The same year, the city lost an  additional $1.5 million because of reduced franchise taxes paid by Southern  California Gas Co.  </P> <P> In 1987, the city lost $2.1 million when the City Council eliminated a 2%  utility tax two years before it was scheduled to expire.  </P> <P> The following year, Oxnard began losing $600,000 annually when fines from  convicted drunk drivers began to be diverted from the city to the county.  </P> <P> However, Mayer said the city is beginning to see increased sales-tax revenue  generated from several new businesses, such as the Price Club, Home Depot and  the Oxnard Auto Mall, all of which opened recently near the Pacific Coast and  Ventura freeways.  </P> <P> He said the city is expecting increased sales and property taxes from several  new developments -- including the 450,000-square-foot Plaza del Norte shopping  center, to be completed in September, and the 4.4-million-square-foot Town  Center business park and shopping mall, to be completed within 15 years.  </P> <P> The developments "have the potential to ease the problems that we have," Mayer  said.  </P> <P> Still, revenue from such new developments are not expected to solve this year's  budget crisis, and city officials say Oxnard residents are just going to have  to tighten their belts.  </P> <P> The Police Department would suffer the biggest financial loss -- $795,000 a  year -- under Mora's plan. Mora has suggested that the city eliminate 16  positions, including six motorcycle traffic officers, a youth-services officer  and a victim-assistance specialist. Anticipating such cuts, the department has  left vacant four positions on the city's drunk-driving task force. Mora has  suggested that the unit be eliminated.  </P> <P> The 154-officer department already has eight vacancies. If the recommended cuts  are made, those jobs would remain unfilled and eight more would be eliminated  through attrition, city officials have said.  </P> <P> Police Chief Robert Owens told the council last week that the recommended cuts  would hurt the department's ability to protect residents. "I don't want to give  up anything," he said.  </P> <P> Owens told the council that the victim-assistance specialist works as a trained  counselor for victims of rape and child abuse. The youth-services officer acts  as a liaison to the city's elementary and junior high schools, he said. He also  warned that, when the city eliminated the motorcycle traffic team in 1978, the  number of traffic deaths in Oxnard jumped.  </P> <P> Since August, when the drunk-driving enforcement team was eliminated, the  Police Department has arrested 495 fewer motorists than during the same period  a year earlier, when 1,690 were taken in, police said.  </P> <P> Last month, dozens of police officers and firefighters tried to eliminate the  need for personnel cuts by campaigning door-to-door in support of the 5%  utility-tax increase.  </P> <P> In an effort to save money, Councilwoman Ann Johs suggested last week that the  county be asked to take over the police and fire protection in Oxnard. The  council is scheduled to discuss the proposal on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Parks and Recreation Department would suffer the largest personnel losses  under Mora's plan.  </P> <P> The city manager has recommended the elimination of 17 positions there,  including two landscape workers, a park ranger and nine custodians. Mora  suggested that the city contract with a private firm to take over the city's  custodial services.  </P> <P> Mora has also suggested that the city close several buildings operated by the  department on Sundays and eliminate the Junior High Grad Night Program. The  city now spends $19,400 to supervise and transport almost 1,000 graduating  junior high school students each year to a local amusement park.  </P> <P> The city can save $478,000 by implementing these cuts.  </P> <P> The loudest outcry from residents was prompted by Mora's recommendation to  close the Carnegie Art Museum, which would save the city $140,000 a year.  </P> <P> Mona Broyles, chairwoman of the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts Commission,  called the proposed closure "totally unacceptable." She has urged the council  to "please seek another alternative cutback." Once the museum is closed,  Broyles said, it will be almost impossible to persuade other museums to loan  art exhibits to the Carnegie in the future.  </P> <P> Museum Director Andrew Voth said closure could permanently ruin the city's  reputation in the art world. Just the rumor that the Carnegie will close has  lost the museum $20,000 in grants, he said. "It's devastating."  </P> <P> The 10,000-square-foot museum, which houses a permanent collection of 250  paintings and sculptures, opened in 1981 and has a staff of one part-time and  three full-time employees.  </P> <P> Mora has proposed that the city save $343,500 by eliminating two emergency  rescue squads and eight firefighters.  </P> <P> The emergency vehicles, each staffed by four full-time firefighters, carry  emergency tools -- such as the "Jaws of Life" -- to the scene of a fire or  accident.  </P> <P> The Fire Department has 43 firefighters and seven vacancies.  </P> <P> Fire Chief Richard Smith told the council last week that there are 22  firefighters on duty at all times. He warned that elimination of the two squads  would reduce fire service by 9%.  </P> <P> Smith said the department normally dispatches 12 firefighters to battle a  routine single-family house fire, leaving 10 firefighters to monitor the rest  of the city.  </P> <P> "It's a little bit frightening, frankly," he said of the proposed cuts.  </P> <P> However, he noted that the city has a mutual-assistance agreement with fire  departments from nearby cities.  </P> <P> Mora has suggested that the city close its main library on Sundays to save  $11,000 in overtime salaries, which would entail no personnel cuts.  </P> <P> The city manager has also recommended that the city eliminate its $398,000  contribution to the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau, which employs six  full-time staff members.  </P> <P> Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, said elimination of the  city contribution would force closure of the bureau. He said the elimination  would have a devastating effect on tax revenue generated by hotels and by other  tourism-related businesses.  </P> <P> Mora also suggested that the city save $200,000 by eliminating three employees  from the city's street-sweeping unit. City officials said such a reduction  would mean that the average residential street would be swept every three  months, while streets in business districts would be swept twice a month.  </P></p>

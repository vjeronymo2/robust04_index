			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Algeria devalues in deal with IMF The Algerian government, struggling with a collapsing economy and hostility from Moslem fundamentalists, is to devalue its currency by 40 per cent and raise interest rates as part of a programme worked out with the International Monetary Fund, AP-DJ reports from Algiers. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said on Algerian television the programme - which also includes a timetable of measures to open up the Algerian economy - would allow Algeria to draw Dollars 1bn immediately from the IMF under a one-year stand-by agreement. He described the emergency programme as 'sound and courageous' and said the IMF also stood ready to work out a longer-term, three-year adjustment programme to ensure Algeria's economic recovery was deep-rooted. The Algerian dinar, which is not convertible outside the country, had already been devalued by 7 per cent against a basket of foreign currencies a week ago. The new official exchange rate of the dinar is 36 to the dollar and about six to the French franc. On the black market recently, the franc changed hands at up to 16 dinars. The IMF deal is expected to free loans from other lending agencies, including Dollars 175m from the World Bank and Dollars 180m from the European Union. Japan is also understood to be considering a Dollars 150m loan. The stand-by agreement will clear the way for Algeria to start negotiations with creditor governments and banks on rescheduling part of its Dollars 26bn external debt. Previous Algerian governments had refused to consider a rescheduling accord, arguing that it would turn off the flow of commercial bank lending that the country so badly needs to finance its hydrocarbons industry. Oil and gas exports account for 98 per cent of Algeria's export revenue, and the country has been crippled by the weakness of the international oil market that has pushed the price of crude oil down to around Dollars 14 a barrel. Officials said the IMF had initially been pushing Algeria for a 60 per cent devaluation. The immediate effect of the devaluation will be to increase sharply the cost of imported goods, especially food. In dinar terms, however, the country's export earnings will be increased considerably. The economic adjustment programme agreed with the IMF also calls for a steep rise in interest rates set by the Bank of Algeria, although they will remain below the official inflation rate, which reached 25 per cent in 1993. The official rate is based on a narrow range of goods and services, however, and experts say the actual rate of inflation is much higher.</p>

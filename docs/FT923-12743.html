			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Royal Mint exceeds targets with Pounds 11m The Royal Mint exceeded sales and profits targets for the 1991-92 year despite recession and strong competition in overseas markets. Mr Anthony Garrett, chief executive, said in the Mint's annual report that it was 'a highly satisfactory year' given the depressed economic conditions, but because of low demand for coins in the UK, sales dipped from the previous year's record Pounds 108.3m to Pounds 83m, while operating profits were down from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 11m. However, he regarded a return on sales of 13.3 per cent and a real return on current cost assets of 20 per cent as creditable in the circumstances. The Treasury received a dividend of Pounds 10m, compared with a record Pounds 14m the previous year. Exports of circulating and collector coins to 58 countries amounted to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 58.9m) included the first exports to eastern Europe since the 1930s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will sign the  final Uruguay Round [UR] agreement at the three-day 120-nation  ministerial conference from April 12 in the Moroccan City of  Marrakech, but hold off on inking the mandate for the World  Trade Organization (WTO), the successor to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and its annexed protocol, the  Government Procurement Agreement, until after parliament  approves, a government official said Saturday.    The official denied reports that Seoul might hold back on  signing the final agreement, which would be construed as a  rejection of the total UR pact as the signing is a formal and  declarative promise of commitment to the world's largest trade  agreement and its future direction by participating nations.    But Korea is seriously thinking about waiting on the mandate  for the WTO, comprised of bilateral and multilateral  negotiations in 17 fields including country schedules in  agriculture, industry and services, and its annexed protocol  until formal approval by the National Assembly.    Signing the two other agreements is not mandatory at the  Marrakech conference and countries can choose to do so after  parliamentary ratification.    The United States and Japan have already decided not to sign  the two pacts at next week's conference due to domestic legal  procedures.    Three agreements will be signed at the Marrakech meeting on  April 15. Some nations will sign then while others will wait  until after legislative passage, ruling Democratic Liberal Party  Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said after party-government discussions.</p>

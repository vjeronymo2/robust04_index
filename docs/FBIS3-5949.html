The remarks of the Japanese foreign minister are virtually  tantamount to an official declaration that Japan will openly  step up nuclear armament, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says,  and goes on:    We cannot but take a particularly serious view of this.  Though the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it will be  useless and will not guarantee peace and security in this  region, Japan's nuclear armament posing an actual danger.  Hence, we have felt that the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearization might be of no use, unless Japan's attempt at  nuclear armament is checked. And this feeling grows stronger as  the Japanese authorities take issue with our "nuclear issue"  more blatantly in a bid to justify its nuclear armament. This  makes us doubt whether the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearisation is needed.    Judging from all this, we may find ourselves compelled to  reconsider our stand toward denuclearization on the Korean  peninsula. In case of this, the situation will develop to an  unpredictable phase and it will not be good to the United States  and South Korea, either. The Japanese authorities should  entirely be to blame for this.    The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, deeply  pondering over the grave consequences of their utterances.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jurgen Storbeck, German `caretaker </F> co-ordinator' of Europol by Isabel Conway, date and place not  given; "Like All Tigers, It Needs Its Teeth"]    [Text] It is, say its critics, in the wrong place, and  with the wrong brief. It has no legal identity, no agreed  budget and no executive powers. But, according to Jurgen  Storbeck, German caretaker co-ordinator of Europol, the European  Drugs Intelligence Unit, it's going to work.    The official launch this month of Europol, in a leafy Hague  suburb with a residence for Jesuit priests on one side and a  high-school playground on the other, was more an act of faith  than a warning to international drugs traders.    But Storbeck believes it can still justify its existence as  a  symbol of Europe's yearning for a common security policy. "A  lot will depend on the leeway we are given by justice and other  European Union ministers, who will ultimately decide where  Europol is going at their convention later this year," maintains  Storbeck.    His biggest fear, he told The European, is of  "over-restrictive rules and regulations" which would "take the  teeth out of the mouth of the tiger before he was even grown  from a cub".    Storbeck's vision is of a strongly federalist Europol drugs  unit with a wide brief so that "international task forces under  the authority of member states, but supported by Europol, could  be formed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other  investigations into organised crime. [no closing '' as  published] "I believe that in time the politicians will agree  to a much more federal role for Europol. It might have been  unthinkable ten years ago, but drugs and other forms of crime  are creating such major problems now that this will in time be  seen as essential," says Storbeck, an Interpol veteran.    Storbeck recognises that Europol is facing weighty  bureaucratic and technical obstacles, not least of which is its  "cart before the horse" status.    It does not have a legal identity yet and depends on a maze  of national and bilateral agreements and goodwill rather than  the compulsory sharing of intelligence between its partners. It  cannot prove itself until a draft treaty setting out its powers  and duties is drawn up, agreed and ratified by the 12 states in  October. Its non-executive nature means that Europol cannot  establish a formal relationship with Interpol and other key  crime-fighting organisations or look to a future crime-busting  role beyond its current limited horizons.    The only employees so far are the skeleton staff of 19  liaison officers seconded from the 12 member states spread out  around the huge building which once housed the Dutch  Intelligence service. Contacts with their own national police  force are maintained by telephone and fax, although some  countries expect computer access to their national criminal  files shortly.    Recruitment of Europol's administrative staff and the  provision of the required 24-hour ring of steel depends on the  member states eventually agreeing a budget. Getting the unit  running will cost in the region of 35 million guilders ($18m),  according to Europol chiefs. The available budget of 4 million  guilders this year falls far short of that.    Storbeck claims that Europol is already proving that it can  offer a "much faster service" than Interpol. Even without  executive powers, the liaison officers (by the year's end 50  will be based in The Hague) are demonstrating the commitment of  member states to co-operate fully with each other's requests for  help in co-ordinating information and eventually developing an  intelligence network, he reports.    Storbeck says: "I would like it to be obligatory for member  states to assist each other in gathering information and  swapping intelligence within the new structure. But that is for  the politicians to decide."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--The Security Committee, a  part of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on ways of  implementing the Gaza-Jericho Palestinian autonomy agreement,  began meeting in Cairo today. Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, is leading the  Palestinian side of this committee, while 'Uzi Dayan, head of  the Israeli General Staff's Planning Branch, heads the Israeli  side.    The committee is discussing a timetable for the Israeli  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the deployment of  Palestinian forces there, including the number of Palestinian  police to be stationed in the two areas, their tasks, and the  equipment they will use.    Official Palestinian sources told MENA that there are  indications that Israel will accept the Palestinian demand for  10,000 Palestinian policemen. Formerly it insisted on limiting  the number to only 6,000 policemen. They explained that this  change in the Israeli position comes in the wake of the Hebron  massacre of hundreds [as received] of Palestinian worshipers.    Representatives of the international observers from Norway  and Denmark who will be deployed in Hebron are expected to join  the meeting of the Security Committee.    It should be recalled that the observers team will consist  of  160 members from Norway, Denmark, and Italy.    The Palestinian delegation has held meetings in Cairo for  the  past two days to discuss the dispatch of Palestinian police  officers to Gaza and Jericho. It has been decided that the  first 300 police will enter these areas on Tuesday [5 April].  They will be followed by 1,500 more policemen on Thursday.  Others will follow later. They will prepare for taking over  control of the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho in accordance  with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    Israeli sources in Cairo said that General Amnon Shahaq will  arrive Monday morning to participate in the negotiations  regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement. [passage omitted]    Other negotiations committees on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement are scheduled to begin their  meetings tomorrow. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / China condemns corruption China, reporting a sharp jump in the number of corruption cases this year, said yesterday that rampant corruption threatened economic reform and vowed again to crack down hard on graft, Reuter reports from Beijing. A senior prosecutor said the number of corruption cases uncovered in the first half of this year were 81 per cent up on the same 1993 period. 'Corruption is very serious and threatening reforms, liberalisation and (the) socialist market economy,' Mr Liang Guoqing, deputy procurator-general of the People's Supreme Procuratorate, told a news conference. China's leaders fear public anger over corruption and inflation could upset social stability, as it did in 1989 when many ordinary people backed student-led pro-democracy demonstrations.</p>

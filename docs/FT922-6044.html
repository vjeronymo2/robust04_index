			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Observer: Pohl's golden opportunity Canadian financiers with fingers in the property pie are hardly flavour of the month among the international banking fraternity these days. But Peter Munk, Toronto entrepreneur par excellence, is clearly different. How else has the smooth-talking, fine-wine-loving Munk managed to lure Karl Otto Pohl onto the board of his gold, oil and property holding company Horsham Corporation? Since stepping down from the Bundesbank, Pohl has lined up an impressive string of blue-chip directorships - including Bertelsmann, Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell. Having turned down hosts of other worthy causes, he was obviously in the market for a touch of excitement. But what, in turn, can the owner of American Barrick, a leading North American gold producer, and Clark Oil, a US Midwest oil refiner, want with a former German central banker, however noted? A Hungarian emigre who has been in Canada for more than 30 years, Munk still retains a soft spot for Europe and Europeans. He has a ski chalet at Klosters, and another prominent German, Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner, was a guest of the Munks on his most recent Canadian trip. Never dull on the subject of French wines, Munk would like Pohl's reputed ability to be able to distinguish between 200 sorts of grappa. And while he would not primarily be seeking advice on the gold or oil markets, Munk must undoubtedly be hoping the new big name addition to the board will grease the wheels of a recent foray into Germany. Horsham owns 195 hectares on the outskirts of Berlin which it wants to turn into a business park and entertainment complex and has its eyes on other properties. Pohl's help should be invaluable in the search for financial partners - and tenants.</p>

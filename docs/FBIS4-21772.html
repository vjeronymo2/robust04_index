			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at  1130 GMT on 29 March reports: ``The Shamgar Committee hearings  on the Hebron massacre today tried to clarify two outstanding  questions regarding the morning of the massacre: Why a  policeman was not at his post at the Cave of the Patriarchs, and  why three Border Police were late reaching the site? More from  No'omi Segal:''    ``What emerged in testimonies on the failure of security  arrangements to work properly on the morning of the massacre was  a broken chain of command. In contradiction to an earlier  testimony by head of Central Command Dani Yatom regarding the  stationing of a policeman at the Cave of Patriarchs, commander  of the Judaea District Police Moshe Mizrahi testified there was  no standing order for a police officer to be present at the  site. An alternative arrangement called for a police van to  patrol the area, Mizrahi said, but on the morning of the  massacre the police scheduled to patrol were unaware it was  their turn.''    ``Eli Moyal, the Border Police duty officer the night before  the massacre, answered questions on why three Border Police  failed to reach their posts. I prepared a list of who had to be  working, Moyal said, but the morning duty officer changed it.  By the time three other Border Police were awakened, it was too  late,'' he said.    ``Qiryat Arba' resident Eli'ezer Spitzer, who was in the  jeep  that gave Barukh Goldstein a lift to the Cave of the Patriarchs,  also appeared before the commission. Spitzer said he noticed  nothing unusual about Goldstein's behavior and, in response to  the judges question, could not recall what kind of weapon  Goldstein had.''    ``The commission tried to verify contradictions in testimony  by a Muslim worshiper who was in the Cave of the Patriarchs at  the time of the massacre, 'Abd-Rabbuh al-Atrash. He told the  judges he heard two explosions and then firing, not one  explosion, as he earlier told police.''    ``At this hour, Pinhas Eidelstein, who is the duty  communications officer in Qiryat Arba', is appearing before the  commission. Miryam Goldstein called Eidelstein minutes before  the massacre, urging him to contact her husband. The judges are  trying to clarify if there was anything in her tone that  indicated alarm.''</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEN JOHNSON TO RUN AGAIN FOR CANADA;  </P> <P> DRUGS: THE GOVERNMENT REVERSES ITS LIFETIME BAN ON THE SPRINTER FOR USING  STEROIDS AT SEOUL OLYMPICS.  </P> <P> Sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his world's fastest-human title and was kicked  out of the 1988 Olympics for using steroids, was given government clearance  today to run again for Canada.  </P> <P> Canadian Sports Minister Marcel Danis reversed the ruling of his predecessor,  Jean Charest, who in 1988 placed Johnson under a lifetime ban from competing  for the national team.  </P> <P> Minutes later, the president of Athletics Canada said Johnson will be  reinstated to a national team after his two-year suspension by track and  field's international governing body expires Sept. 24 -- if the sprinter can  meet team standards.  </P> <P> Though Johnson will be able to compete again, he and any other Canadian athlete  caught using performance-enhancing drugs face lifetime bans on receiving direct  federal funds.  </P> <P> In making his announcement, Danis warned that athletes caught using banned  drugs in the future will face even stiffer penalties. He proposed that the  suspension for a first-time offense be doubled, from two years to four.  </P> <P> "We accept the notion . . . that anti-doping rules ought not put the federal  government in the position of deciding day-to-day matters relating to the  eligibility of individual athletes, coaches, trainers and others," the sports  minister said.  </P> <P> Johnson was stripped of his gold medal and world record for the 100-meter dash  at the Seoul Olympics after testing positive for steroids.  </P> <P> "I'm just very happy that the government gave me the OK to run for this country  again," Johnson said in the driveway at his family home in east suburban  Toronto.  </P> <P> "I want to thank the Canadian public who supported me. This is one of the  happiest days of my life, so far. I am very, very happy that I can run for this  country again."  </P></p>

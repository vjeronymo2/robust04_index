Another adrenalin-inducing phrase might be Virgin Cola, launched recently by Richard Branson and Cott Corporation. But Darby says competition helps stimulate the whole market and anyway Coke always gets the lion share of any growth. With Branson likely to have a glass of his own in his hand in every picture, the competition could be brisk. But Darby's not bothered. 'We always feature Coca-Cola as the hero, the star.'</p>

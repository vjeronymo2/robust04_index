			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] During a visit to Peten Department on Tuesday,  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio referred to the challenge raised  by Deputy Carlos Arroyave Cerna against the elections for new  deputies. De Leon also spoke about the provisional  constitutional protection decree issued by the Supreme Court of  Justice in the face of this challenge.    [Begin de Leon recording] The political aspect has been  resolved. The executive branch no longer has anything to do  with the elections taking place. This is now the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal's problem.    Challenges of this nature are common under a legal regime.  The appropriate constitutional organizations, in this case the  highest constitutional justice organization, will decide the  constitutionality of the elections. The executive branch no  longer has anything to do with that.    I say this because once these phases are over and we have  institutional and political stability and because we have seen  positive results in these areas, we have to dedicate ourselves  more fervently to resolving economic and social problems.

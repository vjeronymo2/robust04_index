			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Insect repellent goes tree climbing Climbing insects, such as ants, can devastate a fruit crop. But an environmentally friendly device which claims to give nearly 100 per cent protection has been developed by Oecos, a Hertfordshire-based company. The device consists of a 20mm thick foam trapping strip which compresses and moulds to the contours of the tree trunk. This is covered by a green UV-degradable band to protect it from debris and keep it out of reach of hungry birds. It is effective against winter moths, aphids, earwigs and spider mites.

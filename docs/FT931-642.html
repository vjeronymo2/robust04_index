			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Compromise plan for BR pensions A COMPROMISE plan that would head off Conservative MPs' concerns over British Rail pensioners when the industry is privatised is being given serious consideration by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, who has 2,000 BR pensioners in his constituency, said the scheme proposed by British Rail pension trustees was emerging as a 'front-runner'. BR's board of directors has expressed fierce opposition to the government's plans. Problems have arisen over the two options originally envisaged by the government - either transferring the portion of the BR Pounds 8.5bn pension fund corresponding to existing pensioners to the Treasury, or transferring the portion to a new pension fund. Several Conservatives were worried that the pensioners would get only minimal increases in pensions from the Treasury, while an independent fund without any contributors would have to take an exceptionally cautious investment stance - again meaning that rises in pensions would be limited. Under the compromise scheme, backed by Mr Milligan, a new pension fund would be set up to include existing British Rail pensioners, 'deferred' pensioners who have left the company, and those who continue working for BR Residual - the part of BR that will remain in the private sector. That would guarantee an income flow to the pension fund for at least five to 10 years. Mr MacGregor has ordered a consultation period on the proposals which will last until May, but colleagues have confirmed that the compromise plan is receiving detailed attention at the department. The results of the consultations are expected to coincide with the Commons' report stage on BR privatisation.</p>

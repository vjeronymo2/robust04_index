			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 18 May -- The Central Electoral Commission has  completed the registration of presidential candidates.  Registration certificates were issued to five more contenders:  Valeriy Babych, Leonid Kuchma, Volodymyr Lanovyy, Oleksandr  Moroz, and Petro Talanchuk. The commission noted that the  contenders complied with all the requirements of Article 28 of  the electoral law and thus may begin to campaign.    The Central Electoral Commission rejected the applications  of  two contenders who failed to raise the required number of  signatures, Ivan Valenya and Mykola Rud. The Central Electoral  Commission registered Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kravchuk earlier.</p>

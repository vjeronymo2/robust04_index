			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson: "Russian Cosmonautics: Ordered </F> To Concentrate. The Need Has Arisen for Restructuring"]    [Text] A resolution of the government of the Russian  Federation entitled "State Support and Protection of Space  Activity in the Russian Federation," dated 11 December 1993, was  published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 11 January 1994 and thus was  put into official force.    The resolution was adopted against the background of  developing work on construction of the joint Russian-American  orbital station, the Alpha. Finally, the Russian Space Agency  (RSA), it appears, has found its place amidst the giants of  national rocket building. From now on it is planned that all  funding of the Russian Federal Space Program be through the RSA.  For this purpose it is proposed that the agency be allocated an  antedated 164.8 billion rubles for 1993, and for 1994 -- 274.8  billion. Other than the RSA, only the military space forces are  designated as users of space vehicles.    It must be said that considerable work on the development of  the juridical base of national cosmonautics was carried out in  the Commission on Communications, Information Science and Space  ("Adrov Commission") of the former Supreme Soviet. Without  question the preparers of the new resolution made use of the  accumulated experience. However, for the first time a number of  interesting innovations are appearing in such a high official  document.    Although the situation with the Baykonur cosmodrome has been  normalized for some time and agreements have been reached with  the Kazakhstan side and although the funding of the principal  cosmodrome of the former USSR is especially provided for, the  new document proposes to interested organizations that in a  month's time they present to the government proposals on the  further development of Russian Plesetsk and on establishing a  new cosmodrome in the Russian Far East.    Thus, there has been official continuation of the  "Blagoveshchensk Project." Since due to purely physical reasons  it is possible to put considerably lesser loads into space from  northern Plesetsk than from the lower latitudes, and since  Baykonur seems none too attractive from the political point of  view, the civilian and military rocket users of Russia are  unified in their desire that something new be constructed. All  the moreso since launchings of the heaviest (other than the  stillborn Energiya) Russian rocket, the Proton, are impossible  from the Plesetsk test range, making it is quite necessary to  construct launch facilities. It is assumed that if they are to  be built, it is better that it be done to the southeast. The  spent stages in this case will fall in the ocean and the  protests from Kazakh, Yakut and Nenets herders should probably  cease. If two launch sites are constructed for Protons in the  Blagoveshchensk region in the Far East, then naturally a  duplicating center of Russian cosmonautics will take shape,  taking into account the only station in Russia for the  monitoring of distant space with the 70-m antenna at Ussuriysk  and the reserve airfield for the Buran at Khorol. It is true  that it is a long way to transport Protons from Moscow.    In addition to the Far Eastern project, there is the quite  exotic project of the NPO Energiya, which has been kicked around  in its time, the construction, on the basis of the model and  similar to the Italian San Marco, of a floating platform for the  launching of rockets from equatorial waters. The payload, to be  sure, is increased, but there is a corresponding increase in the  load on the long-suffering space budget. It is probably  necessary to forget the platform for the time being.    Reading between the lines in the new documents, one can  visualize the direction of further restructuring and  concentration of national aerospace. Fully in accordance with  market conditions an individual item provides for the allocation  of preferred conversion credits for ensuring the production of  technology in conformity to a specific list. If this list is  comprehensive and if survival of the enterprises and  organizations not included in the list is not contemplated, the  fate of a number of facilities and projects becomes clear --  they will die. Reference, in particular, is to the construction  of solid-fuel boosters, including those based on ballistic  missiles from submarines (Machine Building Design Bureau at  Miass in the Southern Ural); to the further production of the  light Kosmos booster at the Omsk Polet Production Association;  finally, to the Buran system and in general winged spacecraft.  The Tushino NPO Molniya, building the Buran spaceplane, is not  named in the list, but the Buran, together with the Energiya, on  the other hand, were mentioned in a "requiem" press conference  of Yuriy Koptev, RSA director, at the end of the year. The Buran  is not to be. The only thing which can be recommended to the  devotees of romantic spaceplanes is to await the opening of an  elite restaurant in Gorkiy Park which will be placed aboard one  of the Burans.    However, some of the projects will probably be taken over by  the military. A number of their main organizations are not  mentioned in the document, but without their support the  projects are unlikely to survive. With respect to the "civilian  segment," it is evident that the giant established by  Academician Korolev, the NPO Energiya, now bearing his name, as  before has a special status in Russian space plans.    Although the NPO (strictly speaking, it is unknown on whose  initiative, up to now specific individuals are either  dissociating themselves or whitewashing themselves after the  fact) in my opinion has somewhat lost its initiative and dynamic  character, in the mid-1970's getting itself involved in the  venture with the Buran, the continuing cooperation with the  American NASA on the orbital station is again advancing the  enterprise at Podlipki into a privileged position. The several  hundred million dollars to be received from the Americans is  entirely comparable to the entire Russian space budget for a  year or two. In addition, the NPO Energiya traditionally has  carried out such functions and also has had such subdivisions  which throughout the world have usually been regarded as  governmental. The cosmonaut detachment, for example. Most of the  directors of national cosmonautics and the military-industrial  complex in general (including Aleksey Adrov, the former chairman  of the Supreme Soviet commission, and Yuriy Baturin, the newly  designated presidential assistant on national security) came  from Podlipki. The latest resolution strengthens this special  status even in details -- the next to the last item in the  resolution allows the RSA to have the additional post of deputy  general director. This post is set aside specially for Yuriy  Semenov, the present-day general designer of the NPO Energiya.    Whatever you say, the structure of the space complex in  Russia has taken on a monstrous form. Bad enough that a number  of enterprises of the once unified military-space complex are  now located abroad, primarily in the Ukraine, but also in  Kirgizia and in Uzbekistan, not to mention Baykonur. The  responsibility for clear-cut implementation of the government  space program has been capriciously distributed between the  state RSA and industrial enterprises (Energiya) which are being  privatized. The very same American NASA, unquestionably a  government agency, but having in its makeup very well-developed  research and planning centers, is able to turn to private  enterprises of the aerospace industry only with specific  government orders. This is funded by a budget approved by the  congress. Therefore, the time has come for a restructuring of  the Russian space infrastructure. However paradoxical it may  seem, the guardians of government interests in most cases are  the directors and specialists of privatized  scientific-production enterprises rather than a new generation  of oversight people from state offices. It must be assumed that  despite all the swingings of political vanes the hand on the  pulse of Russian cosmonautics will continue to be held by the  chief designers and the heads of design sections, and not only  by managers and administrators.    Although many specialists, even at this same NPO Energiya,  and particularly in the "outer circle," consider that it would  be useful to establish a Russian NASA. This dream was mentioned  once again during the monthlong period, but the dream evidently  died on 11 January. It must be assumed that soon we will learn  what direction the restructuring of national cosmonautics will  take. It can be assumed that in Moscow, and probably in  Krasnoyarsk (communication satellites), several federal space  centers will be established, as stated in the resolution, for  the concentration of efforts.    The legendary Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy prophesied the arrival  from space of "mountains of grain and unlimited power."  Present-day rocket specialists prefer a bird in the hand to two  in the bush. It is best to remind our excessively pragmatic  comrades once again how at one time such pragmatism forced  Isabella of Castile to finance the voyage of Columbus.</p>

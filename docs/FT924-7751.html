			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Tourist board opposes sale MR WILLIAM DAVIS, chairman of the English Tourist Board, reacted angrily yesterday to government suggestions that it should divest part of its business in the face of a 40 per cent cut in its grant over the next three years. 'We will not have civil servants telling us how to run our business,' Mr Davis said. Government officials earlier indicated the sale would take place amid the tight control of public expenditure outlined in Thursday's Autumn Statement. Government funding for the board will fall from Pounds 15.4m this year to Pounds 9m by 1995, with 70 per cent of that total being diverted to regional tourist boards. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, told MPs yesterday: 'The case is now much less strong for central government funding of the promotion of tourism in England. 'As the industry matures, and the regional tourist boards develop, it is appropriate for other bodies to carry on many of the ETB's central activities.' Heritage department sources suggested that guides for hotels, guest houses and caravan sites would be high on the list for privatisation. However, with many of the board's initiatives undertaken with private-sector participation, tourist industry analysts question how much would be saved by such a move. Mr Mark Phillips, a senior consultant with Howarth Consultancy, which operates the boards's hotel occupancy survey, said: 'There is already a very successful partnership between the private sector and the ETB. I cannot see how the government can privatise it further without serious ramifications on the ETB's position.' Howarth won the contract to operate the board scheme by tender three years ago and pays all the administrative costs.</p>

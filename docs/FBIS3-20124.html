			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ole Johan Nilsen report: "EU Questions One After Another"] </F>   [Text] "No question time without EU [European Union]  questions" looks to be the motto in the Storting these days.  The foreign purchase of Norwegian fishing boats and their  quotas was the topic for Morten Lund (Center Party). Fisheries  Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen pointed out that the EU agreement  prevents such purchases for three years. It will also be  possible to retain Norwegian rules that stipulate that only  those actively engaged in fishing can own fishing boats.  Finally, licensing regulations and considerations of resources  and regional policy can be invoked. The minister gave advance  notice of his own law covering the right to engage in fishing.    Syver Berge (Center Party) wanted more information about the  agricultural agreement. [Agriculture Minister] Gunhild Oyangen  pointed out that some questions need to be clarified, including  those to do with the food industry, environmental programs for  primary agriculture, and investment arrangements. Clarification  is also needed on the boundaries of the northern agricultural  support area. She expects that there will be an agreement  containing the necessary clarifications before the referendum.    Differentiated employers' contributions need to be  clarified,  but there is every indication that we can keep our present  arrangement, Municipal Affairs and Labor Minister Gunnar Berge  told Eilef A. Meland (Socialist Left Party). The results of the  talks with the EU on this matter will be available in a few  weeks.    Paul Chaffey (Socialist Left Party) sought guarantees from  the EU in areas affecting asbestos, CFC gases, solvents, and  mercury. Thorbjorn Berntsen responded that our rules on CFC's  are not in conflict with the EU's rules. We can also keep our  ban on the import and manufacture of asbestos. We can keep our  regulations covering the labeling of solvents, but Norwegian  regulations covering mercury in batteries can only remain in  force for four years. But in this area there is an agreement  committing the EU to revising its rules. In some areas Norway  will have to tighten up its environmental regulations. This  applies, for example, to the substance pentachlorophenol.    Chaffey also wanted information about "EEA [European  Economic  Area] fish" that had been handed over to the EU in the  negotiations. The minister informed him that the pattern of  fisheries that would have been set up in 1997 has been brought  forward to 1995 with slightly larger quantities than applied  after the EEA agreement.    Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa (Center Party) raised the question  of duty-free alcohol allowances within the EU. Social Affairs  Minister Hill-Marta Solberg was able to announce that the  government has no plans for a comprehensive reorganization of  Norwegian alcohol policy. Vinmonopolet [state alcohol monopoly]  will continue as it is today, import allowances will be  maintained with small additional quantities bought at full  price, the advertising ban will continue, and the duties on  alcohol will continue to be fixed by Norway. But border checks  will be more difficult to carry out, she thought.    Arvid Vegger (Center Party) wondered whether the EU  agreement  is binding in international law. The trade minister replied  that before it is binding the parliaments of the various  countries involved must have ratified it. However, first it  must be scrutinized by the European Parliament and then signed.</p>

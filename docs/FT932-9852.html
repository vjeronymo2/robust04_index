			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers resist oil tax pressure MR STEPHEN DORRELL, fin-ancial secretary to the Treasury, last night underlined the government's determination to hold to the changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget. He insisted that the likely impact of the new regime had been carefully examined before its introduction and provision made for up to Pounds 200m to be available in the current financial year for any transitional relief that was required. The government secured a majority of 36 (289-253) to defeat a Labour amendment to the Finance Bill designed to provide more wide ranging transitional relief. An amendment moved by Mr Alex Salmond for the Scottish Nationalists with a similar objective was defeated by a government majority of 37 (287-250). Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour treasury spokesman, accused Mr Dorrell of failing to take into account that at least 10,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the changes. He warned of the danger that the new regime would result in exploration work being exported from potential oil fields in the north sea to other parts of the world. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some producing assets. Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax PRT changes, but that its parent company had decided to reduce its exploration expenditure.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TRUTH HURTS WORSE;  </P> <P> MURDER: IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR CATHY BROCK TO VISIT HER FATHER IN JAIL WHEN SHE  THOUGHT HE WAS INNOCENT. NOW HE'S CONFESSED TO THE MURDER OF HER ABUSIVE  HUSBAND. SHE STILL BLAMES HERSELF.  </P> <P> Cathy Brock had only been to see her father once at Orange County Jail in all  the months he was there. It had been too hard on both of them, she said.  </P> <P> But she had written to him. She had told him how sorry she was that "you had to  give up your life to see me happy." The letter upset him. He told the family:  Tell Cathy she is not to blame. She is not to blame.  </P> <P> James Joseph Rovida Jr., a 55-year-old Los Alamitos truck driver whose life  revolved around his wife, his five grown children and his grandchildren, was  convicted last month of first-degree murder in the death of Cathy Brock's  husband, Robert Brock.  </P> <P> Brock was shot to death just after 3 a.m. on July 6, 1989, in the front  driveway of his sister's home in Orange, where he was living during the  couple's latest fight. Brock had just gotten off work at a printing plant in  Fullerton, where prosecutors say Rovida had followed him -- then fatally shot  him in the head and chest.  </P> <P> Brock's death put an end to the stormiest marriage those closest to the Brock  couple had ever seen.  </P> <P> "We went from downhill to the bottom," Cathy Brock, 31, said in describing  their final days together.  </P> <P> Last week, Rovida was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison by Superior Court  Judge Robert C. Todd. He will be almost 70 before he is even eligible to apply  for parole.  </P> <P> Her father did not do it, Cathy Brock insisted. But she blames herself anyway.  There had been that dramatic confrontation on the Riverside Freeway, her  husband tracking her down and shouting threats, furious that she was taking  their two children on a Rovida family trip against his orders.  </P> <P> Her father had shot out Brock's car windows. If that hadn't happened, Cathy  Brock insisted, police would never have tried to pin her husband's murder on  her father. And she was to blame for what happened on the freeway.  </P> <P> She was to blame for her father, an innocent man, being in jail.  </P> <P> Except her father is not innocent. After his trial, he finally confessed. He  had kept it from his family, even from his own lawyer. The confession was  played out by the prosecution in open court on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The freeway incident, Rovida told a probation officer, had led him to confront  Brock, to let him know that Rovida just couldn't take it anymore. Rovida denies  he meant to kill him. But he admits it happened.  </P> <P> "Cathy just cannot accept losing both her husband and her father, so she blocks  it out, just refuses to believe it," said her sister-in-law, Joann Shaw, Robert  Brock's sister, who had found him dead in her driveway.  </P> <P> At her new home in Bellflower, where she's raising their daughters, ages 9 and  5, Cathy Brock looked at a picture of Robert and her on their wedding day. They  looked happy.  </P> <P> "But there weren't a whole lot of good times," she said. "I always had to get  my butt kicked -- even when he was just mad at himself over something, I was in  for a beating."  </P> <P> Robert Brock had been her only real boyfriend. They began dating when she was  16 and moved in together when she was 18. They married four years later.  </P> <P> Two of Robert Brock's sisters interviewed defend their brother, in part. Cathy  was often the aggressor in the arguments, they said. Joann Shaw says her  brother still had a bruise on his cheek at his funeral caused by an assault  from Cathy Brock. But even they don't deny their brother could be violent.  </P> <P> "We begged them to break up," Joann Shaw said. "We said, 'Look what you are  doing to each other. Look what you are doing to your kids.' "  </P> <P> They lived in Buena Park, Cypress, Fullerton, anywhere they could stay a jump  ahead of rent payments due. Robert Brock was an electrician, but had been laid  off.  </P> <P> Cathy Brock describes a life of hell. Twice a month or more he would beat her  with his fists, she said. Once he used shearing scissors to tear up all her  clothes, she said. Another time, she claimed, he even put razor blades in her  shoes.  </P> <P> She has a scar on her arm from the shearing scissors, when she tried to stop  him. And another from an ashtray fight. She told about one incident in which he  stole her driver's license and car registration, took her plates off the car,  then reported the car stolen. She spent a night in jail before the mess was  straightened out, she said.  </P> <P> Three times she went to court to get restraining orders against him during  their many break-ups. The problem was, restraining orders don't amount to  anything when the man is determined to ignore them, she said.  </P> <P> The problem was, Brock's sisters say, Cathy Brock never gave the restraining  orders a chance. Because she always went back to him. Always.  </P> <P> Even that last dramatic week, when they were down to nothing and nowhere to  live, she had planned to go back to him. She said so in court.  </P> <P> Their problems came to a head in November, 1988, when she lost her job. She  claims her husband could not accept her working while he was unemployed and got  her fired by constantly harassing her at work. They skipped town owing back  rent at their apartment in Fullerton in May, 1989. He had picked up a  minimum-wage job, enough for them to survive, living in a run-down motel in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> "You can't know how that feels," she said. "Two kids and not even a home for  them."  </P> <P> Fourth of July week, 1989, the Rovidas had asked her and the children to join  them for a family trip to the Colorado River. She claims Robert did not want  her to go. She went anyway.  </P> <P> "My kids needed some fun in their lives," she explained. "But Robert warned me:  'You won't make it to the river.' "  </P> <P> Two carloads of Rovidas were heading north on the Riverside Freeway when Robert  pulled alongside them in his own car, shouting threats, they all say.  </P> <P> "He said that if we went ahead to the river, he'd burn my parents' house down,"  Cathy Brock said.  </P> <P> Then, family members told police, Brock pulled his car in front of Rovida's.  The Brock family disputes that he tried to run anyone off the road. But the  Rovidas say clearly he was harassing them. That's when Rovida shot out Brock's  windows.  </P> <P> Paul S. Meyer, Rovida's lawyer, says the real tragedy of the case is that  Rovida is probably not guilty of the crime he was convicted of: first-degree  murder.  </P> <P> "If we'd had the facts, we probably could have shown the jury this was a  voluntary manslaughter," Meyer said. "But Mr. Rovida was too ashamed to admit  to his family what he had done. So he kept it from everyone, including me. What  a terrible, terrible consequence he must pay now."  </P> <P> Cathy Brock remains torn about what happened. She did love her husband, she  says. And she is definite that she did not want him dead, especially because he  was close to their younger daughter.  </P> <P> But still, she feels free.  </P> <P> "Now I'm actually a person; I have self-respect, I have things, and a home for  my daughters," she said. "I'm no longer just someone who needs her butt  kicked."  </P> <P> And she has also made a commitment to Brock's family. Despite the wishes of  some of her siblings, she is letting her daughters spend time with Brock's  sisters, whom they adore.  </P> <P> "My kids don't deserve any more punishment," she said.  </P> <P> Gloria Creighton, another of Brock's sisters, said they appreciate Cathy "not  using the children as weapons between the families."  </P> <P> "My brother's kids are like my own," she said.  </P> <P> Creighton added that the Brock family is angry that Rovida, in none of his  court appearances, ever showed remorse for Robert Brock's death.  </P> <P> "But I do feel sorry for Cathy," she said. "If only she and Robert could have  stayed away from each other."  </P> <P> Cathy Brock's task now is to confront the truth about her father.  </P> <P> She still won't admit his guilt. And her mother has persuaded her it's best if  she does not return to Orange County Jail to see him before he is shipped to  prison this week. But she says she does have something she wants him to  understand.  </P> <P> She explained: "I have to let him know, that I know I'm the one to blame."  </P></p>

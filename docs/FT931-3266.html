			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hall hit by rationalisation HALL Engineering (Holdings), the steel stockholding, construction products and automotive engineering group, yesterday announced a Pounds 21m 'breakthrough' order in Gerany and virtually unchanged profits for 1992, before exceptionals, of Pounds 5.6m. However, a Pounds 1.84m exceptional item for rationalisation at Hall &amp; Pickles and British Reinforced Concrete Engineering left the pre-tax line at Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 5.07m). Group turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 135.7m. Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said conditions remained depressed, causing worsening results from steel reinforcement and metal stockholding where profits fell by Pounds 800,000 and Pounds 1m respectively. Profits from associated companies improved from Pounds 5m to Pounds 6.8m. In particular, Mr Hall said the 50 per cent-owned Singapore reinforcing steel, roofing and cladding businesses were 'going like a rocket.' Engineering profits dropped by Pounds 1.3m, with fewer automation contracts at Stadco being completed. But Mr Hall said he was delighted to announce that Stadco's automation division had won a Pounds 21m contract from Audi in Germany. The order is a record for Stadco. It furthers its ambitions to move to 'a slightly higher rung' in the automotive manufacturing equipment sector according to Mr Brian Hinkins, group managing director. The continuing predominance of profit from overseas led to a further build-up of ACT in the UK - and the ACT write-off of Pounds 1.8m is higher than previously expected. The effective tax rate last year was 74 per cent, but Hall estimates the rate this year will be 37.5 per cent. A total tax charge of Pounds 2.76m, and a Pounds 1.37m extraordinary charge due mainly to the decision to close steelmaking operations in South Africa, produced a net loss for the year of Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 3.56m). Earnings per share dipped from 11.34p to 3.05p, while the dividend is maintained at 8.64p with a same-again final of 5.34p. Mr Hall said the current year has had a much better start than last year. Increases in steel prices, rationalisation at Hall and the current round of capacity cuts in the reinforcement industry left him 'more optimistic than I have been for some time for the future performance of the group.'</p>

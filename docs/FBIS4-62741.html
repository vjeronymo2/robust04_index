			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tonu Kaljumae will now report about the Baltic  Assembly's sitting, which has ended in Jurmala.    [Begin Kaljumae recording] Today the fourth session of the  Baltic Assembly ended in Jurmala. A whole string of documents  were prepared in the course of three days and today Estonian,  Latvian, and Lithuanian representatives signed them. Ulo Nugis,  the Estonian delegation's leader, which of the adopted documents  -- and there are about a dozen of them -- is the most important  in your view?    [Nugis] I would not underestimate any of them, but it seems  to me personally that the most important documents are to do  with the topical political issues, in particular relations with  Russia and the Russian troop withdrawal. I would rate the  Baltic Assembly's statement as number one, on the Russian  Federation's statements of pressure on the Baltic states. In  essence, let us say, it amounts to support from two Baltic  countries -- Latvia and Lithuania -- to Estonia. Its preamble  states clearly that the Russian defense minister has threatened  Estonia with additional troops, and the Baltic Assembly states  that, both at present and in the future, threats or exertions of  pressure to any one Baltic state, whichever form they take, will  be viewed as a threat to the security of all three Baltic  states.

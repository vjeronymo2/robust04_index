			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held  Sunday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the on-the-spot  guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to the Korean  Central News Agency.    Comrade Kim Chong-il guided the KCNA on the spot on June 12,  1964.    He had a historical talk entitled "The Basic Tasks Facing  the  Korean Central News Agency" with KCNA officials, clearly  indicating the road ahead of it.    Comrade Kim Chong-il gave flawless answers to all the  theoretical and practical questions for the development of the  work of the news agency such as its basic tasks, functions and  role, the principles it must maintain to become a mighty  ideological weapon of the party and ways for their application.    After his on-the-spot guidance, KCNA has been able to serve  better for the cause of modelling of the whole society on the  chuche idea as an ideological weapon of the Workers' Party of  Korea and defend and exalt the revolutionary tradition of the  chuche-based press.

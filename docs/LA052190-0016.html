			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BOREDOM BECOMES RACING BLISS FOR EARNHARDT  </P> <P> Dale Earnhardt's start-to-finish victory Sunday at Charlotte (N.C.) Motor  Speedway in The Winston pleased him with its boredom.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of race I wanted to win," he said after dominating the field  in NASCAR's all-star event.  </P> <P> "There was no question who was best out there today. We won it without any  controversy. There's no mad race fans out there because their guy got knocked  out."  </P> <P> He was referring to controversial Winston finishes last year and in 1987, the  first time Earnhardt won the event.  </P> <P> With the victory that capped a $325,000 Earnhardt weekend that was NASCAR'S  richest ever, he became the first two-time winner of The Winston, which dates  to 1985.  </P> <P> He also is the first to win the race from the pole and averaged 163.001 m.p.h.  for the 70-lap, 105-mile event that was run in two parts -- a 50-lap segment  followed by a 10-minute rest and a 20-lap sprint.  </P></p>

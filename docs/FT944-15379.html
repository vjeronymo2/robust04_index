			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Japanese securities tax move Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, said yesterday he believes a proposed revision of the country's securities trading tax should be considered as part of an overall review of the securities tax system. Speaking in the Japanese parliament, Mr Takemura said a review would also cover a proposed increase in capital gains tax. But he said that a full review of the tax was unlikely before 1996. Alone among the leading international capital markets, Japan currently imposes a 0.3 per cent tax on all securities transactions. But in the last year, as equity trading has remained sluggish and foreign companies have de-listed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, alarm has been expressed about che damage done by the tax to Japan's market.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Hard disk resists shock treatment Until quite recently hard disk drives were not only big, bulky and heavy, but also sensitive to shocks which made them unsuitable for many hand-held electronic devices. Now Hewlett-Packard has introduced a shock-resistant mini hard disk, dubbed the HP Kittyhawk Personal Storage Module (PSM). The Kittyhawk is a 1.3-inch hard disk drive capable of storing 21 Mbytes of data in a device the size of a matchbox. Aimed at mobile applications like palmtop computers, electronic instruments, communications and imaging devices, the PSM can withstand an operating shock of 100g. Today's 1.8-inch and 2.5-inch disk drives can only handle shocks of between 10g and 20g. The drive incorporates an integrated circuit based on the same technology used in cars to sense collisions and trigger air bags. As a result the PSM can sense and brace for a shock before it occurs, keeping data safe. The device will compete with solid-state technology storage devices like flash memory, but cost only about a fifth as much. Hewlett-Packard: US, 208 323 6000; UK, 0344 361419.</p>

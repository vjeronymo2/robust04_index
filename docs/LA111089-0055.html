			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BORDWELL PASS LIFTS EL CAMINO REAL  </P> <P> Jeff Duva, a former El Camino Real High All-City quarterback, returned to watch  his first Conquistadore football game in five years Thursday night and had to  be impressed with what he saw.  </P> <P> Duva, who led El Camino Real to the City final in 1972, saw Tony Bordwell  complete his first touchdown pass of the year -- a 29-yarder to Ronnu Griffin  with 46 seconds to play -- to lift El Camino Real to a 13-7 West Valley League  victory over Canoga Park (1-7, 1-5) at Pierce College.  </P> <P> Bordwell, who didn't complete a pass in last week's win over Cleveland and  missed on his first six attempts against Canoga Park, finished five for 13 for  72 yards.  </P> <P> Fullback Jamal Anderson registered his second consecutive strong performance in  two weeks. Anderson, who rushed for 172 yards and two touchdowns last week,  gained 182 yards in 15 carries and scored a touchdown on a 54-yard run in the  first period.  </P> <P> Anderson also had a 26-yard touchdown run called back on a holding penalty in  the second quarter. El Camino Real (4-4, 3-3 in league play) is 4-0 this season  in games in which Anderson has rushed for more than 100 yards. JIM COLEMAN  </P></p>

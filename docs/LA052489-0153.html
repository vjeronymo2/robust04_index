			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PHIL ESPOSITO IS FIRED BY NEW YORK RANGERS  </P> <P> Phil Esposito was fired today as coach, general manager and vice president of  the New York Rangers.  </P> <P> Esposito took over as coach with two games left last season when, as general  manager, he fired Michel Bergeron.  </P> <P> In making the announcement, John Diller, executive vice president of Madison  Square Garden Sports Group, which owns the NHL team, said, "We announced at the  end of the season that we would undertake a thorough assessment of the entire  Ranger organization."  </P> <P> ". . . It is our belief that new hockey leadership is necessary at this time in  order to achieve the goals we have set for this franchise.  </P> <P> "The decision with respect to Phil, who has completed his third season as  Rangers general manager, was not an easy one. He has made many contributions to  the franchise both as a player and as a general manager."  </P> <P> After firing Bergeron on April 1 and coaching the Rangers through the last two  regular-season games, Esposito was behind the bench for four games of a playoff  against Pittsburgh. The Rangers lost all six of those games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vote of Confidence  </P> <P> After the sweep by the Penguins, the 47-year-old Esposito was given a vote of  confidence by the Rangers' hierarchy.  </P> <P> Esposito, who completed his 18-year NHL playing career with the Rangers in the  1980-81 season, first coached the team during the 1986-87 campaign. After  replacing Ted Sator, Esposito compiled a 24-19 regular-season record before the  Rangers were beaten in the first round on the playoffs by Philadelphia, four  games to two.  </P> <P> Diller said that no one had yet been selected to replace Esposito as coach or  general manager.  </P></p>

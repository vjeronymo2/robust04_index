The verdict was announced on February 7 in  Tbilisi.    Sharmaidze, 21, alleged that he had fired at a passing car,  not knowing who was in it, after hopeless attempts to stop any  car to borrow several liters of gasoline. A bullet hit Fred  Woodruff in the head.    The head of Eduard Shevardnadze's security service, who was  driving the car, was freed from his duties after the tragedy.    According to various sources, Woodruff was a high-ranking  CIA  staffer who instructed Shevardnadze's security guards in  Tbilisi. CIA chief James Woolsey came to Tbilisi to collect  Woodruff's body.</p>

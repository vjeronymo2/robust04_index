			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The people of 'Bop' turn backs on a loser: Patti Waldmeir reports from Mmabatho on the revolt against a homeland president 'When we got our independence we were told we were being liberated from apartheid, only to find we were coming into a greater apartheid,' says Mrs Pinkie Tsikwe, trying to explain the revolt of the normally docile inhabitants of the nominally independent black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana against their President, Lucas Mangope. 'Being oppressed by a black man is worse than being oppressed by a white man,' she says, sitting at the lace-covered dining room table of her tasteful three-bedroomed brick home in the capital Mmabatho. It is only a few hundred yards from the scene where, only hours later, a large part - if not all - of the Bophuthatswana police force revolted against Mr Mangope and joined anti-government demonstrators. Mrs Tsikwe, whose husband is one of the striking civil servants who paralysed the government of this apartheid homeland, insists that the protests are not political. Whatever the public demands of civil servants or university students - chief among these is that 'Bop', as it is widely known, should be re-incorporated into South Africa - the real problem is that the people of Bophuthatswana 'have just had enough of the President'. Even the civil servants' strike, launched over the issue of whether government employees' pension funds are being raided to fund normal government expenditure and since recast as a protest at Mr Mangope's refusal to re-incorporate, is not political, she argues. 'It isn't the pensions, it isn't the politics, it's money,' she insists, adding that ministers awarded themselves a 50 per cent pay rise while normal civil servants received only 5 per cent. When mutinying police presented a petition to the government late yesterday afternoon, they too mentioned money, conditions of service and housing, though their chief demand was that the police 'should not be used by any political party, especially the Christian Democrat party (of President Mangope), as political tools'. They, too, want out of politics. What she does not say, but what civil servants' leaders hint at, is that the inhabitants of Bophuthatswana have smelled blood: they know that Pretoria no longer supports Mr Mangope (it once rescued him from a military coup in 1988, but relations have since soured) and they know that the African National Congress is set to win a big election victory in the rest of South Africa. Under those circumstances, Bop's inhabitants seem inclined to be pragmatic. They will follow the most basic rule of politics in Africa: support a winner. And Mr Mangope has all the hallmarks of a loser. Judged in terms of economic development, this would be an unfair verdict on his 17-year rule. For Bop, a nation of 2m Tswana people that gained nominal independence from Pretoria in 1977, has more to lose economically from re-incorporation than any other homeland. Economic growth in recent years has exceeded that in most independent African countries, and certainly has bettered that in South Africa proper. Education, housing and health care are all arguably better in Bop. Still, it looks like the end of the line for President Mangope. It was unclear last night whether he had been toppled from power: but without the support of the majority of police, it seems unlikely that he can hold out against the demand for re-incorporation and for Bop's citizens to participate in South Africa's elections. Perhaps he never had a chance of resisting. Government sources made clear that Pretoria would intervene militarily if 'South African nationals' - in practice, that meant whites - were threatened (seconded officials from South Africa hold senior jobs in the civil service and several white motorists have already had narrow escapes from the angry mob). Units of the South African Defence Force have carried out highly visible manoeuvres on Bophuthatswana's border. And the Bophuthatswana Defence Force has not been loyal; Bop soldiers regularly responded in kind when greeted with the black power salute of the ANC, and took little part in putting down unrest. Even most of the police, the bastion of President Mangope's support, appeared to give in with strikingly little resistance. After negotiating with students on the University of Bophuthatswana campus, they emerged to present a petition entitled 'Police for Peace' to the South African ambassador, and later embraced demonstrators in emotional scenes of surrender. Their revolt is a propaganda coup to the ANC, which has skilfully manipulated the protest to look like a massive vote of support for the ANC. The apparent demise of Bop would inevitably raise hopes among some ANC leaders that the much stronger, meaner and more determined regime of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be similarly toppled. This seems unlikely: civil servants in his KwaZulu homeland are both more committed to the ruling party, Inkatha, and more fearful of brutal reprisal, than their Bop counterparts. The ANC would do well to remember that KwaZulu is not Bop; if they do not, the consequence could be vastly worse violence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Nasri Yusuf, commander of the  Palestinian Police Force, has stated that his forces will refuse  to hand over to Israel alleged perpetrators of operations  against the Israeli state who seek refuge in the self-rule areas.    At a news conference in Gaza, he said: We will not permit  the Israelis to come and arrest anyone in the sectors that are  under our control. Maj. Gen. Nasri Yusuf also said that the  Palestinian police will issue arms licenses to the self-rule  inhabitants, but will not permit weapons to be carried on the  streets as they should be kept at home.</p>

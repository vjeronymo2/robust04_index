			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILLY BOB'S IS BACK WITH A WHOOP AND A HOLLER  </P> <P> The rowdy reopening of Billy Bob's Texas, billed as the world's largest  honky-tonk, sends a strong signal that Texas has bounced back from the shock of  collapsing oil prices three years ago.  </P> <P> "The big question tonight is -- 'What's a honky-tonk?' " said Steve Murrin, one  of 200 employees who poured beer, roped bulls, swept floors or barbecued beef  ribs for Thursday night's 2,500 customers.  </P> <P> "I can't describe a honky-tonk, but I can show you one," he said. "It's a place  where you expect a little beer, a little music and maybe a stabbing or shooting  once in a while."  </P> <P> During the day Murrin operates a 2,000-acre working horse and cattle ranch near  Ft. Worth, which is 30 miles west of Dallas, but at night he works at this  converted cow barn with 42 bars, a live indoor rodeo and seating room for 6,500  customers.  </P> <P> The official reopening of Billy Bob's, closed for 10 months after its owner,  Billy Bob Barnett, declared bankruptcy, ranks high among unofficial economic  indicators measuring the financial health of Texas.  </P> <P> "Billy Bob's is just one beer joint, but when it shut down, the world thought  the city of Ft. Worth was done for," Murrin said.  </P> <P> The record crowd for Billy Bob's stands at 8,000 customers inside at one time.  </P></p>

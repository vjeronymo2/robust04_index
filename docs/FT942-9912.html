			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Sizewell B ahead of budget target and on schedule Sizewell B in Suffolk, Britain's first pressurised water reactor nuclear power station, is heading for completion more than Pounds 100m below the budget set five years ago. It is expected to be commissioned several months ahead of the February 1995 commitment given to government before construction began in 1987. Completion of the plant on time and below its estimated Pounds 2.03bn budget follows delays and large cost overruns during the 1970s and 1980s in the building of advanced gas-cooled reactors. The causes were late design changes and industrial disputes which led to a loss of more than 11m man-hours. Dungeness B in Kent took 18 years to complete - 13 more than scheduled  - and at double the cost. Sizewell B's budget was set in 1989. Previous estimates had been lower, but Nuclear Electric, the plant owner, says the rise from the most recent figure of Pounds 1.87bn was due to the government abandoning plans for four power stations of the same design and the consequent loss in economies of scale. Nuclear Electric hopes to start generating electricity by August or September. A further delay is possible because Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution has yet to issue a licence for the plant to discharge radioactivity routinely. While construction is within the timetable given to the government, work is several weeks behind the company's hopes of last year that it would commission in May or June. With only weeks to go before the scheduled completion of construction contracts, officials expect the capital cost to be in the region of Pounds 1.9bn. Final figures will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry, which is examining the company's planning application for a Pounds 3.5bn twin-reactor, Sizewell C. A go-ahead for this plant depends on the outcome of a public inquiry and also the government's long-awaited nuclear power review. The timetable for the review and its remit have yet to be announced. Nuclear Electric already has planning permission for a single reactor at Hinkley Point C in Somerset but construction there is also subject to a favourable review out-come.</p>

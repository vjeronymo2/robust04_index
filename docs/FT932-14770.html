			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton output down 20% COTTON OUTPUT in the former Soviet republics dropped by almost 20 per cent last year to 6.47m tonnes, the lowest level for 15 years, according to the Commonwealth of Independent States' central statistical office. Raw cotton production totalled 7.79m tonnes in 1991 and 9.1m tonnes in 1980. Two-thirds of last year's total came from the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, with Turkmenistan, Tadzhikistan and Azerbaijan supplying most of the rest. The CIS statistical office cited shortages of agricultural equipment as the key reason for falling production. Productivity was relatively inefficient with only 2.24 tonnes of cotton collected from each hectare cultivated. However, the collapse of trade links between the former Soviet republics and the political unrest in Azerbaijan and Tadzhikistan have also drastically affected the harvesting and processing of cotton. With the former Soviet republics now increasingly determined to boost their supplies of hard currency, exports of raw cotton have risen significantly - last year Uzbekistan increased its overseas sales by 130 per cent to 600,000 tonnes. At the same time trade with Russia, previously the main receiver of raw cotton in the Soviet Union, has dropped, leaving its textile industry in growing crisis.</p>

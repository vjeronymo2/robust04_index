			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Technology: Cutting through the red tape - How fragmented sectors, such as machine tools, can realistically carry out joint R&amp;D Over the past few months, Europe's machine tool builders have been engaged in characteristically low-pro-file talks with the European Community about a possible industrial policy. In the depths of a recession that has damaged competitiveness, the industry hopes for some stimulus to investment by its customers in manufacturing, but also wants the EC to help create the conditions that might address some of its longer-term problems. At the top of the list is a very different approach to research and development - aimed at stimulating better co-operation between companies in the most strategically important areas of R&amp;D, and improving the unhappy relationship between the industry and EC-funded research programmes. The outcome of the talks is far from clear, but the industry's approach raises questions about the nature of R&amp;D in a fragmented, intensely competitive industry of some 1,500 independent producers. How does such an industry achieve a balance between 'R' and 'D' when most companies concentrate exclusively on the D? Where does the R get done, and how does the industry benefit? How much R is necessary anyway? For many machine tool builders, development work that is not linked to a specific product or technology is rare, and 'blue-sky research' taboo. But new materials, relatively new processes such as laser-cutting and the trend towards standardisation of control systems, motors and drives all argue for a significant research element in R&amp;D. Inevitably, though, the recession has reduced the ability of machine tool builders to do much more than plough their own development furrows. Consequently, increased co-operation on higher levels of research - broad-based and 'pre-competitive' but not 'blue-sky' - has become an even higher priority for producers, users, institutions and universities. But the industry and the EC industrial research infrastructure is poorly matched. Most machine tool builders, for example, believe the structure and content of the EC's Brite/Euram industrial research projects make it difficult for them to participate. 'The research is too far removed from the market place to allow the formulation of projects that can be useful in the medium- or short- term,' says Mike Bright, chairman of Brighton-based FMT Holdings. 'It's the Plesseys, Siemens &amp; Philips who are obtaining the funds. The SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) are not getting a look in, and it's causing quite a concern.' Tony Balding, managing director of Norwich-based Beaver Engineering Group, cites the intimidating amounts of paperwork involved in applying to join an EC project. He warns too that small companies which do participate may find their pace is inhibited by larger, slower-moving partners. Continental machine tool companies have similar complaints. Sandvik of Sweden has participated in Brite/Euram via EC subsidiaries, but Clas Ake Hedstrom, president of the Sandvik Coromant metal-cutting tools division, says that results have been limited so far, and some programmes are taking longer than was originally anticipated. The problem for the machine tool industry is that such EC projects were set up to focus on what Nigel Eldred, chief executive of Amtri, the UK machine tool research organisation, calls 'macro-technology'. Consequently, small companies which have traditionally carried out strictly targeted development work find it difficult to leap into these broader-based projects. However, the industry has reason to hope that EC-funded research may soon become more user-friendly. Jean Heymans, secretary general of Cecimo, the European machine tool trade association umbrella body, says the EC's current Framework programme for Brite/Euram projects will be much more geared to industry than to blue-sky research. Cecimo, whose talks with the EC are backed by its 12 member countries, is pushing for a policy designed to improve the SMEs' access to R&amp;D programmes through measures such as increased funding for their projects, simplified administrative procedures and enlarged Craft-type programmes. Craft, an offshoot of Brite/Euram and currently at the pilot stage, is likely to be more market-oriented than Brite/Euram itself, and could appeal to SMEs. Administrative procedures should be simpler but, according to one UK machine tool official, 'there will still be a whittling down process, and unless you know the ropes, you haven't got a hope in hell'. As long as the machine tool industry retains its current structure, though, there will always be companies which will find it hard to benefit from the EC's largesse - some Ecu 500m (Pounds 350m) spent on Brite/Euram in 1989-92 and Ecu 670m budgeted for the overlapping 1990-94 programme. But the industry can, and is, participating in the pan-European Eureka R&amp;D initiative, launched in 1985. This is intended to be more market-related than Brite/Euram, but projects are narrower in scope and rely on funding by national governments. Speed is probably the biggest factor prompting some companies to consider bilateral agreements on development rather than become involved in a long-term project which offers little opportunity to cover administrative costs and could be tantamount to 'buying a headache,' says Eldred. But at least one larger UK machine tool company is happy to be taking part in a Brite/Euram project, even if it did take months to get off the ground. Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based grinding machine manufacturer, is investigating the potential of cubic boron nitride for precision cylindrical grinding at high wheel speeds via a four-year Brite/Euram project based at Aachen. The diversity of the project's participants is a new trend for machine tool research and one which many observers believe should be encouraged. Apart from Aachen University's machine tool research department, the other partners are Brussels-based Diamond Boart, manufacturers of super-abrasive wheels, and a user - the vehicle-parts and electricals group Robert Bosch. In the UK, which has traditionally lagged behind continental Europe in harnessing R&amp;D carried out by companies, universities and government-funded research institutions, Amtri has been the catalyst behind a unique project that follows a similar approach. The Pounds 15m Machine Tool Technology and Materials Processing Programme, supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, brings machine tool customers, producers and part suppliers together in a series of separate projects such as high-speed spindle research. The aim is for all the technologies being developed in the programme to be combined in a 'multi-function machine tool'. Eldred sees a key role for Amtri as a 'networker' to link companies with universities and other bodies, and to keep its ear close to the ground in relation to other European centres. As companies and institutions begin to take a more international approach to research partnerships, the next step is to help develop a more effective 'network of networks' in Europe, according to Derek Palethorpe, Amtri's director of operations. The overall aim should be to produce a more co-ordinated, broad-based approach to R&amp;D in the European machine tool industry. In the background is competition from Japan, which has always outshone rivals on product development and exploitation but is also becoming more interested in multidisciplinary international research. Japan's proposed research project into intelligent manufacturing systems, for example, is intended to have international participation. Some European observers worry, therefore, that it may be no more than a Trojan horse feeding on Europe's remaining areas of superiority in machine tool innovation. At the same time, industry critics say, more mergers and cross-border co-operation among European machine tool builders would develop a mentality that is better suited to participate in the higher reaches of EC research. At least they would have more resources to handle the red tape.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LE MONDE FOUNDER HUBERT BEUVE-MERY DIES AT AGE 87  </P> <P> Hubert Beuve-Mery, who founded Le Monde in 1944 and made it France's leading  daily newspaper, has died at the age of 87, the newspaper announced today.  </P> <P> Beuve-Mery died Sunday night in Fontainebleau, where he had been hospitalized  for the last week after a serious fall, Le Monde said.  </P> <P> "He was a great leader," Jacques Fauvet, Beuve-Mery's successor as editor and  publisher of Le Monde, said on French radio. "He had great independence of  spirit and moral authority at the same time."  </P> <P> The austere, left-of-center tabloid, its gray expanses only rarely broken by  photographs, became known for its authoritative and thorough coverage of  foreign and domestic affairs, complete with footnotes in tiny print.  </P></p>

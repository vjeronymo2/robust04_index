			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Cookery: A source of good sauce and the high street multiples are enjoying booming own-label sales on both counts. Last week, I reported on a blind tasting of supermarket pastas. This week, the spotlight is on pasta sauces. Each company was invited to submit two - whatever they considered to be their own-label best. My tasting panel was the same as before: Anna Del Conte, Josceline Dimbleby, Simon Parkes, Oliver Waley and Henry Dimbleby. We started in a dubious mood as we all believe in the superiority of home-made sauces. After all, making a pasta sauce takes only minutes and calls for no special culinary skills. Indeed, many of the best can be conjured up in the time it takes to boil the pasta. The general quality of the sauces submitted for tasting was unappetising, to say the least. A lot of unpleasant things were said. A sea of tomato and other vegetable-based sauces elicited such comments as: 'This has the reconstituted quality of packet soup', 'surely this is off?', 'disagreeably thick and mushy; it smells of chlorine', 'a disaster', 'I cannot recall tasting anything nastier'. The so-called carbonaras provoked outrage because they were total misnomers  -variations on a white sauce instead of eggy with snippets of fried bacon and an optional splash of cream. 'Looks like bechamel and tastes like cardboard boxes', 'where is the bacon? where is the egg?' Only two sauces passed the test: 'Would you eat this again?'. The first was a tomato and mascarpone sauce from Marks &amp; Spencer which just scraped by as acceptable to some of the panel - sample comment 'there is something quite nice about this' - although I recoiled from its chicken tikka-ish brown colouring and frothy texture. The other, also from Marks &amp; Spencer as it turned out, won rave notices all round. We were amazed by it, a fresh tomato sauce that lived up to its name. Pure and simple, it looked as good as it tasted. The tomatoes were of the plum variety, top quality, full of flavour, very juicy, firm but not hard, simply chopped, barely cooked in a little extra virgin olive oil, nicely seasoned and scattered with basil. Josceline summed up our reactions neatly when she exclaimed: 'I have never come across any sauce from any shop that tasted as home-made as this.' We thought it was a sauce with many potential applications. In fact, arguably, as Anna commented, drained of some of its juice, it might be even better for topping bruschetta than pasta. (Any juice drained off should be saved for adding to soup or a salad dressing, or to drink with a slug of vodka - it is far too good to sluice down the sink). One thing that puzzled us was the label instruction to heat the sauce gently and serve it hot. To do so risks robbing it of its lovely freshness. Far better, we thought, to do as we did: put the sauce into a serving bowl, add the cooked pasta and toss quickly to mix before serving. M &amp; S has since amended the wording. The reasoning behind the original instructions undoubtedly harks back to the British penchant for serving a little pasta with our sauce, and the fear that the pasta would, thus overwhelmed, become cold long before it hit the plate, let alone the palate. It would be easy enough to make a sauce like this at home so far as culinary skill is concerned and no-one could call it time consuming. But where would you find sufficiently good tomatoes - the key ingredient? M &amp; S buy-in special fruits specifically for making this sauce, variously from France, Italy and Spain, wherever the best vine-ripened plum tomatoes are to be found at any given time. If none are deemed good enough, this line is suspended for the duration. Cooks wanting to make such a sauce at home would probably have to grow their own tomatoes and will the sun to flavour them. The sauce, as tasted at our sampling, is unhesitatingly to be recommended. But a cautionary footnote must be added. I have found the product to be variable (perhaps unavoidably?). A subsequent purchase had its subtlety and tomatoeyness spoiled by the over-assertive presence of garlic and chilli. Marks &amp; Spencer's fresh tomato sauce costs Pounds 3 per lb. The recommended serving is 4-6 oz per person, which seems to me unnecessarily greedy. The product is made fresh daily and goes on sale for one day only. Sadly it is stocked only by branches that boast a deli counter - currently Marble Arch and Kings Road Chelsea in London and Camberley in Surrey. More are in the pipeline but not many. Finding this sauce among so much dross made our hearts leap. Such quality deserves to be encouraged. I would change my tune about buying sauces if more were this good. How pleasing it would be if supermarkets developed all their recipe products to match the best of home-made, as has been done in this case. Next week: home-made sauces</p>

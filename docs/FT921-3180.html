			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (5): An urgent need of debt relief - The balance of payments constraint will tighten this year LAST YEAR's hopes that higher oil prices and a reduced debt-burden would ease the balance of payments stranglehold on the economy were shortlived. The re-emergence of the oil glut and the spectre of stalemate with the IMF over domestic economic policy mean that the balance of payments constraint will tighten this year. Oil exports, which more than doubled between 1988 and 1990, fell sharply last year, when the price of Nigerian crude averaged Dollars 18.8 a barrel, compared with Dollars 23 in 1990. A further fall in oil revenues seems inevitable in 1992; the authorities have, as usual, estimated their oil revenues extremely conservatively, at between Dollars 7.4bn and Dollars 8.9bn this year. These projections cannot be reconciled with the budget assumptions of exports of 1.43m barrels a day and a price of Dollars 21 a barrel, which imply earnings close to Dollars 11bn. However, these are fragile assumptions, given the near-term outlook for the world economy and Opec's quota cuts. If exports can be maintained at 1.43m b/d with a price of Dollars 17, oil exports would be close to the higher of the two budget assumptions at Dollars 8.9bn. The break-even price for Nigerian oil - that is, the oil price that would enable the country to balance its books without recourse to additional external assistance - is estimated at Dollars 23 a barrel in 1992. Since a fall of Dollars 1 in the price of a barrel of oil costs Nigeria some Dollars 500m annually, the Dollars 6 a barrel gap between the break-even price and the widely-forecast 1992 price of Dollars 17 a barrel, points to a huge financing gap of some Dollars 3bn this year. Five years ago, the World Bank was projecting non-oil exports well in excess of Dollars 1bn by the early 1990s. In fact, non-oil earnings of Dollars 425m last year were well below their 1987-8 average of Dollars 575m, though the latest Washington forecast projects a surge in non-oil exports, from Dollars 650m in 1995 to Dollars 2bn by the turn of the century, reflecting the impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. In fact, non-oil exports are substantially higher than the official figure, because an unknown - but large - volume of cross-border trade is unrecorded. Given the lacklustre performance of non-oil exports and the undesirability - if not the impossibility - of further import compression, the Nigerians who, just a year ago, believed they had slain the debt dragon, are now pleading for Trinidad terms for additional debt relief. Two significant debt-rescheduling agreements were reached last year - one with the Paris Club of official creditors, and a debt-service reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial banking creditors. This covered some Dollars 5.8bn, or 17 per cent, of outstanding debt in 1990; and when the agreement was activated in January, Nigeria's foreign debt was reduced by Dollars 2bn. Some 65 per cent of the holders of the bank debt opted to redeem their debt at a discount price of 40 cents in the dollar, while the bulk of the remainder was exchanged for collateralised 'par bonds', carrying interest at 5.5 per cent for the first three years and 6.25 per cent for the remaining 27 years of the 30-year maturity period. In effect, this means that Nigeria has repurchased commercial bank debt with a face value of Dollars 3.3bn for approximately Dollars 1.32bn - a 60 per cent discount. Accurate figures for Nigeria's foreign debt are hard to find. The central bank estimated that the country's public (and public-guaranteed) external debt at Dollars 33.4bn in October 1991. With the buy-back of London Club paper, the debt stock is forecast to fall sharply this year to Dollars 29bn. In spite of this, the debt-service situation is set to deteriorate, with scheduled obligations this year of some Dollars 5.8bn and exports of no more than Dollars 9.5bn - a ratio of approximately 60 per cent. Clearly, this is not sustainable, which is why Nigeria desperately needs a Trinidad-terms debt rescheduling agreement. But this is a non-starter without a new IMF agreement, which looks remote at this juncture. Certainly, there was little in the 1992 budget to encourage the hard-nosed men from Washington to believe that Lagos is ready to bite the bullet on the core issues of the exchange rate, the budget deficit and the domestic petrol subsidy. One source of partial relief has been the substantial inflow of foreign direct investment, which has averaged Dollars 800m annually over the last five years. Virtually all of this is targeted on the energy sector, but it has played its part in offsetting at least some of the onerous burden of loan repayment outflows, which averaged Dollars 1.6bn a year over the same period. As a result, the world's 13th poorest country has been a net capital exporter to the tune of Dollars 4bn a year since the structural adjustment programme was launched in 1986, underscoring yet again the urgent need for debt relief.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (DOLLARS BN)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                          1990        1991        1992                                   (estimate)   (forecast)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Exports                  13.7        10.6         9.5   (of which: oil)        13.3        10.2         9.0 Imports                   4.9         5.1         5.4 Trade surplus             8.8         5.5         4.1 Net invisibles           -3.5        -2.0        -2.0 Current account           5.2         3.5         2.1 Capital account          -4.4        -3.3        -3.4 Overall balance           0.8         0.2        -1.3 Scheduled                -6.9        -6.0        -5.8    debt-service  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Central Bank of Nigeria, National Planning Office, Lagos, and IMF  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

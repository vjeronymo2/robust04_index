			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY WON'T FACE L.A. CHARGE  </P> <P> New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry will not face a weapons charge in  connection with his arrest during a domestic dispute in January, the Los  Angeles city attorney's office said today.  </P> <P> An alcohol problem was the root of Strawberry's domestic problem and the  ballplayer was in a recovery program, the prosecutor's office said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors concluded there was insufficient evidence to support any weapons  charges against Strawberry, 27, who was booked for investigation of assault  with a deadly weapon Jan. 26 after a dispute at his Encino home.  </P> <P> The statement issued by the office of City Atty. James K. Hahn said the  conclusion was reached after hearings involving Strawberry's wife, Lisa, 25,  and her mother, Virginia Andrews, and "frank" discussion with Strawberry.  </P> <P> The investigation was concluded, the statement said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Strawberry was especially frank with us in discussing both the incident,  the events leading up to the incident and his problems with alcohol which, in  our judgment, lies at the root of the family problems which resulted in his  arrest," the prosecutors said.  </P> <P> "He has now completed the initial step of his recovery program. Therefore, we  do not intend to file misdemeanor spousal battery charges at this time. Rather,  in conjunction with Dr. Allan Lans, the director of the Mets Assistance  Program, Mr. Strawberry has agreed to provide us with biweekly written progress  reports for three months.  </P> <P> "During this time, he will continue counseling for his alcohol problem and  begin family counseling. After three months, we will assess the need for  further monthly reports through the end of the year."  </P> <P> The city attorney's office said it was supportive of efforts by individuals to  deal with "the problems of chemical dependency which invariably lead to acts of  violence."  </P> <P> Shortly after Strawberry's arrest, the city attorney's office received a signed  statement from his wife saying she did not want him to be prosecuted.  </P> <P> Lisa Strawberry and her mother, who witnessed part of the altercation, met with  a city attorney hearing officer Feb. 9.  </P> <P> Mike Qualls, a Hahn spokesman, said one purpose of those meetings was to  determine if Lisa Strawberry told police of her own free will that she did not  want to press charges. Qualls said today that it was determined that she had.  </P> <P> About a week after the incident, Strawberry said he had a problem with alcohol  and admitted himself to the Smithers Institute in Manhattan.  </P> <P> The Mets said Strawberry was en route today to the club's training complex in  Port St. Lucie, Fla.  </P></p>

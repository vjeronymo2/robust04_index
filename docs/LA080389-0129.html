			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON SIGNS MURPHY TO COACH FOOTBALL FOR 3 MORE YEARS  </P> <P> Football Coach Gene Murphy of Cal State Fullerton has signed a three-year  contract extension through the 1992 season, school officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Murphy, 49, is about to begin his 10th season with Fullerton, which has  finished no worse than tied for second in the Big West Conference in five of  the last six seasons.  </P> <P> Murphy's record at Fullerton is 48-56, not including two opponent forfeits,  even though the Titans have played 70 of 104 games on the road over nine  seasons. He was 15-7 in two seasons at North Dakota before coming to Fullerton  in 1980.  </P> <P> "We're obviously very pleased to extend Coach Murphy's contract," said Athletic  Director Ed Carroll. "And we're happy to get it done now, so we can all  concentrate on the 1989 season."  </P> <P> Fullerton's athletic department is placing increased emphasis on academics, a  move that has tightened admissions standards for athletes.  </P> <P> "The contract places emphasis on academics, not on wins and losses," Carroll  said. "Our priorities and objectives are about academics. We want Gene to win,  but we also want him to know he has job security." ROBYN NORWOOD  </P></p>

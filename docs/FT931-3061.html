			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Leading Article: French Socialists go on trial NEXT SUNDAY'S election in France will be widely regarded as a trial of the Socialists' record in office. On the evidence of the opinion polls, they may lose three-fifths of their seats and the combined conservative parties will sweep back into power with a massive majority. By the ordinary yard-stick of democratic success and failure, such a result would appear to be a devastating condemnation. Up to a point, the Socialists clearly deserve to be thrown out. They have been in power too long, they have shown themselves all too ready to resort to the flesh-pots of political corruption, and they have failed to rethink their traditional policies and their style in terms which would reconcile their claims to some kind of modern socialism with the practical demands of today's world. But if one looks at their policy record, it is not evident that the Socialists have done badly by the French electorate. When they came to power in 1981, they rushed ahead with outdated left-wing nostrums, like wholesale nationalisation and early retirement. But within two years they were forced to backtrack and since then they have steadily pursued a modest, even 'conservative' economic policy, based on budgetary restraint and control of inflation. This has been a well-managed policy, which has given France above-average growth and steadily falling inflation. It will no doubt be continued by the conservatives after next Sunday's election. The acute problem, from a Socialist point of view, is that this responsible economic policy failed to prevent the rise in unemployment, which has now become inexorable under the forces of recession. Structural problem It is reasonably clear, therefore, that a vast swing in Sunday's vote will point to a serious structural problem, which can only partly be laid at the feet of the Socialists. The problem is that the French political system is out of kilter, largely because there is an imbalance between the large and spreading powers of the presidency and the undervalued role of the parliament. Over the years this has generated a growing sense of alienation among the electorate, which has become evident in the growth of support for the protest parties, most notably the extreme right-wing National Front and the two ecology parties. All told, the non-government parties could get a third of the votes between them, but without winning many seats in parliament; whereas the conservatives can expect a huge majority in parliament, even if they get under 40 per cent of the vote. Urgent priority The disequilibrium between the conservatives' ostensible governing power, and their much more limited popular support, will be especially flagrant where the conservatives are divided on major policy issues, as they are on Europe. One of their most urgent priorities, therefore, should be to introduce some quite modest political and constitutional reforms, to restore the balance between the institutions and rebuild popular confidence in the system. There can be no changing the defining characteristic of the constitution, which is that of a mixed presidential-parliamentary system. As a system this may seem unclear, but the central fact is that it obviously suits the French and has provided government of above-average quality for rather a long time. President Mitterrand's recent initiative, in launching a package of constitutional reforms, has been criticised by the right. But it is bound to become one of the central issues of debate by the new governing majority in parliament, and offers a convenient opportunity for improving the system. One option would be a shortening of the presidential term; another would be a tighter definition of the powers of the president compared with his government. But, however it is done, the essential requirement is for some slight shift of authority and legitimacy in the direction of government and parliament.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 WALK AWAY FROM STREET CRASH-LANDING  </P> <P> A student pilot and his instructor walked away unhurt Monday after their  single-engine airplane lost power at 400 feet and crashed-landed on a street  minutes after takeoff from Fullerton Municipal Airport. No one on the ground  was injured.  </P> <P> The pilot, John Otey, 30, of Anaheim, was flying the Piper Warrior II for an  instrument rating license, police said. He had 200 hours of flying time. Both  the plane and the instructor, Mike Simmon, 21, of Norwalk, are with Aviation  Facilities Inc. of Fullerton, Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen said.  </P> <P> Fullerton Airport Director Rod Murphy said he watched the aircraft from his  office as it took off at 2:30 p.m., then suddenly crash-landed.  </P> <P> "The airplane was operating normally on its departure and had an engine  failure," Murphy said. "The pilot maneuvered to miss houses and buildings and  aimed for the clear area."  </P> <P> The plane glided over a vacant field about a quarter of a mile west of the  runway as it dropped, according to witnesses at the scene. The plane's  propeller sliced a power line as the gray Piper smashed into the ground,  missing a home by about 50 feet and plowing through a white picket fence.  </P> <P> The aircraft then spun sideways across Artesia Boulevard, coming to rest before  the Buena Park Business Center, half a block west of Dale Street.  </P> <P> "I saw the wire come down first thing," said Choong Nam, whose office is  situated just a sidewalk's width from the wrecked airplane. "Suddenly I saw the  back of the crashed airplane. Then two men came out. I can't explain to you how  scary it was."  </P> <P> The cause of the Piper's engine failure was unknown, and the crash is under  investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National  Transportation Safety Board, authorities said.  </P> <P> Otey, the pilot, and his instructor were being questioned Monday afternoon by  the FAA and declined to speak with reporters, said a woman who answered the  telephone at Aviation Facilities.  </P> <P> Otey received praise from several quarters Monday for his maneuvering of the  stricken airplane away from houses and buildings and onto the street.  </P> <P> "I'd say the pilot did one hell of a job," said one crash witness, who declined  to give his name.  </P> <P> "I hear the pilot did good work bringing the plane down," said City Councilman  Don Bankhead, a retired Fullerton police captain elected to the council last  November, who has opposed any airport expansion or jet landings for noise and  safety reasons. "It's very fortunate that they walked away from it."  </P> <P> Damage to the Piper Warrior appeared moderate. The nose cowling was crumpled  and the severed power line was wrapped around the propeller. The landing gear  also had crumpled, apparently on impact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Crashes  </P> <P> The Fullerton Airport has been the site of several crashes in its 63-year  history, the most recent on Sept. 20, when a Piper Cherokee 6 crashed into an  industrial park on approach to the airfield.  </P> <P> A passenger in that plane was seriously injured, suffering a broken pelvis. The  pilot, a part-time flight instructor, suffered moderate injuries.  </P> <P> On Oct. 17, 1987, the pilot of a Piper Cherokee Arrow lost control of his plane  and struck a Buena Park apartment complex. No one else was injured but the  pilot was killed.  </P> <P> In June, 1986, popular radio traffic announcer Bruce Wayne died when his Cessna  Cardinal went down shortly after takeoff from the airport. Five months later, a  plane crashed in the yard of an elementary school on Fern Drive, just 30  minutes after classes ended. There were no injuries.  </P> <P> These and other crashes have sparked residents' opposition to the airport's  operations in recent years.  </P> <P> City officials have pointed out over the years that the airport was built long  before the the neighborhood became a residential area and that those who moved  there did so knowingly and at their own risk.  </P> <P> Referring to the facility's past, airport director Murphy said Monday that no  one has ever been killed on the ground by a crashing airplane. And for an  airport with 170,000 takeoffs and landings a year, he said, its safety record  is sound.  </P> <P> Controversy over the airport has diminished following the defeat of a 1986  referendum that would have banned jets from landing at the airport.  </P> <P> "We've been lucky we haven't had more serious injuries and fatalities," said  Carl Stevenson, one of the organizers behind the failed referendum. "Obviously  people are worried, concerned about planes flying over houses and businesses.  The airport is tucked away in a densely populated area."  </P> <P> But Stevenson added that he does not oppose the airport's continued operation.  </P> <P> "I know everybody who flies out of the airport is concerned about maintenance,"  he said. "I don't mean to imply that anyone is slipshod here. But things break,  no matter how good everyone's efforts are."  </P> <P> Ellen Fortney said she is just happy that the Piper Warrior missed her house,  never mind the picket fence knocked down in her front yard.  </P> <P> Fortney said she was on her way home from work when she saw a helicopter  hovering over her house, leading her to worry that something was wrong.  </P> <P> Standing in front of her home, Fortney said a few other planes have landed in  the field behind her since she moved in 8 years ago. "But this is actually the  closest one that's ever come down."  </P> <P> Even so, the airport doesn't really bother her, Fortney said. Looking across  the street at the ungainly Piper, resting awkwardly on its broken legs, she  said of the two men who escaped injury, "I'm just glad they're all OK."  </P></p>

(``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, its Common Stock, Series A &amp; B Redeemable Common Stock Purchase Warrants are listed on the BSE and quoted in the NASDAQ SmallCap Market under the symbols ``WCII,'' ``WCIIW'' and ``WCIIZ,'' respectively. The Company now seeks to withdraw the securities from listing on the BSE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, the decision to withdraw the securities is based on the limited and sporadic trading activity of the securities on the BSE since the date of listing. The Company's primary trading market has been and continues to be the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. The Company believes that the benefits of remaining listed on the BSE do not outweigh the costs involved in maintaining such listing, since the NASDAQ SmallCap Market represents the primary trading market for the securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before June 13, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

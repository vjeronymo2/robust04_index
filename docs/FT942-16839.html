			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / China tells Balladur French exporters must be more competitive Chinese Premier Li Peng yesterday held out little hope a Sino-French political rapprochement would yield early dividends for French companies seeking opportunities in the cut-throat Chinese market. Mr Li told Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, that while French business was welcome it must be more competitive. Mr Balladur's four-day mission to China is aimed at opening a new chapter in relations after the two sides agreed to put behind them a row over French arms sales to Taiwan. But unlike a high-profile selling mission to China last November by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Balladur's aims are more modest and include refurbishing political relations between fellow permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Mr Balladur's arrival in Beijing was overshadowed by a widening international argument over China's detention of Mr Wei Jingsheng, its most prominent dissident, for interrogation over alleged breaches of parole and 'new crimes'. The episode has provoked sharp exchanges between Beijing and Washington and further complicated President Bill Clinton's decision, due in the next few months, on renewal of China's low tariff access to US markets. China yesterday firmly rebuffed US criticism over Mr Wei's detention with a foreign ministry spokeswoman saying it was 'inappropriate for any foreign country to make irresponsible remarks on this matter'. Earlier the State Department said in Washington that 'the United States very much regrets China has taken this step'. Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, who is with Mr Balladur in Beijing, in an interview with the French daily Liberation was sharply critical of China's human rights behaviour. China's economic development, he said, would eventually 'render the system of repression untenable'. He described human rights progress since the June 1989 massacre of pro-democracy activists as 'insufficient'. French business had hoped Mr Balladur's mission would ease market access after a recent chill prompted by a 1992 deal by the previous French government to allow sale of 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan.</p>

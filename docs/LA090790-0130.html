			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CITY ETHICS MANUAL TO BE DISTRIBUTED  </P> <P> A manual of ethics and values, nearly three years in the making, soon will be  distributed to all City Hall employees.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joanne Coontz began a campaign in 1987 to update the code of  ethics as outlined in a 1972 City Council resolution.  </P> <P> "A resolution is not worth the paper it's written on unless you do something  about it," Coontz said. "A lot of new employees knew nothing" about the ethics  resolution.  </P> <P> Last month, the council adopted a new manual that summarizes the city's ethical  policies and provides a statement of values. The pamphlet will be printed  in-house and distributed to all employees, Coontz said.  </P> <P> "We know that the city is growing and people are coming in from all over who  are not familiar with our city," Coontz said. "I just think people should know  more about the corporation they work for. It's a good thing to pass out to all  employees and all new appointments on commissions and committees."  </P> <P> The pamphlet, which emphasizes honesty, integrity and loyalty, includes a  statement of values and outlines standards of conduct and ethical principals.  The margins of the manual are filled with quotes from leaders and philosophers  such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, John Morley and others.  </P> <P> The manual's "statement of values," a guide designed to provide continuity for  the city's leadership, lists the worth of the individual, effective service,  future planning and individual commitment to public service as high priorities  for all employees.  </P> <P> The manual is drawn from the 1972 code, a values statement used by the city of  Fairfield and a report by the League of California Cities Committee.

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious lack of interest in European law Sir, Two points on your excellent editorial on the need to cut back on the regulatory burdens of business ('First blood in the red tape war', January 20). First, it is curious that there should be a furore in the UK over scrapping regulations without a full debate in Parliament. Many regulations implementing European Community directives were not debated in the house beforehand. I have been monitoring the way in which statutory instruments made under the European Communities Act 1972 go through Parliament. The Public Services Contracts Regulations 1993 which came into force on January 13 1994 were made and laid on December 22 1993, as were the Utilities Supply and Works Contracts (Amendment) Regulations - both while Parliament was in recess. Both are concerned with the controversial public purchasing directives. Second, your idea that there should be a 'new select or standing committee for deregulation . . . to scrutinise ministerial proposals in detail' has merit. I would add that such a committee should also scrutinise proposals for new regulations, especially those which give effect to EC directives. That might help to avoid the over-implementation of things like the 'six-pack' of EC health and safety directives about which the government is rightly concerned. Bryan Cassidy, European Parliament, Strasbourg, France</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Solution sought on copper trading losses The China International Trust and Investment Corporation said yesterday it was committed to a 'reasonable solution' in its dispute with London Metals Exchange copper traders and other creditors over non-payment of copper trading losses totalling Dollars 30m-Dollars 40m. In Citic's first detailed comment on the dispute, which dates back to early this year, a spokesman attributed the problems to dealers associated with the organisation's Shanghai branch acting without the knowledge or authority of Citic itself. Mr Xu Xiwei, a senior adviser to Citic Shanghai, said two dealers and two managers, including the former president, had been charged with corruption and detained. The Citic official, however, did not commit the organisation to a settlement. The official said that this would depend on the outcome of meetings to be held soon in London. But he noted that Citic Shanghai was 'an independent legal entity under the law of China' and was therefore responsible for its own profits and losses. Mr Xu said an international accounting firm had been entrusted with responsibility for investigating the losses and suggesting solutions. 'I sincerely hope all parties concerned will find a reasonable solution through friendly consultation,' Mr Xu said. He blamed creditors, including western banks, for lax procedures in their efforts to assist Citic Shanghai to overcome its trading losses. 'I must regretfully point out that certain foreign counterparts have got some screws loose in their own house,' he said. 'In other words, what they have done has to some extent assisted such a thing happening unintentionally or intentionally.' Mr Xu said that credit had been extended to Citic's Shanghai branch equivalent to 'five or six times' equity. This was done without notifying Citic headquarters, let alone requiring any guarantee from Citic. 'Any counterpart, if he is prudent, should have related extension of credit to Citic Shanghai's capacity and in line with China's relevant laws and regulations governing foreign exchange.'</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rewe buys 26% of Budgens REWE, one of Germany's largest food retailers, has bought a 26 per cent stake in Budgens, a small UK food retailing chain, in a move which could step up the continental European assault on the discount end of British retailing. Rewe is a private company which operates 8,000 stores and has 15 per cent of the German food market. Budgens has 100 supermarkets, mainly in the south-east of England. The German group paid Pounds 23.5m for the Budgens stake to BIL Securities, the New Zealand investment company founded by Sir Ron Brierley. BIL and other institutional investors ousted Budgens' management in 1991 and installed a new German chief executive, Mr John von Spreckelsen. He has brought the struggling chain back to profit, but doubts have persisted about whether the group has a long-term future. Mr Spreckelsen said he would 'look forward to developing the opportunities that will inevitably arise from such a strong European connection'. He said it was too early to say what Rewe intended, but they wanted to be supportive shareholders and there was obvious scope for joint sourcing. The German company will put a representative on the Budgens' board. Rewe currently operates more than 1,400 discount grocery outlets called Penny-Markt, as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets. Several continental European discounters, attracted by the high profit margins available in UK food retailing, have opened stores in the last three years, making discounting the fastest-growing area of the UK food market. Aldi, Germany's largest food discounter, opened its first stores in the UK in 1990, followed quickly by Netto of Denmark. They now have 63 and 45 stores respectively and have announced expansion plans. Carrefour, the French retail giant, opened its first Ed discount store in Maidstone, Kent, in January, and there is speculation in the retail trade that other continental European groups such as Germany's Tengelmann, Lidl &amp; Schwartz, and Norma, are investigating the UK market. Rewe paid BIL 55p each for the stake of 42.78m shares, a significant premium to yesterday's opening price of 46p. Budgens shares closed 3p higher at 49p. BIL paid an average of 32p per share, so it showed a paper profit of about Pounds 10m on its investment. Mr von Spreckelsen, who introduced the New Zealand-based company to Rewe, said: 'BIL has been a very supportive shareholder. Their support for the company, in particular during the restructuring phase in 1991, has been outstanding. This said, we are delighted with Rewe's agreement to purchase and welcome them as new partners.'</p>

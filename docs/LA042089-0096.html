			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS ASSAULT-GUN BAN  </P> <P> Voting 4 to 1, the Lawndale City Council has given preliminary approval to an  ordinance banning the sale of assault weapons.  </P> <P> Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman had urged adoption of such a  law shortly after a Stockton incident in which five schoolchildren were killed  and 29 injured by a gunman with an AK-47 assault rifle.  </P> <P> Councilman Harold E. Hofmann voted against the ban, citing his belief in the  constitutional right to bear arms.  </P> <P> The state Assembly has approved a bill banning the sale of most military-style  assault weapons and severely restricting their possession by private citizens.  That legislation is expected to be put to a state Senate vote today. If  approved, it would supersede the Lawndale law.  </P></p>

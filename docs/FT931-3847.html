			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay improves 41% HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest retailer, surprised the market with a 31 per cent gain in final-quarter profits to push earnings for the year ended January ahead by 41 per cent, Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal. The group benefited from strong Christmas sales, declining cross-border shopping, lower interest costs and a better economy in western Canada. Full-year profits were CDollars 116.7m (USDollars 93.8m) or CDollars 2.32 a share, against CDollars 82.8m or CDollars 1.61 a share. Sales totalled CDollars 5.15bn, up 2 per cent.</p>

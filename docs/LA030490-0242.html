			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS GOAL IS TO SCORE THEM IN WORLD CUP;  </P> <P> SOCCER: WYNALDA MOVES UP FROM DEVELOPMENTAL SQUAD TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR U.S.  NATIONAL TEAM.  </P> <P> His first appearance in a screaming headline occurred 12 years ago when a  Thousand Oaks newspaper stretched this banner across the top of the sports  page: "Eric Wynalda -- Soccer Figure at 8."  </P> <P> At the time, Eric's father, David, was surprised by the headline and felt Eric  really didn't deserve being singled out. Sure, Eric scored 56 goals in leading  his youth soccer team to a state championship season, "but we thought he was  just having fun out there. We didn't see him as special," David says.  </P> <P> However, the reporter who wrote the story accompanying the headline was an  Irish-born soccer expert, David says, "who recognized the things in Eric that  we couldn't see."  </P> <P> Today, it no longer takes a trained eye to determine that Eric is special.  Always a prodigious scorer -- 88 goals in three varsity seasons at Westlake  High and Southern Section 4-A Division offensive player of the year -- Wynalda  is a strong candidate for the U.S. national team that will compete in the World  Cup starting June 10 in Italy.  </P> <P> "Eric is a gifted athlete," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler says.  </P> <P> Currently considered the team's No. 1 striker, Wynalda started at forward in  the last four exhibitions, including a 3-1 loss to the Soviet Union before an  estimated crowd of 61,000 in Palo Alto last week, and just signed a contract  with the U.S. Soccer Federation. His presence in the lineup, Gansler says,  "adds some attacking flair to our team."  </P> <P> But despite Wynalda's scoring skills, his status is surprising -- he wasn't on  the national team until January. While strikers such as Peter Vermes and Brent  Goulet were helping the United States to its stunning performance in World Cup  qualifying last year, Wynalda was playing for the national developmental  B-team. It took six months before Wynalda was able to move up to the big team.  </P> <P> "Eric caught our attention when he was working with the B-team," Gansler says.  "We knew he was a talent."  </P> <P> Gansler wanted Wynalda to join the national team for a game against the Soviets  in Philadelphia last August, but he came down with mononucleosis. The disease  laid him up for two months and prevented his starting the collegiate season on  time at San Diego State. In late December, Gansler called Eric at his parents'  Westlake Village home and asked him to attend a two-week training camp in La  Jolla.  </P> <P> Wynalda, 6-1, 170, with long sandy-colored hair, was one of 28 players Gansler  brought to camp. Most of the country's top strikers -- including some who play  professionally abroad -- were there, but Wynalda stood out "and started to  shine," Gansler says. By the end of camp, Gansler said Wynalda was his top  striker but needed international experience.  </P> <P> Wynalda went to Miami with the national team for the Marlboro Cup matches in  January. But Gansler started a midfielder, Hugo Perez, ahead of Wynalda in the  opening game against Costa Rica, and Perez played the first 45 minutes in a 2-0  loss. Wynalda played the last 15 minutes, "made an impact," he says, and  Gansler told him he had earned a chance to start against Colombia.  </P> <P> Four minutes into the Colombia game, Wynalda, at 20 the youngest starter in the  lineup, took a pass and went in alone on the Colombian goalkeeper, beating him  with a quick shot for the only U.S. goal in a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> But Wynalda doesn't have a lock on a starting job or even a guaranteed backup  role on the World Cup team. Gansler isn't going to name the final 22-man roster  until May, after several more international exhibitions. And, according to  Gansler, Wynalda still needs to improve.  </P> <P> "At times he looks very, very good, and at times he gets caught with his  concentration waning," Gansler says. "Technically he's fine, but he has to get  better on the tactical end of things." Then Gansler adds, "I'm betting that  he's going to get it done."  </P> <P> Wynalda's next test will be March 10 against Finland in Tampa, Fla. "Coach  Gansler always tells us, 'You're only as good as your last performance,' "  Wynalda says. "That saying always goes off in my mind. I know if I have a bad  game he'll give someone else a look."  </P> <P> Most experts say that the problem with American soccer is the lack of skillful  finishers, players who can score goals. Wynalda is a rare exception, says Chuck  Clegg, soccer coach at San Diego State.  </P> <P> "Eric's ability to take on a player one-on-one is the best I've ever seen in an  American," Clegg says. "And to have developed this skill with a purely American  experience is very unusual."  </P> <P> Wynalda learned to play in the American Youth Soccer Organization. When he was  5 and his brother Brandt was 7, they joined an AYSO team coached by their  father. The team's assistant coach was Italian-born Tino Forino, who spoke  little English but knew how to play the European way.  </P> <P> "Eric was inspired by Tino," says David, who owns a soccer specialty shop in  Westlake Village. "The kids didn't understand much of what he was saying, but  he still taught them the basics."  </P> <P> In his junior year at Westlake High, Wynalda was coached by another European, a  former player from Austria named Rudi Fedimeyer, who was studying American  soccer for his doctorate degree. Fedimeyer helped refine Wynalda's techniques,  and by the time Eric enrolled at San Diego State, he was "one of the most  skillful players we've ever had," Clegg says.  </P> <P> Wynalda stayed at San Diego only three seasons. In his freshman year, he scored  the winning goal against UCLA in the NCAA Division I tournament quarterfinal  and led the Aztecs into the final, where they lost to Clemson, 1-0. But last  December, after the season, Wynalda decided to drop out of school and forgo his  senior year of soccer.  </P> <P> Only a handful of Americans currently play first division soccer elsewhere in  the world, but Wynalda made strong connections when he and Aztec teammate  Marcello Balboa played in a farewell game for Brazilian soccer star Zico last  December in Brazil. Wynalda says he has offers to play first-division soccer in  Spain and Holland.  </P> <P> His priority, however, is making the U.S. World Cup team. "I'm very confident  that I can do some very good things for the team," he says. "I think I bring an  element of unpredictability to the attack."  </P> <P> A major underdog in the 24-nation tournament, the United States is grouped with  Czechoslovakia, Austria and host Italy in the opening round. But Wynalda says  the United States is no longer a pushover. He points out that the national team  was 8-18-9 in international games in 1988 and 18-6-3 last year.  </P> <P> "That has a lot to do with the confidence we have in ourselves as a soccer  nation," he says. "We don't go on the field any more trying just to hold our  own. We expect to win and we don't feel overwhelmed. We don't say, 'Oh, we're  playing Brazil,' and panic.  </P> <P> "In the qualifying rounds we proved we could play defense. Now we have to  generate a consistent attack."  </P></p>

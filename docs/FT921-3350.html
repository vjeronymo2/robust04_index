			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Erythronium White Beauty The precise origin of this splendid plant is uncertain but there is no doubt that it is one of the most beautiful of the Trout Lilies which are the North American counterpart of the European dog's-tooth Violets. The white flowers with orange markings at the base of the widely reflexed petals are two inches across and the green leaves are handsomely marbled. The plant grows strongly and carries its flowers well above the leaves, making a magnificent display in spring. It succeeds best in light shade where the soil is deep and rich in humus. The best time to move the bulbs is immediately after flowering, in April or May, lifting and replanting them with plenty of soil around their roots.</p>

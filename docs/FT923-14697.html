			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: World tyre industry 'poised for recovery' THE WORLD tyre industry, with a Dollars 53bn (Pounds 27.7bn) annual turnover, is poised for recovery after making Dollars 1bn collective losses in the past two years, a study* by the Economist Intelligence Unit says. Provided the still-tentative US car market recovery is consolidated, the industry could earn profits above Dollars 1.5bn next year, the study concludes. It forecasts that Bridgestone, Japan's biggest tyre maker, which bought Firestone of the US for Dollars 2.6bn in 1988, will raise its market share in Europe and North America, as Japanese vehicle makers continue to expand their 'transplant' manufacturing operations. Goodyear of the US, already back in profit, will also gain market share in Europe. Michelin of France, with potential to gain ground in the US after its Dollars 750m acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich in 1990, risks losing share in Europe, where it is market leader, Mr Philip Wylie, the report's author, says. The industry's improved financial prospects are seen as largely due to its success in imposing much-needed price rises on the replacement tyre market. 'But it seems likely the original equipment sector will follow as the recession lifts, and vehicle makers have more funds at their disposal.' The industry still has substantial over-capacity. While car production is expected to rise, raising tyre demand over the next few years, this will be partly offset by other factors, among them growing environmental concern, making performance vehicles less attractive and tyre replacement less frequent. * World Tyre Industry: Back from the Brink.

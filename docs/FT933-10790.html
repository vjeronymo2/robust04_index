			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Building materials The possibility of interest rate cuts across Europe is providing a further leg-up for the UK building material sector, which first shinned up the drainpipe when sterling devalued last September. Many building material companies have a big exposure to Germany and France. The hope is that a turn in the economic tide will boost their earnings from the region. But the picture is not as simple as it seems. The German construction market has been decoupled from the rest of the economy. The housing market, in particular, has remained resilient as the stream of immigrants continues and east Germans repair their leaky roofs. The likes of RMC and Redland, are already benefiting. It is not clear that falling interest rates would make much difference. By contrast, the French construction market appears to have slipped off the scaffolding. Housing starts are at their lowest level for 30 years while the rest of the construction market remains depressed. However, the government is attempting to resuscitate activity. Much of the proceeds of the Balladur bond will be sunk into construction. The complicating factor is that last night's decision on currencies may also redraw the competitive map of Europe. UK companies would then lose some of their competitive edge: Pilkington, for example, would face greater pressure from St Gobain. With building materials companies already commanding fat premium ratings there is little headroom for more.</p>

Hasselbach had said that Haider has had personal  contact with the Austrian neo-Nazi scene. FPOe Press Spokesman  Peter Westenthaler: "This is absolute nonsense." FPOe Secretary  General Karl-Heinz Grasser said there never has been any contact  between Haider and the two neo-Nazis Gottfried Kuessel and  Walter Ochensberger. Grasser also said that the FPOe would take  legal action against DER STANDARD and Hasselbach.    However, the FPOe did not object to Hasselbach's book  entitled Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts], where  Kuessel speaks of links between neo-Nazis and the FPOe. FPOe  Secretary General Grasser called Hasselbach's statements a  "complete web of lies."    Reinhart Rohr, Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]  chairman for Carinthia, sees these reports in a different light.  "If Hasselbach's allegations are true," it becomes clear why  Haider should consider the investigations into the letter-bomb  attacks [carried out in Austria last December] "hostile to the  state."    FPOe Deputy Helmut Prasch criticized the fact that the SPOe  seems to attach greater importance to the statement of a  neo-Nazi than to "statements by a democratically elected  Austrian politician."</p>

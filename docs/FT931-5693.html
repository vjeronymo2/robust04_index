			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Guidelines set for unit trusts and derivatives TWO NEW sets of guidelines, from the Securities and Investment Board (SIB) and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO), should smooth the path for unit trust managers who want to use derivative instruments. But no decisions have yet been taken on any substantial reform of regulatory policy in this area: the SIB will deal with the main policy issues surrounding derivatives legislation in a separate consultative document due this spring. Currently, derivative instruments can be used by unit trusts in two ways: firstly, unit trust managers can use derivatives for efficient portfolio management; secondly, under 1991 regulations, derivatives can be used in futures and options funds (Fofs), or geared futures and options funds (GFofs). While a handful of companies have launched Fofs, no GFofs have yet been offered. The unit trust industry has been lobbying for existing legislation to be expanded to allow guaranteed funds, limited issues and performance fees. These issues will be discussed in the second consultative paper due this spring. Mr Philip Warland, director general of the Unit Trust Association, said there was an increasing feeling that Fofs should never have been separated from other unit trusts, which can also use derivatives. Among potential changes was the extension to the EC directive on collective investments to include Fofs. The UK delegation has tabled a proposal to permit funds complying with the directive to undertake tactical asset allocation. Last week's guidance from the SIB and IMRO focuses on the area of efficient portfolio management. IMRO has issued guidance to clarify previous recommendations on the use of index derivatives, regarding congruence between the components of the index and the stocks in the portfolio. IMRO stops short of recommending any target for correlation, but recommends a procedure for fund managers to follow in deciding what index derivative trading is appropriate.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LEFT-HANDED CHECKBOOK FOR LEFTY  </P> <P> What do you give a left-handed person who has nearly everything? A left-handed  checkbook.  </P> <P> Australia's Bank of Melbourne has started issuing left-handed checkbooks, the  bank's chief executive said today.  </P> <P> Christopher Stewart estimated that about 30% of the bank's 800,000 customers  are left-handed.  </P> <P> "One day I saw my No. 2 man, who is left-handed, trying to sign a check. It was  clumsy," Stewart said. "The next week we got a letter from a left-handed  customer complaining about the checkbooks so we decided to do something about  it."  </P> <P> The difference between a right-handed and left-handed book is that a  left-handed book's spine is on the right.  </P></p>

It was decided that the republic will be allocated  more than $1 billion this year to continue economic reform.    Kazakhstan's main "donors" were the IMF, the International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Asian banks, and a  number of states. For instance, $220 million was allocated by  the Japanese Government. The European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development has granted a 100 million-ECU [European currency  unit] targeted loan for the financing of small and medium-sized  enterprises.    The loans are being provided to Kazakhstan on favorable  terms. For instance, the IMF loans are repayable over 17 years  at an annual interest rate of 7 percent. Interest only will be  paid for the first five years.    These facts were cited by Kazakhstani President Nursultan  Nazarbayev in an interview with the newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA  PRAVDA.</p>

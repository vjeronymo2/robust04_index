			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Now There Is a Crusade in Defense of the Real"] </F>   [Text] Ricupero is a fervent Catholic but likes a  good fight. In his opinion, the desire to avoid conflict serves  only to delay change.    So the man is Rubens Ricupero, a practicing Catholic whom  many Brazilians first got to know under unusual circumstances: a  foot-washing ceremony during Holy Week. His first statement upon  being named minister of finance brought good news. "Spending is  banned," he said, repeating the famous phrase by former  President Tancredo Neves. Chances seem good that the ban is  genuine. "As an admirer of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Ricupero will  find it very difficult to lie," says Deputy Delfim Netto. "Lying  is not a sin in Marxism, but to Saint Thomas it is a capital  offense."    Hours before being sworn in in the vast reception hall on  the  third floor of Planalto Palace, Ricupero told Nely Caixeta,  EXAME's editor in Brasilia, what was going through his head.  Here is some of what he said:    The Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan: "It is the first plan  in Brazilian history to be concerned with ensuring smooth  operations during the first year of the following  administration. We want to have everything solved by 1995, but  without the structural reforms now pending, it will be difficult  to ensure the success of the plan."    Inflation: "Without stability and balance in the public  accounts, there is no salvation. Why is it that in Latin  America, we are the only ones who have not managed to eliminate  inflation? Is it because we have a kind of genetic flaw or is it  because our institutions and, basically, the Constitution render  us incapable of making decisions?"    Privatization: "This is an issue we cannot avoid. The fact  is  that in coming years, the government-owned firms are going to  require very big investments. But the government has no way of  investing because it stopped saving a long time ago."    Wages: "The idea of a wage trigger makes no sense whatever  because it means betting that the plan will fail. Look at those  proposals for raising the minimum wage to $100. Who is going to  pay the salaries for the municipality of Sao Raimundo Nonato in  southern Piaui? Deputy Paulo Paim?"    Elections: "It is in the interest of all the candidates that  the stabilization program be successful. Anyone gambling on the  idea that the worse things are the better is going to inherit a  probably ungovernable country. It will be a Pyrrhic victory."    Employment: "First of all, it is necessary to eliminate  inflation, because employment is the result of investment. We  also must reduce the costs imposed by legislation and create  incentives to generate well-paid jobs."    "Personal crusade": It is ideas like those that have made  Ricupero's appointment a welcome one. "I have confidence in the  minister, and I hope he will be able to implement the economic  plan," says Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the  Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries. "He is a serious man  and a competent politician." For his part, Ricupero claims that  his intention is to continue with the plan, work with the team  set up by Fernando Henrique, and combat inflation. "The plan  will work if every citizen and every member of the  administration views it as a personal crusade," he says.    The minister's objective is to clear the path as soon as  possible for the adoption and consolidation of the real. Issues  such as privatization, for example, will probably not receive  his immediate attention, although Ricupero agrees that the  government-owned firms need to change hands. While the economic  team holds internal debates on the best time to introduce the  new currency and the mechanisms it will adopt for stabilization  and conversion, Ricupero is preparing to negotiate with the  National Congress. On the immediate agenda is approval of this  year's budget and of the provisional measure creating the real.  The minister also wants to breathe new life into constitutional  reform, which is threatening, as it blunders from one obstacle  to the next, to turn into one of the biggest fiascoes in the  history of the legislative branch. By the beginning of January,  when he relinquishes his post to the minister appointed by the  next administration, Ricupero hopes to leave office with the new  currency consolidated, the budget coordinated, and inflation  down.    Replacing a minister like Fernando Henrique will not be an  easy task for this descendant of Italian immigrants who was born  in Bras, Sao Paulo, and likes to listen to chamber music by  Mahler or Brahms. After all, his predecessor was able to leave  office to the sound of applause even though the figures  reflecting his time in office were not favorable. The country  was growing by 4.5 percent per year when Fernando Henrique took  over the ministry, but has now slowed to 2.5 percent per year.  During that same period, annual inflation jumped from 2,700  percent to 7,200 percent. "If I, Delfim, or Simonsen had gotten  the country into that situation, we most certainly would have  been flayed on the public square," says Deputy and former  Minister Roberto Campos. Delfim Netto agrees, saying: "What is  most incredible is that the National Confederation of Industry  and Brazilian Federation of Banks approve."    Affable, a good storyteller, and regarded as the best  official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he impresses his  listeners with his knowledge of contemporary Brazilian and  foreign problems, especially those in the area of international  trade. He has served abroad for a total of 20 years. Like  Fernando Henrique, Ricupero possesses a solid humanist  background. In Brasilia, where he lives in one of the two  mansions still owned by the government on the Peninsula of  Ministers on South Lake, he follows the custom of another former  minister of finance, Marcilio Marques Moreira. On Sunday  mornings, he attends the mass celebrated at the Sao Bento  Monastery. Alongside his wife Marisa, a teacher to whom he has  been married for 33 years, he sings Gregorian chants in Latin.  To obtain an interview with the minister, reporter Angela  Coronel of EXAME's Brasilia office had to go to great lengths.  Angela attended the Maundy Thursday Mass at the monastery at  Ricupero's side. She then accompanied him in the procession that  followed. Finally, an interview was arranged, and as they  parted, Ricupero said: "This country needs God."    Impulsiveness: Ricupero seems to be the typical official cut  out for government service: one of those people who try to  acquit themselves well on any mission, whether as the country's  representative at GATT in Geneva, as ambassador to Washington,  or -- it is hoped -- as minister of finance. He regards as  pointless the warnings that he will have to get along with a  president of the republic who is given to impulsive behavior.  "Our thinking coincides," he says, citing as proof his support  for Itamar during the episode in connection with the conversion  of salaries to URV's [real units of value] in the judicial  branch. He saw nothing wrong in the president's demonstrated  willingness to stand up to the Supreme Court justices. "There is  something in Brazilian culture that makes people dread facing up  to conflicts," Ricupero says. "It is that desire to avoid  conflict which caused us to be the last country to abolish  slavery and which is hampering changes such as those represented  by constitutional revision." Although using different words,  Ricupero is thereby endorsing one of the most revealing ideas  held by the former prime minister of Great Britain, Margaret  Thatcher, regarding the art of governing: the idea that  consensus is the negation of leadership.</p>

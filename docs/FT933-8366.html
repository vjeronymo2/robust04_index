			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: United Airlines files complaint UNITED Airlines, the large Chicago-based carrier, has filed a complaint against the Australian government with the US Department of Transportation, alleging the Australian authorities have 'unlawfully restricted' the airline's proposed new New York-Tokyo - Sydney service, writes Nikki Tait in New York. United has been seeking for several years to fly the north Pacific route, a service which it argues is permitted under the bilateral aviation agreement between the countries.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza shares fall on warning Shares in Canadian Pizza, which floated in November last year, fell 6p to 83p yesterday after the pizza and pizza crust maker issued its second profits warning of the year. Forecast pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 have been reduced from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.3m. The shares are now worth only 42 per cent of their flotation price of 200p. Mr Reg Bolton, finance director, said that revenues were lower than expected because of delays with four of the nine new UK retail customers it had won this year. The company also faces a charge of Pounds 133,000 due to the early retirement of Mr Harry Kent, the 67-year-old deputy chairman and co-founder. In April the company issued a profits warning after its biggest client, J Sainsbury, which accounted for 25 per cent of turnover, withdrew a large part of its business. Mr Bolton said: 'We have not been able to fill the gap left by the lost Sainsbury business in the timescale we had hoped.' The company also said that it had abandoned plans to build a new manufacturing base in continental Europe. All exports of pizza crusts will continue to be sourced from the Salford factory.</p>

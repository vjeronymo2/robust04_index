			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (6): On the way to speedier settlements - Crest Crest, the Bank of England, insists, is not an acronym and has no meaning. But in giving this catchy name to the electronic settlement system that is intended to fill the gap left by the Stock Exchange's collapsed Pounds 400m Taurus project, has the Bank taken risks with the image? After all, when you pass the crest you go downhill. Last month a task force set up by the Bank in July issued a working paper describing the design principles of Crest. After a period for consultation, a final specification is due by May next year. Crest will be a stripped-down electronic settlement system, minus some of the complexity which rendered Taurus unworkable. It is due to be introduced in 1996. Even before that, however, important improvements in the settlement of London Stock Exchange transactions are set to take place. By beefing up the existing (but old-fashioned) Talisman system used by market makers it is intended to speed up the creaking settlement system which still operates according to a fortnightly account basis. The provisional timetable is that 10-day rolling settlement will be introduced by July 1994, and five-day settlement by January 1995. This would still leave London settlement some way short of the three-day rolling basis which is the international standard proclaimed by a Group of 30 committee. That would have to await the full implementation of Crest. However, the latest initiative has already run into the same kinds of snags which delayed and finally derailed Taurus. There were protests in August, for instance, from the Institutional Fund Managers' Association which said that its members - the biggest users of the London Stock Exchange - were seriously under-represented on the Crest committee, which instead was packed with representatives of custodian banks and registrar banks. Some institutions are openly sceptical of whether the transitional Talisman-based scheme can meet its targets. Mr Michael Robarts, director of administration at Fleming Investment Management, says that the move to five-day settlement within little more than a year will prove impractical. 'We don't believe that it will be feasible in a paper-based system,' he says. 'It is inevitable that backlogs will develop, especially among some of the smaller custodians and registrars. An awful lot of paper has to be passed around.' His potential disaster scenario is that accelerated rolling settlement will be introduced on a flawed basis, and then Crest will fail to appear for some unforeseen technical reason. In any case, other pessimists reckon that Crest will take five years to be introduced rather than the official three. Certainly, if the move to five-day settlement is to be successful, paper will have to move around between custodians and registrars at considerable speed, and the electronic payment and trade reporting networks which have recently developed will need to be able to interface without hitches. At some point an unacceptable level of settlement failures would occur, and it would be important for the authorities to back off before this stage was reached. Another somewhat controversial area is stock lending, an activity which is likely to expand when rolling settlement is introduced and the market makers will have less time to cover their positions. Some fund managers believe that the traditional collateral, consisting of short-term Talisman certificates, is not acceptable for pension funds. Sceptics remember that even the existing two-week account system caused tremendous problems in 1987 as volume soared in the months ahead of the Black Monday crash. So the five-day settlement target under Talisman remains in doubt. This is accepted by some on the task force, while among the big brokers some fear privately that up to 40 per cent of trades would fail on a five-day cycle, at least on the basis of present experience. Nevertheless, the big investors and their brokers accept the need for a speeding up of the settlement process. Private clients see it differently, because they may be required to deposit money with their brokers, and may find themselves forced to run their investments through brokers' nominee services; this would break their direct links to the companies they invest in and expose them to possible default risks should the brokers get into administrative or financial trouble. As for Crest, it is true that the Bank of England has a track record of building electronic settlement systems, notably its system for the gilt-edged market, which operates on the basis of next-day settlement. But an equity system is inherently much more complicated, given the need to cope with rights issues, takeover bids and various special situations. There are also many registrars to be dealt with, rather than just one as in the case of the Central Gilts Office. Nobody will be confident that Crest will work satisfactorily unless the design is kept simple. The critical point may be the so-called name-on-register requirement that may have been the straw that broke the back of Taurus: vociferous companies insisted that the original design should be changed so that a full list of investors would appear on their shareholder registers. This is also known as the designation issue. It would greatly simplify the structure of the new electronic system if identification of individual shareholdings were confined to the custodian's records and did not have to be repeated externally on the company register. However, the Crest working paper leaves this issue open: a Crest member's pooled account might be designated as a number of smaller accounts on the register. The Bank of England says simply that designation should be available if users are prepared to pay for it. But some institutions fear that too many pension scheme trustees will insist on designation for security reasons, and the system may become overloaded. The Goode Committee on pension law reform looked at the security arguments for external designation, but decided that with Crest in the offing it would not be desirable to make external designation compulsory. It remains to be seen whether lobbying by British companies nervous of losing track of suspicious changes in the ownership of their shares will once again block attempts to adopt a simplified approach.</p>

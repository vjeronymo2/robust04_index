Sanchez, who stated  the attack was "carefully planned," told EFE that Rene del Pozo  was beaten a number of times in the head, abdomen, and back, and  needed to be treated for bruises at Havana's surgical hospital.    According to Sanchez, in the past two weeks, Rolando Pages  and Elizardo San Pedro, two other activists of the most moderate  group of internal dissidents, were the target of similar attacks  "always under strange circumstances," and had to be taken to  hospitals. In his opinion, these are "repressive and  intimidatory actions by the Cuban Government's political police  against peaceful citizens who want to express their disagreement  with the continuous violations of civil and political rights."</p>

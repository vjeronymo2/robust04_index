			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Europe's parliament European Union institutions often face justifiable criticism for lack of transparency in decision-making. One of the bodies best placed to address this problem is the European Parliament, but the public doubts its effectiveness. That is one reason why, in most EU countries, the turnout in the election for the Strasbourg assembly on June 9 and 12 will probably be much lower than in national polls. In fact, as a result of the Single European Act that came into force in 1987 and the Maastricht treaty, the power of the 518 (soon to be 567) MEPs in many cases exceeds that of members of national parliaments. With the ability to determine Europe-wide legislation, vet both the European Commission and Council of Ministers and check the EU budget, Europe's transnational assembly demands to be taken seriously. At the same time, the rules governing the parliament's own operations need to be tightened. If it wants public sympathy in its campaign for a more directly democratic EU, the parliament will have to correct its own shortcomings. At present, the parliament offers a case study in unwieldiness, due only in part to the inevitable problems of linking 12 states' diverse political cultures. Efficiency is constrained and costs increased by MEPs' need to peregrinate between plenary sessions in Strasbourg and committee meetings in Brussels. Higher profile The parliament's difficulties have often reflected national governments' unwillingness to allow it to undermine national parliaments. However, during the next five-year legislature period, it will have a much higher profile. Already, around 2,000 MEPs' amendments relating to single market legislation have passed into law. Under Maastricht, the parliament shares 'co-decision' power with the Council of Ministers. It can veto most measures passed by qualified majority voting, in fields ranging from consumer protection and vocational training to health and research. In a fresh sign of its importance, the parliament is due to decide tomorrow whether to accept the formula for EU voting planned when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join. It would be both unwise and regrettable if MEPs risked delaying an enlargement timetable which commands widespread support within the EU, but which is politically sensitive in the applicant countries. The parliament is, however, on stronger ground in seeking confirmation hearings with nominees for the new Commission due to take office next year and is playing a welcome part in efforts launched by the Dutch to reduce secrecy in EU ministerial discussions. Credibility In its supervisory or watchdog role, the parliament can have a beneficial impact in promoting transparency, controlling EU bureaucracies and curbing over-spending, including that linked to fraud. But these efforts will command little credibility while evidence persists of parliament's own mismanagement. Responsibility for the wastefulness of the Brussels-Strasbourg Euroshuttle lies largely with the French government, which has constantly opposed siting the parliament in its logical home, the Belgian capital. Nonetheless, the parliament is partly to blame for the cost over-runs on its new building in Brussels and for the plan to create an expensive new chamber in Strasbourg. Independent inquiries into both affairs are urgently required. Among necessary procedural reforms, the parliament must widen timely dissemination of its often valuable committee work. It must also try to ensure a more cohesive framework for its debates and for the ensuing votes. Possible moves to crack down on absenteeism might include suspension or expulsion of MEPs. Equally, given its influence over EU legislation, the parliament needs firmer rules for disclosure of members' links with outside companies. To reinforce the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions, it is healthy that the parliament is acquiring and using extra muscle. But there is also a need to scrutinise the scrutineer. Only if it respects the principles of probity and openness in the conduct of EU affairs can the parliament hope to safeguard them. Without a better reputation, the parliament will fail to engage the interest and to win the trust of Europe's voters.</p>

The first is  that the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform  Grouping [YRG], the two northern partners in the ruling  coalition, implement the Pledge and Accord Document in  accordance with the interpretation and the measures agreed on by  the YSP and the opposition, regarding which the GPC and the YRG  still have some reservations or objections; or, that there be a  return to the situation obtaining prior to 22 May 1990 and an  announcement of the end of the unity experiment.    The sources said that Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-Shawarib,  deputy prime minister for internal affairs and member of the  Political Forces' Dialogue Committee, which drafted the Pledge  and Accord Document, late last month offered the YSP leadership  the federation option as a way out of the crisis, along the same  lines suggested last October by Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP  assistant secretary general and Presidential Council member, but  the party's Political Bureau rejected that option on the grounds  that that suggestion had been overtaken by the recent military  confrontations in Abyan and H rft Sufyan.

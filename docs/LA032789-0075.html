			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Tom Kirby, who has been president and general manager of Gannett-owned KOCO-TV  in Oklahoma City, takes over today as executive producer of "USA Today on TV."  It's the second major management change in recent months for the syndicated  magazine series that's produced by GTG, a partnership between Grant Tinker and  Gannett. Earlier, Jim Bellows, a former Los Angeles newspaper executive, was  called in as managing editor to resuscitate the show following its debut last  September. Bellows will continue as a consultant. With the changing of the  guard, Grant Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, assured the "USA-TV" staff  that the program will remain on the air for its two-year commitment. He called  Bellows "a brilliant editor . . . (who has) completed the task of reshaping the  show and giving it new direction." Said Bellows: "I came in to do what they  wanted and I did it. The show has a good, long future, and I feel good about  the show." ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

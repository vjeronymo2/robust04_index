			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Another Effort"] </F>   [Text] The people were doubly insulted by the deputies's  inopportune decision to hike their own salaries and by the fact  that the legislative and judicial branches have found a way to  make money when converting their salaries into URV's [Real Value  Unit].    They now find that, under the same impetus, Congress has  rejected the salary equity draft bill for public servants by  rejecting the president of the Republic's veto on the article  that provides for exorbitant salaries for public servants.    Federal Administration Minister Romildo Canhim has many  reasons to be disgusted about this: it has now become almost  impossible to administer public servants without stirring up a  storm among them. The problem now is not only that salaries are  not equitable but that the "maharajas" [public servants who  enjoy privileges] have become an institution.    This disappointment also affects the common Brazilian  citizen  who cannot understand such a lack of sensibility regarding  common wellbeing.    The foundation of a state of law is ethical, not juridical,  nor formal -- because it is based on the principle that we are  all equal before the law -- but the developments of this past  week seem to suggest the opposite: The law is more generous to  those who draft it.    This frightening and contradictory peculiarity also appears  to be preventing the continuation of the constitutional reform,  which thus hinders the approval of lasting solutions to the  serious problems affecting the country.    For instance, when Congress debates whether or not to  maintain the compulsory vote, one can only see the intention not  to change, by any means, the legislators' life -- because the  compulsory vote is an important component in the mechanisms that  move the old electoral windmills: which are fueled by money and  inertia.    Group interests is an evil that can surface in any society:  consolidated interests exist everywhere and they are always  looking for ways to perpetuate themselves.    But the problem becomes tragic when, in a country like  Brazil, group interests become established precisely on the road  of basic changes for the entire society, especially affecting  the most needy, the most hard up sectors due to retrograde  structures.    In view of the discouragement created by recent voting  sessions, those who favored postponing the constitutional reform  will side with those who are against it -- this latter group  includes those who uphold their own interests and those who  uphold ideologies.    To postpone the reform would be illogical as well as a  defeat  in the legislative field because the creation of the Social  Emergency Fund was only juridically possible because a date for  concluding the congressional reform had been set. Time is  running out and it is hoped that responsible sectors of Congress  will make a collective effort for the sake of the most  elementary sense of duty to use the time left well.    The worst that can happen is that this effort will only  serve  to show the electors who is worthy of their vote.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Clinton accused of draft dodging GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose presidential campaign was thrust on to the defensive by allegations of adultery, yesterday faced charges that he dodged the draft during the Vietnam War. Although Mr Clinton dismissed the charges as 'old news', similar charges dogged Vice President Dan Quayle during the 1988 election campaign and may not be so easily brushed aside. The Arkansas governor is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the latest controversy comes less than two weeks before the February 18 New Hampshire primary election, the crucial first test of the 1992 campaign. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Mr Clinton promised in 1969 to enter a reserve officers' training programme (ROTC) at the University of Arkansas, enabling him to secure a deferment from the draft. However, Mr Clinton, then a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and one of the outstanding students in his state, backtracked on his promise, failing to enter either the University of Arkansas or the ROTC. On his return from England, he entered Yale University. By that time, the draft laws had changed and a draft lottery existed. Mr Clinton's number, based on his birthday, was 311; since no-one with a higher number than 195 was called to service in Vietnam, Mr Clinton, like many privileged young men of his generation, escaped combat duty. In 1988, Mr Quayle was accused of using political influence to secure a place in the Indiana National Guard. Unlike Mr Quayle, however, Mr Clinton came from a poor family in the south and prospered because of his academic ability. Mr Clinton, campaigning in New Hampshire, said: 'This is an old story that was widely reported in 1978 and has been regularly recycled by the Republicans.' Until yesterday he appeared to have weathered a storm over accusations by a former cabaret singer that he engaged in a 12-year-affair while Arkansas governor.</p>

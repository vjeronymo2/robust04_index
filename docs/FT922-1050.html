			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: French public-sector chiefs face review THE French cabinet is today expected to decide the fate of the chairmen of a number of leading state-owned companies as their three-year mandates come up for review. Very few of them are expected to lose their jobs, with the notable exception of the chairman of Bull, the loss-making computer group. The government yesterday announced that Mr Bernard Pache, the chairman of Charbonnages de France, would succeed Mr Francis Lorentz as Bull's chief. The government wants to ensure management continuity where possible. It needs to avoid worrying other shareholders while it is selling minority stakes in state companies to fund its employment policies. It also needs to be cautious because many state-controlled groups are forging alliances with foreign partners. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the civil and defence electronics group since 1982, was yesterday proposed for re-selection by his board, putting an end to recent speculation over his future. During his tenure, Mr Gomez has trimmed Thomson's activities from 23 disparate businesses to three core businesses - defence systems, home audio-visual products and semiconductors. He also launched a series of ambitious international acquisitions. Thomson is currently attempting to take over the missiles division of LTV, the US steel and industrial group, against intense political resistance in the US. Confirmation of Mr Gomez's reappointment by the cabinet should be automatic, making him one of the longest-serving state industry chiefs and one of the few to keep his job since the round of nationalisations 10 years ago. The government is also expected to reappoint Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine; Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging group; and Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, who has already been proposed by his own board. Other nominations expected include the top jobs at the banks Credit Lyonnais, Banque Hervet, Compagnie Financiere du CIC, Union Europeene and Societe Marseillaise de Credit.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Daf shares suspended ahead of funding statement TRADING in Daf, the lossmaking Dutch truckmaker, was suspended yesterday on the Amsterdam stock exchange ahead of the unveiling today of a recovery plan which is expected to involve the provision of further credit from the company's bankers based on a promise of support by the Dutch state. Daf, which declined to give any details of the plan, said it had asked the stock exchange to suspend trading in its shares until after the plan is released in mid-afternoon. Daf closed on Friday at Fl 7.20. The Dutch government would not be drawn on whether it planned to take a stake in the company as part of efforts to provide more capital. The government already owns a small indirect stake in Daf through the chemicals group DSM, which holds 5.9 per cent of Daf's shares and which is itself 31 per cent state-owned. British Aerospace is Daf's biggest foreign shareholder with a stake of 10.9 per cent. Other shareholders include ABN Amro Bank, the company's 'house' bank, and insurance companies Aegon and ING.</p>

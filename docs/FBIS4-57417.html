			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, the party of  Joaquin Balaguer, current president and candidate for  reelection, described as "insolent" the Socialist International  (SI) observers who attended Monday's elections. On a television  program, Angel Lockward, spokesman of Balaguer's Social  Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), criticized Chilean Luis Ayala,  president of the SI, who last night described the irregularities  observed in the general elections as "grave and serious."  Lockward criticized the lack of respect shown by "some  foreigners" and said that "none of them have the right to meddle  in local politics."    The PRSC indicated that the SI observers were invited by the  social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party of Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez, the main opposition candidate. He added  that the observers his party invited have remained respectful,  without making statements.</p>

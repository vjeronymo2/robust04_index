			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) has called on the parties to the  wage negotiations to reduce wages for less qualified work. A  low-wage sector might contribute to reducing high unemployment  in Germany, Rexrodt stated in Bonn today. It is not a question  of taking away something from those who have low incomes but of  improving the opportunities for those who have no jobs. Low  wages in certain spheres might be an initial step.    "In the long run, the current unemployment level is  unacceptable," Rexrodt stressed. He referred to U.S.  experiences. A total of 36 million jobs have been created there  in the low-wage sphere in the past 11 years. In Europe, the  number was only 8 million, despite the larger population.    Distributing work in a different way, as demanded by the  Social Democratic Party of Germany, is a naive proposal. The  unemployment problem can only be solved if the labor market  becomes more flexible. In the future, working hours will have  to be adapted to the individual needs and requirements of the  enterprises. Flexible wage agreements are necessary to achieve  that. If the system of area wage contracts is maintained, a  "wide margin for individual company regulations" must be offered.    Rexrodt described the planned permission for private  employment agencies a "mosaic stone in creating a more flexible  labor market." Small private employment agencies will be able to  fulfill the task more efficiently than the labor offices of the  large Federal Employment Office. The advantage of private  agencies is that they "know the people and the enterprises round  the corner."    A poll carried out by the Chamber of Industry and Trade in  Koblenz among enterprises in this region, which the chamber and  Rexrodt presented jointly, revealed that about three-quarters of  the companies polled would use private employment agencies.    Of the 2,700 enterprises that received questionnaires,  approximately 1,400 replied. Two-thirds stated that their needs  have never or seldom been covered by the labor offices. Larger  enterprises were a little less dissatisfied than smaller ones.  The majority of companies would also be willing to pay up to  three monthly salaries for private employment agencies, the  executive manager of the Koblenz Chamber of Trade and Industry,  Hans-Juergen Podzun, stressed. The price will be determined by  the market.</p>

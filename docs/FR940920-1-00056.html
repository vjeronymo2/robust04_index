			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Markets for recycled materials are critical to the success of recycling, and this has been recognized both here and abroad. In the United States, States have been creative in developing a variety of nonregulatory approaches to spur markets. These include several measures to help start new businesses using recovered materials and to help existing businesses convert to the use of recovered materials, such as: (1) Information and technical assistance, (2) financing assistance, (3) direct financial assistance, (4) tax breaks (i.e., credits and exemptions), and (5) ``buy recycled'' programs to encourage the purchase of goods made from recovered materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA continues to be instrumental in enhancing markets for goods from recycled materials. In an effort to position the Federal community in a leadership role, the EPA is providing guidelines to assist Federal procurement agencies in buying increasing quantities of goods made from recovered materials. In October 1993, an Executive Order was signed by the President of the United States directing Federal agencies to procure goods made from recovered materials, harnessing the purchasing power of the Federal community to strengthen markets for these materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are substantial public and private sector efforts underway across the nation to foster markets for recycled goods. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade has recently announced that by late 1994 they will add recyclable plastics and glass to their listing of commodities. From these efforts, the demand for recovered materials will grow to complement the increasing supply of materials diverted from the solid waste stream as more communities implement the ISWM approach. This diversion will impact the characteristics of the remaining portion of the waste stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposed Materials Separation Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The design of any element of an ISWM system, whether a landfill or an MWC, must necessarily reflect the impact of the other elements. To provide for proper sizing and other elements of the landfill or MWC design, it is important to consider current and projected waste generation rates and the impact of source reduction and diversion on the character of the remaining waste stream that serves as the MWC feedstock. Today's proposal is consistent with and complements the ISWM approach by providing for an assessment of the impact of materials separation on municipal waste combustion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under today's proposal, prior to applying for a permit to construct a new MWC, the owner or operator of the MWC would be required to submit a materials separation plan for public review and comment. Today's proposal would require the materials separation plan to be applicable to the area served by the MWC. No rigid performance levels, specification of separation system design, or designation of materials to be separated are specified in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal allows the materials separation plan to be tailored to the service area, considered in the design of the new MWC, and reviewed by the public prior to construction of the MWC. The materials separation plan may be optimized for the entire service area, so that certain subareas may have materials separation requirements while other subareas may not have materials separation requirements. This approach is fully consistent with EPA's ISWM goals for both MWC's and landfills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency invites comments regarding the proposed materials separation plan requirements, including suggestions of alternative approaches. A definition of ``materials separation plan'' has been included in the definitions section (&sect;60.51b) of the proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above requirements for a materials separation plan are being proposed only for new MWC's and are not being proposed for existing MWC's. The MWC industry has made impressive progress in implementing materials separation programs at existing MWC's, and this should be encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Public Meeting and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed NSPS requires that the MWC owner or operator make the materials separation plan available to the public in the service area where the affected facility is to be constructed. As part of making this information available to the public, the MWC owner or operator would be required to distribute a preliminary draft materials separation plan to all public libraries in the affected service area and to publish a notification of the public meeting in the principal newspaper(s) serving the area where the MWC will be sited and where the waste will be collected. The MWC owner or operator would then be required to hold a public meeting and accept comments on the preliminary draft materials separation plan. The public meeting would be required to be held in the county where the MWC is to be constructed and would be required to be scheduled 30 days or more after making the materials separation plan available to the public and publishing the notification of the public meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Paramount receives fresh takeover bids Viacom, the cable television company, and QVC Network, the television shopping business, both submitted fresh takeover offers yesterday to Paramount Communications, the entertainment company which has put itself up for auction. Paramount did not disclose the value of the two proposals submitted by the 4pm deadline that had been set for bidders' best offers, but said that the board would evaluate each of them. Late in the afternoon QVC said its plan to announce the value of its bid had been blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the securities industry. It added that it was still negotiating with the SEC and might be able to announce the offer later in the day. Viacom declined to comment on whether it would reveal its bid. The Paramount board is expected to meet today to review the bids and will eventually recommend one of them, though shareholders will be free to accept whichever one they choose. Before last night's developments, QVC had a bid on the table worth around Dollars 10bn and Viacom one of Dollars 9.6bn. Just 24 hours before the deadline Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, issued a strong defence of controversial purchases of his company's stock in recent months - some by a private company he owns and some by an investment firm in which he holds a stake. Mr Redstone's statement appeared designed to reassure the board of Paramount and Wall Street of the value of Viacom's stock, which is likely to form part of the company's revised bid. There has been speculation in the US media that the share purchases could have helped bolster Viacom's share price. Viacom said, however, that 'rather than inflating the price of Viacom securities, the more legitimate inquiry is whether the repeated, inaccurate and misinformed publication of rumours and innuendo has served the agenda of QVC by damaging the reputation of Viacom's management and by artificially damaging the market price of Viacom stock.' It added that investments in Viacom by Mr Redstone's private company, National Amusements, had taken place in the period preceding the announced merger with Viacom and were part of a well-publicised market purchase programme which had been in effect for six years.</p>

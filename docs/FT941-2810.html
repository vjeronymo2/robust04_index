			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Qantas in the black at half-time Sharply-reduced interest charges and higher passenger volumes have allowed Qantas, the state-owned Australian airline in which British Airways holds a 25 per cent interest, to announce an after-tax profit of ADollars 71.6m (USDollars 51m) for the six months ended December. This compares with a ADollars 365.5m loss in the same period of the previous year, but the 1992-93 figure was struck after ADollars 433.2m of abnormal items, primarily write-offs and restructuring expenses arising from the merger of Qantas, traditionally Australia's international carrier, with Australian Airlines, the large domestic airline. There were no abnormal items in the latest set of figures. Qantas said yesterday that operating profit, before tax and abnormals, rose from ADollars 33.8m to ADollars 100.5m, with total operating revenues standing at ADollars 3.46bn, against ADollars 3.44bn. Even this comparison, however, was muddied because Australian was included for only four months in 1992, compared with the full six months last time. If Australian had been included for the full six months in 1992, Qantas estimated that the most recent figures would have shown a 10.3 per cent rise in revenues and an increase in operating profits from ADollars 27.6m to the ADollars 100.5m figure. Qantas described the results as 'creditable,' but admitted that operating yields had fallen on both domestic and international operations, hitting profitability. Staff-related costs increased 'significantly', while fuel costs rose in line with the increase in available seat kilometres - up 8.7 per cent on international routes and 11.1 per cent on domestic. Net interest costs, by contrast, fell very significantly, to ADollars 38.3m from ADollars 122.3m. This follows the recapitalisation of the group and the injection of the British Airways investment in February 1993. Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman, warned yesterday that the seasonal downturn in traffic during the current six months would mean that the second-half results are weaker than those just reported. 'I would expect something less than the first-half result in the current period,' he said.</p>

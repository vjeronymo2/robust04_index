			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis Pounds 104,000 midterm TAKING in interest receivable, the Chrysalis Group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 104,000 in the six months ended February 28 1992. The depressed market for amusement machines continued to seriously undermine the trading of MAM Leisure, and results for the full year were likely to be dominated by that subsidiary. The directors said there would be continuing operating losses and very substantial one-off costs associated with the restructuring of that company, in particular from the write-down expected to stem from the review of the depreciation policy. Elsewhere in the group there were 'many encouraging signs' with improved profit contributions from the music and television divisions. For the 1991-92 comparative half year the group has complied with FRS 3. The accounts show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.6m, which included an Pounds 11.6m profit on the sale of shares in the Chrysalis record companies. Turnover in 1992-93 was Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 38m) and operating losses Pounds 853,000 (Pounds 913,000). Earnings per share were 0.2p (38.9p).</p>

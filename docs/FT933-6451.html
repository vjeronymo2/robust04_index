			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: The Bundesbank sticks It has taken financial markets a long time to understand that the collapse of the ERM also gave Germany freedom over monetary policy. Yesterday's Bundesbank decision to leave official interest rates unchanged means that, unlike its partners, it is using that freedom. France would still like lower German rates so that it can follow suit without jeopardising the franc, but Germany is now concentrating on purely domestic considerations. The rate of money supply growth, in particular, does not currently warrant lower rates. If that was true yesterday, it will almost certainly be true in two weeks' time. So those who think the Bundesbank was simply deferring any decision until its next meeting could end up disappointed. Indeed the bank's readiness yesterday to deny itself any additional room to manipulate money market rates lower suggests it is in no hurry at all. It may now be several weeks before a further cut can be expected. That puts countries like France, Denmark and Belgium in a spot. The best practical solution might be concerted interest cuts of their own which would limit the exchange rate uncertainty. Given the pressures, they will have to find some way of lowering rates, which may explain why bond and equity markets remain so relaxed. The Bundesbank's behaviour, though, makes the recent strength of Frankfurt equities look distinctly odd.</p>

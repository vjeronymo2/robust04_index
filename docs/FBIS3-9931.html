			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces  commander in chief, yesterday hinted that he is trying to help  President Carlos Roberto Reina so he does not fall short on his  campaign promise to eliminate obligatory military service.    During an interview following a meeting at the Foreign  Relations Ministry, the general said that a "mixed" volunteer  military service is being studied under which some "would be  obliged" to serve.    Discua Elvir said he met with the president on Monday to  analyze the last proposal that he, as commander in chief,  presented on 10 February to establish "constitutional military  service."    The general said he is waiting for the government's response  to this proposal because "the president's political objective is  to solve this issue, which has been a problem for the Armed  Forces, the government, and the Honduran people. We hope there  is a desire to recruit soldiers in a more humane manner."    Immediately after the meeting, the commander in chief was  asked if military service would remain obligatory. He replied:  "We have neither the economic nor cultural capacity for an  all-volunteer military service."    Discua Elvir said only four nations in the world have  volunteer military services. "We want to have a mixed military  service in which there are both volunteers and those who will be  obligated to serve," he noted.    The general added: "We are trying to organize a mixed  military service because a volunteer service is very expensive.  Even if we reduced the number of personnel to a quarter of its  present size, the Armed Forces budget would triple."    Discua was then reminded that the Armed Forces is  contradicting President Carlos Roberto Reina's campaign promise  to have a "volunteer and educational military service."    "I am afraid that at that time the president did not have  advisers. Sometimes advice is not correct; maybe that was the  case. Nevertheless, the president is doing everything possible.  He must be given time. He definitely wants to keep his  promise, and we -- who must help with ideas -- are cooperating  as much as possible so he can find a solution to keep his  promise."    The general insisted that the new recruitment system will  not  discriminate and include only the sons of the poor. He  explained that other options, such as students serving on  weekends, are being studied.    We are trying to do this "in an acceptable manner" so those  who want to remain in the battalions can choose technical  careers or receive special training as forest rangers,  mechanics, and so forth. This would also include social services  such as painting schools, sweeping streets, and other  activities, he noted.    Discua Elvir indicated that a plan will be coordinated with  Education Minister Zenobia Rodas whereby all officers will help  teach illiterate residents living around the battalions -- to be  identified by a census -- to read and write.</p>

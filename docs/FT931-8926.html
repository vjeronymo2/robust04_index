			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Personal View: First step to blocking a two-tier Europe The shambles of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's legal about-turn on the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty on Monday should not be allowed to confuse the issues that are at stake. Labour's amendment 27, by seeking to remove the opt-out, could only ever be the first step on the road towards the social chapter's inclusion in the treaty. Parliament should vote in favour, for two reasons. First, the arrangement negotiated at Maastricht by John Major, the prime minister, is a legal and political mess. The opt-out creates a two-tier Europe in the social dimension which many Community experts believe to be unworkable. Mr Major has left Britain, in this vital area, with reduced influence, diminished status and, once again, without the ability to shape the institutions that will guide the Continent. At Maastricht, the prime minister had the opportunity to negotiate a social chapter which conformed more clearly with British desires for decentralised decision-making and a free-market approach. He passed up that chance and chose isolation instead. Mr Major's tactics may have given him something to show his sceptical backbenchers when he returned from the negotiations. He was determined to prove that he had not abandoned his predecessor's legacy. But he has robbed his country of the ability to steer the social legislation of the Community. Second, the British public needs to understand and support the process of European integration. A single market, leading to a single European currency, will oblige British companies and employees to face up to competitive stresses and strains. Why should those same British men and women be denied the benefits of the minimum social and employment legislation that is agreed at a European level, and which will be upheld in every other member state? And has Britain not something to learn from those of its neighbours who have shown that co-operation and partnership can lead to economic success? All of the other member states understand that Europe must have a social face. A specific clause has already been inserted which requires legislation to respect 'national practices'. Another protects the position of 'small and medium-sized undertakings'. The chapter specifically excludes pay, the right of association and the right to strike. All of the legislation so far proposed has arisen not from the Maastricht treaty but from the Single European Act, passed by a Conservative government in the 1980s. Liberal Democrats do have concerns about the corporatist nature of some of the procedures for decision-making within the chapter which could by-pass the elected European Parliament. But the British government has shown no interest in improving the democratic accountability of the Community. In any case, such concerns should not outweigh the desire to see Britain 'at the heart' of the Community, able to participate in all of its deliberations and to shape its institutions. Amendment 27 does not by itself insert the social chapter in the UK's version of the treaty. It is a necessary step towards that end, but it is not in itself sufficient. Even so, the government was claiming until Monday afternoon that the amendment, if carried, would 'wreck' the treaty. Douglas Hurd attempted to raise the stakes further by threatening to ditch the treaty. He sounded petulant and bullying, unsure of his case. Now that the government's case has been blown apart, it is clear that its problems are not technical, but political. On this occasion, Britain would be moving towards its European partners, who would welcome the end of an opt-out. The UK should take further steps to make this possible. With the French elections now upon us, and with a heightened political atmosphere at Westminster, much nonsense will be spoken over the next few weeks about the social chapter on both sides of the Channel. Some will allege 'social dumping'. Conservatives will claim that an opt-out is Britain's only route to prosperity. Labour has persuaded itself that the chapter could return Britain to the days of collectivist industrial relations. The truth is more mundane, but none the less important to Britain. It is in British interests for the Community to move together as 12. Yes, there are problems with the chapter. But these will only be solved with Britain inside a more democratic Community. Last November, Liberal Democrats voted to support the Maastricht treaty in the 'paving' debate. Next month, we shall vote to improve the treaty by supporting the social chapter.

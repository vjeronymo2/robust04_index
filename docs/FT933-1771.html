			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Yule Catto in Pounds 30m rights to fund purchase YULE CATTO, the industrial chemicals group, is to raise Pounds 29.7m through the first rights issue in its history to buy 50 per cent of a German synthetic rubber latex company and to reduce debt. It is is paying Pounds 18.2m for the purchase of the stake in Synthomer Chemie from Chemetall, ultimately owned by Metallgesellschaft, after a one-for-six rights issue at 215p. The shares fell 18p to 259p on news of the rights and the group's interim results for the six months to June 30, which disclosed a pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 9.26m on sales up 12 per cent at Pounds 140.6m. The deal will strengthen Yule Catto's links with Reichhold Chemicals of the US, the subsidiary of Dainippon Ink of Japan. Reichhold owns the other 50 per cent of Synthomer and is also the joint venture partner in Doverstrand, another latex joint venture with Yule Catto. Mr Alex Walker, Yule Catto chief executive, said bringing the two joint ventures together under common ownership would open up opportunities to rationalise marketing, research and manufacturing and help create a pan-European synthetic latex rubber business. For the year ended September 30 1992 Synthomer made profits before exceptional items of Pounds 6.4m and profits before tax of Pounds 3.8m. Its net assets were Pounds 7.1m. The rights issue would also reduce group gearing, which at the end of the first half was 43 per cent on net debt slightly up on the same period last year at Pounds 20.7m. Earnings per share fell from 7.5p to 6.5p but the interim dividend is lifted from 2.5p to 2.6p. Mr Walker said the fall in profits mainly stemmed from the poor performance of the building products division in Holland, Belgium and France. Yule Catto's largest shareholder, Kuala Lumpur Kepong, which owns 29.5 per cent, has irrevocably agreed to take up its rights. The balance is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Lord Catto, chairman, said the bringing of Synthomer and Doverstrand under common ownership would strengthen the international business. 'Doverstrand has enjoyed a long standing technical and commercial relationship with Synthomer through its common shareholder, Reichhold Chemicals,' he said.</p>

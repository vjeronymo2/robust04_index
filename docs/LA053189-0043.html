			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY FOR SAILOR ASSAILS IOWA INQUIRY AS A 'SMEAR'  </P> <P> Denouncing the Navy's investigation of an explosion that killed 47 sailors  aboard the battleship Iowa as a "smear" campaign against Gunner's Mate 3rd  Class Kendall L. Truitt, Miami attorney Ellis Rubin charged Tuesday that  investigators are paying scant attention to more plausible explanations for the  blast.  </P> <P> The Navy confirmed last week that it is investigating whether the personal  relationship between Truitt and another member of the crew could have been a  factor in the explosion. Truitt was listed as the beneficiary of a $100,000  life insurance policy purchased by the other crewman, Gunner's Mate 2nd Class  Clayton M. Hartwig, who died in the blast.  </P> <P> In defending Truitt, Rubin pointed to what he said was the presence of  inexperienced crewmen in the gun turret that exploded and the possibility that  gunpowder loaded into the turret's big gun may have become unstable because of  faulty storage.  </P> <P> "Many people assigned specific tasks (in the affected turret) were not  qualified," said Rubin, who is representing Truitt against possible criminal  charges arising from the Navy investigation. "Many were last-minute  substitutes," Rubin added, creating a turret crew that had never worked  together as a team.  </P> <P> Rubin also contested the Navy's claim that the storage of gunpowder in  overheated ships could not have contributed to the accident. Citing two  engineers with expertise in explosives, Rubin said that after such improper  storage, "the gunpowder was so volatile and unstable that anything could have  happened. And it probably did."  </P> <P> As Truitt and his wife of five months held hands and occasionally kissed behind  him, Rubin demanded that the Navy publicly apologize to his client. He said  that Truitt is exploring an unprecedented suit against the Navy for disclosing  preliminary details of the inquiry, which suggested that the 21-year-old  gunner's mate was homosexual.  </P></p>

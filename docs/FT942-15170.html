			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Recovery hopes fuel Solvay stock rise Shares in Solvay, the Belgian chemicals group, yesterday soared to a record high after the market predicted it would recover from heavy losses unveiled earlier. The shares closed at BFr16,075 on the Belgian stock market, BFr275 higher than the previous day, and more than 3 per cent stronger than at the start of the week. The surge, which took some analysts by surprise, came after the group on Thursday unveiled a total consolidated loss of BFr6.9bn (Dollars 196m) for 1993. The loss, which had been widely predicted, compares with a consolidated profit of BFr9.9bn the previous year. Solvay yesterday blamed BFr2.95bn of the loss on restructuring costs. They related to the closure of several plants last year, resulting in the loss of 2,500 jobs. However, the other reason for the loss was a decline in European chemical sales and prices, the group admitted. Although the group's turnover rose 14 per cent in the US, and 27 per cent in Asia last year, it fell 11 per cent in Europe. A large part of this loss stemmed from the poor performance of the plastics sector, which recorded a BFr2.27bn pre-tax loss in 1993. Conditions in the soda ash business, where Solvay is the world leader, had also been difficult. The result seems likely to fuel demands among the European chemical sector for tighter trade controls on east European imports of PVC and soda ash. Mr Daniel Janssen, Solvay chairman, heads a campaign calling for the European Commission to impose tough anti-dumping penalties. Mr Janssen said yesterday the dividend would be maintained at BFr500 per share, and predicted better results this year. Sales and profits prospects for Solvay's main alkalis sectors were improving, he said, and prices appeared to be bottoming out in the caustic soda sector. Meanwhile, cost-cutting in the western European soda ash business, and strong growth in the exports of US soda ash production to south-east Asia and Brazil should also help recovery, Mr Janssen said. These views were endorsed by the Belgium stock market, where analysts said Solvay's fortunes could only improve.</p>

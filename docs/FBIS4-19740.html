			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundestag today began to  debate the new world trade agreement which promises Germany  higher standards of living in the medium term. A week ago in  Marrakesh, the member states of the GATT signed the agreement,  which took seven and a half years to negotiate.    The agreement stipulates a 37-percent reduction in customs  duties as well as the opening up of markets to foreign products  and services. The German Government intends officially to apply  that Bonn be the location of the new World Trade Organization  (WTO). The WTO will replace GATT, which was founded in 1947, on  1 January.    In a government statement, German Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) welcomed the new world trade  agreement as a "milestone in trade policy." The export-oriented  German economy, on which every third job depends, will profit  from the agreement even if follow-up negotiations are still  required in individual cases.    The agreement shows that countries want free trade and are  ready to take on structural changes. The walls of protectionism  belong to the past, said Rexrodt. At the same time, the  minister underlined that Bonn is a serious candidate for the  seat of the WTO due to its position and infrastructure. His  ministry is therefore preparing its bid.</p>

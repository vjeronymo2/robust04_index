However, he is very  familiar with the situation in Guizhou and is clear about ways  to eliminate poverty and improve the economic condition of  people in the province.    Guizhou is located in China's southwest and is a remote  landlocked province. It is not situated in coastal areas, is  not along the Chang Jiang, and has no border areas. About half  of all counties in the province are poor, and the number of poor  people in the province accounts for one-eighth of all poor  people in the country or 30 percent of the province's total  population. Therefore, eliminating poverty has become the most  important work in the province.    However, is Guizhou really in utter destitution? Chen  Shineng does not think so. When reporters interviewed him, he  counted on his fingers and listed six advantages that Guizhou  can utilize as follows: Guizhou has the advantage of energy  sources, with more than 18 million tonnes of theoretical  hydraulic power [shui li zi yuan di li lun yun zang liang 3055  0500 6327 3293 4104 3810 6158 5686 5661 6852] and 50 billion  tonnes of coal deposit. Guizhou has the advantage of both  mineral resources and a metallurgical industry, with deposits of  phosphorous, manganese, antimony, aluminum, alumina, and 24  other mineral resources all ranking front in the country and  relatively advanced metallurgical technology and facilities.  Guizhou has the advantage of joint military and civilian  mechano-electrical industry. A large contingent of some 480,000  military industrial workers formed in the past and assets and  facilities of military industries provide good conditions for  transforming military industries into nonmilitary enterprises  producing commodities that can compete well on the market.  Guizhou has the advantage of light and textile industries,  represented by famous tobacco and wine. Guizhou has the  advantage of chemical industry by utilizing local coal and  phosphorous. Guizhou has the advantage of beautiful natural  scenery and customs of minority people in developing tourism.  Touching on Guizhou's tourism advantage, Chen Shineng spread  his arms and humorously told reporters: "I formally invite all  of you to visit Guizhou. There are not only the Huanggushu  Falls but also national forest parks and many natural sites and  cultural relics. Guizhou can be described as a place with  beautiful mountains and lakes and wonderful customs of people of  minority nationalities."    Chen Shineng pointed out: In the face of such a situation  and conditions, Guizhou will utilize the above-mentioned  advantages to develop related industries. At present, it is  necessary to grasp the opportune time to accelerate reform;  speed up the construction of infrastructure projects; develop  aviation, transportation, and communications; and laid down a  good foundation for enabling the people to live a relatively  comfortable life. In the vast and poor rural areas, it is  necessary to strive to achieve "two increases, one decrease, and  one control."    He explained: The two increases are: 1) to increase the  peasants' income from the present annual per capital income of  579 yuan by 90 yuan each year and reach 1,200 yuan by the end of  this century; and 2) to increase grain output by improving rural  facilities and raising the level of farming technologies. One  decrease means to take resolute measures to decrease the number  of people in poverty. Guizhou will strive to eliminate poverty  for all people by the end of this century and must not lay a  burden on the country. One control means to strictly control  the people's birth rate.    Chen Shineng said: It seems the above-mentioned goals are  not very high, but it is also not easy for Guizhou to achieve  those goals. However, since the industrious and wise ancestors  in Guizhou could make the world renowned and tasty Maotai  liquor, which requires a complicated technological process, the  people in Guizhou can certainly make good wine in the new era to  eliminate poverty and become rich under the excellent situation  of reform and opening up and to celebrate the arrival of the  21st Century.</p>

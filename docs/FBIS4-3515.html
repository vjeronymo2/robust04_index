			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A large Chinese  delegation will take part in the "Home Pride Asia '94" and "New  Homes '94" exhibitions, due to open April 24 in Singapore.    The trade exhibitions will focus on interior decoration and  real estate business, respectively.    The interior decoration section of the Chinese delegation  will display a wide variety of decoration materials, household  electrical appliances, lamps, bathroom equipment and other  household facilities with distinct national flavors.    For the first time, the group will show some art treasures,  such as a 100-m-long mosaic screen with pictures illustrating  the book "The Art of War" by the ancient Chinese military  strategist Sun Wu and a porcelain vase with 18 Buddhist saints  produced in Jingdezhen, the home of Chinese porcelain.    The fair will also display a modern high-tech duplication of  the world's first seismograph invented by Chinese scientist  Zhang Heng (78-139), a jade copy of the renowned stone boat in  Beijing's summer palace, and silk hangings.    The real estate group will put forward 22 housing projects  in  the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenyang, and Hainan  Province for international bidding.    The projects will be mainly connected with urban  infrastructure upgrading, dwelling and office building  construction and tourism promotion.    The delegation, comprised of 35 enterprises from 12 China's  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, is chiefly  organized by the China Everbright Trading Company under the  China Everbright Group Ltd., together with sponsorship from the  Chinese Government and the Chinese Embassy in Singapore.

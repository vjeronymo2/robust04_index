			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PRINCE VETOES TEXAN HANDSHAKE  </P> <P> Prince Charles, who's still recovering from a broken right arm, said today he's  wary of shaking hands with Americans, especially Texans.  </P> <P> He told a patient at a West London clinic that his arm, badly broken in a June  polo accident, continues to heal.  </P> <P> "But he said don't shake hands with anyone from America -- especially Texans --  because they shake your hand too hard," said Mabel Newson, 79, who met the heir  to the British throne at St. Dunstan's Community Leg Ulcer Clinic.  </P> <P> The prince's arm was broken in two places above the elbow when he fell off his  horse during a polo match. The arm did not heal properly, and the 42-year-old  son of Queen Elizabeth II had surgery in September.  </P></p>

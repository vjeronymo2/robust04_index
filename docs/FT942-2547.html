			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: Now it's a nightmare for Sid - The Bottom Line When Sid, the advertising character created to promote the privatisation of British Gas, bought those shares in BG back in 1986, he was hoping for a profit, not a regulatory nightmare. But a nightmare is what he got. Ever since the government called in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission nearly two years ago, the prospects for Gas have been bedevilled by uncertainty. Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, settled things down somewhat in December when he accepted the MMC's recommendation to liberalise the gas market. But Sid still had to contend with Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator - and the news from her this week was not good. Under the liberalisation plan, British Gas is supposed to hive off its network of pipelines and storage into a separate unit. This unit will still be owned by BG, but it will sell its services at arm's length both to BG and the independent gas suppliers who want to get into the market. On Wednesday, Spottiswoode produced a formula governing the prices that the new unit will be able to charge for transporting gas around the country. She set it at 14.16p a therm, starting on October 1. After that, the price can go up by the rate of inflation minus five percentage points a year. This arrangement will continue until March 1997, when the liberalisation of gas will be complete and a longer-term pricing formula can be devised. Spottiswoode's formula was a lot tighter than BG had been hoping for, and chief executive Cedric Brown wasted no time in going on the attack. It was 'extremely tough', he said, and would probably prevent BG from raising its dividend this year. But although Brown might have been disappointed by the formula, he cannot have been surprised. The MMC report contained recommendations which Spottiswoode had indicated she would follow, and the market was prepared: when the news hit the screens, the shares fell only 2p. It was only when Brown made his remarks about the dividend a few minutes later that the shares fell another 15p. Was this just bluster or a genuine cry of pain? It is true, as Brown says, that BG is under a lot of regulatory pressure at the moment: it must yield to competitors the larger part of the market for big gas users, something which is eating into profits. It also has an aggressive cost-cutting plan to shed as many as 25,000 jobs, so there are not many more savings to be had from that quarter. Then, starting in 1996, competitors will be allowed to enter the domestic gas market in stages until a fully competitive market is reached in 1998. There is always a possibility that these pressures could force BG to overstep Brown's warning and actually cut its dividend. But analysts doubt very much that that will happen. Nick Antill, at Hoare Govett, says the worst for which shareholders should brace themselves is an unchanged dividend over the period of the market restructuring. 'Neither balance sheet or cash flow considerations justify worrying about a cut,' he writes in a research note. The analysts at NatWest Securities take a similar view. They think BG can maintain its dividend over the transitional period provided it gets good profits from its unregulated exploration and production businesses, although the dividend cover will fall. At Kleinwort Benson, Paul Spedding also sees no dividend increase for the time being, at least in real terms, and he sympathises with Sid's predicament. 'He must be heartily fed up with all the bad news,' Spedding says, 'and now he doesn't know what his dividend is going to be next year.' As Spedding points out, BG shares are yielding 6.7 per cent, which is more than you get in a building society account. But the lower-yielding water and electricity sectors offer much better dividend growth prospects, and many BG investors may prefer to switch to escape the nightmare once and for all.</p>

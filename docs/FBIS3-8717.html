			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian  president, has just ended his talks with the representatives of  the Serbian Republic. Let us listen to the assessment by Nikola  Koljevic [vice president of the republic of Srpska]:    [Begin recording] [Koljevic] I believe that the talks were  very brief, very concrete, and very efficient. We did not find  out in what way and within what framework the next talks will be  held, that is to say, in what way the Serbs will be involved,  however, we have laid a sort of basis for participation.    It seems to us that prior to any sort of official  participation after the signing of the federation agreement  between the Muslims and the Croats, we must primarily accomplish  peace, sign a document on peace and not about a cease-fire.  Namely, the only thing that we can fear is the formation of a  new military alliance, while everything else is their free will.    Therefore, first of all we will be interested in  establishing  peace and in the document about peace, and then in the talks of  our side with the federation on an equal footing, which would  mean without sanctions.    [Unidentified reporter] Were there any concrete proposals  today?    [Koljevic] There were concrete proposals regarding the  situation on the ground today as evidently greater efforts are  aimed at establishing peace on the ground than on further  problems regarding the constitutional order, that is to say,  federation, confederation, and with whom. There was some  mention of Tuzla, that is, in what way could the Serbian  observers be incorporated in light of the fact that the Muslim  side had rejected the initial proposal. Also discussed was that,  if a sort of federation and confederation is being created, the  Serbs would normally be interested in very close links, not to  say a confederation, with Yugoslavia. Actually, we have never  left Yugoslavia, legally speaking. All these problems regarding  the political solution will arise. They were not raised today  because the new mediators evidently care most about success on  the ground and success with two sides, and to accomplish some  success with the third side later.    [Unidentified reporter] Were you officially invited to join  the negotiations?    [Koljevic] This was not officially offered to us, because  this was not an official meeting. We must create the framework,  officially. However, it is perfectly clear that this offer is  on the table and will be proposed to us. It is difficult to  imagine, bearing in mind that the other two sides have already  rejected the possibility of a confederation with Yugoslavia,  that this will be a serious option. However, all this will only  come into consideration when the official talks with the Serbian  side will commence. [end recording]</p>

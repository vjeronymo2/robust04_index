			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (11): Voters' crucial yardstick - Housing expectations Mr Joe Slovo, former ANC guerrilla chief and chairman of the South African Communist Party, holds what is arguably the toughest job in South Africa: he has to implement the African National Congress election promise to build at least 1m low-cost houses in five years. Apart from setting this ambitious target, assisted by a R12.5bn state subsidy, the party also vowed to 'transform and upgrade' the 411 migrant workers' hostels which house 1m residents, and bring electricity to at least 2.5m homes by the year 2000. A government white paper setting out ways to meet these targets is due to be published in the next few weeks. Meanwhile Mr Slovo is listening and taking stock - and setting out some of the tenets that will shape policy. The housing backlog cannot be left to the market, argues the minister: 'Private sector representatives are unanimous that the market requires the assistance and intervention, direct and indirect, of the state.' Deliberate neglect of black urban housing - apartheid's architects treated black South Africans as only temporary residents in white cities - created a backlog of between 1.5m and 2m homes. Even if government sought only to keep up with the annual demand caused by population growth, it would face a formidable task: about 240,000 new homes each year need to be built. In the Pretoria-Witswatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) province alone, 1m people need decent housing. Some 200,000 people have in recent years established squatter settlements, driven to the region in search of work or to escape from the drought of the early 1990s, and freed from apartheid laws restricting movement. The migration to the cities looks set to rise. A recent study prepared by the Central Witswatersrand Metropolitan Chamber estimates that the population of the PWV will rise to 16m by 2010, an 80 per cent increase from the 1990 figure. A study by the country's National Housing Forum, a broad-based independent association of interest groups established in August 1991, doubted whether the construction industry can cope with the target. The number of registered building companies had dropped from 14,300 in 1988 to about 7,000 as a result of the recession. Skills are in short supply and plant and equipment is ageing, the study points out. In an interview last month, Mr Slovo made clear that he was opposed to what are called 'site and service' schemes, which allow people to build their own homes on plots provided with running water and water-borne sewerage. Mr Slovo argues that government must provide a secure, weatherproof structure, otherwise such schemes soon become little better than the slums they are designed to replace. Many housing experts disagree. Given the resources available, the size of the backlog, and the annual demand stemming from population growth, there is no alternative to serviced sites, they say. Some of Mr Slovo's concerns are borne out by a 200-page report on the largest low-cost housing project in South Africa's history. Known as the Capital Subsidy Scheme (CSS), it was launched in March 1991 by the state-financed Independent Development Trust, established a year earlier to manage and disburse a R2,000m fund 'to enhance the standard of living of disadvantaged communities'. The R750m scheme offered 113,000 subsidies of R7,500 in 103 projects around South Africa. Eligibility was limited to households earning less than R1,000 a month, and giving registered ownership of a serviced site. These would be provided with water and waterborne sanitation, access by graded road to each site, and paved bus routes. On completion, the project will have provided facilities for between 5 and 10 per cent of the low income population needing housing. The assessment needs to be put in the context of the troubled times. Housing was in the political arena, with efforts to tackle the problem set back by political violence, rent boycotts and tensions created by the economic recession and rising unemployment. Despite these difficulties, the evaluation describes the CSS as having been 'largely successful'. In the two years since its inception, some 300,000 people have been accommodated on 57,000 plots, at a cost of R440m of the allocated R775m. But as the assessment goes into more detail, it becomes clear that for all its achievements, there are serious problems which current housing strategy has to take into account. 'There is a high risk of the subsidy being lost in the collapse of roads, toilet structures and pipes due to inadequate mechanisms being instituted for maintenance', it warns. 'The scenario could develop where there are taps but no water; blocked storm-water drains; impassable, eroded roads; toilets but no sewer systems; piles of refuse etc.' 'This eventuality', the report continues, 'is already raising its head in a number of projects. As the situation worsens, it will become increasingly difficult to resolve, with financially restrained local authorities unable to respond, and communities becoming more and more unwilling to pay for services that they only experience as non-functional'. The report also warns that 'the level of expectation appears to have increased since the CSS started in 1991. The current expectation is that housing schemes for the poor need to make subsidy provision for a serviced site and a two-roomed house at least.' The government can go a long way towards meeting these expectations, says Mr Slovo, with a programme in which government subsidies will be accompanied by private sector participation. A forthcoming white paper will propose: Provision of a maximum grant of R12,500 for those earning less than R1,500 a month. Mortgage indemnity insurance scheme, with the capital provided by government and foreign aid, and the scheme maintained by users' premiums. Banks will be insured against non-payment of loans or if they are unable to repossess homes because of violence or political conditions. Consumer protection: measures to prevent speculation, and ensuring quality control. A national housing bank which will 'cheapen housing capital by acting as a wholesale bank', says Mr Slovo. Provision of state-owned land for low-cost housing. Given these schemes and the co-operation of the private sector, Mr Slovo believes that 50,000 houses can be erected this year, rising to 125,000 in 1995, 175,000 in the following year and 225,000 in 1997. How close Mr Slovo's ministry comes to reaching these targets will be one of the yardsticks by which black South Africa will judge the ANC at the next election.  ------------------------------------------------------------ The provinces and the premiers  ------------------------------------------------------------ Western Cape                             Hemus Kriel (NP) Eastern Cape                             Ray Mhlaba (ANC) Northern Cape                          Manne Dipico (ANC) KwaZulu/Natal                        Frank Mdlalose (ANC) Orange Free State                    Patrick Lekota (ANC) North West                              Popo Molefe (ANC) Northern Transvaal                Ngoake Ramatlhodi (ANC) Eastern Transvaal                     Matthew Phosa (ANC) PWV                                   Tokyo Sexwale (ANC)  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

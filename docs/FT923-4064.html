In 'Springing Lenin' Geraldine McEwan stars as an eccentric Scottish spinster who hauls an unwanted statue of Lenin across the continent. 'Business With Friends' finds two members of the British extreme right hob-nobbing with the German neo-Nazis. 'Can't Stop Me Dreaming' seems to have something to do with George Formby and England's northern club circuit. The story of the RAF aircrew shot down in their fighter-bomber over Iraq is told in detail for the first time on television in Tornado Down (9.00 C4). For a couple of days during the Gulf War, the bruised faces of John Peters and John Nichol became the most familiar images in the world. Here they tell their own story. BBC1's documentary series Inside Story begins another run with an account of a My-Lai type massacre said to have been carried out by the Scots Guards in the Malayan jungle in 1948. (9.30 BBC1).</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Tories co-operate in Nadir cash probe CONSERVATIVE Central Office has responded to concerns that it has not been co-operating with the trustees in bankruptcy to Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. The office is believed this week to have provided greater information to Mr Neil Cooper at accountants Robson Rhodes, head of the firm's insolvency arm and Mr Nadir's court-appointed trustee. Its action came as the trustee was considering demanding to interview Conservative party officials to gather information using his powers through English insolvency law. Mr Cooper has been attempting to trace any assets to which Mr Nadir's creditors may lay claim. These include up to Pounds 440,000 in political donations made by Mr Nadir to the Conservative party during the 1980s. But it is believed that the Conservative party had provided insufficient information until recently to help determine the basis for any claim. There was some confusion over whether three letters sent by Mr Cooper had been received and dealt with by officials. A letter in late July initially went unanswered and was followed by a further letter in August. The Conservative party has previously said that it will return the donations if the money was stolen. Accountants at Touche Ross, the joint administrators to Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's former conglomerate, may also have a claim on the donations, most of which have been traced to Unipac, a Polly Peck packaging subsidiary in northern Cyprus. But Mr Cooper may have a claim on the donations if the money was drawn on cheques from Mr Nadir's personal bank accounts held with companies in the Polly Peck group. None of the donations were disclosed in the Polly Peck group accounts as required by English law. Donations to political parties by companies based in northern Cyprus are believed to be outlawed. Conservative Central Office said yesterday: 'We are co-operating in every way we can. We have co-operated fully and we have certainly acknowledged his (Mr Cooper's) letters.'</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WADKINS INCREASES LEAD TO 3  </P> <P> Twenty years after losing to Lanny Wadkins as an amateur, Curtis Strange gets a  shot at revenge today in Williamsburg, Va. And this time there's $180,000 on  the line. And it's on Strange's home course.  </P> <P> "He's a good front-runner, he's a tough competitor and he's got a lot of guts,"  Strange said. "But I've got my share, too. It ought to be fun."  </P> <P> Strange has ground to make up. On Saturday, Wadkins used three birdie surges to  shoot a four-under-par 67 that gave him a three-stroke lead over Strange going  into the final round of the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic.  </P> <P> Wadkins, a native of nearby Richmond, made consecutive birdies at three  different stages of his round at the Kingsmill Golf Club. He also had two  bogeys which left him at 15-under-par 198 for the tournament.  </P> <P> Strange, who was born in nearby Norfolk, chipped in from the fringe on the  par-four 18th for a birdie. His 68 put him at 12-under 201.  </P> <P> Because Wadkins is 40 and Strange is 35, they didn't meet often as amateurs.  But Strange recalled that Wadkins did beat him in the semifinals of the 1970  Virginia Amateur.  </P> <P> "I was always kind of right behind Lanny," Strange said. "Lanny and I have  become friends -- very good friends."  </P> <P> In addition to sharing a home state, Strange followed Wadkins in college golf  at Wake Forest. But Wadkins tried to downplay the parallels between himself and  Strange, whose 17 victories include two U.S. Opens.  </P> <P> "He's a tough competitor. He's capable of playing better than anyone," said  Wadkins, who is seeking his 19th career title.  </P> <P> Betsy King is leading the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic, although you'd never know  it to listen to her talk.  </P> <P> "I should have quit after the front nine," she said after shooting a  one-under-par 70 for a one-stroke lead over Chris Johnson and Tina Purtzer  heading into today's final round.  </P> <P> King is at four-under-par 138 through 36 holes. She built a two-stroke lead  with three consecutive birdies, then came back after dropping three shots to  par by making a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.  </P> <P> George Archer ignored back problems while shooting a five-under-par 67,  building a two-shot lead over Frank Beard, Homero Blancas and Charles Coody  after two rounds of the senior tour Northville Long Island Classic at Jericho,  N.Y.  </P> <P> Archer, who began the day two strokes behind first-round leader Gary Player,  used an eagle on the par-five 10th hole and a birdie on No. 11 to build a  four-stroke margin. But bogeys on Nos. 13 and 16 pulled him back to the field  at 136, eight shots under par.  </P></p>

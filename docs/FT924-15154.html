			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken losses soar to SKr8.4bn at eight months NORDBANKEN, Sweden's state-owned bank, yesterday announced financial losses of SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.57bn) for the first eight months of the year, up from SKr3.433bn in the corresponding period of 1991. Loan losses totalled SKr10.01bn, exceeding two-thirds of the level forecast for the whole of the year. No provisions had been made for SKr1.32bn of that figure. The bank said that its profits before loan losses for the May to August period only 'increased insignificantly' but it did not provide a figure. It added that operating profits before loan losses for the first eight months totalled SKr1.59bn, a 55 per cent decline on the same period of 1991. Nordbanken said the 'poor trend of earnings' was expected to continue for the rest of the year. It pointed out that the high market interest rates in Sweden now increased the risk of further credit losses as the recession deepened. 'The bank's earning capacity is at present undermined by a substantial increase in non-performing assets,' said Nordbanken. The bank is no longer listed on the stock market as it became wholly-owned by the state in the middle of last month. 'Nordbanken's loan losses still remain very high,' said Mr Olle Wastberg, under-secretary at the Ministry of Finance. But he added that this would not 'jeopardise depositors' funds or the reconstruction of the bank'. At the end of this year, non-performing loans, loans with negotiated interest deferments and other assets that hamper the bank's earning power, are to be transferred to a new company called Securum which will be wholly-owned by the Swedish government and separate from Nordbanken. The government will announce a rescue plan for the bank shortly after today's opening of the new session of parliament. Its aim is to strengthen the bank's financial base so that its capital adequacy requirement ratio will exceed the 8 per cent required by the end of the year under the rules of the Bank for International Settlements. The depths of the crisis at Nordbanken can be gauged by the size of their non-performing assets which were SKr32bn at the end of August. Nordbanken revealed yesterday that the reserve for possible loan losses was SKr16.6bn which covered only 52 per cent of the total. The net amount of non-performing assets at the bank had risen to SKr15.2bn compared with SKr9.9bn at the start of the year and SKr12.7bn at the end of April. The bank said that the volume of outstanding loans with interest deferment agreements rose during the year to SKr6.5bn from SKr3.8bn and pledges taken over by the bank for protection of its claims rose by nearly SKr1bn to SKr7.4bn.</p>

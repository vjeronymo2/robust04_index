			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Chemical accidents spark debate CONCERN about safety and environmental protection measures in the German chemical industry intensified yesterday as parliament announced an emergency debate on a series of accidents at plants operated by Hoechst. At the same time, the federal Ministry of Environment ordered a government commission to investigate Monday's chemical explosion at a Hoechst plant near Frankfurt, which left one worker dead and another suffering from third-degree burns. Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, called for tougher application of the safety controls enforced by the state-run Technical Inspection Agency, TUV. He said: 'We have to bring in external expertise, for example by sending in the TUV to these plants to review safety precautions.' The German Chemical Industry Association rejected stricter controls, saying that chemical enterprises were already making all necessary safety checks in their plants. 'I do not think that safety standards could be increased by external expertise,' Mr Wilfried Sahm, chairman of the association, said. But the explosion, following a series of accidents at Hoechst plants, amounts to a severe public relations setback for the chemical industry, which came under attack both in the press and among politicians yesterday. Less than a month ago, an accident at Hoechst released 10 tonnes of chemicals into the sky over a Frankfurt suburb. Last Friday 100 litres of a potentially poisonous solution were discharged into the Rhine. Mr Michael Muller, environment spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats, said yesterday that 11 accidents in the space of a few weeks must produce some response from legislators. 'Clearly, the current security measures are not adequate to reduce the potential danger of chemical production,' he said. 'It is a worrying sign that Hoechst cannot give precise information about the dangers from the emissions.' The environmental group Greenpeace yesterday blockaded the main Hoechst plant near Frankfurt after the company refused to allow it to take samples of water and earth from the site.</p>

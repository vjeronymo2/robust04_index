			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / 'The meeting is the message' at Apec forum: George Graham on the meeting in Hawaii of 17 Asia-Pacific countries In the last two months, the US has backed itself into a series of conflicts with almost half its fellow members in the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Besides its long-running battle to open Japan's markets, President Bill Clinton's administration has feuded with Indonesia on human rights, with Thailand on access to financial services markets and with Singapore on the island state's decision to cane a US teenager for vandalism. Most ominous of all, after the failure of a mission last week to Beijing by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is an impending clash with China over the human rights improvements Mr Clinton is demanding as a condition for renewing China's most favoured nation trade privileges. Little of that, however, will surface this evening and tomorrow when finance ministers from the 17 Apec countries meet on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. 'The meeting is the message,' said finance ministry officials from three different Apec countries, in unison. Even US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen's expected bilateral meetings with his Japanese and Chinese counterparts are unlikely to touch on the trade sores between them. The meeting is the first to take place between Apec finance ministers, and marks another step forward, after a ground-breaking leaders' summit in Seattle last November, for the fledgling organisation. Some member countries hold out great hopes of an Apec evolving gradually from 'four adjectives in search of a noun', as an Australian minister described it, into the 'new Pacific community' enunciated by Mr Clinton. Even the most enthusiastic Apec supporters, however, acknowledge that progress towards such a goal, not shared by all, will be slow. Apec offers considerable advantages as a forum bringing together nations from both sides of the Pacific. It is, for example, one of the rare places in which the US and China get away from their usual human rights/MFN dialogue. Even more unusual, it includes not only China but Hong Kong and Taiwan. But its members have wide differences of culture, economic development and democratisation, and some members, notably Malaysia, remain suspicious that the US's enthusiasm for Apec may disguise a spoiling operation designed to undercut the six-member Association of South-east Asian Nations and Malaysia's idea for an East Asian Economic Caucus, excluding Apec members such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Malaysia, whose prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, boycotted the Seattle meeting, will participate in full at the finance ministers' meeting, with a delegation led by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister. Dr Mahathir is also expected to attend the second Apec leaders' summit in Jakarta this autumn. The meeting in Hawaii this weekend is expected to run through the economic prospects for the region, which continues to show the most dynamic growth in the world, but to stop well short of the sort of economic policy co-ordination attempted by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Finance ministers will examine topics such as ways of facilitating external financial flows for infrastructure needs and developing capital markets in the region. Besides the US, Apec includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. Chile is to be admitted at the meeting in Jakarta.</p>

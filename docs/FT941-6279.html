			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Admiral ahead 16% to Pounds 4.6m Profits before tax at Admiral rose 16 per cent to Pounds 4.61m in 1993 as the computing services company reaped the benefit of its move into defence software and client-server technology. Turnover was up 19 per cent at Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 30.9m) and operating profit jumped 23 per cent at Pounds 4.35m (Pounds 3.53m). Cash in hand at the year-end was Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.4m), but falling interest rates resulted in a 43 per cent decline in net interest receivable, from Pounds 452,000 to Pounds 260,000. Admiral has maintained growth in sales, pre-tax profits and earnings per share since it went public in 1987. It recruited new staff throughout the recession. Last year staff numbers rose 20 per cent to 662 and now stand at 790. Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said yesterday that Admiral was a dominant force in the client-server marketplace which he believed would grow strongly in the future. Client-server systems replace centralised mainframe computing with combinations of network servers and intelligent workstations. The company is now active in the defence, finance, government and industrial sectors with a growing presence - accounting for 9 per cent of sales - in commerce. It provides computing services, software products and training and has overseas operations in Australia and Singapore. Earnings per share were 27.6p (24.2p) and a final dividend of 4.3p makes a total for the year of 6.3p (5.4p). Dividend cover is 4.3 times. Mr Brendish said there was good evidence of recovery in the economy and he expected a further good year. Analysts are looking for growth of about 24 per cent for the current year giving profits before tax of about Pounds 5.7m.</p>

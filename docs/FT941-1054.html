			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Motoring: When only shire horses will do An on/off-road, four-wheel drive turned into an executive express sounds improbable. But no more so, I suppose, than the transformation of a redundant barn, oast house or stable block into a desirable residence - and south-east England is now dotted with them. If you fancy using such a vehicle as a business car, go for a Range Rover converted by a small company called Overfinch. One I used for a wintry week recently was by far the best Range Rover I have driven. The Overfinch version had been given an engine transplant. Out went the 4.2-litre Rover V8; in went a General Motors' 5.7-litre V8. These days it is politically (for which read environmentally) incorrect to say so - but, if you are after truly relaxed high performance, there is no substitute for litres. The GM V8 delivers 284 horsepower and 344lb/ft of torque, a measure of pulling power at a given engine speed. For sheer brawn, it makes the largest-engined standard Range Rover, the 4,278cc LSE (200hp and 250lb/ft of torque), feel almost a weakling. At 80mph (128kph) and 3,000rpm, the cabin was quiet enough for enjoyable Classic FM listening. On non-motorway journeys, overtaking was instant and, therefore, safe. A prod with the right toe slipped the automatic transmission into third. With a bull-like bellow, the two-ton machine hurtled forward, all-wheel drive keeping the Avon Turbospeed tyres gripping on wet surfaces. Handling and ride comfort stood comparison with that of a normal executive saloon. But, realistically, no tweaks (however clever) can make two heavy beam axles behave like fully independent suspension. So, although it did not wallow on corners, the Overfinch Range Rover's lofty body leaned a bit if a roundabout was taken quickly. Potholes did not pass unnoticed, either. As I sat straight-backed on fragrant Connolly hide, enjoying a horseman's view of the countryside, I felt as though I were driving a very short wheelbase Bentley Turbo R or a high-off-the-ground Aston Martin V8. High speed, road-pattern tyres, and reduced ground clearance and axle articulation make an Overfinch Range Rover unsuitable for rough and muddy terrain - where few of its kind venture, anyway. It would, though, do nicely for getting out of slithery car parks at race meetings. A full conversion - engine transplant, modified running gear and steering, Recaro sports seats and some nicely understated cosmetic changes - costs a little over Pounds 18,000. A brand-new Overfinch Range Rover Vogue SE will leave little change out of Pounds 55,000, which is barely more than half the price of the cheapest Bentley and less than a third of an Aston Martin Virage shooting brake. Overfinch, however, will do the same work on the cheaper Land Rover Discovery, mechanically the Range Rover's twin brother. Nor need you start with a new host vehicle. One up to six years old can be tackled if in generally good fettle. I have said often that I could not see much point in using a beefy on/off-road 4x4 exclusively on tarmac, and the logic still escapes me. But the choice of road-going, four-wheel driven automatic estate cars with really high performance is tiny. There is an Audi 100 2.8E quattro and BMW 525i X Touring at list prices of Pounds 28,655 and Pounds 31,330 respectively, or a less prestigious but worthy Subaru Legacy 2.2 GX 4WD at a mere Pounds 18,399. But when nothing less than four-wheel drive, two pedals, shire horse muscle and a high seating position will do, it has to be the Overfinch. If you can countenance a fuel consumption of 15-17mpg (18.8-16.6 l/100km) of super unleaded, call Overfinch on 0420-542 877. Not a word, please, to Friends of the Earth, but I promise you will find a 120mph (193kmh), 0-60mph (0-96kmh) in well under eight seconds Overfinch Range Rover one of today's really great drives. A possible large-engined alternative, with smooth automatic transmission and unimpaired off-roadability, is the Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its 5.2-litre V8 produces 212hp and 285 lbs/ft torque (more than a standard 4.2-litre Range Rover, less than the Overfinch with the GM engine). Now on sale in Britain at Pounds 27,995, it is a bargain. The price includes air-conditioning, anti-lock brakes, leather seats and power operation for almost everything. The snag is that, at present, it comes only in left-hand drive. Another possibility is Mitsubishi's latest Shogun 3.5-litre V6 (Pounds 35,889), which is in the same prestige, performance and price class as an off-the-peg Range Rover Vogue SE (Pounds 36,130).</p>

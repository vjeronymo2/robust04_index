His speech did express those thoughts. He began by stating  that "those of us responsible for government at this historic  juncture have a duty to gorge ahead on the path of change and it  is demanded of us that we remake politics, the economy and our  society no matter how great the difficulties." He also  stressed, "I intend to take up the challenge of new reforms, not  forgetting the essential spirit of this reform government."    This issue consciousness is only to be expected considering  the circumstances surrounding Japan both domestically and  abroad. In international terms, the Clinton administration has  revived the Super 301 provision and has staked out a hard-line  position in preparing for trade negotiations. Domestically,  taking action to spur economic recovery and reform taxation are  urgent matters. To handle these issues, many people are calling  for deregulations and administrative reform.    Moreover, from the standpoint of the nature of the present  recession and international relations, there is a pressing need  to review the economic and social structures that had been  praised as the Japanese system's strengths. Hosokawa was  undoubtedly correct when he said in his speech, "in laying the  foundations for a new era of development, it is imperative that  we demolish those systems and practices that are no longer  compatible with the needs of the times" and that, "we must  promote reform that will be conductive to business restructuring  and the creation and development of new industries."    However, the biggest issue is whether the government can  create a structure for implementation that will match the points  noted by the prime minister. The ruling coalition's  cohesiveness has been visibly shaken with the recent, sudden  announcement of a plan to introduce a national welfare tax and  the rumblings about a cabinet reshuffle. In more direct terms,  there are doubts as to whether the administration structure will  follow the dictates of government when there is trouble stirring  between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary, who  serves as the main coordinator of the cabinet.    Implementing deregulation or administrative reform will not  be possible unless the political sector cuts into the sacred  ground of the bureaucracy. As a result of circumstances  surrounding the compilation of the government budget from the  closing days of the past year, it became apparent that the  coalition parties, which are still trying to become accustomed  to controlling the government, had to eventually rely on the  bureaucratic apparatus led by the Finance Ministry. There is  even the sense that the bureaucrats' power in formulating policy  has increased since the Liberal Democratic party controlled  government.    In his speech, the prime minister said: "It is impossible  for the administration alone to stand unchanged when there are  such major changes taking place in politics and the economy.  Seeking to establish an administration that is fair,  transparent, and, above all, has the people's interest as its  first priority, we must initiate radical surgery on our  administrative structures and systems." From his experience as  a committee chairman in the Third Provisional Council for the  Promotion of Administrative Reform, Hosokawa should be  well-aware of the strong opposition posed by bureaucrats. If  his resolve ends up being nothing more than mere words, he will  have problems maintaining control over the government.    One hopeful sign for the Hosokawa cabinet is the still-high  support it receives from the people. In a poll conducted by  ASAHI SHIMBUN at the end of February, the Hosokawa Cabinet was  supported by 57 percent of respondents. While the figure was  slightly lower than the 60 percent recorded in a poll in  December 1993, the support rate did not seem to be affected by  the recent fiascoes involving the national welfare tax and the  cabinet reshuffle. Now is the time for Hosokawa to return to  his initial intent and not take advantage of the people's  magnanimity.    We would like to further indicate two points that are  important to carry out drastic deregulation and administrative  reform. The first is to attempt to solidify public opinion by  clarifying concrete goals and aims for the policy. Economic and  administrative reform covers a wide range of topics. While  Hosokawa promised to "promote visible administrative reform," it  is important to explain in easily understandable terms what  results are being targeted and how the actual changes will be  made.    The second point is the need to clarify the overall plan and  procedures and to create a structure that will implement the  process in a step-by-step manner. The government plans to  submit a bill in the current Diet session to establish a  committee on administrative reform that will promote supervision  of the administration and public disclosure of information.  That institution should be designed to bring together the power  of politics and public opinion.</p>

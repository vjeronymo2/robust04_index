			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Report": "Price of Peace in Cambodia"] </F>   [Text] King Sihanouk, disappointed with a lack of progress  in his attempt to hold dialogue for national reconciliation,  said in a news conference yesterday that he was sorry that the  conduct of the leaders of the Cambodian factions was not worthy  of the $3,000 million the world gave to the United Nations to  forge an end to the armed dispute and to hold general elections  last year. The king blamed continued disputes among the  Cambodian factions as the main cause of the political problem in  his country.    The $3 billion UN administration of Cambodia during the  transition period leading to the election was not just the most  expensive UN operation, it achieved only partial success. That  is, while the United Nations succeeded in organizing the  election and formation of government of the people, it failed to  achieved peace and national reconciliation, which were just as  important. To date, no one can tell how much more investment  will be needed to achieve the complete goal as desired by the  United Nations.    It is strange that while so far there is no answer to the  question of how much more the world has to pay to enable the  Cambodian people to avoid genocide, certain countries have  openly said that they are ready to make more investment by  sending in their soldiers or providing arms to the Cambodians.  This would only exacerbate the fighting in that country. It  appears as if the world has put a cap on its budget for peace in  Cambodia and has begun to contemplate a budget for war and  destruction. As long as the Cambodian factions continue their  disputes, the trend for more intense fighting could gain greater  support from other Western countries. If the Cambodian leaders  agree to the strange proposal advanced by the west, peace will  likely be achieved only by extermination of the Cambodian race.</p>

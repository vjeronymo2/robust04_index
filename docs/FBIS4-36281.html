			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source" at the GPC </F> General Committee]    [Text] The GPC's [General People's Congress] Standing  Committee has learned that the security agencies affiliated with  the gang of apostasy and secession in Aden have in the past few  days made collective arrests of many leaders and members of the  GPC branch in Aden, the economic and trade capital of the unity  state, which is now controlled by the gang of those who rebelled  against unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy, and  threw them in jails.    Information confirms that the security agencies of the rebel  gang raided houses of the GPC members on the pretext of  searching for weapons before arresting them and taking them to  detention centers.    Reliable sources said these security agencies did not inform  the families of some GPC members that they were detained. Other  information says the detainees were subjected to psychological  and physical torture at the hands of experts in torture after  they had refused to sign a statement supporting al-Bid's  declaration of secession.    The GPC Standing Committee is astonished by this criminal  conduct. It holds the criminal gang fully responsible for what  may happen to the detainees at the hands of their henchmen and  calls for their immediate release. The Standing Committee urges  all political parties and organizations and the popular  institutions and organizations to denounce this cowardly act,  which was carried out by the elements of apostasy and secession  in the Socialist Party. Having failed to face the valiant forces  of unity and constitutional legitimacy, these elements seek to  take revenge from the innocent civilians, including members of  our organization.    We also draw attention to the fact that these criminal,  suppressive acts carried out by the elements of rebellion and  secession in the Socialist Party expose the rigid totalitarian  mentality, the tyrannical suppressive will, and the  conspiratorial policies that still live at the minds of the  enemies of democracy, human rights, and civil liberties; and who  do not respect other opinions. These acts are yet another  addition to the series of crimes committed by this gang against  our people and will not go unpunished.</p>

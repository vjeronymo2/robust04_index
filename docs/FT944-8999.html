			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Politics, not control, behind UBS proposal Sir, Much has been written about Union Bank of Switzerland's proposal to convert its registered shares into bearers ('UBS holders urged to reject change', November 15). However, the discussion in the UK as well as in the US misses some important points. The row between UBS and BK Vision, its single biggest shareholder, may on the surface look like a contest for control. It is in fact a struggle with a highly political background. UBS's managers claim to have obligations to society which prevent them from maximising shareholder value. The fact that UBS's managers are willing to sacrifice profits in order to meet the demands of various 'stakeholders' may seem odd to Anglo-American investors and lend support to BK Vision's opposition. We have recently talked to Dr Martin Ebner, president of BK Vision, about his views on corporate governance. We would point out that Dr Ebner, while acting as a trustee for his own shareholders, has also adopted measures to entrench himself outside the influence of the stock market. Furthermore, he has left no doubt that he wants to use his voting power in public companies as an instrument to influence Swiss politics. Bearing in mind, for example, his hostility towards European integration of Switzerland, investors cannot be sure BK Vision will always stand for shareholders' interests. For institutional investors it may be tempting to support BK Vision in its bid to block the proposed simplification of UBS's capital structure. However, this is little more than a problem of a shift in control. As long as Swiss law allows discrimination against foreigners, the creation of differential voting rights, the introduction of voting limitations, and the like, there will be no market for corporate control worthy of its name. The real issue is whether UK and US investors want to be excluded in the future from control of Swiss companies in which they have invested. If this is the case let them vote for Mr Ebner. If not, they should start to fight for capital structures that allow competition for the resources of a public company at all times. Mr Ebner will not do this for them, as he has nothing to gain from such action. How long do Anglo-American investors want to sit idly by watching Nestle, Sandoz, Roche and others use international markets for corporate control, while at the same time being denied the gains from mergers and takeovers in Switzerland?

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Reich warns on rights of workers In the clearest statement yet of Washington's position on worker rights and trade, Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, yesterday said trade sanctions should be just one option in a 'menu' of possible international responses to rights abuses. Mr Reich, addressing the annual conference of the International Labour Organisation, also drew a firm distinction between a few 'absolute standards' which all countries should respect and other labour standards which could be expected to improve with rising levels of development. The US has led a campaign by industrialised nations for the links between 'internationally-recognised labour standards' and trade to go on the agenda for future trade talks. This continues to be resisted by many developing countries, which fear concern over worker rights is a pretext for putting up trade barriers against low-wage nations. Mr Reich outlined 'a short list' of core labour standards, including prison and slave labour, some forms of child labour such as work by very young children, and restrictions on trade union organisation and collective bargaining. 'Some labour practices simply place countries outside the community of civilised nations,' he said. Beyond that core, the international community could not dictate working hours, minimum wages, benefits, or health and safety standards which matched those of the rich industrial nations. However, it did have a legitimate interest in seeing standards rise with development. Countries with rising living standards offered growing markets for other countries' exports, he said. One test of whether labour standards were improving as economies grew richer was the existence of democratic institutions. Where these were lacking, a worsening of the position of low-wage workers, and a widening of the income gap between rich and poor, would suggest deliberate suppression of worker rights 'to serve narrow commercial interests'. However, Mr Reich did not see trade sanctions as the inevitable response to abuses. He said trade itself could be a catalyst for progressive change. Other remedies could include technical assistance to help raise standards, worldwide publicity for abuses and exclusion from international grant and loan programmes. International intervention should also be 'authorised and implemented multilaterally' if possible and aimed at bringing about change in offending nations.</p>

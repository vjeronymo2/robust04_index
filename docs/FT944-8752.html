			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Aspirin is a plant's best medicine Salicylic acid, the precursor of aspirin, has been found to play a central role in plants' ability to resist disease. Scientists at Ciba-Geigy in the US and Switzerland conducted experiments on transgenic tobacco plants which found that an accumulation of salicylic acid is essential for the expression of plant disease resistance. The lack of salicylic acid hinders acquired resistance and makes the plant more susceptible to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, according to the report in today's Science.

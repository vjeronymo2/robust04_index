			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 23 Febraury HOMMIKULEHT, PAEVALEHT, RAHVA HAAL, </F> POSTIMEES, pp 1,3; "News Bulletin" No. 37/94]    [Text] Wednesday, February 23 -- President Lennart Meri  called a special meeting of Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Interior  Minister Heiki Arike and Defence Forces Commander in Chief  General Aleksander Einseln yesterday to discuss the incident at  the Amari airfield. The Defence Ministry failed to ascertain the  location of Defence Minister Indrek Kannik, the presidential  chancellery press release added.    The meeting discussed the incident and the "unacceptable  inefficiency" of the information services to relay information  directly concerning Estonia's security and international  reputation, the press release read.    President Meri received Russian charge d'affaires Anatoliy  Ivanov yesterday, who relayed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  congratulations in connection with Estonia's national holiday.  The president assured the Russian representative that a  thorough investigation will be carried out and the guilty  persons will be punished.    Russian Charge d'Affaires Ivanov also met the head of the  Foreign Ministry political section Toivo Klaar, who expressed  his regret with Russia linking the incident to Estonia's  official policy and also criticised Russia's reaction to the  picketing of its naval HQ in Tallinn on Monday [21 February].  High Russian officials had described it as an inflammatory  action, leading to provocations like the incident in Amari. But  head of the Russian Foreign Ministry information section  Grigoriy Karasin stressed that the incident is not seen as a  political one. Still, he described it as a provocation.    The Interior Ministry considers a personal vendetta the most  likely version. The ministry press release expressed suspicions  that persons connected with the Russian Army unit may be  involved. Amari has been mentioned as a gateway for illegal  immigrants to Estonia and for the removal of stolen property to  Russia.</p>

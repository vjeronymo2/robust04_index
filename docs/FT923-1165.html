			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Banks reject Canary Wharf plan: Creditors may have to provide Pounds 170m for Jubilee line extension BANKERS to the troubled Canary Wharf development have rejected proposals for taking over control of the east London property project from a group of US investors which includes Mr Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor and Mr Lewis Ranieri, the investment banker. The proposal had been seen by some bankers as the only promising prospect of progressing the development. The banks' decision appears to end hopes of them securing outside capital for a vital private sector contribution to the costs of extending the Jubilee Underground line, which is crucial to Canary Wharf's prospects. The project's bankers will now have to decide in the next few days whether they themselves will provide the Pounds 170m needed. According to bankers gathered in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Canary Wharf's 11 leading bank creditors voted by 7 to 4 to reject the proposal, which had been handled through Smith Barney, the New York investment bank. The group was formed by Mr Paul Reichmann, founder of the east London development. A spokesman for Mr Reichmann last night put a brave face on the decision, saying: 'There have been a series of discussions and the group is hopeful that these discussions can continue'. Lloyds Bank, the UK clearer, led opposition to the consortium proposal, which was championed mainly by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Some banks opposed the bid because it would have left Mr Reichmann with an equity interest in the project, and they blame him for their losses on loans to the project. The group, which was proposing to inject between Pounds 235m and Pounds 350m into Canary Wharf, would have provided the first tranches of a private sector contribution to the Jubilee costs. The UK government insists the Jubilee extension to Canary Wharf and other parts of east London will not be built unless it receives a firm commitment on a private sector contribution by the end of the month. The extension is seen as essential to attract tenants and save the banks from huge losses on the Pounds 576m they lent to Canary Wharf. The banks are considering proposing to the government that if it rented space at Canary Wharf, the banks would refinance the buildings let to the government and pass the funds back as a Jubilee contribution. The administrators to the project, three partners of accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young appointed in May under UK insolvency legislation, want to put a proposal to the government in the next few days.

Japanese-U.S. trade frictions have lasted for 30 years. In  this period, the two countries continued to hold talks and  continued to work out new programs in an attempt to solve or  mitigate frictions. The latest round of such talks began after  the G-7 summit meeting in Tokyo last July.    An interesting fact was that the breakdown of the talks this  time did not cause the host and the guest to leave each other  unhappily. At the news conference, the two leaders made rather  frank speeches which were benign on their overall relations.  After admitting that the talks had broken down, Clinton said  that it was better to have reached no agreement than to have  reached an empty agreement. Hosokawa said that frankly admitting  things that could not be done was a demonstration of the  maturity of bilateral relations. The two leaders both agreed  that the breakdown of their economic talks would not affect the  cooperative Japanese-U.S. relationship in global affairs.    Public opinion here pointed out that all the previous  economic talks between the Japan and the United States ended  with Japanese concessions. This time, Japan explicitly said  "no," and this was also the first time Japan had done this.  After the breakdown of the talks, both sides frankly admitted  the fact of the breakdown and said that this would not affect  bilateral relations. This was also an unprecedented event.  Therefore, public opinion in Japan was rather elated at this  result. Japanese commentators said that although the talks did  not succeed, a new relationship of "being able to speak frankly"  between Japan and the United States had been established beyond  expectations. This was of great significance to Japan.    The dissolution of the Cold War-oriented world pattern has  weakened the binding force among Western countries, which have  attached greater importance to their respective national  interests in approaching their mutual relations. Among the  three major pillars of their relations, namely, political,  security, and economic pillars, the first two have become less  and less important, while the economic factor has become the  main factor deciding relations between the Western countries.    While major changes have occurred in the international  situation, the status of the United States is also becoming much  weaker than before, and Japan is adopting a much stronger sense  of being a big power. Such an objective situation has forced  the United States to attach importance to the principle of  "reaching agreement through consultations" in approaching its  relations with other Western countries. Eventually, Japan dared  to say "no" in the talks, and this could only appear in a book  rather than in reality a few years ago.    After the recent talks, will Japan really be able to stand  on  an equal footing with the United States? While expressing its  happiness, Japanese public opinion also paid attention to the  fact that after the breakdown of the talks, the hawk faction on  the U.S. side demanded that "Super 301" should be applied to  impose sanctions against Japan; they also noted that the U.S.  side this time was unconcerned mainly because it had confidence  derived from the beginning of its economic recovery. Therefore,  Japanese commentators said that while saying "no," Japan should  still take some initiatives in the economic field. Under the  current changeable and complicated international situation, the  development of Japanese-U.S. relations after the recent summit  meeting will become more significant.</p>

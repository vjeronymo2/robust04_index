			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Cambridge, Mass., became the first city in the nation to approve an ordinance  protecting the welfare of vertebrates used in experiments. City council members  voted 8 to 0 to expand on federal and state regulations concerning humane  treatment of laboratory animals by including all vertebrates -- animals with  backbones or spinal columns. Federal law deals with dogs, cats and monkeys to  the exclusion of reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits, said Steven  Wise, an animal rights attorney. The ordinance will affect Harvard University,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 11 other academic and private firms  engaged in animal research. The council created a commissioner's post to  oversee and enforce the new rules.  </P></p>

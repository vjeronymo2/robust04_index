			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP)--China emphatically denied  Thursday a Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper report that  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had made a rare public appearance  in the northeastern coastal city of Qingdao.    "This report is not true," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin told a weekly press briefing.    In a front-page article published Thursday, Wen Wei Po said  Deng's trip took place recently and quoted the 89-year-old  Chinese leader as telling local officials in Qingdao that China  "must not have a multi-party system."    The official rejection of the detailed report, which quoted  what were described as authoritative sources, was unusual given  the fact that the Wen Wei Po is backed by Beijing and often used  by the Chinese authorities.    Asked to clarify Deng's present whereabouts, Wu said simply:  "Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is."    Deng's last public appearance was at Lunar New Year in  February when he appeared on Shanghai television looking frail  and physically supported by his daughters.    The ailing leader's health is a constant source of intense  speculation.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> DELAY OF HOTEL OK SOUGHT  </P> <P> Malibu's unofficial City Council will ask the California Coastal Commission to  delay approval of a luxury hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean until after the  community becomes a city.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the council on Tuesday approved asking for the delay,  saying the community should help to decide the future of the 300-room,  $65-million hotel that the Adamson Cos. wants to build.  </P> <P> The state panel last month approved the final grading plans for the 27-acre  hotel site near Pepperdine University.  </P> <P> The panel approved the hotel in principle five years ago, but stipulated that  the hotel must be served by a sewer system before it is allowed to operate.  </P> <P> Concerned that Los Angeles County's proposed sewer system for Malibu might not  win the commission's approval, Adamson wants permission to build its own waste  treatment facility. The firm's request was to have been heard by the panel next  week but was delayed until at least January after the commission staff said it  needed more information.  </P></p>

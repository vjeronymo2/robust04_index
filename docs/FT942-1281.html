			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph plunges on price war Publishing stocks pre-empted the weakness in the London stock market as The Telegraph saw its shares sold heavily after joining battle in the price war started by the Murdoch newspaper group. The stock touched a low of 340p and closed 191 down at 349p with 6.3m shares traded, one of its biggest daily turnovers since flotation at 325p a share two years ago. The Telegraph decision to cut its weekday cover price to 30p from 48p and the accompanying statement that revenue would fall by Pounds 40m this year sent analysts scurrying to lower their forecasts for this year and next. And news that The Times is to reduce its price further, announced after the market closed, is likely to cause further turmoil in the sector today. It also marked a significant scaling up of the price battle in the UK newspaper industry and consequently sent shares in United Newspapers, owners of the Daily Express, down 83 to 510p, Daily Mail Trust 178 lower to 1275p and Mirror Group Newspapers, which not only has a big stake in the Independent but is also suffering the effects of the price cut by Mr Murdoch's Sun newspaper, down 31 to 134p with 14m shares changing hands. The Stock Exchange is believed to have launched a full inquiry into the Telegraph share trading. In particular, the exchange will be looking very closely at when the company first began to consider cutting its newspaper cover price. A month ago, Hollinger, the Canadian company controlled by Telegraph owner Mr Conrad Black, offloaded 12.5m Telegraph shares at 587p, and under Stock Exchange rules a company cannot deal in its shares if it has undisclosed price-sensitive information. Ms Lorna Tilbian of SG Warburg said: 'All hell will break loose. You cannot place a stake on May 19 and have a price war on June 23.' Ms Tilbian cut her current year Telegraph profits forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 47.5m and her estimate for next year by Pounds 22.5m to the same figure.</p>

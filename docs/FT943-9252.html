			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Efficiency measures fail to help energy trust Measures to encourage more efficient electricity use are included in the price controls, although they will not help the government's beleaguered Energy Savings Trust. Electricity companies have an incentive to sell as much electricity as possible because their profits are directly related to volume. In future volume will account for only half the 'revenue driver' which determines a company's profits. The other half will be based on the number of customers the company has. Prof Littlechild argues that this will reduce the volume incentive while encouraging companies to go out and seek new customers. He will also allow companies to keep more of the profits made from reducing power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of the electricity passing through the system. Prof Littlechild expects these measures to produce savings equivalent to the electricity used by a city the size of Nottingham. However, he decided against introducing fresh measures to curb demand for electricity. Last year he approved an allowance in the price controls that will raise Pounds 100m in four years for electricity companies to spend on energy efficiency projects. He said yesterday that he was unwilling to increase this because the full costs and benefits of demand side measures have not yet been established in the UK. He also believed that it was not the regulator's job to impose what was essentially a tax on consumers, even if it was for a worthy cause. This marks a further blow for the government-sponsored Energy Savings Trust, which is supposed to raise several hundred million pounds from gas and electricity users for domestic energy efficiency work. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, has already said that funding for the trust is a matter for parliament, not her. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the review because it 'reversed the regulator's position on the Energy savings Trust'. He also said that the reduction of the volume component of the revenue driver to 50 per cent was not enough to cut the profligacy of the electricity companies. 'It's 25 per cent in Northern Ireland and 10 per cent in the gas industry because that is what the real costs are,' he said.</p>

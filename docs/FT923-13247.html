			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Snipers 'firing on aid convoys to Sarajevo' SNIPERS around the beleaguered city of Sarajevo are firing on ambulances and aircraft carrying relief supplies to the Bosnian capital, a United Nations agency said yesterday, Reuter reports. 'People are taking pot-shots at anything with 'humanitarian' written on it,' Ms Sylvana Foa, of the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in Geneva. Ms Foa said aircraft landing at Sarajevo's airport with relief supplies for the city's estimated 300,000 inhabitants 'are taking hits as they come in'. 'A bullet shattered the window of one ambulance right by the head of one of our people who was riding in it,' she said. Sarajevo has been under siege since April from Bosnian Serbs opposed to the republic's independence. UN peace-keepers in Sarajevo yesterday accused both Serbs and the Croat and Moslem forces which oppose them of ceasefire violations hours after mortar bombs landed near their headquarters. In another incident, UN troops returned fire and killed a Serb sniper who slightly wounded a Canadian soldier at Sarajevo airport, a UN spokesman said. He added that a record 25 relief flights to Sarajevo were expected yesterday. The leaders of the three warring factions agreed to come to London today to meet Lord Carrington, the European Community envoy, in a new attempt to end the fighting. Meanwhile, Serb forces are said to be confident that within 48 hours they will capture the town of Gorazde, 70km east of Sarajevo. Serb forces launched an offensive on the mostly Moslem-populated town on Saturday, deploying tanks and pounding it with heavy artillery. All communications with the town, with a 70,000 population including 10,000 children, are cut. The town is critically short of food and medicine.</p>

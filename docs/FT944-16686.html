			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Amersham/Sumitomo The logic behind yesterday's first step by Amersham towards a radio-pharmaceuticals joint-venture with Sumitomo Chemical is convincing. The deal fills Amersham's strategic gap in the world's second largest market, which is expanding at 15 per cent a year. It gives the British group local manufacturing and distribution, important in Japan where physicians prefer prescribing a particular form of product that has an especially short shelf-life and so cannot be imported. Access to the fruits of Sumitomo's R&amp;D efforts could eventually prove handy. At a maximum of 26 times historic earnings, the price does not seem steep for a Japanese company. Such deals are not easy in Japan. Amersham has limited any risks by taking particular care to smooth the venture with its established partner Chugai. The transaction is also a feather in the cap for Morgan Stanley. Investment bankers have been attempting to tie up such deals for many years. Few have succeeded. For Sumitomo, the move is good news after a run of bad. Sales of Sumiferon, its top-selling interferon, have tumbled since March when the government warned that the drug could cause severe depression and then cut the medicine's price by 19.5 per cent. The recent decisions by SmithKline Beecham, Zeneca and Upjohn to dissolve their respective joint ventures with Sumitomo have also wounded. Although Amersham's link-up is to be welcomed, it does not secure the long term future of the pharmaceuticals subsidiary. Sumitomo Chemical may be a giant, but its drugs wing remains a pharmaceuticals pigmy. Other Western companies looking to increase their presence in Japan might consider approaching the group to forge a more permanent alliance.</p>

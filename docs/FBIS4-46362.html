			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 8 Jun (EFE) -- A police source confirmed today  that the Peruvian Police thwarted a large-scale terrorist attack  through the arrest of a woman believed to be the main Shining  Path [SL] military chief in Lima.    Police sources reported that terrorists planned to detonate  a  car bomb containing 600 kg of explosives in Lima on 17 May on  the 14th anniversary of the launching of the SL "people's war."    The attack was aborted when extremist Ayma Rosa Cabanillas  Contreras, 22 years old, was arrested. She confessed that she  was chosen to conduct the subversive operation and to provide  the necessary materials to those entrusted with perpetrating the  attack.    Cabanillas Contreras has four police records for involvement  in terrorist attacks. The police source said she was arrested  on 10 May "after an exhaustive intelligence operation that  started about four months ago."    Cabanillas has been placed at the disposal of the military  courts on charges of "treason against the fatherland," the legal  term in Peru for aggravated terrorist crimes. If found guilty,  she could be sentenced to life imprisonment.    Cabanillas is the second SL leader to be arrested by the  Peruvian Police in the past two months. The police already  arrested Felipe Tenorio, believed to be the SL "Number Two."    The SL organization split in 1993 after its top-ranking  leader, Abimael Guzman -- who was arrested in 1992 -- recognized  the political and military defeat of the SL and submitted a  peace proposal to the government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic  planner said Tuesday [14 Jun] he is not convinced the country's  economy is rebounding.    Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency (EPA), distanced himself from bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno, who said Monday the economy has moved "one step  toward a recovery."    "I cannot confidently say the economy has entered a recovery  phase, although I do feel much better about it," Terasawa said  at a press conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    He said he will wait before declaring an economic recovery,  citing capital spending and foreign exchange rates as his main  concerns.    "My concerns will dissapear if capital spending firms up,"  Teresawa said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS Correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek May 5 TASS -- Parliamentarians from Russia,  Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan and representatives of  Nagorno-Karabakh worked late into the night on Wednesday [4 May]  and resumed discussions early on Thursday morning to try and  find a way around the stumbling block which, according to the  leader of the Armenian parliamentary commission on  Nagorno-Karabakh, Seiran Bagdasaryan, is formed by Azerbaijan's  state policy rejecting the introduction of CIS peace-keepers and  CSCE observers to the Karabakh region.    According to Bagdasaryan, Azerbaijan has not made up its  mind  concerning the main question about the disengagement of the  warring forces. Only after the guns become silent, will it be  possible to begin peace talks, bring back the refugees and  exchange hostages. Azerbaijan is proposing a simple lull, but  the situation is calling for the beginning of a lengthy process  which can guarantee the non-resumption of combat activities,  Bagdasaryan said.    Different variants of stationing peace-keeping forces have  been proposed. In April the Azeri leader, President Heydar  Aliyev refused to sign the resolution on the sending of CIS  troops to the region approved by the CIS summit. At present the  Azeri delegation is dragging feet in order not to sign a simple  protocol, containing a call on the heads of state and  parliaments to from CIS peace-keeping contingent and begin a  peaceful dialogue. This is a practical attempt at hiding behind  verbiage about Azerbaijan's sovereignty in an effort to avoid  any solution to the Karabakh problem, Bagdasaryan said.    The Azers are again trying to use these talks in order to  play for time, while they are preparing their troops for new  offensive, the Armenian parliamentarian said. Political  realities are now such that Azerbaijan will have to recognise  Nagorno-Karabakh's independence. Policy can no longer be build  on quantitative indices of the sort that there are seven million  of Azers and only 150 thousand of Karabakh people. World  experience shows that this is by far not the most decisive  factor, Bagdasaryan said. He stressed his confidence that  Azerbaijan would have to recognise Karabakh's independence  earlier or later.    As concerns talks as a whole, Bagdasaryan said they are  necessary because they help CIS parliamentarians to know each  other better, clarify their respective positions and make steps  towards peace. Meetings of this kind also help strengthen the  CIS inter-parliamentary assembly, which is a promising process,"  the Armenian envoy said.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANDLORD-CITY FEUD ERUPTS OVER LAW ON SECURITY DEPOSITS  </P> <P> New city ordinances designed to ease financial burdens on low-income renters  have touched off a political donnybrook that is pitting a local landlord  coalition against Los Angeles city officials in a fight for the rightful claim  to apartment security deposits.  </P> <P> Arguing that the money belongs to tenants, rent regulators and City Council  members leveled sharp criticism Friday at the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los  Angeles for suing the city in Los Angeles Superior Court to overturn a law  requiring that owners of rent-controlled apartments pay tenants 5% interest on  security deposits.  </P> <P> The group, which says the law is biased and financially injurious, also filed a  second suit seeking to challenge a companion ordinance that bars landlords from  raising rent by more than 10% when adult tenants move into occupied  rent-controlled units. Under the same ordinance, landlords cannot increase rent  at all if the new tenant is a newborn.  </P> <P> The suits seek to stop enforcement of the ordinances, which took effect earlier  this month.  </P> <P> According to the security deposit ordinance, a landlord must begin paying  interest on the security deposit a year after the tenant moves into the unit.  The security-deposit ordinance affects only the 480,000 housing units subject  to rent-control law. Thus, about 40% of the rental units in Los Angeles are  unaffected by the measures.  </P> <P> City officials, annoyed about the suit, dismissed the litigation as unfounded  and threatened to impose even tougher measures on apartment owners.  </P> <P> "The suit is nonsense," said City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents  the 5th District on the Westside. "(The landlords) have no clue about what a  tenant in this city is faced with in terms of finding affordable housing."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said the landlords' resistance to the ordinances showed their  callousness toward the plight of their tenants, many of whom can only afford  apartment units under rent-control law.  </P> <P> "If they insist on pursuing this line of attack against landlord-tenant law,  perhaps the next solution will be to simply prohibit security deposits of any  type," said Yaroslavsky, who supported the controversial measures when the City  Council approved them last October. "I think this will have a more deleterious  effect on the landlord, and it might have a more positive effect on the  creation of affordable housing.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to consider it. Perhaps it should be looked at."  </P> <P> But association attorney Trevor Grimm argued that the city cannot force  apartment owners to pay the interest because security deposits, the money  tenants give landlords before moving into apartment units, do not belong to  tenants.  </P> <P> "If it were their money, they could spend it, invest it, but they can't," said  Grimm. "It's got a hook in it. It is an escrow account. It is meant to  compensate the landlord for damage to the apartment, unpaid rent or the cost of  cleaning the apartment. It loses its character as the tenants' money."  </P> <P> Any attempt to prohibit security deposits would violate state law, Grimm said,  including the current interest-payment ordinance.  </P> <P> But city officials insisted that they do have the right to impose the interest  payments. Furthermore, they said, the money indeed belongs to the tenants, that  landlords can lay claim to security deposits only as recompense.  </P> <P> "It gets down to the old story: a bank, when it takes your money, pays you  interest; a stock pays dividends," said Yaroslavsky. "Why shouldn't a landlord  be required to pay you interest on your money?"  </P> <P> While other city officials expressed skepticism about a wholesale ban on  security deposits, they agreed that the landlords' arguments were baseless.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will stand up in court," said Michael Bodaken, housing  coordinator for Mayor Tom Bradley's office. "I think that this law is a  legitimate attempt by the city to prevent rent gouging."  </P> <P> He and other officials pointed out that other major urban centers, most notably  New York City and Chicago, have similar measures.  </P> <P> Grimm complained that the ordinance discriminates against the owners of  rent-controlled units.  </P> <P> "It segregates owners of rent-controlled units, whereas owners of other units  don't have to pay," said Grimm.  </P> <P> City rent regulators said the dispute illustrates a constant war between  landlords and tenants.  </P> <P> "This is a classic example," said Barbara Zeidman, director of rent  stabilization for the city. "In rent control, there is very rarely an argument  of who's right and who's wrong. It's a matter of competing rights."  </P></p>

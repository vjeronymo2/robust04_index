			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Skopje, June 26 (TANJUG) -- A Serb party in the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) said on  Sunday that F.Y.R.O.M. census takers were registering Serb  families in pencil and refusing to register those Serbs to whom  the authorities had either denied or not gotten round to  granting citizenship.    The early census in the F.Y.R.O.M. began on June 21 and is  due to be completed by July 5, at a cost of 1.7 million dollars,  financed and monitored by the European Union and the Council of  Europe.    The Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia said in a  statement the Serbs had been justified to warn European experts  of possible fraud in connection with the Serbs' citizenship  designed to minimise their numbers.    According to the previous census, taken in 1991, the  F.Y.R.O.M. had a population of 1.3 million, 2.3 per cent or  50,000 of whom were Serbs. The Serbs, however, immediately  challenged the results. The Association of Serbs and  Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. insists that the country has a  quarter of a million strong Serb community, 50,000 of whom in  the northern Kumanovo commune alone.    The Democratic Party of Serbs claims that various forms of  pressure are being brought to bear on the Serbs during the  current census, and that even the party's activists in the field  are being threatened with 60 days in prison for drawing  attention to the fraudulent activities of authorities and  census-takers.    As a special form of pressure, incidents on the border with  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) are being fabricated and then  taken as a pretext for waging a massive anti-Serb media campaign.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A military spokesman for the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine--General Command [PFLP-GC] has stated  the following:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate:    Military communique:    In confirmation of the threats that Clinton has made to  those  who oppose the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement and after the ceremony of  selling and liquidating our people's rights and cause,  represented by the agreement signed by 'Arafat and Rabin in  Cairo on the 4th of this month, the outlines of this agreement  and its secret annexes have started to be translated into  actions on the ground against the positions of the strugglers.    At 1200 today, 10 May 1994, squadrons of the Zionist-U.S.  enemy aircraft carried out several barbaric raids on PFLP-GC  institutions that provide humanitarian, medical, and other  services in the al-Na'imah area south of Beirut. The enemy  aircraft carried out six raids over a period of two hours on  these positions, hurling tonnes of their hatred and destruction.  The Zionist aircraft continue to overfly the area.    The military spokesman continued: We in the PFLP-GC view  this Zionist aggression as an extension of the Hebron massacre  and the policy of killing and terrorism that the U.S. peace  brings with it and which pursues its open war against our  people's aspirations and rights and seeks to undermine the  morale of the mujahdin who struggle to regain their rights.    As for our losses, they are limited and minor. We will issue  a communique later as the situation and needs dictate.    The military spokesman added: It is important for us in the  PFLP-GC to emphasize to the masses of our nation and people that  our political stand and struggle will continue in spite of what  is being concocted against our rights, against our people, and  against our nation. We are confident about achieving inevitable  victory. The Zionist-U.S. policy of terrorism will not separate  us from our cause. We pledge to pursue the revolution until the  liberation of land and man.    [Signed] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command</p>

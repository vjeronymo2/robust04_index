			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / People: Guignard quits Greycoat The expected board shake-out at Greycoat, the property developer rescued from the brink of collapse almost a year ago, was announced yesterday, perhaps rather sooner than had been thought. However, according to Michael Beckett, who became non-executive chairman in September: 'The sooner you do these things, the better. It is the final stage of the group's refinancing and restructuring process, which has been going on for a period of time. This now cements it.' Richard Guignard, 52, and for the past three years a managing director, is retiring from the board in an atmosphere of 'no animosity', according to Beckett. It was Guignard who 'was responsible for conceiving and implementing the successful financial restructuring in 1993'. His settlement is Pounds 75,000 gross, with no extras; his salary had been Pounds 180,000. John Weir, like Guignard with the company since 1982, has also stepped down as an executive. He will continue to oversee the US operation 'until the properties there are sold or transferred, probably spring next year', says Beckett. On the non-executive side, George Constantinidi, interim chairman until the arrival of Beckett, and George Pitt have resigned, to be replaced by Stephen James and David Tucker. James recently retired as senior partner of Simmons &amp; Simmons, the City law firm; he also has extensive property involvement. Tucker was a former deputy managing director of M&amp;G Group and therefore 'knows the City and City practice', according to Beckett. Julian Treger and Brian Myerson, the South African financiers credited with the resuscitation of the company and made non-executive directors in the light of the 12.44 per cent shareholding of their vehicle, will remain as non-executives. However, Treger will resign in March, when he and Myerson will become alternate directors.</p>

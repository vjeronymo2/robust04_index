			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Early gains in Treasuries quickly evaporate US Treasury bonds held close to their opening prices yesterday in spite of a weaker than expected reading on consumer confidence. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at 93 13/16 , with the yield rising to 8.043 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 1/2 , to yield 6.795 per cent. After a day of heavy losses, the selling pressure on the long end eased on a mildly favourable piece of economic news. The Conference Board, a trade group, said its October index of consumer sentiment slipped to 87.6, from 89.5 the previous month. The data were positive for inflation-sensitive bonds because they suggested less spending by consumers. The development offset an earlier announcement by the National Association of Realtors that September sales of existing homes had climbed 1 per cent from the August level. The figure was not strong enough to discourage bargain hunting, with the 30-year bond yield at its highest level in more than two years, but the overall tone of the market was weak, and the early gains quickly evaporated. Traders remained concerned about an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates. The prospect of a tightening, considered likely near the Fed's November 15 policy-making session, discouraged buyers across the yield curve. Traders were looking ahead to Friday's estimate of third-quarter growth amid fears that the central bank is allowing the economy to expand too fast. More immediately, the market was facing an influx of fresh supply when its ability to absorb the new securities was in question. The first tranche came with the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. As expected, demand was tepid, but bond prices managed to hold steady. The action did not bode well for today's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Meanwhile, the dollar showed only vague signs of reversing its recent slide on the foreign exchange markets. It inched ahead against the D-mark but receded some more against the yen. The bond market was bracing itself for further declines by the dollar as the week progressed. European government bonds fell in another volatile session, with Germany leading the losses. Most markets opened lower following overnight weakness in US Treasuries and tumbled further after breaching key technical support levels in the futures markets. US consumer confidence data helped bonds claw back some of their losses, but prices slipped again in late trading. German bunds ended a volatile day sharply lower, depressed by new supply, investor selling and the breach of key technical support lines on the December bund future. After breaching support at 89.50 and 89.00, it hit an intra-day low of 88.50 before ending at 88.76, down 0.71. The first DM3bn tranche of a new 7 3/4 per cent 10-year bond for Germany's postal authority also pressured prices as dealers sold futures against it. A second tranche is to be sold today via a US-style auction. Although the paper offers an attractive yield pick-up over bunds, it is expected to draw little foreign demand and go mostly into domestic accounts. Dealers reported investor sales amid fragile market sentiment. 'There has been some liquidation by people who got long after the election,' said a London bund dealer. UK gilts were dragged over  1/2 point lower by Treasuries and bunds and depressed further by the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey. Most dealers said they expected today's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction to go relatively well in spite of the market's weakness, calling for a bid-to-cover ratio of between 1.5 and 2 times and a tail (the difference between the average and the lowest accepted bid) of no more than 2. They were expecting demand to be boosted by the paper's status as next year's five-year benchmark and the absence of a gilt auction in November. French government bonds fell by more than  1/2 point but out-performed bunds as investors switched into France from Germany. The stronger franc also helped, attracting some outright cash buying, dealers said. While the December OAT future on Matif fell by 0.60 points, the French 10-year benchmark bond's yield premium over bunds narrowed to 67 basis points from 74 basis points on Tuesday. Italian government bonds were also supported by spread trades out of bunds into BTPs; Italy's 10-year yield gap narrowed to 449 basis points from 465 basis points on Tuesday.</p>

The night visitors concentrated their campaign on al-Nuzhah,  Wadi al-Haddadah, al-Rusayfah, al-Mafraq, and other areas of  Amman.    Musa Hasan Sulayman and his brother Mustafa were arrested in  Bayadir Wadi al-Sayr, while Muhammad Fakhri, Nabil  Abu-Harithiyah, and Iyad Shaqildi were arrested in other Amman  areas. 'Ala' Abu-Uways and Jawad al-Faqih were arrested in  al-Rusayfah.    The security forces stormed the houses of 'Isam Muhammad  Tahir, known as Abu-Muhammad, and Ahmad Faysal Nazzal and  confiscated books and papers. The security forces are still  searching for the two men who are accused of leading an illegal  religious group.    AL-BILAD learned that the arrested are charged with  affiliation to an illegal party, Muhammad's Army, and that they  are mainly Jordanians who volunteered to fight in Afghanistan.    The security organs accused Muhammad's Army of attempting to  topple the regime two years ago.</p>

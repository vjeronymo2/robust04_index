			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Vila, May 27 (AFP) -- The Vanuatu Government  said Friday it had decided to restrict logging and ban timber  exports to protect the environment of this island nation.    The Council of Ministers made its decision Thursday  following  a recent environmental study, acting on a recommendation by  Prime Minister Maxime Carlot, government spokeswoman Yvette Sam  said.    Sam said the decision mainly affected four companies logging  on the southern island of Erromango with licences issued last  year that allowed them to exceed the quotas recommended in the  study.    The government decided to halve the number of logging  companies in Erromango to two within a month and to restrict the  volume of wood cut in Vanuatu to an annual 25,000 cubic metres  (32,500 cubic yards), as recommended by the Australian-funded  study.    It would also ban all wood exports from June 15 to encourage  processing within Vanuatu.    Representatives of European Union countries told Carlot on  May 17 of their concern about the scale of logging in Vanuatu,  reminding him of EU funding for sustainable logging projects.    Carlot had promised to take action, saying excess logging  was  a "serious problem."</p>

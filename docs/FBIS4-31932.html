			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part I of "Summary of the Program of the Right-Wing </F> Democratic Party of Albania"]    [Text] The Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania (PDDSH)  is a political force which aims at coalescing around itself all  honest Albanians who are against communism, fascism, or any  other form of totalitarian ideology. The PDDSH struggles for a  free and democratic Albania where full freedom of the  individual, private property, religion, thinking, expression,  and action should be guaranteed in a lawful and democratic state.  <H5>  The Political Position of the PDDSH </H5>   1. The PDDSH is a political force on the right wing of the  Albanian political spectrum, relying on and defending the rights  of all those who are in favor of a firm anticommunist stand. It  primarily relies on the broad masses of former political  prisoners and detainees, former owners stripped of their  property by the communist dictatorship, the broad masses of  workers, both employed or economically assisted by the state,  honest intellectuals, the youth of Albania, suffering women of  Albania, and the Albanian patriotic peasantry.    2. The PDDSH will cooperate with other political right wing  forces for the creation of a common anticommunist front.    3. The PDDSH will not accept any agreement with forces of  neo- communist and communist convictions and stands.    4. The PDDSH will turn down any political agreement with  extremist forces that aspire to resort to violence.    5. The PDDSH will work to attract the rank and file PD  [Democratic Party] members who nurture right-wing democratic  aspirations. The PDDSH will not enter into any relationship with  the present PD leadership, because it thinks that they hold  neocommunist views and positions.    6. The PDDSH will carry out its political activities in a  democratic way, rigorously respecting the constitutional order  and laws of the state.    7. The PDDSH is a party of clear nationalist stance. It will  strive to protect Albania's freedom, independence, and national  interests. The PDDSH is for an ethnic Albania, created through  the free expression of our people's will in the motherland and  the will of our brothers living in their own territories in  Montenegro, Sandjak, Kosova, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as well as the will of the  expropriated Cams, who were expelled from their legitimate lands  in Greece. Working for the realization of these aspirations, the  PDDSH declares itself against any violent changes of the  existing state borders of Albania with its neighboring countries.    8. The PDDSH will resolutely fight for the thorough  eradication of communism and neocommunism in Albania. In this  respect, it will also work for:    - the creation of a state commission which should  investigate  and bring to account the former ruling communists who have  perpetrated political genocide against the people or have their  hands stained with the blood of innocent people.    - the weeding out of former communists from responsible  positions and decisionmaking bodies of the state administration.    - the investigation of business activities of unscrupulous  speculators who have illicitly become rich and against whom  measures should be taken, including expropriation in accordance  with the law.    9. The PDDSH is for guaranteeing the rights of national  minorities living in Albania, strictly honoring relevant  international agreements.    10. The PDDSH will work for the state to protect the  legitimate rights of our fellow countrymen who are permanently  or temporarily living in other countries. The PDDSH will strive  to mobilize our compatriots, however they live, in our country's  political, cultural, and economic life.  <H5>  The PDDSH's Economic Program </H5>   1. The PDDSH is for a market economy, but economic reform in  Albania should take into consideration our country's specific  political, social, and economic conditions created following the  collapse of the cruel communist dictatorship. The PDDSH is  against the "shock therapy" and in favor of a gradual reform  resulting in less drastic consequences during the transition  period.    2. The PDDSH will work to reduce the unemployment level by  taking the following main measures:    a. Putting under operation state-owned profitable  enterprises  mainly in food, textiles, mining industry, and in agriculture,  etc.    b. Investing in projects that create more new jobs in  infrastructure, forestry, tourism, and so forth.    c. Encouraging private business of productive character,  which involves more manpower.    d. Rapid privatization at all levels of state-owned  enterprises.    3. The PDDSH will strive to narrow at fast speed the  existing  differences between the real pay and price level, in the  following aspects:    a. Control, through a discouraging fiscal system, over the  uncontrollable price hikes.    b. Gradual increase of salaries, pensions, and assistance  allowances.    c. Tax exemption of pensioners, unemployed people receiving  economic assistance, invalids, and children, and ticket price  reduction for them in state-owned transport, cultural and sports  activities, public services, electrical energy, dental services,  school texts, and so on.    4. The PDDSH will work to draft a state financial budget on  a  more studied basis, bearing in mind the following:    -- More rational rapports between investment and  assistance, giving priority to the former so as to enable work  and production to start again from scratch.    -- Drastic cuts in unproductive costs, particularly in  state administration, army, and so on.    5. The PDDSH will struggle in a lawful way to abrogate  immediately the Law No. 7,689 of 15 April 1993 "On the  Restitution and Compensation of Buildings and Lands," and No.  7501 of 10 July 1993 "On the Agricultural Land." It will strive  for new laws to be passed that should thoroughly honor the  legitimate rights of former owners in towns and countryside to  total and unconditional restitution of their property,  arbitrarily grabbed by the communist state and not given back  even by the present laws in force. The PDDSH will strive that  the new laws on property contain the following legal obligations  to the owners:    a. Immediate and unconditional restitution of the existing  buildings.    b. Immediate restitution of free land grounds, or those on  which economic or cultural facilities and villa type dwellings  have been built.    c. Compensation in value, in other land grounds or in  buildings (according to the former owner's right to choose) for  all the land grounds occupied by multistory dwellings (apartment  flats).    d. Compensation in value, or in other land grounds, for  occupied land grounds on which social facilities have been  built, like hospitals, schools, kindergartens and nurseries,  roads, parks, stadiums, and sport fields.    e. Full restitution of agricultural lands, olive trees,  grazing lands and forests to poor, middle or rich former owners  living in towns or in the countryside.    f. In areas where the state possesses large areas of land,  the former landowners can be compensated, if they so wish, in  plots of land from the state-owned land.    g. Peasants, who according to "the Land Law" have received  plots of land, remain as tenants of this land now belonging to  its former owner. The owner cannot send the tenant away from  this land earlier than a period of five years. After this  period, new contractual agreements can be concluded between the  owner of the land and the tenant.    In this case, the tenants who have rented the land do not  pay  any more taxes to the state.    6. The PDDSH will fight for the abrogation of the existing  laws on privatization, because they sanction the privileges of  red businessmen and violate the rights of former owners,  political detainees, and the working people. The PDDSH will  strive for a minute revision of privatization, according to the  following criteria:    a. Small and medium-size enterprises should be privatized by  selling them on credit to former owners of objects, land  grounds, former political detainees, and people working in them.  The credit will be paid back within a delayed period of five to  10 years, without any bank interest rate.    b. Large enterprises will be converted into shareholder  enterprises in which 51 percent of the shares will initially  remain state-owned property and 49 percent will be given free of  charge to the workers of the respective enterprises.    c. With the abrogation of the government decision which has  divided land to the working people for use, the agricultural  enterprises will be revived and converted into shareholder  enterprises, where shares will be divided according to the "b"  clause of this article.    d. In agricultural enterprises set up on land that was  formerly private property, the land, together with the economic  projects built on it, will be given back to the former owner of  the land, who is obliged to offer employment to not less than  one farmer per family, for a period of two to three years. These  types of enterprises can also be turned into private shareholder  enterprises by agreement with the owner or owners who are  carrying out their economic activities in the territory of  former state enterprises.    7. The PDDSH is for the restitution to the former owners of  riches expropriated or confiscated without compensation by the  communist state, such as toppled buildings, livestock, monetary  values, and so on. This will be gradually realised within a  period of several years.    8. The state should compensate the political prisoners and  detainees of the communist regime according to their relevant  status in the following main directions:    a. Compensation in cash for the period of their sentence  term  in jails or concentration camps.    b. Free of charge privatization of state-houses they are  living in.    c. Providing homeless people with free housing by the state.    d. Credits without bank interest rate, enabling them to  start  up business, and priority to the privatization of economic  enterprises. Priority to employment.    e. Awarding study scholarships at home and abroad.    9. The PDDSH will encourage foreign investment in Albania.  The PDDSH is of the opinion that the restitution of property to  its former owners will attract foreign investors. The PDDSH is  for offering stimulus to investment by large and serious foreign  companies and creating procedural facilities for the conclusion  of relevant contracts. A state administrative body will be set  up for this purpose. It will deal with all the necessary  practices that are currently dispersed among many government  bodies, causing undue delays and concern to the foreign  investors, and leaving room for corruption.    The PDDSH is of the opinion that in certain important  sectors  of our economy like agriculture, tourism, mining, and forestry,  a policy of concessions must be pursued as a most profitable  policy in our conditions, which would further encourage foreign  and serious investors. Priority in these concessions will be  given to agreements between governments.    10. The PDDSH will work to attract most favorable credits to  our country. Work will be done for more acceptable rapports  between investment funds and those for technical assistance.    11. The PDDSH will see that the credits received by the  Albanian banks really serve to encourage productive activities.  In this respect, the following basic criteria will be pursued:    -- To lower bank interest rates to medium international  levels.    -- To create favorable conditions (longer terms with lower  interest rate) for productive activities which create new jobs  in agriculture, construction, public services, etc.    12. The PDDSH will strive, through a favoring fiscal policy  and state investments, to support and encourage the activities  of those enterprises that produce domestic goods, especially in  food, tobacco, the textile industry, etc.    13. The PDDSH is for the immediate creation of a stock  exchange market. It is of the opinion that the setting up of  private shareholder companies will mark a consolidating step for  the market economy in Albania.  <H5>  The PDDSH's Agrarian Policy </H5>   The PDDSH considers agriculture as one of the main branches  of our economy, which plays and will still play in the future a  primary role in our country's economic development. In this  respect, the PDDSH will work to create conditions for Albanian  agriculture and the Albanian countryside to embark really and as  soon as possible upon a modern and intensive level of  development, capable of successfully competing in the  international market. To achieve this goal, the PDDSH will work  in the following directions:    1. The production structures of the private agricultural  economies should be defined by their owners themselves,  according to the requirements of the market. The prospective  development of agriculture will be guided by the state along a  policy of subsidies. Given its suitable climatic and soil  conditions, Albanian agriculture will be oriented toward the  cultivation of tobacco, vineyards, cultivation of vegetables,  strawberries and flowers in greenhouses, and toward animal  husbandry.    2. Given the difficulties in creating a modern and  competitive agricultural technology due to the large  fragmentation of the land, the PDDSH will work (by providing  credits, subsidies, and a favorable fiscal system) for the  creation of farmers' units and private shareholder enterprises  in the production sphere, agricultural machinery, transport,  collecting and trading the products, and in the bank system, etc.    3. The PDDSH will work to encourage and stimulate the  setting  up of private farms by specialists in agriculture, the state  renting them land from its own land (10-12 hectares) and  offering them assistance with credits at low interest rates,  exempting them from rent tax, and reducing their income tax for  the first two or three years, etc.    4. The state, through a license system, will encourage the  creation of private rural centers for selling seeds, pesticides,  and chemical fertilizers. These centers will be required to be  run by agronomists of high education.    5. The PDDSH will insist that a network of centers of  technical assistance and control over agriculture be organized  on a village- commune basis so as to ensure effective assistance  and control over the development of agriculture and animal  husbandry, according to technical discipline, strictly  respecting the legislation in force.    6. The PDDSH is for offering support to joint ventures with  foreign investment, by respecting parity in invested capitals  and clearly defining the mutual obligations and profits in  advance.    The state will also assist in creating enterprises with  foreign investors, renting to them land from the state-owned  land, and allowing private owners, too, to rent their land.    7. While being for passing a law that will allow selling and  buying land, the PDDSH is against selling agricultural land to  foreigners for a period of not less than 10 years, and it is  against selling agricultural land to citizens of neighboring  countries who live near the frontiers with our country.    The PDDSH will pursue a social policy promoting the  interests  of the most deprived and unprotected segments of our country's  population. It will strive to protect the interests of these  segments, making the state take the necessary measures in their  favor. The PDDSH will struggle also for improvements in the  social policy pursued by the state in all fields of its  activities. In this respect, the PDDSH's attention will focus on  taking the following measures:    1. Free ambulatory and hospital health services in the  state-owned health institutions. Free service in the state-owned  dental clinics (except for full or partial prostheses, for which  pensioners, invalids, and people economically assisted by the  state will pay up to a 50-percent reduced price.    2. State-owned education system. Obligatory eight-year  education. Reduced prices of school books.    3. The state will support scientific research work in all  fields. The scientific research institutions will be entirely  financed by the state.    4. The state will fully or partially finance the activities  of cultural and sports institutions, as well as educational  entertainment and leisure activities for youth and children. The  state will also assist and encourage private undertakings in  setting up and operating sports associations, establishments for  the education and entertainment of children (discos, cinemas and  clubs, game centers, swimming pools, etc.) The state will assist  with financial contribution in setting up clubs and other  establishments for aged people and pensioners.    5. The PDDSH will strive to extend the period of leave days  per year, birth leave days for pregnant women, and prohibit  night shift work or other particularly difficult jobs for women.    7. The PDDSH will strive for the improvement of  infrastructure by investing in repairing existing roads and  building up a new modern road, railroad, and internal air  transport network.    8. The PDDSH will persevere with investments in  restructuring  the electrical network of the cities and their potable water  supply system.    9. The PDDSH attaches extremely great importance to a  concrete estimation of Albania's intellectual potential. The  PDDSH will struggle so that the state pursues a favorable policy  toward an active participation of Albanian intellectuals and  specialists in drafting projects, steering and putting them into  practice, and in other technical and scientific undertakings,  keeping under control the number of foreign specialists involved  in these projects. The PDDSH severely condemns as antinational  and antieconomic every attitude of underestimating our  specialists.    10. The PDDSH is of the opinion that the state should  coordinate private business through legal means, ensuring fair  rapports between the sphere of commerce and that of public  service so as normally to meet the population's needs in this  sector.    11. The state will wield its strict control over hygiene and  sanitary conditions in the commercial sector and services. It  will gradually restrict street vendor trade, especially in food  products, and discipline the trade of vegetables and fruits in  centers controlled by hygiene and sanitary bodies.    12. The PDDSH is for a fair solution and prevention of  social  conflicts stemming from demographic movements of the population  from mountainous areas, especially from the northeastern parts  of our country. The PDDSH will not encourage parallel movements  from one village to another, but it is for a free movement of  people from villages to the towns. In the actual period of  trnasition, the PDDSH is of the opinion that the state, through  investments in forests and mines, should assist the peasants  living in these areas with long-term, interest-free credits, so  as to create living conditions in their areas until jobs for  them are created in the towns.    The PDDSH views the movement of part of the population into  the towns as an indispensable element of the long-term state  program. In this respect, the state will give priority to  villagers having little land, and families living in  agricultural state-owned enterprises to move gradually to the  towns as new jobs are created there.    13. In all its political activity, especially dealing with  economic and social problems, the PDDSH will seek the opinion of  and closely cooperate with the BSPSH [Union of Independent Trade  Unions of Albania], the Association of Former Political  Prisoners and Detainees, the Association of the Kulaks,  patriotic societies like "Kosova," "Cameria," "Tirana," and  other societies of anticommunist program and orientation.

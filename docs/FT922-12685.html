			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: Pension fund managers support reform but warn against sacrificing proven practices Sir, The members of this association, which includes virtually all the leading independent managers of pension fund assets in the UK, are taking a close interest in the suggestions for reform of the private occupational pension fund system following the Maxwell affair. Although some of the proposed reforms are not of direct relevance to fund managers, and most of the proposals are still at the preliminary stage, there are some on which we feel it right to comment now in order to encourage progress in the right direction. We fully approve the steps being taken to limit investment in assets connected with a pension fund's sponsors. We also believe that it is essential to strengthen the independence and powers of trustees, for example by adding to their number either suitably qualified individuals, who would perform a function equivalent to that of non-executive directors, or a trust company, which might also act as custodian. All trustees should be able to appeal to a body, such as the Occupational Pensions Board, with enhanced powers to prevent misuse of a fund's assets. However, some of the other changes which have been suggested in such areas as custodial arrangements fail to address the overriding need to improve protection against fraud and negligence and would have few, if any, advantages. In particular, the practice, common in the UK, of holding pension fund assets in the name of a nominee company associated with the investment manager is efficient and free of risk where suitable authorisation, systems and controls are in place. Also, although designation of individual client holdings in a custodian account may superficially seem attractive, it in fact adds to the cost and complications of administration without any commensurate improvement in security or increase in control by the trustees. Insurance cover has a part to play, but it can never take the place of preventative measures. All investment management firms have fidelity and professional indemnity insurance, but the suggestion, made recently in a letter to the FT (March 26), that they should be required to 'have insurance cover to at least the total level of funds under management' is neither sensible nor practicable. If the insurance market could provide cover for over Pounds 450bn of assets, which it cannot, the cost would be horrendous (and borne ultimately by the clients). A combination of effective procedures and reputable agents provides a far better solution. Above all, trustees can and should ensure that they select managers of good reputation and that their own system of controls, and those of their agents, give adequate protection. They should not rely solely on authorisation by a regulatory agency as a guarantee of honesty and efficiency but rather on their own investigations and regular reviews. The pension fund system has clear shortcomings and fund managers are ready to play their part in identifying and correcting them. Our members hope, however, that any pressure to make changes without proper consideration will be resisted, especially if they entail the sacrifice of cost-effective practices which have served pension funds well over many years.

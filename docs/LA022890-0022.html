			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN AMBASSADOR-CLASS SCHOOL?  </P> <P> The Ambassador Hotel has been through monumental changes in its 69 years. Now  the defunct hotel is the focus of a bidding war involving preservationists,  Donald Trump and the Los Angeles Unified School District. But in going all out  to "win" the Ambassador property, the school district has mistakenly taken a  righteous line and lost sight of achieving the basic educational goal.  </P> <P> School officials want the Ambassador's 24-acre site on Wilshire Boulevard for a  high school. But while there's no doubt about the need for another mid-city  high school, the Ambassador site is the wrong place for it.  </P> <P> A company managed by Trump owns the Ambassador property and recently announced  tentative plans to develop a 125-story office tower. Whether such a skyscraper  ever will, or should, be built is still open to question. But there's little  question that the mid-Wilshire district would be stabilized by a development  consistent with its commercial surroundings.  </P> <P> The staff of the agency that controls the school construction purse strings,  the State Allocation Board, has recommended that the board turn down the  district's request for $120 million to buy the prime real estate. Even if  voters in June approve $500 million in school-construction funds, the board  would find it hard to set aside 20% of the entire amount for one Los Angeles  school.  </P> <P> So why not pursue some of the district's creative proposals that are more in  keeping with budgetary reality? Like turning inner-city parks into school  sites, and allowing the grounds to be used as parks on weekends and after  school. The Department of Recreation and Parks should stop fighting this. And  it is important to find sites that don't require large-scale demolition of  existing housing -- something else in desperately short supply in the mid-city  area. Los Angeles High School sits on a compact 11 acres, including an athletic  field.  </P> <P> Of course, it isn't fair that many suburban schools built 20 to 30 years ago  are roomier. Just as it isn't fair that Proposition 13 forced many school  districts to stop building schools and thus precipitated the current crisis.  But the sad reality is that the district must stretch every school construction  dollar as far as it will go. Paying $120 million for one school along a pricey  commercial strip won't take those dollars far enough.  </P></p>

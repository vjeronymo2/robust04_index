			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Gold will be used to pay some MAI staff: Scheme at subsidiary avoids National Insurance MAI, the financial services group, said yesterday that its board, which includes Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and Sir Graham Day, chairman of British Aerospace, had sanctioned payments to some employees in gold bullion to avoid National Insurance contributions. The admission is politically embarrassing for Lord Hollick, MAI's managing director. He has been the most prominent member of the business community to support the Labour party's election campaign. Last week he arranged a meeting between Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and a group of Labour-supporting business executives. He has been tipped for ministerial office if Labour wins the election. MAI yesterday denied press allegations that Lord Hollick or other senior executives at the company had benefited from the scheme. It said press articles to that effect had been politically motivated, involving wilful and malicious disregard for the facts. However, the company admitted that about 300 staff at Harlow Butler Ueda, MAI's money and securities broking subsidiary, would receive bonuses in the form of bullion paid in Jersey. It insisted that such schemes were widely used, entirely legal and perfectly proper. Remuneration in gold is not subject to National Insurance. The payments need to be made in locations outside the EC such as Jersey to avoid paying value added tax on the gold. An advantage of such schemes is that employees can defer tax for up to 18 months if payment is timed for the end of the tax year. The bullion scheme has only recently been set up. A similar scheme, involving the payment of bonuses through unit trusts, was abandoned when the Inland Revenue closed a loop-hole last October. MAI said its board had authorised the bullion payments. MAI said it and Harlow Butler Ueda would issue writs today against the editor of The Mail on Sunday, a journalist at the paper and Assoc-iated Newspapers, its owner. The Harlow Butler Ueda writ will deal with allegations concerning local authority swap deals.</p>

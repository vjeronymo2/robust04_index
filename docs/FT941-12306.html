			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Russia will cut aluminium output in trade deal Russia is to cut its annual aluminium output by 500,000 tonnes, or about 15 per cent, for two years as part of an unprecedented international trade deal agreed at the weekend by the world's leading aluminium-producing countries. Western producers are expected to follow Russia's lead with cuts which will reduce global aluminium output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes - or about 10 per cent. The arrangement aims to end growing friction between Europe, the US and Russia over aluminium supply surpluses that last year produced record stockpiles of the metal and cut prices by half to record lows. Nearly two-thirds of the former Soviet Union's aluminium was used by the military but is now being exported. This has boosted aluminium exports of the Commonwealth of Independent States from 250,000 tonnes in 1989 to an estimated 1.6m tonnes last year. In the west, where aluminium is mainly used for transport equipment, construction and packaging, producers have already cut annual output by 1.4m tonnes or nearly 10 per cent of their total capacity. But stocks have continued to accumulate at the rate of 1.8m tonnes a year. Many producers were unwilling to make further cuts unless Russian industry shared in the reduction. Now a formula to bring the market back into balance has been approved by trade representatives from Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US. Mr Georgy Gabuniya, Russia's deputy foreign trade minister, said after tense discussions last week with the republic's smelter managers that Russia would cut its output by 300,000 tonnes in the three months beginning tomorrow and then by a further 200,000 tonnes in the following three months. The memorandum of understanding accepted by the aluminium producers at the weekend provides no specific targets for individual western countries because of anti-trust problems. The trade delegates hope they can convince anti-trust authorities in the US and elsewhere that the aluminium industry is reacting to market forces rather than acting as a cartel.</p>

The Russian President's Edict No. 1765 allows  administration chiefs to approve local election statutes  themselves: The parliament is only just beginning to consider a  general federal law. One doesn't have to be a genius to imagine  what will happen. However, much is already clear: Read our  item.    "There is a vast bureaucratic plot against democracy in the  country, which took shape just before the parliamentary  election," says Vladimir Rasskazov, former people's deputy and  chairman of the banking subcommittee of the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet, retired vice-chairman of the Russian Central  Bank, and current president of the All-Russian Stock Bank. "I  know from personal experience that local nomenklaturas were  given complete control over the elections to the Federation  Council."    Like every businessman, he supports his statements with  specific documents and facts, although many of them are clearly  colored by the pain of a person who has lost an election  campaign. Vladimir Rasskazov ran for the Russia's Choice bloc  for an Arkhangelsk Oblast seat in the Federation Council. His  opponent, Yuriy Guskov, chairman of the Arkhangelsk Oblast  Soviet and before that first secretary of the Arkhangelsk Oblast  CPSU Committee, was nominated as candidate by the Russian  Communist Party. He won by 9,000 votes. In Vladimir Rasskazov's  view, this was a result of machinations, forgery and outright  legal arbitrariness of the local powers that be. Nor was it only  the issue that communist representatives could conduct their  campaigns directly at enterprises during work hours, which  democratic candidates could not. Or that the oblast radio would  fall silent "for technical reasons" precisely when broadcasting  an interview with Vladimir Rasskazov.    Much more mysterious was the kaleidoscope of number errors  in  the Arkhangelsk election returns. Thus, 42,000 ballots more were  cast for the Federation Council election than in the federal  district, where parties and blocs were determining their  standing with the people. What does this suggest? Two  assumptions come to mind: Either the voters deliberately failed  to cast their "party" ballots, or someone deliberately stuffed  the ballot boxes with extra "paper" ballots, which decided the  outcome of the race for the upper chamber of parliament.    There are many such flaws. For example, the total number of  ballots issued to voters or cancelled was 118,508 less than the  number of registered Arkhangelsk voters. One can think of many  reasons for this. Say, again blame voters who for some reason  put the lacking number of ballots in their pockets. But is it  possible that more than 100,000 people would want to commit an  identical prank? Or could one justifiably say that voter turnout  in the oblast was expected to be low, so fewer ballots were  printed in order to save paper.    For all its peculiarities, the complex existing situation  may  not have aroused so many distortions if Vladimir Rasskazov or  his representatives had a document stating the total number of  printed ballots, indicating how many were handed out and how  many remained in reserve. The absence of such information has  aroused the most evil suspicions of the losing side: Where the  ballots "saved" before or after the election? Try and find out  now, while 116,000 election ballots account for almost 20  percent of the vote.    Also surprising are the "miracles" of the Solovetsk election  precinct, where 434 voters cast a total of 1,604 ballots. It is  hard to imagine that in their civic enthusiasm the Solovetsk  citizens managed to vote several times. Was this some  unfortunate accident? Quite possible, but if the mistake was  discovered and not corrected one can't help thinking of direct  fraud.    "Nevertheless," says Vladimir Rasskazov, "a preliminary  count  of votes in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk and Novodvinsk, which  include half the district constituents, showed that 1.7 times  more had voted for me than for my opponent. Seeing this, the  district commission immediately halted ballot collection for  three days. In the final result Yuriy Guskov was already  ahead..."    Incensed by such "democratism," Vladimir Rasskazov prepared  papers and appealed to the Central Election Committee and  procurator agencies, seeking a recount of the Arkhangelsk Oblast  ballots. So far with no result.    "As fate would have it, the Central Election Committee's  complaint commission is headed by P. Zhigaltsov, an Arkhangelsk  crony of Yu. Guskov," says the would-be deputy, explaining the  reason for his unsuccessful quest for the truth.    The first thing that comes to mind after talking to him is:  Here is a person who has lost an election and now seeks to make  a political issue of it. New times breed new traditions. And all  his appeals to courts and procurator offices, allusions to the  biased makeup of election commissions "formed back in 1989 by  the communists," and "the absence of the possibility to monitor  their actions by democratic forces" could be seen as an effort  to create "publicity" around his name with an eye on future  elections.    You must agree that if something like this were expounded by  some run-of-the-mill politician or a representative of the  humanities his words could be classified as populism. But the  assertions of a ranking banking-brokerage executive well versed  in the intrigues of the powers that be, moreover an economic  scholar with two university degrees who acquired professional  experience both as a director at the Computer Center and in  academic and research work at the economics and management chair  of a technical college, tend to ring true. Moreover, the results  of the latest election reflect, as on a screen, the strategic  redeployment of the communist-soviet nomenklatura forces,  bringing hidden secrets to light.    Understanding that the democrats' political prestige depends  on the local successes of the changes taking place, and that the  apparat plays a key role in this process, the nomenklatura,  having regained consciousness after the August debacle, hastily  began to deploy its people over the entire vertical of power.  Launching a personnel offensive, it soon gained control over  Russia's major regions. Suffice it to cite facts for just a few  of them (see table).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oblast                   |Total number of administ-|Of them, former secretar-|  |                         |ration chiefs            |ies or executives of cen-|  |                         |                         |tral, oblast, city, rayo-|  |                         |                         |n CPSU committees        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rostov                   |58                       |28                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Voronezh                 |33                       |25                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belgorod                 |27                       |21                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Irkutsk                  |38                       |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Novosibirsk              |37                       |14                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sverdlovsk               |24                       |12                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In Krasnoyarsk Kray, every other city or rayon  administration  chief is a former CPSU apparatchik. And if one considers  personnel who completed the Higher Party School, then it is all  of 80 percent...    This was described and happened two years ago, but for some  reason we only now seem to have overcome amnesia and are  worriedly asking: How come that in, say, Penza Oblast 40 out of  45 seats in the legislative assembly have gone to former party  committee secretaries, deputies of disbanded soviets, directors  of plants and state farms, and other local leaders of communist  orientation? And now, egged on by Sergey Filatov, chief of the  Russian president's administration, and Nikolay Medvedev, chief  of that administration's department for work with territories,  the democratic chorus has suddenly voiced its alarm at the  possibility of the formation of a "red belt" made up of regions  with strong anti-reform moods around Moscow and the return of  the local party-managerial nomenklatura to power.    Actually, it never lost that local power, only adapting  deftly to circumstances. We all remember the metamorphoses when  the leaders of party committees of various levels  instantaneously, like a shoal of fish following some signal  known only to them, occupied leadership position in soviets of  the respective levels, and then, with the same alacrity, moved  over to the positions of administration chiefs. Now, again in  consort, they are occupying the seats of dumas and other  legislative bodies. Today the entire nomenklatura force is  following their bosses in the "personnel offensive." Which is to  say that so far the only "belt" around Moscow has been "red."</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WARNS AGAINST BANGLADESH TRAVEL  </P> <P> The United States on Wednesday warned Americans not to travel to strife-torn  Bangladesh and said the imposition of a state of emergency will not solve the  South Asian country's problems.  </P> <P> President Hussain Mohammed Ershad said in a radio and television broadcast  Tuesday night that he had ordered the emergency, which curbs all civil rights,  to fight violence ignited by an opposition campaign to force him from power.  </P> <P> Ershad said he is banning all political activities, political meetings,  processions, strikes and industrial lockouts indefinitely. Civil rights will be  suspended and the press will be censored.  </P> <P> At least 10 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured since Oct. 10,  when the opposition renewed its campaign to force Ershad to quit and hand over  rpower to an interim government before free elections.  </P></p>

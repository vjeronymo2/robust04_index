			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm/jod"-signed report: "Telekom and France Telecom </F> Establishing Worldwide Network"]    [Text] Bonn/Paris, 14 Jun -- German Telekom, France  Telecom, and the U.S. Sprint Corporation are going to provide  telecommunication services worldwide, Telekom's president of the  board, Helmut Ricke, announced in Bonn. The cooperation between  the two biggest providers of telecommunication services in  Europe and the third-largest long-distance network provider in  the United States will bring about an international market  leader operating a worldwide network, Ricke pointed out.    Provided they get the necessary approvals, the two companies  are planning to take two equal shares in Sprint totaling 20  percent. Ricke said the entire share package is worth $4.2  billion. This means that each of the two European partners  would hold a portion of some 3.5 billion German marks [DM].  Telekom and France Telecom will have a seat and a vote in the  most important decisionmaking bodies of their new partner  company.    At a press conference held simultaneously in Paris, the  chief  of France Telecom, Marcel Roulet, stressed that in return for  their investment in Sprint, the two partners will be given a say  in strategic decisions. Asked about U.S. companies' access to  the European market, Roulet said that all activities under the  transatlantic partnership have been decontrolled. If the  cooperation works well, Sprint might participate in France  Telecom in the long run.    The alliance is the "logical continuation" of the intensive  cooperation between Telekom and France Telecom that was agreed  upon at the end of 1993. Under this cooperation, a joint  venture will offer services worldwide as of 1995. It will be  operating from Brussels and is expected to achieve a turnover of  more than DM3 billion during its first year.</p>

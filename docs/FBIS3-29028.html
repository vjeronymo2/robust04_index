[passage omitted]    In his White House speech, Clinton said the time for  bitterness was over and now was the time for a new beginning  between Hanoi and Washington. This is indeed laudable and the  US president could not have said it better.    The reconciliation process was a long difficult one for the  United States due to the great bitterness the Vietnam War had  caused among the American people. At that time it was perceived  that a communist regime had beaten the free world superpower of  the day, and this did not go down well with the American people.    When the embargo was extended after 1975, its purpose was to  squeeze more information from Vietnam regarding the American  MiAs. [missing in action] Veterans groups and families of the  MiAs were of course very emotionally involved, just wanting to  know what happened to their loved ones.    Hence there was a great deal of pressure on a number of US  administrators to keep the embargo intact until there was a full  accounting of the missing servicemen. [passage omitted]    For the Vietnamese to forgive and forget is also laudable.  It has to be remembered the extent to which the Vietnamese have  suffered from the ravages of war. Since 1946 they have fought  five wars almost continuously, and nearly 10 percent of the  population of about 71 million is totally disabled.    Interestingly enough, one of the key questions on the minds  of many is to what degree the issue of trade played a part in  the presidential decision. Clearly, American companies have  been represented in Hanoi for a long time but the embargo has  always prevented them from assuming a full role in the booming  Vietnamese economy. Because of this they have been forced to  stay on the sidelines while European, Australian, Japanese,  South Korean and Hong Kong companies have been able to get a  good head start on them.    Obviously, this factor has been the main point of  consideration, though in answering questions from reporters  Clinton said the trade question did not influence his decision.    Unfortunately, the lifting of the trade embargo is not quite  the same as the normalization of relation between Washington and  Hanoi. Normalization usually involves the exchange of  ambassadors and other diplomatic ties and these were certainly  not a part of the current presidential decision.    However, it can be assumed that Vietnam will be seeking  diplomatic ties with the United States. Since the collapse of  the Soviet Union, Hanoi has been looking for a guarantor  against China's expanding role in the region and sees Washington  now being able to play the part.    The establishment of a US liaison office in Hanoi is indeed  positive development and this must be seen as the first step on  the path towards normalizing ties between the two countries.    With the lifting of the trade embargo, the United States and  Vietnam can now look forward to a better future. This is indeed  a good omen for the beginning of the new lunar year next week  because, for the first time in decades, Vietnam is not at war or  in conflict with any country.</p>

Lewis] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] has strongly condemned the torching of ANC Deputy  Secretary-General Jacob Zuma's Northern Natal house at the  weekend, saying the attack underlined the need for the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and the government to act  decisively to create free political activity in the province.  Mr Zuma's house in Nxamalala, near Nkandla, was torched by  unknown vandals on saturday soon after anti-ANC pamphlets were  distributed in the area.    In its reaction on Sunday, the ANC charged the attack was  the  work of those consistently opposed to the peaceful transition  towards democracy in South Africa. "The fact that anti-ANC  pamphlets were distributed in the area prior to the attack --  and were the same malicious pamphlets distributed in kwaMashu,  near Durban, before hostel dwellers attacked B-section last week  -- indicates that the leaflets were aimed at creating a climate  in which Mr Zuma's house would be torched," said ANC spokesman  Ronnie Mamoepa.    "This latest attack underlines the urgency of the need of  the  TEC in conjunction with the government to act decisively to  create a climate for free political activity in Natal and to  ensure the success of the democratic process.    "We call on the law enforcement agencies to ensure the  killers of our people in Natal and those responsible for the  arson at Mr Zuma's house are brought to justice," Mr Mamoepa  added.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Dollars 2bn Argentine housing scheme A Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) financing scheme to build 60,000 houses and create 130,000 construction industry jobs was launched yesterday by the Argentine government, which is facing growing public concern over high unemployment. Leaked reports, denied by President Carlos Menem, that unemployment has crept above 13 per cent have fuelled public debate over the ability of Argentina's restructured, open economy to create jobs. Most economic analysts agree that the joblessness rate, which has risen steeply since the implementation of economic stabilisation in 1991, is likely to climb further before it recedes. The housing scheme, designed to bolster a construction sector that has been an important economic motor in recent years, is being presented as one government initiative to tackle the problem. 'Next year we will reduce unemployment by 3 or 4 points,' Mr Menem said yesterday, promising a substantial public works programme to 'absorb many of the jobless'. In addition to its job-creating function, the plan is intended to bring home-ownership within reach of many families denied access to mortgage finance since the ravages of hyperinflation in the late 1980s. The scheme, to be administered by the state Banco Hipotecario Nacional, will provide 15-year mortgages at an annual interest rate of 13.5 per cent. It is likely to be a vote-catcher in its own right. Mr Menem, aware that unemployment could become a political irritant in the run-up to next May's presidential elections, has taken to giving impassioned speeches about the need to balance technological innovation with the creation of jobs. Foreign investors, in particular, have been asked not to put 'robots' above the welfare of the Argentine workforce.</p>

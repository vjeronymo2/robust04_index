			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MISSION BAY HANGS ON, 67-59;  </P> <P> EL CAPITAN MAKES LATE COMEBACK, BUT FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> Under the playoff system used two years ago in San Diego Section high school  boys' basketball, El Capitan and Mission Bay would not have met in the  postseason.  </P> <P> Going into Monday's Division II first round, Mission Bay (16-7, 7-3 in the City  Western League) would have competed in the Class 2-A playoffs. El Capitan  (9-17, 2-6 in the Grossmont 3-A League) would have had its season over by now.  </P> <P> But this year, like last season, every team is eligible for the playoffs, where  60 games over a two-week period will determine five champions.  </P> <P> Mission Bay's winning percentage was 32% higher than El Capitan's. And, for  three quarters Monday, it looked as if the Buccaneers would win handily.  </P> <P> Mission Bay led by 25 points early in the fourth quarter, but held on for a  67-59 victory at home to advance to the second round Thursday against  eighth-seeded Crawford.  </P> <P> "We were a little late and a little short with the comeback," said Jim Gleboff,  El Capitan's coach.  </P> <P> But the effort was valiant. Jeremy McGarity scored 12 of his game-high 25  points and Eagle LaChappa (nine points) made three three-pointers in the fourth  quarter as El Capitan outscored Mission Bay, 23-6, over the final 7 minutes.  </P> <P> With runs of five and 11 points, El Capitan pulled to within, 63-52, with 3  minutes left. After Peter Wilson made two free throws and Brett Grebing one, El  Capitan scored seven in a row to pull within, 66-59. But only 14 seconds  remained. A Ken North free throw ended the scoring.  </P> <P> For three quarters, Mission Bay dominated behind the shooting and passing of  Wilson. The 5-foot-8 point guard had 19 points (only two in the fourth quarter)  and 11 assists. Six-foot-six center Brett Grebing added 14 points and 11  rebounds. Keith Berkley and Jim Thomas had 10 each.  </P> <P> Wilson, known more for his passing and ballhandling skills than his scoring  ability, has a season-high of 20 points against Kearny. But come playoff time,  Wilson, a senior, seems to shine. Last season, in a 61-51 first-round playoff  victory over San Pasqual, Wilson had 23 points.  </P> <P> "To me, it's crunch time. That's where I get my motivation," said Wilson.  </P> <P> Said Mission Bay Coach Mike Seaman, "He goes unnoticed for the contributions  that he makes. But tonight, he had a great game."  </P> <P> Mission Bay won seven of its last eight league games to finish in a first-place  tie with La Jolla.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top 10  </P> <P> BOYS  </P> <P> Pos.

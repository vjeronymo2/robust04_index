			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Budapest, June 11 (MTI) -- "Such a violent action  is understandably shocking to a country where terrorists are  uncommon, where social transformation has been going on for  years in the greatest possible peace," Minister of the Interior  Imre Konya told MTI on Saturday, commenting on the explosion.  Konya said it was especially startling because it affected the  parliament building, the symbol of democracy in Hungary.    "This event warns us to devote more attention and money to  the protection of our public buildings," Konya continued. "I  have already directed the chief police commissioner and the  commander of the Government Guard to elaborate a proposal on  improving the protection of the parliament and the  representatives' office building. But this is basically a  question of money and I intend to present a proposal on the  issue to the Cabinet at its next session."    Asked whether there could be any connection between today's  terrorist action and the recent explosions in Szeged and  Szabadka, the minister said, "The chance of some connection  cannot be excluded but I do not wish to make guesses concerning  the background of the action while investigation is still under  way." However, he said there is no information on any political  group in Hungary that could be connected to the case. [passage  omitted]</p>

"No one can honestly talk about falsifications," Ciampi said  in a statement, referring to Berlusconi's allegations in a  televised debate with Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic  Party of the Left, that Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa had  doctored the deficit figures.    Spaventa and Berlusconi will be facing off in Rome's  downtown  first-past-the-post constituency for a seat in the Senate.    "Last night the government was accused by a political  candidate of having presented false budget figures, in contempt  of parliament," Ciampi's statement said, adding: "In the face of  this very grave affirmation I am forced to break the silence I  had imposed on myself during this election campaign."    Ciampi also cited his decision not to take part in the  campaign's closing forum, broadcast on public television Friday  night and traditionally attended by the government chief.    In his statement, Ciampi reiterated that the cabinet's  budget  figures were compiled by the three finance ministers together,  were approved by parliament and were in line with forecasts and  calculations made by major international institutions. Upward  revisions of the forecast 1994 deficit made earlier this week,  he said, were in line with lower projected growth figures made  by the same international organizations (European Union, OECD,  IMF).    That part of the higher forecast deficit (14 trillion lire  above the December forecasts) not caused by external economic  factors amounts to some five trillion lire (3.1 billion  dollars), Ciampi continued, but since revisions of this size,  "considering payments of 700 trillion lire and revenues of 540  trillion lire, happen in all countries, and no one can honestly  talk about falsifications."    Ciampi then defended his government's economic policies,  citing the renewed trust of foreign investors, successful  privatizations and substantial interest rate cuts, which have  reduced interests on debt servicing.</p>

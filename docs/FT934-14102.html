			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / The ups and downs of air-launched nuclear missiles: The latest project is by no means the first to be scrapped THE government's decision yesterday to abandon plans for a new air-launched nuclear missile means that the RAF stands to lose the nuclear role it has maintained since the V-bomber aircraft went into service with Britain's first atomic bombs 40 years ago. The project has been discussed, on and off, for six years. But Britain's experience in the field of nuclear missiles for aircraft is a chequered saga going back much longer. The first plan was a glide-bomb called the Blue Boar, with a range of 25 nautical miles. It was abandoned in 1954 in favour of a longer-range cruise missile, Blue Steel, which eventually went into service in two versions. But plans were afoot to replace the V-bombers altogether with a ballistic missile, Blue Streak. In 1960, when Blue Streak was judged unviable and scrapped, the Macmillan government plumped for a US-designed air-launched missile, Skybolt. Two years later that project, too, was scrapped, this time by the US. As a result Britain agreed to buy submarine-launched Polaris ballistic missiles from the US, tipped with British warheads. But the RAF kept its nuclear mission. Its current WE177 gravity bomb - the RAF is believed to have about 100 left  -has been in service even longer than Polaris. The new 'stand-off' weapon, known in official jargon as a Tasm or tactical air-to-surface missile, was meant to replace the WE177 at the end of the decade. Instead, Britain's low-flying Tornadoes will have the bombs until well after the year 2000, and no stand-off missile. During the cold war the rationale behind a stand-off weapon was that it would give aircraft a better chance of reaching their targets in the Soviet Union and returning because it would allow pilots to stand off, or rather stand back, from their target. Talks with the US and France, each a potential partner, began in 1988. A decision was expected the following year. Politically, the prospect of a breakthrough in Anglo-French collaboration bore particular significance, as a symbol of much closer defence ties. But Britain preferred the US option, in the form of the SRAM-T, a nuclear version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack Missile. Then history repeated itself, when President George Bush stopped that programme in 1991. This left another US option based on the SLAT, or Supersonic Low-Altitude Target, as well as Aerospatiale's ASLP, a longer-range counterpart to the ASMP cruise missile in service with the French air force. More recently, Britain was looking at ways to cut missile programme costs. Now that the cold war has passed, the importance attached to nuclear weapons has been greatly reduced. But the UK has not dropped the principle of fielding 'sub-strategic' weapons - intended for limited roles - as well as strategic ones. The idea is to stop a potential adversary, such as a 'rogue' country with a newly made atomic bomb, from gambling on the calculation that nobody would contemplate using the full force of strategic arms against it. But the government has accepted the Navy's arguments that it can fulfil both the strategic and sub-strategic roles with the Trident, the replacement for Polaris, due to enter UK service in 1995. The US-supplied missiles, instead of carrying up to eight nuclear warheads, could be equipped with a single warhead. One advantage of this argument is that the UK warhead for Trident has been fully tested. Britain cannot do any more tests as long as the US keeps up its moratorium, which may become permanent under a global test-ban treaty. In any event, as one defence official admitted: 'There would not be much support for any new nuclear weapon just at the moment.'</p>

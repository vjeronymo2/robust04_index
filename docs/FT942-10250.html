			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Lift-truck producers go global - Takeover of Lancer Boss will not be the last Last week's takeover of the UK's Lancer Boss by Jungheinrich of Germany is unlikely to be the last such deal in an industry where medium and small-sized companies are becoming increasingly squeezed as the 'big boys' pull away from the pack. In spite of a series of mergers in the 1980s, the industry is still plagued by excess manufacturing capacity - especially in Europe - and increasing price competition exacerbated by the strong growth in the past decade of Japanese and Asian producers. Success in traditional but mature western markets requires financial strength to weather the business cycles inevitable in industrial equipment. Meanwhile, the best long-term growth prospects are elsewhere, notably in Asia. To succeed, large producers of lift trucks are taking a global approach, either through acquisition or organic growth. Medium-sized producers, in contrast, are finding they lack the volume to generate sufficient cash flow when markets are strong, while small companies are left to exploit specialist niches. Since the 1980s, the industry has been reshaped. The big acquirers of the past decade have been Linde of Germany and Nacco of the US. Linde has become the industry leader through a string of acquisitions in Europe - Fenwick in France, Wagner and Still in Germany, and Lansing Bagnall in the UK. Nacco (North American Coal Corporation Industries) has made its purchases in the US. It bought Yale in 1985 and Hyster in 1989. Speculation of further deals continues - Nacco, for example, is said to be keen to buy Swedish-owned BT. Nacco supplies four-wheeled counterbalanced electric trucks and engined trucks to Jungheinrich, which could eventually produce these machines in-house, following the takeover of Lancer Boss and its German unit, Steinbock Boss. 'There are a few smaller companies left in Europe, which will fall by the wayside,' said Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), yesterday. 'It will be difficult for them to survive.' Before its twin receivership in the UK and Germany, Lancer Boss was a classic medium-sized company, whose global sales peaked at about Pounds 200m (Dollars 298m). It, too, had expanded by acquisition in Europe, but wanted to become bigger. Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, its former chairman, believed the company needed sales of Pounds 500m to secure its global position. Its problems have given Jungheinrich an excellent opportunity to bolster its global position. In contrast to Linde and Nacco, the Hamburg-based company has until this month followed the Japanese-style organic approach to growth. Its last lift-truck acquisition was a small French deal in 1974, but by 1991 it had grown quietly to third place in the industry behind Linde and Toyota. Jungheinrich slipped to fourth in 1992, the latest year for which rankings were available, but the takeovers of Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss would have put it into second place with turnover of nearly DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.08bn) and more than 8,000 employees. For Jungheinrich, though, the rankings are less important than the impact on its competitiveness. Overall, says Mr Bischof, Jungheinrich has both broadened its product range and 'taken the first step to looking outside Europe into a global market.' The acquisition of Steinbock significantly strengthens Jungheinrich's position in the market for very narrow aisle (VNA) trucks used in warehouses. By taking over Lancer Boss, the Hamburg company says its potential to penetrate the counterbalanced electric and combustion engined market is strengthened because of the UK company's 'excellent engineering' in this area. The deal takes Jungheinrich for the first time into sidelift trucks and container handling trucks. For all its financial problems, Boss was the world leader in trucks to handle empty shipping containers, and has been very successful in the booming Asian market that Jungheinrich wants to exploit. Mr Bischof hints that the twin acquisitions may not be the last made by Jungheinrich, and says they will make a positive contribution to Jungheinrich's profits next year. As one observer points out, there are some 'lovely' profit margins on big container handling trucks. And Lancer Boss' home market is recovering strongly from recession.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 WORLD TOP TEN LIFT TRUCK PRODUCERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                                             1992 turnover*                                                       D-Mark (m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Linde (Germany)                                         2,952 Jungheinrich (Germany)**                                1,797 Toyota (Japan)                                          1,548 NACCO - Hyster/Yale (US)                                1,394 Komatsu (Japan)                                         1,297 Terex - Clark (US)                                        908 Toyo Umbanki (Japan)                                      874 Mitsubishi (Japan)                                        778 Crown (US)                                                697 Nordico - BT (Sweden)                                     665  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *  Lift truck turnover only ** Pro forma figure based on combining sales of Jungheinrich and Lancer    Boss  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Fordermittel trade journal, Germany  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

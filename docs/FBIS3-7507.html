			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The government compiled on  Tuesday a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 1994 with a  record outlay of 11.05 trillion yen to bridge the delay in Diet  passage of the full budget. The stopgap budget formed by the  Finance Ministry was endorsed by the ruling coalition parties  and the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for  immediate submission to the current ordinary Diet session.    A ministry official, briefing reporters, stressed that the  economy is unlikely to face downward pressure with a failure to  enact the full budget before Friday's start of fiscal 1994. But  the delay in fact means a slower output of spending earmarked in  the full budget, with the government aiming to put the economy  on a path to full recovery in the early stage of fiscal 1994.    If deliberations go smoothly, the provisional budget is  expected to become law on Thursday.    The Diet is now stalled in its deliberations on the fiscal  1994 budget plan worth 73.08 trillion yen, with the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party demanding Hosokawa give a full  accounting of a 100 million yen loan he received from the  scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking group.    The full budget was submitted to the Diet as late as March  for the first time in 27 years, already two months behind  schedule, and the Diet impasse has made it certain that  administrative bodies will enter the new fiscal year without the  funds to keep functioning.    The Finance Ministry also compiled a provisional plan worth  9.84 trillion yen for the fiscal investment and loans program,  also approved by the government and the ruling parties. The  program, regarded as a second national budget, allocates funds  to government-backed financial institutions and other special  bodies.    Even though the stopgap budget excludes new policy spending,  the ministry budget bureau official said the government has  earmarked sufficient fresh public works and other  economy-stimulating outlays in the third fiscal 1993  supplementary budget, which became law in February, to fund  large chunks of the latest 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus  package.    The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in  spending  related to public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in  the full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993  and a roughly estimated amount usually necessary for the first  50-day period.    A minimum necessary 14 percent is included for labor,  operating and other administrative expenses to keep the  government functioning.    Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget  allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from  13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in  tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen.    On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion  yen  in the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax income  and 2.47 trillion yen in bond issuance.    To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion  yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term  treasury securities.    The 50-day provisional period is the second-longest in  postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990  when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets.    The ministry official said the 50-day period reflected the  average 48 days taken in the past three years for the full  budget to pass the House of Representatives. After passing the  powerful lower house, budget bills are sent to the House of  Councillors which is relatively quick in completing  deliberations.    The government apparently hopes that deliberations on the  stopgap budget will heighten public awareness and pressure  opposition parties to accept debates on the full budget.    Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press  meeting  on Monday that budgets should normally be passed before the  fiscal year begins, and called for Diet passage "as early as  possible."</p>

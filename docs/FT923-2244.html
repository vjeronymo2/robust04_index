			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Further tension and turbulence THE foreign exchange market remained turbulent yesterday, as sterling fell further and tensions continued within what remains of the European exchange rate mechanism, writes Tracy Corrigan. However, dealers said the market was calmer than on Wednesday, as traders tried to take stock. Following its suspension from the ERM late on Wednesday, sterling slid in early trading on news that the lira had also been suspended. The pound fell to around DM2.60 - about 18 pfennings below its minimum level in the ERM, abandoned the previous evening. But the reversal of Wednesday's two-point rise in minimum lending rate, bringing the base rate back to 10 per cent, helped lift sterling somewhat. A trader commented: 'There was a feeling that, with rates lower, the UK economy could start to improve, and that helped renew confidence in the currency.' The pound rallied from further weakness against the D-Mark to reach DM2.68 at one stage. However, uncertainty over the future economic policy of the government continued to undermine sterling. A statement from the Treasury that the pound would rejoin the ERM as soon as market conditions permitted unsettled the currency, which fell back again to close in London at DM2.6400, off 11 pfennigs on the day. 'The worry is that we will rejoin the ERM rather than consider another policy, and more particularly, that we might go in at current levels,' one trader said. Meanwhile, the failure of the Bundesbank to lower interest rates, after some dealers had expected a cut, boosted the D-Mark against the dollar. The latter ended at DM1.4830, down from the previous close of DM1.5185. In New York it finished at DM1.4755. Elsewhere, there were continued tensions within the ERM. As the French franc began to come under some selling pressure, Mr Michael Sapin, French finance minister, said the French currency was holding up well in the turmoil. He said there was nothing particularly significant about a level of FFr3.42 per D-Mark, at which the currency closed last night. But it was near enough to its DM3.43 floor for dealers to remain nervous. However, the pressure on the French franc could prove more short-lived. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB, said: 'If there is a Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht on Sunday, I think we will see a sharp rebound in the franc.' The Irish punt came under severe pressure yesterday, as the Irish central bank and the Bundesbank both intervened. The lira was buffeted in the currencies market, ending at L829.2 per D-Mark, against L823.6. Prior to its suspension, the lira's floor was L820.6.</p>

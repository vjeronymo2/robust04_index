			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Brussels to back Spanish steel plan The European Commission will ask EC industry ministers to give outline approval to a restructuring package for the Spanish steel industry next week, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. But the Commission conceded yesterday that progress of the EC's overall rescue plan would be held up until the Italian and German governments had agreed acceptable restructuring plans. The Commission now expects final agreement from ministers in November. The Commission has set strict conditions for formal approval of the politically sensitive Spanish plan, following discussions over the summer with Madrid, and with the Basque government in Brussels last week.</p>

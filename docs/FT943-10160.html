			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Halifax Since turnover in the housing market has been rising this year, it seems strange that the Halifax Building Society feels the need to expand by buying up other people's mortgage books. Halifax argues that this is only part of a strategy designed to keep it ahead in the mortgage market, and it certainly is a less complicated way of expanding than buying another society. A number of centralised lenders are leaving the business - in the case of BNP because of its new management's desire to run down overseas retail activity. So it makes sense to pick up what is on offer. Two other points speak in favour of such deals. While base rates are low, lenders like BNP, who fund themselves with wholesale money are in a strong position. Once rates start moving up, institutions like Halifax, with a retail funding base, enjoy a relative advantage. Second, despite increased housing market activity, mortgage lenders still have to offer incentives on variable rate lending to attract business. That increases the attraction of buying ready-made loan portfolios. The fact that mortgage lenders are choosing to purchase market share in this way remains a sign of underlying market weakness. Halifax says it can grow without such deals. The first half slippage in Abbey National's share of the new mortgage market would have been more embarrassing had it not purchased the mortgage assets of CIBC. Without a greater flow of genuine new business, margins on mortgage lending look set to come under further pressure across the industry.</p>

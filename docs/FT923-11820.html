			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Officials quit as anti-mafia anger grows Angry anti-mafia protesters yesterday broke through police cordons outside Palermo cathedral at the funeral of five bodyguards blown up with leading anti-mafia judge Mr Paolo Borsellino on Sunday, Reuter reports from Palermo. Anger against the political class which failed to protect Mr Borsellino after the Mafia murdered his colleague, judge Giovanni Falcone last May, has been rising since Sunday's bombing, particularly among police bodyguards in Palermo. The mayor of Palermo, Mr Aldo Rizzo, resigned hours before the ceremony and seven of the Sicilian capital's 16 deputy prosecutors have also stepped down in protest at the authorities' latest failure in the battle against the Mafia.</p>

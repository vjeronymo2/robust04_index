			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Ford unions in Europe join forces UNIONS representing Ford workers across Europe are combining forces for the first time to make representations to the company. They believe Ford management in the US has taken a strategic decision to sub-contract an increasing number of production processes and fear thousands of jobs are at risk in the long term. The move comes in spite of the unions' continuing difficulties in forming a European works council at Ford, designed to give a collective voice to workers from all six European countries where Ford has a presence. German union leaders want Euro-works council representatives to be elected from Ford employees only. The British want some full-time union officials on the proposed 20-member council. This week, however, negotiators from Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal will ask Ford of Europe management for a meeting to request assurances that no core processes will be sub-contracted within the next five years. They also agreed to contact the US Union of Auto Workers for more information. Unions believe the proposal to put seat production at Ford in Britain out to tender will lead to 800 job losses and heralds a move to increase sub-contracting. Ford is due to decide on that proposal later this year. Ford has little choice but to buy in more component systems and processes from outside suppliers if it is to remain competitive with the leading Japanese vehicle makers on costs. On average more than 60 per cent of the value of Japanese vehicles is made up of externally supplied components. Western carmakers, like their Japanese counterparts, can cut costs substantially by forging long-term partnerships with a relatively small number of key suppliers. These suppliers are required to bear all the big costs of research and development in exchange for long-term supply contracts. Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union who attended a meeting of all Ford European unions in Geneva this month, said: 'Ford unions without exception do not agree to out-sourcing without negotiations and agreement on items to be out-sourced.' Ford denied that it plans to sub-contract core businesses. The company said: 'Out-sourcing of some work is an on-going process. We have looked at peripheral areas for a number of years. We are always asking whether someone can do the work better than we can.' It added that any substantial increase in sub-contracting would be a matter for long-term discussion with unions. European Community trade unions have united with employers' organisations in an appeal for governments to support a co-operative growth strategy for more employment. The two sides have called for the rapid reduction of interest rates in an eight-point statement timed to coincide with a meeting of EC finance ministers today. ENGINEERS at Ford's research and development plant in Dunton, Essex, are to stage a one-day strike tomorrow in protest over the company's plan to relocate 300 jobs to Germany. Members of the MSF technical union voted almost two to one in favour of the action which will be the third stoppage in the dispute that began in May. The relocation is part of the company's strategy of 'co-location' that involves bringing together staff working on similar activities. The company has said nobody will be forced to move to Germany, and that with the co-operation of employees compulsory redundancies can be avoided. Ford believes that the current multi-site structure of its technical operations puts it at a competitive disadvantage. It plans to consolidate technical operations into two sites in Europe, one in Britain and one in Germany.</p>

Tihomir Vinkovic reports:    [Vinkovic] Following six hours of talks an agreement has  been  reached whereby both sides agree that the cease-fire will take  effect at noon on 25 February. All future offensives or attacks  are ruled out. All propaganda pitting one side against the  other must come to an end. The lines of contact will remain as  they are at the time that the cease-fire comes into effect.    UNPROFOR will be positioned in sensitive areas to safeguard  the implementation of the cease-fire. All heavy weaponry will  be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn from the lines  of contact; mortars are to be moved 10 km away and and tanks and  artillery 20 km away by noon on 7 March.    On 25 February a joint commission under UNPROFOR auspices  will be set up in Kiseljak. This commission will work to solve  points of dispute.    Following the signing of the agreement, General Ante Roso  said:    [Roso] "A new time requires a new dialogue. I believe that  this sums it up. As is written in the text, the cease-fire by  noon of 25 February [sentence as heard]. It is laid down in a  relatively detailed way. Further on, there is the technical  part. I hope it will be realistically possible to implement what  was signed today. Everything requires a period of time. Every  beginning is the beginning of an end. Hence, this is a  beginning. I believe that enough is said in my definition of  this signature: a new time, new dialogue."    [Vinkovic] Rasim Delic said:    [Delic] "All this depends on the two of us, actually on  those  units and formations that are under our command. I think that  the points stipulated in the agreement and principles from the  annex to the agreement are of a nature that will enable the  implementation of all this. Of course, all this is to be  implemented on the ground, and hard work remains to be done. I  think that by this we are creating conditions for our  politicians to reach an agreement which, I hope, they are going  to do soon. This should be speeded up.    "As regards soldiers, they are always ready to put into  practice agreements aimed at the political resolution of the  issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been topical for such a  long time."    [Vinkovic] The UN secretary general's special envoy Yasuhi  Akashi, who attended the talks and witnessed the signing of the  agreement in addition to UNPROFOR Generals Cot and Rose, called  this moment an historical one.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``Special dispatch'' by staff correspondents Yang </F> Hsiao-yang (2799 1420 3152) and Shih Ping (0670 0365): ``Huian  Chosen as the Site for the Fujian Nuclear Power Plant;  Feasibility Studies Have Been Approved'']    [Text] Quanzhou, 23rd--Shanqian Township in Fujian's Huian  County has been chosen as the site for the third nuclear power  plant, after the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong and  the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. A feasibility  study on the site was approved a few days ago.    The township in Huian County is the only site among the  three  initially picked by state nuclear power departments in Fujian  that is not near an earthquake zone. Following numerous surveys  and scientific demonstrations, concerned experts finally  determined that Shanqian Township was the best site for a  nuclear power plant in the province. The new plant will be  located in the middle region of coastal Fujian at the mouth of  Quanzhou Wan, near a hillside and facing the sea, and is 140 km  north of Fuzhou and 20 km south of Quanzhou.    The Huian Nuclear Power Plant project plans to build six  900,000 kw generating units with a total installed capacity 5.4  million kw, commanding over 50 billion yuan in total investment.  Phase one has been listed in the ``Ninth Five-Year Plan'' and  will include two 900,000 kw generating units requiring 30  billion yuan in total investment. The units will be integrated  with the eastern and central China power grids.    Huian County has begun the early phase of preparations for  the nuclear power plant project in Shanqian township, which  includes resettling villagers and educating people about nuclear  power.    According to the electricity departments, because the  project  requires a huge amount of capital and the province itself is  short on construction funds, the departments concerned are  hoping to solve the funding problem by inviting bids and  attracting foreign capital.</p>

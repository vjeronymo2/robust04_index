			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: A sector in turmoil needs a guiding hand  -A recent study into UK accounting practice has mixed feelings about the ASB The publication today of Ernst and Young's massive inquiry into the state of British accounting marks the fourth edition of what is arguably the most comprehensive review of its kind. At 1,610 pages the book UK GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the UK, does more than justice to the 500 large companies which provide the raw material in the form of their published accounts. Originally designed to satisfy the in-house accountants at Ernst and Young wanting to know the realities of applying standards and rules to company accounts, it now has a wider audience. With a sales target of 10,000 - compared to 8,000 in 1992 - it will this year be taken to the university-student market. It is a standard reference work - but it is also more than that, and therein lies its power. The detailed study of accounting practice on which it is based gives the authors a unique insight into what worries, confuses, or angers Britain's leading financial directors and their teams. The verdict of the authors is stark: 'In spite of the best efforts of the Accounting Standards Board, financial reporting in the UK remains in a state of some turmoil.' According to the authors, wrangles over issues such as goodwill and brands reflect a conflict of interests between preparers and users of accounts. 'If the ASB is not able to find acceptable solutions to these issues, the possibility remains that the regulation of financial reporting will be taken out of the hands of accountants and placed with a body less sympathetic to the interests of the accountancy profession,' they warn. The book hardly promotes harmony by then attacking the ASB: its new standards are too complex to absorb, or too hastily drafted and over-simplified. A gap looms between theory and practice - particularly for small companies. While the picture in terms of regulation seems dire, the authors find - oddly - that the accounts of large companies have hardly been better. Not only are statistical cores of financial statements improving, but so are their accompanying narrative sections. This state of affairs is put down to the ASB's development of the operating and financial review (OFR). The Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance adopted the OFR as a forward-looking assessment of a company's health. It should contain analytical discussion and a review of trends, and be clear, succinct and understandable to the 'general reader'. It was published by the ASB as a statement of best practice in July 1993. UK GAAP also considers the quest for a conceptual framework for financial reporting. Like the holy grail this is much sought after, particularly in the US, but rarely glimpsed. The authors think they have the measure of the ASB's own statement of principles - and they don't like the look of it. 'What we see is an approach which is radically different from that applied by most companies at present: one which focuses attention on the balance sheet and measures performance by the total movement in equity.' The authors of UK GAAP believe that the founding principle of UK financial reporting is historic cost accounting with current values supplied only as extra information. They envisage accounting centred on transactions in the past, not assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The authors believe the ASB does not realise how fundamental the difference is between the two approaches and it urges the board to stop now and reconsider. 'There is no point in adopting a framework on the basis of its apparent theoretical appeal, only to find that it then results in accounting standards that no one wants.' The authors deserve some credit for not leaving the argument at that point. They acknowledge that the ASB has done some courageous and valuable work. While they disagree with its statement of principles, they suggest a hybrid set of the same should be produced, incorporating more than one accounting model. This plan has a certain elegance. Different sets of users would be provided with different accounts, tailored to their needs, certainly not containing less information but rather the right information in the right form. The data could be shown as 'multi-column reporting' or 'layered' accounts. Among the hundreds of other issues tackled in the book is the so-called 'big GAAP/little GAAP' - the debate over whether small companies should have fewer rules, no rules, or different rules to those of big companies. The authors show that efforts to set up two sets of standards, such as a Canadian attempt in British Columbia, contain 'insurmountable difficulties.' At present the UK profession is awaiting publication of a special working-group report on the issue chaired by Ken Wild of Touche Ross. All the indications are that it will propose a draconian cutting back of regulations governing 'small' companies - those with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 2.8m. The authors of UK GAAP think this is a mistake. They consider size an arbitrary criteria. Instead they see a division between large companies and owner-managed companies. After all, they argue, small companies are not just simpler versions of big companies. The users of their accounts have quite different needs to the average shareholder. 'Companies with a limited number of (management) members, all involved in the day-to-day operations, should be able to incorporate under a different and specially designed limited liability regime,' says the book. The users of owner-managed company accounts are internal, bankers or the Inland Revenue. The accounts should be different to fulfil their needs. UK GAAP also reviews the progress of the various accounting standards introduced in recent years. The story of FRS 3 is instructive and again illustrates the authors' uneasy admiration for the work of the ASB in contrast to their impatience at the shortcomings of aspects of the code it produces. FRS 3 virtually abolished extraordinary items and brought all remaining such charges above the earnings line, as well as introducing new disclosures. It changed the face of the profit and loss account. Unfortunately it appears that some companies are over creative within the new framework. 'It seems that the market is often too easily misled by some companies' innovative use of FRS 3's layered approach to the profit and loss account to divert attention away from the overall total result for which management is accountable.' The authors see this as part of a 'jousting match' between the ASB, which wants the accounts to portray the overall picture, and parts of the financial community, particularly analysts, who still fall hungrily on a 'magic number' in the accounts that they trust will reveal all. Finally the authors see in FRS 3 the first 'manifestation of the ASB's balance sheet approach to income recognition as outlined in the statement of principles.' The standard, they say, focuses on changes in wealth rather than traditional historical cost accounting. They object to this concept being entrenched in UK practice without proper debate. The debate, wherever it rages, will be better for this book. But one has to spare a thought for the authors, already contemplating the gigantic task of writing the fifth edition in 1996. UK GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, by Mike Davies, Ron Paterson and Allister Wilson, is published by Macmillan at Pounds 49.95p</p>

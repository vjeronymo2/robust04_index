			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Court approves restructuring of O&amp;Y Canadian operations A RESTRUCTURING plan for Olympia &amp; York Developments was approved by an Ontario judge last night, ending nine months of court protection for the collapsed Canadian property developer. O&amp;Y, which was the world's biggest developer prior to seeking bankruptcy protection for its Canadian operations last May, will emerge still nominally owned by the Reichmann family, who built up the company over 25 years, but controlled by its creditors. The plan covers only O&amp;Y's Canadian operations. It does not affect Canary Wharf, the project in London's Docklands, which has also been under the care of administrators since last May. Canary Wharf's future is currently the subject of negotiation between the administrators, a group of international banks and the UK government. Under the Canadian plan a new company will be formed. It will be known as O&amp;Y Properties, and will concentrate on property management. O&amp;Y's Canadian buildings, as well as its US properties and its non-property investments, will remain under the umbrella of O&amp;Y Developments. As part of yesterday's court order, Mr Justice Robert Blair sanctioned the appointment of an administrator who is expected to preside over the gradual dismantling of the company and the seizure of several of its buildings by creditors. The restructuring involves about two thirds of O&amp;Y's total debt of CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 7bn). The administrator is expected to be Mr Robert Lowe, an insolvency expert in the Toronto office of auditors Coopers and Lybrand. The future of O&amp;Y's US properties, comprising about 20 buildings, depends on the outcome of talks between the company and lenders to the various buildings. Mr Paul Reichmann, who masterminded O&amp;Y's expansion in the 1970s and 1980s, resigned earlier this week from the board of the US subsidiary. Mr Justice Blair said he was satisfied that the plan was 'fair and reasonable'. Under the restructuring proposals, most secured creditors will be allowed to seize their collateral on 30 days notice.</p>

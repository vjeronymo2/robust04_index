			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tea break loss brings widespread protests THE LOSS of a Friday morning tea break has provoked unrest among engineering construction workers at several sites, including Grangemouth in Scotland and Sizewell in Suffolk. The break was scrapped as part of a cut in working hours agreed with unions. However, some workers may take their break today in protest, in spite of the agreement. Reductions in the working week have been achieved widely in the engineering and building industries, partly by phasing out tea breaks. National officials from the AEU and EETPU engineering unions and the GMB, MSF and TGWU general unions met yesterday in an attempt to quell the unrest. Earlier this week 3,000 workers stopped work for half a day at two oil refinery sites in Grange-mouth. There have also been protests involving a total of up to 6,000 workers at the Sizewell nuclear power station, the Shell Haven oil refinery in Essex, two power station sites at Killingholme, Humberside, and at one of the sites at the St Fergus gas-processing plant in Grampian, according to Construction News, the trade newspaper. The employers confirmed yesterday that there had been a walk-out at Grangemouth but said working had been resumed according to the agreement that took effect on January 6. Mr John Porter, chief executive of the National Engineering Construction Employers' Association, said the 'vast majority' of sites had accepted the new terms. He added that there were still matters to be resolved at Sizewell and at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site in Cumbria. At those two sites some workers already worked a shorter day on Fridays, so breaks were having to be cut from long shifts during the week, he said. The agreement on reduced hours includes a 6.4 per cent increase in the hourly pay rate and a cut in hours from 39 to 38. The first hour of overtime will not now be paid at a higher rate. The deal means an overall pay increase of just under 5 per cent, according to Incomes Data Services, the pay research group.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson to receive Pounds 17.6m for bullion business Kleinwort Benson, the merch-ant banking group, yesterday said it would collect Pounds 17.6m cash for Sharps Pixley, the bullion and metals business being bought by Deutsche Bank. The latest financial information suggests that the value of the net assets being sold is Pounds 7.07m. Kleinwort announced in September that the sale was being negotiated. Sharps Pixley is one of the five members of the London Gold Fixing which meets to fix the gold price twice each working day. The acquisition gives Deutsche Bank marketmaking capability in London, where it previously had only precious metals trading activities, plus a ring-dealing membership of the LME, where base metals prices are established, and membership of the New York Commodity Exchange.</p>

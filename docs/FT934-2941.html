			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading December Footsie futures broke through 3,300 yesterday but failed to hold their gains after a rumoured Pounds 100m sell order kicked in when the underlying market hit that level, writes Peter John. December opened at 3,297 and drove forward to 3,313 while maintaining a high premium to cash. However, some dealers suggested one house had sold a big tailor-made call option, or OTC, which would automatically cancel out if the underlying FT-SE 100 broke through 3,300. If that were the case, the buyer would only have benefited from rises in the stock market up to the knock-out level. A ceiling on possible returns would have made it cheaper to buy. The seller of the option would have to be able to supply stock but once the contract was void, stock bought as a hedge would have to be sold back into the market. The market did indeed turn when underlying equities nudged above 3,300 and the futures were at a 13-point premium. Dealers added that the recent bear squeeze had dissipated. The subsequent slide received further impetus from strong producer price figures in the US which revived concern that US investors might begin to repatriate their holdings. December swung back to 3,281 by the official close on strong turnover of more than 16,200 contracts. Among options, there was strong turnover of 54,423 lots, almost half of which represented the two classes of FT-SE options. The most heavily traded stock options were HSBC on 3,831 lots, followed by Bass.</p>

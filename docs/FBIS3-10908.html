			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Official Investigative Police sources yesterday  confirmed that two of the seven Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front  (FRPL) militants arrested by Investigative Police intelligence  agents occupy very important positions in the hierarchy of the  terrorist organization.    They are alleged subversives Jose Luis Medina Soto and Omar  Alejandro Hermosilla Marin, second and third in that terrorist  hierarchy, respectively. It was reported that they, and the  other group members, were preparing an "annihilation operation"  against a bus of the 38th Carabineros Station in La Florida.    The individuals were captured on 23 February as a result of  investigations launched by the police following the attack  against the "New Spain" Carabineros premises in La Cisterna on  21 February and a series of other actions, such as bombings of  political party offices. These actions were considered a  reaction to the transfer of 45 prisoners, who are in jail on  charges of terrorist activities, to the new maximum security  prison.    The other FRPL militants captured with the first two were  identified as Alma Magaly Victoria Salame Inostroza, Oscar  Antonio Cruces Espinoza, Sergio Manuel Gonzalez Gonzalez, Ulises  Antonio Manriquez Rojas, and Doris Marianela Ojeda Cisterna.    It was also established that the group had direct links with  Mapu-Lautaro [United Popular Action Movement-Lautaro] top leader  Guillermo Ossandon Canas, alias "Diego Carvajal," who is still  at large.

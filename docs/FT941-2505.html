			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Israeli team in Tunis to woo PLO: Public posturing hides private diplomacy between leaders A team of senior Israeli officials flew to Tunis yesterday seeking to woo the Palestine Liberation Organisation back to the negotiating table. It was indicative of the hardening of attitudes to Israel and the peace process since last month's Hebron mosque massacre that the Israeli aircraft carrying the officials was refused permission to land in Tunis. The Israelis had to go to Sicily and switch to a US aircraft for the rest of their journey. Before the team set out, it had announced its acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which called last Friday for the deployment of a temporary international force in the occupied territories to protect Palestinians. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said after the council vote - which condemned the February 25 massacre by a Jewish settler of 30 Palestinians in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs - that he expected full Israeli-PLO peace talks to resume at an early stage. There has been talk of a meeting this week between Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, to announce formally the resumption of negotiations. But neither Israeli nor PLO officials sounded completely confident yesterday. Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, said as he left for Tunis that, while he hoped to pave the way for a resumption of talks, it would be foolish to predict a date. He confirmed that Israel would allow the deployment of a temporary and unarmed international observer force in the West Bank. This would possibly be in the shape of an increased Red Cross presence, with a Red Cross office at Hebron to deal with Palestinian complaints of human rights abuses. Israel is also prepared to see a Palestinian police force established at Hebron, provided it is answerable to the Israeli army. But, as for the possibility of evacuating Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron, Mr Savir was adamant this was an issue for the Israeli government: 'We won't open any debate with them (the PLO) on that issue.' Mr Nabil Sha'ath, PLO chief peace negotiator, said he regarded the issue of radical settlers as of central importance. The Tunis talks would focus, he said, 'on the measures to be taken by the Israeli government about the settlers' status in the occupied Palestinian land, especially Hebron'. Despite the public posturing, the two sides have engaged in considerable private diplomacy. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, spoke to Mr Arafat several times by telephone over the weekend. He declined yesterday to brief his cabinet on the substance of some of the measures he was willing to take to re-start the peace talks because he feared leaks. Meanwhile, Israeli troops yesterday shot and wounded nine Palestinians, and stone-throwers injured an Israeli motorist, during clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The violence, with frustration over the continued Israeli closure of the territories which is keeping tens of thousands of Palestinians away from jobs inside Israel, has focused both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat on the need to wrap-up the 'Gaza-and-Jericho-first' autonomy deal. Mr Peres promised at the weekend that the final deal could be sewn up in three weeks, and that the Israeli army could complete its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho a month after that.</p>

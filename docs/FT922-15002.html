			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Snecma slips to FFr68m loss as orders fall SNECMA, the French state-owned maker of aircraft engines, yesterday provided the latest evidence of the aerospace industry's difficulties by announcing a loss for 1991 and a 30 per cent decline in new orders. The group swung into a consolidated FFr68m (Dollars 12m) net loss last year, from profits of FFr208m in 1990, on a sales increase of 1.7 per cent over the same period to FFr23.9bn. Mr Louis Gallois, the chairman, predicted two months ago that Snecma had roughly broken even in 1991. Snecma attributed the loss to difficulties at three subsidiaries; Messier-Bugatti, which makes aircraft brakes and landing gear; the Sochata maintenance business; and FN Moteurs, its Belgian engine unit. 'All three companies were particularly affected by the recessionary economy in 1991 and have implemented plans to adapt their industrial and human resources to changing market conditions,' said Snecma. The parent company, which embraces most of the engine-making business, booked FFr7.3bn of new orders last year, down from FFr10.3bn. However, all the commercial engine programmes in which it competes, including the CFM-56, made with General Electric of the US, had increased their market share in a 'fiercely competitive market'. Net income at the parent company rose from FFr77m to FFr82m, after a FFr408m extraordinary charge for job losses and depreciation of the value of Snecma stakes in some subsidiaries. The group shed 300 jobs last year and has submitted plans to its workforce for losing another 500.</p>

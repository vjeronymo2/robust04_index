			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / IBM to shake up its PC division International Business Machines is to change the senior management of its Dollars 11bn personal computer business which is facing intense competition. The changes come at a critical time for IBM's PC business, where sales rose 40 per cent last year to achieve a 12 per cent share of the worldwide market, according to market analysts. However, IBM is believed to have lost ground to Compaq Computer in the first quarter. Mr Robert Corrigan, president of IBM PC, who led a restructuring of the PC business that has led to a strong resurgence in sales, will retire. His responsibilities for running IBM Personal Computer go to Mr Richard Thoman, a former Nabisco International and American Express marketing executive who joined IBM last year. Mr Thoman's career moves have followed those of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who also formerly worked at RJR Nabisco and American Express. Mr Thoman will now be responsible for the IBM PC company; the Power Personal Systems division, which is developing a generation of PCs based on IBM's microprocessor technology; and IBM's printer divisions. In other management changes, IBM assigned worldwide responsibilities to senior executives for marketing, product development and finance. Previously, these duties had been divided along geographic lines. IBM also announced the appointment of Mr Anthony Santelli, formerly head of product development for the IBM PC company, to general manager of the Power Personal Systems division. IBM said Mr Corrigan had decided to retire at the end of last year, but agreed to stay on to assist Mr Thoman in the management transition. Mr Thoman, who has no prior technology experience, is expected to bring a more consumer-focused approach to IBM's PC business. By taking direct responsibility for the PC operations, and effectively eliminating a layer of management, Mr Thoman has also created a direct link between the erstwhile 'independent' IBM PC company and IBM's central corporate executive committee, which is responsible for corporate strategy.</p>

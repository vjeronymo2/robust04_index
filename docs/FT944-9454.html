			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (13): Wall Street leads the way - Supercomputers Imagine that an investment house managing funds wants to identify high, medium and low-risk targets for its cash. Imagine, too, that it wants to balance the funds between the three risk types and analyse the rates of return, both planned and expected, from each type of risk. What are the IT problems facing the investment house? If the investment house operates in global financial markets, the varying economic situations around the world would have a profound impact on the ability of that investment house to say accurately what may or may not happen to its clients' funds. Investing millions of pounds in equities or bonds, and switching funds between currencies around the world, adds to the complexity of the finance house's problems. This investment house clearly has vast quantities of data to manipulate and wants to perform complex financial calculations on these data. Where can it turn for support? Unusually, a few financiers are turning to supercomputers to manage their data, and the supercomputer vendors are certainly eyeing the finance markets with increasing interest. A year ago, Merrill Lynch, one of the largest stockbroking firms in the US, established a blueprint for the use of supercomputers in finance. It is believed to have paid Dollars 1.75m for a Cray Research MP2E, a twin-processor machine intended to give the firm greater power to handle its trading activities. At the time, Mr John Galonte, a Merrill Lynch vice-president, said simply: 'We want to improve the timeliness of some of our calculations.' Merrill Lynch is not the only broking firm to introduce supercomputers, says Paul Clarke, brand manager for POWERParallel Systems at IBM in London. 'But the leadership here is in the US, on Wall Street,' he says. Some Wall Street users say the technology brings such significant competitive advantage that they refuse to be identified, he claims - 'customers won't allow themselves to be referenced because of the competitive advantage these machines bring them, but there are probably a handful of users out there at present.' Mr Clarke is brand manager for one of IBM's supercomputers, the SP2, a machine he describes as a parallel, scalable computer. The end-user price for the SP2 was about Pounds 500,000, but a stripped down, entry-level version costs from Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000, he adds. So far, there are no users of the SP2 in the UK - the machine was only launched earlier this year, but financial users are at least beginning to discuss supercomputing. 'We are in the process of setting up a meeting with UK banks,' says Mr Clarke. 'Our scientists from the IBM Maths Centre in Paris will talk to our customers to find out what they want. For example, customers are telling us they're wasting millions in asset and liability management.' Supercomputers can help, he suggests. So what are the advantages of these high-performance machines, capable of processing vast amounts of data extremely quickly? In the last two to three years, IT managers in the finance world have been seeing supercomputers used for maths-based services, in general engineering applications, weather forecasting and so on. Now there appears to be a real role for them in solving commercial problems. The range of problems they can solve include financial analysis and planning; optimisation; risk analysis; pattern spotting and portfolio analysis. In essence, supercomputers can use a number of mathematical disciplines simultaneously, making complex calculations such as simulations and real-time trading analysis relatively straightforward for the finance house. So will finance houses move away from current systems, mainly Unix-based workstations, and adopt supercomputer technology over the next five years? A recent survey by the research company, International Data Corporation, attempted to discover just that. While it did not highlight an explicit move towards supercomputers, it did reveal a surprise shift away from Unix-based workstations in finance IT - 'we believe that Unix systems have been oversold,' comments Alison McKenzie, research analyst and co-author of the IDC report. 'They haven't lived up to expectations, according to survey respondents, and they're more difficult to use than IT directors expected.' In addition, they lack some of the functions of proprietary systems without being as 'open' as desktop PCs in PC local area networks (Lans). And it is in this area, desktop processing power and communications, that finance managers will increase their investment substantially, says IDC. In short, finance directors seem more interested in local computing power. They ask: 'What can computing help us do for our customers?' Customer service is 'a very important issue right now,' says Ms McKenzie. However, she adds, more than a quarter are currently investing in mainframes and supercomputers 'and 60 per cent of those will be increasing their investment.' Dr David Nunn at the University of Southampton points to the relative ease-of-use of supercomputers in comparison with Unix machines. 'On paper, Unix workstations have the same power as traditional supercomputers, but they're not as friendly,' he observes. 'Supercomputers have better software and better documentation, on the whole. After 20 years of working with supercomputers, I've a 'soft spot' for the Crays, even though high-end Unix boxes often have the same number of megaflops.' (The term, 'flops' stands for floating point operations per second). But to some finance IT directors it will seem heavy handed to switch over to supercomputers from their existing systems, which will remain Unix-based workstations from vendors such as Sun or Silicon Graphics in the short-term. Tony Jeffree, senior consultant in the Business Technology division at the National Computing Centre, agrees. 'It depends what your definition of a supercomputer is,' he says. 'These days, desktop Unix workstations can handle computing of the same scale of the supercomputers from a few years ago. But I wouldn't put supercomputers in the same breath as financial services.' Perhaps where large database services are involved, supercomputing might be useful, or for applications such as global financial modelling, but Mr Jeffree says: 'My gut feeling is that supercomputer manufacturers will not move heavily into financial services - perhaps at the esoteric end, but not in the mainstream.' To some users, top-end Unix-based workstations will be all they will ever need.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Survey among UK financial institutions              Percentages pursuing a Unix-oriented strategy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    YES     NO      No, but     Don't                                                 considering     know  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 Banks and building societies      48.3   15.4       36.4           - Insurance and other financial  sectors                          45.0   38.6       16.4           -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994 Banks and building societies      34.0   51.1       12.8         2.1 Insurance and other financial  sectors                          30.8   57.7        9.6         1.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Alison McKenzie, Research Analyst, International Data Corporation, London  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

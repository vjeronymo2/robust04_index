			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "Aviation" rubric: "`Aeroflot' </F> May Lose Its Airbuses"]    [Text] The "Aeroflot" Russian International Airlines  carrier may lose all its five A310-300 jumbo aircraft leased to  Russia by European Airbus Industrie in early 1992.    Valeriy Eksuzian, general director of "Aeroflot's" affiliate  company, "Russian Airlines," which operates the five aircraft,  has told INTERFAX that "unless the government reaffirms its  guarantees of 1991, the aircraft will have to be returned to a  consortium of West European banks which is currently their  owner."    The Russian Federation Government decree of 10 March 1994  "On  Approving Import Customs Duty Rates" calls for a 50-percent  import tariff on aircraft. At the same time, the five A310-300  were leased upon government authorization in 1991, and the  leasing contract envisioned that the aircraft would be exempt  from customs duties and value added tax.    According to the "Russian Airlines" company, any delays in  or  failure to make leasing payments will result in the Western  partners' immediate move to ground the jumbo jets.    "This will result in our losing the international flights  market worth $100 million, which we are still being able to keep  by providing services in line with international standards with  the help of Airbus Industrie's aircraft," Yuriy Korenevskiy,  Russian Federation deputy transport minister, said. In his  words, "Aeroflot" will have to forgo the leasing of a new batch  of four Boeing-767's.    The total value of the five A310-300's is $350 million.  Leasing payments in 1993 amounted to $49 million. In 1993, the  A310-300's carried 350,792 passengers and around 5,500 tonnes of  cargo.</p>

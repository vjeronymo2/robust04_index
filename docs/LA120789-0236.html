Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> POST-COSBY CAREER WORRIES 'SON'  </P> <P> Malcolm-Jamal Warner says he worries about his career after "The Cosby Show"  but hasn't taken his problems and questions to the television series' star,  Bill Cosby.  </P> <P> "I don't look to him very simply because everybody goes to him with their  business and personal problems," Warner, who plays Cosby's son, Theo, said in  an interview with the New York Daily News. "To me, the cat's got five kids of  his own."  </P> <P> "I've been planting seeds for post-Cosby," the 19-year-old actor said.  "Carefully choosing roles because I want them to be different from Theo."  </P> <P> A paperback edition of Warner's book "Theo and Me" was published last month by  New American Library.  </P></p>

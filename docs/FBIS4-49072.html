			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- Crime has become so rampant  in the Chinese countryside that in some places clans and triads  are now more powerful than the communist party, the LEGAL DAILY  [FAZHI RIBAO] warned Tuesday. The lawlessness means Beijing is  having more and more trouble controlling the social, economic  and political situation outside the big cities, it said. "All  types of criminality and delinquency are increasing in the  country," the newspaper reported, adding that in certain  villages "clans and triad-type organisations have supplanted the  communist party."    Triads -- secretive groups with extensive involvement in  organised crime activities -- have long been banned in China but  have reportedly been making a comeback.    It said clans, which have deep roots in China because of the  cultural importance given to lineage and family ties, have also  gotten out of hand, often seizing control of land, water, roads  and crops.    Faced with this explosive situation, "party organisations  are  sometimes in a state of paralysis," the newspaper complained,  calling for an increase in the number of police. The Legal  Daily said the fault lay with local leaders but also with a  general population obsessed with getting rich at any cost, and  had led many individuals and even villages to decide to settle  scores with rivals. Last year, police listed 600 such battles  between villages that had left 100 peasants dead and another  2,000 wounded. Making a resurgence in the countryside along  with traditional local hatreds was what the LEGAL DAILY  described as reactionary behaviour, notably prostitution and the  sale of women and children.    If many peasants find themselves richer as a result of the  economic reforms which led to the dismantling of the commune  system set up by Mao Zedong, tens of millions are worse off and  find themselves living in harsh conditions. More than 100  million people in the countryside are now considered surplus  labour. Disturbances in several provinces broke out last year,  provoked by rural discontent over rising prices and taxes and  the corruption of local officials, and officials have expressed  fear the trouble will be repeated this year.</p>

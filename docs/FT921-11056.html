			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / A teenager's guide to the budget: America President George Bush seemed to have three objectives in last week's budget: to revive confidence with upbeat economic projections; to stimulate spending with temporary tax incentives (most of which expire shortly after the election); and to distract attention from alarming long-term fiscal trends. The administration is betting on economic recovery beginning in the spring and gathering pace through the year. A recovery of some description does seem likely. But its strength and timing remain uncertain. As if to spite the administration, a raft of forward-looking economic data released last week was uniformly gloomy. Durable goods orders plunged 5 per cent in December, the biggest drop for more than a year. Much of the decline was concentrated in the volatile aircraft sector, but non-transportation orders fell 1.6 per cent, to register their fifth monthly decline. New homes sales fell 6.6 per cent in December and now stand at the same level as in August when last summer's brief economic recovery sputtered out. The index of leading indicators fell 0.3 per cent in December, for the second month running. The index, which anticipates turning points in the economy, has now failed to advance significantly for five months. Consumer confidence slid further in January, instead of reviving as analysts had hoped. Such indicators do not invalidate the budget forecast. But they leave plenty of scope for scepticism. Even if the recovery materialises, growth could be less than 2 per cent at an annual rate - in other words invisible for the purposes of an election campaign. Will the budget tax breaks make a difference? This is hard to say if only because the shape - and timing - of the final package that emerges from Congress is uncertain. It could involve substantially larger tax cuts for middle income Americans. Few presidents, however, have tried quite as blatantly to accelerate spending for political purposes. The change in rules for withholding income tax will automatically increase purchasing power by about Dollars 25bn this year. But whether the cash will be spent depends on taxpayers' attitudes: since next year's tax rebates will be correspondingly reduced, many may decide to save the extra cash. The proposed 15 per cent investment tax allowance for companies must be spent before next January. But the revenue loss this year is estimated at only Dollars 6.1bn, so it seems unlikely to provide a huge stimulus in a Dollars 6,000bn economy. The temporary tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which also expires next January, is even smaller beer, costing only an estimated Dollars 200m this year. Even if Mr Bush succeeds in influencing business and consumer decisions, fine-tuning the tax code could easily prove counter productive. It contradicts the philosophy of the 1986 tax reform act  -- which tried to reduce fiscal distortions - and only serves to highlight the White House's short-term economic horizon. This brings us to the longer term fiscal trends. Mr Richard Darman, the budget director, claimed the budget was prudent because it avoided a big tax cut and stuck to the 1990 budget agreement. That he could respect the pact's terms yet produce a record Dollars 400bn (6.7 per cent of gross domestic product) deficit this year merely underlines its shortcomings. The deficit has been boosted by short-term factors beyond the administration's control, including the recession and the costs of bailing out bankrupt savings and loans institutions. But the fundamental problems run deeper. The administration has spent as though the boom of the 1980s were still under way yet pulled in much less revenue than expected because the economy has actually been stagnant for three years. Total federal spending this fiscal year will be a staggering 29 per cent higher in cash terms than in fiscal 1989 - the last year for which Mr Reagan was responsible. But revenues have risen by only 8.5 per cent over three years. The contrast is even starker in the past fiscal year: spending has risen 11.5 per cent but revenues are up only 2 per cent. This compares, incidentally, with a forecast this time last year of a spending increase of 2.5 per cent and a revenue increase of 6.7 per cent. Looking ahead, the administration forecasts 3 per cent economic growth and a rapid reversal of spending and revenue trends. It expects revenues to rise more than 8 per cent in fiscal 1993 and spending to grow by less than 3 per cent. By 1997 it expects spending as a share of GDP to have fallen by four percentage points to just under 21 per cent and revenues to have risen slightly to 18.5 per cent of GDP. On past trends such austerity does not look feasible: deficits may thus remain much higher than most analysts expect. The core problem is the growth of mandatory 'entitlement' programmes, such as health care and pensions for the elderly. In cash terms, total entitlement spending (which accounts for more than half the budget) has grown by about a third since 1989. There is not enough scope for cuts in other programmes, such as defence (which is already declining fast) and discretionary domestic spending (pared in the 1980s), fully to offset likely growth of mandatory spending. The US can thus cure its deficit in one of two ways: by rigorously means-testing entitlements or by permanently raising taxes by 2 or 3 percentage points of GDP. Most countries opted for higher taxation long ago, but US politicians seem strangely unwilling to admit that a choice has to be made.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Laixi (3769 0171 0823) and Li Chunlei </F> (2621 2504 7191)]    [Text] Harbin, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- While on an inspection  tour in Heilongjiang, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing  Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice  premier of the State Council, stressed that Heilongjiang  Province has advantages in the areas of resources and industry.  The current difficulties faced by the province are temporary  ones encountered in the course of advance. Under the leadership  of the party Central Committee and the State Council, it is  entirely possible to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy with the  efforts of the people of the entire province.    From 12 to 17 April, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by  Heilongjiang's party and government leaders, including Sun  Weiben, Tian Fengshan, and Cong Fukui, and other comrades,  arrived in Daqing, Zhaodong, Harbin, and other areas for  inspection tours to conduct investigations.    Comrade Yue Qifeng [deputy secretary of Liaoning party  committee and Liaoning governor] participated in the inspection  tour from beginning to end.    Zhu Rongji visited drilling sites, factory workshops,  state-owned granaries, grain stations, rural seed growers, and  farm product markets to have a cordial conversation with  workers, farmers, and shop assistants. He inquired in detail  about their production, business, and living conditions. He  also called on cadres and workers of state-owned  forestry-industry farms and land reclamation farms to hold talks  with them. In Harbin, he held several talks with the leaders of  relevant departments directly under the provincial government  and leaders of prefectures and cities, enterprises, and  factories to discuss ways to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy.  After affirming Heilongjiang's important contributions to the  state and the achievements the province has scored since the  introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, he  said: The party Central Committee and the State Council pay  special attention to Heilongjiang's economic development.  Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, I, together with  other comrades from the relevant departments under the State  Council, have come here to conduct investigations and studies  and to discuss with the provincial leaders new ideas for reform  and development and measures for overcoming the current  difficulties and for developing the economy.    Zhu Rongji stressed: The difficulties which have cropped up  in the course of Heilongjiang's economic development are  temporary difficulties in the course of advance. There is no  doubt that they can be overcome. In solving these problems, the  most important thing we must do is to unify the thinking of the  cadres and people of the whole province, enhance their  understanding, and change their concepts. The characteristics  of Heilongjiang's economy are that it has resources and that  industry and state-owned enterprises occupy a large proportion  of the economy. This is a factor restricting economic  development, but is also an advantage for invigorating the  province's economy. So long as the province does its work in a  down-to-earth manner in accordance with requirements for  developing a socialist market economy, it will be able to  transform these factors of restriction to favorable conditions  for developing the economy.    Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang is the nation's important  grain producing province and is also the nation's largest  strategic base for grain reserves. It has great potential for  grain production. Its 80 million mu of low-yielding farms can be  improved; moreover, it has another 50 million mu of wasteland  that can be reclaimed for farming. The central authorities  attach great importance to agriculture. They are adopting  measures to narrow the gap between the princes of agricultural  and industrial products and are increasing investment in  agriculture. So long as Heilongjiang upholds the principle of  taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy,  makes full use of its advantages, readjusts its planting  structure, popularizes fine seed strains, and develops a  diversified economy, it will be able to turn agriculture into an  important pillar for invigorating its economy. He pointed out:  Town and village enterprises in Heilongjiang are not well  developed, and farmers' incomes are increasing at a slow pace,  but Heilongjiang's industry has enough technological strength to  support the development of town and village enterprises. The  prospects are promising in this area.    Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang Province is an important  industrial base in China. In particular, it has various  categories of heavy industries; its technological strength is  strong, and in terms of equipment Heilongjiang is not bad at  all. The province should make the upgrading of state-owned  large- and medium-size enterprises the focus of its economic  work and enhance the leading role of these enterprises. The  fundamental way to deal with the difficulties encountered by  state-owned enterprises is to deepen reform and to effectively  change their operating mechanisms in line with the requirements  for building modern enterprises. In building a modern  enterprise system, the most important thing to do is to separate  government administration from enterprise management. The  government should not interfere with an enterprise's decisions  regarding normal operations. The government's main task is to  supervise the leading bodies of enterprises and macroeconomic  environment.    While in Harbin, Zhu Rongji inspected the ordnance  enterprises which were encountering relatively greater  difficulties. He stressed: Ordnance enterprises should  continue to carry forward the spirit of self-reliant work to  build an enterprise with arduous efforts, and change their way  of operation and management in line with the requirements of a  market economy. At the same time, they should make accurate  decisions regarding switching from the manufacture of military  products to that of civilian products. First, they should  undertake more labor-intensive projects, instead of projects  that need a large sum of capital, so as to employ more surplus  labor; second, they should undertake more technical  transformation projects instead of capital construction  projects, because this is an effective way to get quick returns  with less investment; third, they should no longer rely on  appropriations to undertake new projects. They should use their  own capital or bank loans, but should consider their ability to  repay loans; and fourth, they should undertake more service  projects instead of concentrating entirely on industrial  projects.    Touching on debts among enterprises, Zhu Rongji said: In  settling arrears among enterprises this time, new methods will  be adopted to deal with the new characteristics. The state will  not inject large sums of funds to settle arrears caused by the  shortage of funds for investment in fixed assets. When funds  raised by localities for projects are insufficient, the relevant  prefectural authorities must quickly readjust their capital  construction scale and channel their funds into other areas so  as to ensure the minimum amount of funds; otherwise, banks will  suspend loans for the projects. It is necessary to foster a  concept of the legal system, strengthen settlement discipline,  and prevent the accumulation of new arrears while settling the  old ones.    Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang has the advantage in opening  to the outside world. It should work harder to absorb and  utilize foreign capital. While developing all-directional  trade, it should strive to improve border trade, rectify the  border trade order, readjust border trade structures, and adopt  strict measures to control quality so as to promote the healthy  development of border trade.    While inspecting Daqing, Zhu Rongji pointed out: Daqing has  made immortal contributions in changing the concept that "China  is poor in petroleum." Daqing should inherit and carry forward  the fine tradition of building an enterprise with arduous  efforts which took shape during the all-out effort to prospect  for oil, and make greater contributions to the state. It should  adopt advanced technology and strive hard to stabilize its oil  output at the current production level before the year 2000. At  the same time, it should strive to simultaneously develop  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production,  and fishery, improve urban planning, and build itself into a  prosperous area in the north.    During the few days of investigations and studies, Zhu  Rongji  and other leaders of the relevant departments under the State  Council he was leading discussed with the comrades from  Heilongjiang new ideas for reform and development. They also  solved some practical problems in economic development for  Heilongjiang, especially for its ordnance and coal enterprises,  as well as for state-owned forestry-industry and land  reclamation farms.    Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were comrades  from the relevant ministries and commissions under the State  Council, including Liu Zhongli, Guo Shuyan, Wang Senhao, Han  Zhubin, Xu Youfang, Tu Yourui, Wang Tao, Sheng Huaren, Zhu Yuli,  and Zhang Junjiu.</p>

P. Vorobyev, M. A. Dedunovich; UDC </F> 621.396.967]    [Abstract]Techniques are described for analyzing and  designing solid-state active devices within a systems approach.  Some engineering solutions are examined, as well as attainable  parameters for modern Hanna diode generators and frequency  generators in the shortwave portion of the millimeter range  (_l_  = 2 mm). It was found that the field of solid-state active  devices of extremely high frequencies is a broad one because the  devices are small in size, and require little energy. In  particular this applies to their use for radar stations. 1  figure and 5 references.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS ADVOCATE BEGINS NEW FAST  </P> <P> Homeless advocate Mitch Snyder, whose 51-day fast in 1984 forced the Ronald  Reagan Administration to allocate funds for the homeless, launched another  hunger strike Saturday in the nation's capital.  </P> <P> Snyder began his fast at noon and was joined by 21 members of his Community for  Creative Non-Violence homeless advocacy group.  </P> <P> The organization is protesting a District of Columbia committee's plan to cut  the department budget that funds shelters and other services to homeless  families by one-third this year and by nearly one-half next year.  </P> <P> The committee voted Friday to cut the department's budget by $19 million over  the next two years. The action will be voted on by the district's council March  20.  </P> <P> Snyder, 46, vowed to "do whatever is necessary" to change the committee's  actions.  </P> <P> Starting Monday, the group of fasters will take turns demonstrating in front of  City Hall, he said. Snyder said he was unsure whether the group would continue  to fast if the committee's actions were sustained by the council.  </P></p>

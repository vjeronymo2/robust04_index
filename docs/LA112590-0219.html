			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR DEF. POWAY  </P> <P> For the second consecutive game, Corona del Mar flirted with disaster. And for  the second consecutive time, the Sea Kings found a way to win.  </P> <P> Middle blocker Tahlia Wagner had 16 kills, and outside hitter Tracy Schriber  added 12 as the top-seeded Sea Kings rallied in the final two games for a  15-12, 10-15, 13-15, 15-3, 15-6 win over unseeded Poway in a second-round  Division I regional game at Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (26-1) advanced to the regional final against the winner of the  San Jose Lynbrook, which defeated the Sea Kings in last year's regional final.  </P> <P> Heather Burke and Shana Purvis each had 10 kills to lead Poway (23-6).  </P> <P> The Sea Kings, who struggled in a four-game victory over Notre Dame Academy in  the first round, extended their winning streak to 24 games despite 36 hitting  errors.  </P> <P> It was only the third time this season Corona del Mar has been pushed to five  games. The others were a win over El Toro and a loss to La Habra in the  semifinals of the Orange County Championships.  </P> <P> "We weren't on tonight," Corona del Mar Coach Dale Flickinger said. "But we  came right back and found a way to win."  </P> <P> "Poway has the best offense we have seen this year. They have strong hitters  outside and in the middle." MIKE REILLEY  </P></p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Daihatsu pulls out of US car market THE US recession yesterday claimed its first victim in the Japanese automobile industry when Daihatsu, the Japanese vehicle maker, decided to stop selling cars in the US. Daihatsu, in which Toyota holds a minority stake, said it would halt production of two vehicles made for the US market - the Charade subcompact and the Rocky, a four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle - in order to stem mounting losses. The withdrawal by Daihatsu from the US follows similar moves last year by Rover Group of the UK and Peugeot of France, which decided to abandon the American car market in the face of continuing heavy losses and dwindling sales in the US. Although Daihatsu has only a small presence in the US, its withdrawal will no doubt be welcomed by US makers concerned about their steady loss of market share to Japanese competitors. Daihatsu's move illustrates the financial pressure affecting some of Japan's smaller vehicle makers and their increased vulnerability to swings in the US market. With the Japanese vehicle market stagnating, and profits under pressure due to intense competition, Japanese car makers no longer have a safe profitable haven at home that allows them to support difficult operations overseas. Daihatsu is Japan's second biggest manufacturer of mini-cars for the domestic market. Total Daihatsu domestic vehicle sales last year declined by 1.7 per cent to 484,475 units, although a sharp 16 per cent decline in mini-car sales in December is indicative of troubles facing the company. The sales have been undermined both by the sluggishness of vehicle demand and by changes in parking regulations that removed advantages formally afforded to mini-car owners. Profits are expected to decline sharply in the current year. In the US, Daihatsu had hoped to achieve an annual volume of 50,000 vehicles a year when it launched operations in 1987, but sales in the current fiscal year ending in March are expected to total only 10,300 units. Daihatsu said that it decided to terminate sales after concluding that it would be impossible to nurse the operation to profitability. The company said it would continue to honour warranty commitments to vehicle owners and would maintain a service and parts supply network. It had no immediate plans to reduce US employment. Nissan, Japan's second biggest vehicle maker, last week decided to shut down its loss-making Australian plant.</p>

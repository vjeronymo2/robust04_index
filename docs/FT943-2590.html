			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Big turnout for Hong Kong elections Stephen Chan, with his panda mascot, canvasses support in his campaign for elections in Hong Kong yesterday. Nearly 700,000 people turned out to vote in the colony's first fully democratic elections under British rule, undeterred by threats from Beijing to overturn the result of the poll when it resumes sovereignty in 1997. In the poll 756 candidates contested 346 seats which comprise 18 district boards. An exit poll conducted by TVB television station found that 70 per cent of those who voted said they were not concerned by China's stated intention to overturn the election.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Smith cashes in at Storm - Directors' Transactions GARY SMITH, the chief executive of the animation and licencing group Storm, has sold 2m shares at 10.75p. Smith still retains 5m and his chairman, James Driscoll holds 29.7m, approximately 29 per cent of the issued share capital. Rugby group has proved something of an exception in the building materials sector, having outperformed the market by approximately 16 per cent over the past 12 months. Peter Carr remains by far and away the largest holder on the board with more than 1.8m shares. John Ritblat, chairman and chief executive of British Land, has been buying more stock, this time the 12.5 per cent bonds. He spent Pounds 258,000 on them and Nicholas Ritblat paid out Pounds 51,000. John Ritblat also has bought 850,000 ordinary shares since the end of March. British Land shares remain at a significant discount to the net asset value.

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport efficiencies (2) Sir, Railtrack and client operators must visit Dusseldorf airport in Germany. Coming out of customs they would face a screen. A button brings up user instructions in English. Key in Hamburg, or Koln, and there is displayed the next S-bahn to either Dusseldorf or Duisburg main station connecting with the first inter-city service. Why not try the system out at Gatwick and put Giles Keating's information technology proposal (Personal View, October 31) into practice.

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Management: An angry young warrior - Emiko Terazono and Christopher Lorenz explain how Fuji Xerox's desire to spread its wings is putting a strain on relations with its US parent Of the many joint ventures between American and Japanese companies, Fuji Xerox has long been regarded as a model. The Japanese affiliate of Fuji Photo Film and Xerox, the US copier maker, has not just been a success in its own right. It also rescued Xerox from oblivion in the 1980s by supplying it with a string of successful products. Even more important, it has provided its US parent with a continuous flow of object lessons in better management techniques, notably total quality and 'benchmarking'. Xerox has since transferred its 'TQM' and benchmarking expertise to a host of other companies in the US and Europe, making Fuji Xerox as influential a source of management expertise - albeit an indirect one - as Toyota in manufacturing or Sony in innovation. At the age of 32, with 27,000 employees and revenues last year of Y706.6bn (Pounds 4.6bn), the 50-50 venture is pretty mature by the standards of most inter-company alliances. But, in common with many younger ventures, it is suffering a delayed bout of growing pains over relations with one of its parents. Set up in 1962, its success in the low end of the copier market in the 1970s and 1980s contrasted sharply with Xerox's problems. The troubles of the US group were so severe at one point that the joke among consultants was that the Japanese affiliate would buy out its American parent. Now, when a resurgent Xerox is reorganising many of its international operations in order to improve what it calls the 'line of sight' (direct influence) of its US-based business divisions over their markets around the world, Fuji Xerox is straining at the leash. It claims - as it has often done in the past - that it is finding the group's organisation an increasing constraint on its own growth. The group structure divides global responsibilities geographically between Xerox, Fuji Xerox and Rank Xerox, the European affiliate. Under this arrangement Fuji Xerox's external sales are limited to the Asia-Pacific region, although it also supplies a substantial volume of products and designs to the Xerox network in North America and Europe. The latter are thought to account for about 10 per cent of its revenues, slightly more than its Asian sales. 'As our client companies expand globally, we are finding that the group's division of territories is hampering business and making it hard for us to counter the competition,' says Toshio Arima, strategic planning director of Fuji Xerox and the main link with Xerox on policy matters. 'It's a very difficult problem and we are trying to solve things one (issue) at a time,' he says. Arima says effective technical and service support of Japanese multinationals is one issue which needs to be resolved, while a global manufacturing strategy to improve competitiveness is another. Jeff Kennard, who for five years was executive assistant in Tokyo to the venture's president and is now director of Fuji Xerox relations at Xerox headquarters in Connecticut, counters in the friendliest of tones. He says Fuji Xerox already copes with this problem by having account executives around the world who, in conjunction with local representatives from Xerox or Rank Xerox, deal successfully with global customer companies. Although he stresses that Fuji Xerox can only operate 'where the agreement allows them to', Kennard, who is one of five Xerox westerners on the venture's 28-person board against only two from Fuji Photo Film, points out that the affiliate's territory was expanded only four years ago. In addition to Japan, it previously held the right to sell in Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. In 1990 it acquired the Australian, New Zealand, Singaporean and Malaysian markets from Rank Xerox. The Japanese affiliate had argued since the early 1980s that Rank Xerox's strategy of targeting the high end of the market was ineffective. While Fuji Xerox has considerable autonomy in developing and marketing products for these countries, its design of products for multinational markets is now subject to close co-ordination with the US and European organisation - a form of control which, however sensible, sometimes irks Japanese pride. At US headquarters, Kennard says that although the separate nature of the two organisations causes inevitable complexities in the co-ordination of strategy, technology, product development, manufacturing and marketing to key customers, 'we're proud of how well the two managements work together'. They must do so even more closely now that digital technology is turning the copier business into an integral part of the information technology industry  -a trend which will expose Xerox to even stiffer competition than in the past. As Kennard says: 'It's a bit like a husband and wife. You don't just order people around if you want to maintain a good relationship.' This is not the first time that American satisfaction with the relationship has been matched by an urge on the Japanese side for more independence over where and how to do business. The issue has been endemic to the relationship for well over a decade. It rests partly on Fuji Xerox's stubborn independence in the past in product strategy, which paid off handsomely on repeated occasions, and partly on a long-standing view, in the words of one Fuji Xerox manager, that 'our (world) market should be protected by ourselves'. There has also been resentment over the years that, because of the territorial agreement, Fuji Xerox could never achieve as high an export ratio as independent rivals such as Canon. This, the Japanese believe, puts a brake on the joint venture's growth. This tension is reinforced by the usual clash between Japanese and western priorities. In common with other Japanese companies, Fuji Xerox has placed more emphasis on growing its market share than on increasing its profitability and return on assets. The balance has had to be redressed somewhat since its profits were hit by the recession in 1991, but there is still comment within the venture that this difference contributed to its rise and Xerox's decline during the 1970s and 1980s. In its early years Fuji Xerox managed to position itself in Japan by doing business very much the 'Japanese way'. When the joint venture was set up, the manufacturing was done by Fuji Photo Film, and day-to-day operations were looked after by former Fuji managers. Today Fuji Xerox still prides itself on being more Japanese than a Japanese company. However, a contract between the two parent companies stipulated that as a shareholder, Fuji Photo Film could collect information from Fuji Xerox but could not use it in its own operations. This limited the extent of Fuji Photo Film's involvement in the affiliate. Its direct role was virtually terminated when production was transferred to Fuji Xerox in 1971. Another element which heightened the sense of autonomy was the technology and licensing agreements made between the US parent and the venture. 'The agreements are like those between two independent companies, rather than loose acknowledgements of the sort which exist within Japanese companies,' says Arima. In the early 1970s, Xerox grudgingly allowed Fuji Xerox to go its own way in research and product development. The Japanese subsidiary wanted to expand market share by developing cheap compact copier machines for outright sale, while Xerox's main priority was maintaining large profit margins and return on assets by targeting the high end of the market - and continuing its traditional policy of rental. Fuji Xerox also foresaw Japanese companies threatening the copier market once Xerox's xerography patents expired in the early 1970s. Strong leadership helped tackle these problems. In spite of Xerox's initial demand that the venture stop R&amp;D in the low end of the market and desist from direct sales, the Japanese affiliate forged ahead with its own agenda under Yotaro Kobayashi, then president and now chairman. Having suffered badly in the Japanese market at the hands of arch-rival Ricoh, Kobayashi initiated Fuji Xerox's quality control programme, which eventually led to the company winning the Deming Prize, awarded to companies that show outstanding quality management. It was only in the late 1970s that Xerox finally woke up to Japanese competition - and, with it, the full virtues of its offspring. With its back against the wall, it started importing the low and mid-market copiers from Fuji Xerox which it had at first scorned. It adopted the venture's quality discipline of halving manufacturing defects and slashing the number of suppliers. By as early as 1980 the benchmarking of its operations against those of Fuji Xerox had helped it to narrow sharply the 50 per cent cost gap that had existed with its Japanese rivals, and it made further progress in subsequent years. All this, plus the increasing importance of Fuji Xerox's financial contribution to the Xerox group's earnings, brought the two sides much closer than they had been. During the 1980s they intensified co-operation on research, product development, manufacturing and planning, and exchanged more personnel than in the past to reinforce the relationship. For the Japanese, the sense of being an equal was heightened further this year when the original Technology Assistance agreement governing the relationship between the two companies, and under which Xerox licensed technology to Japan, was upgraded into a Technology Agreement. The difference in wording is marginal, but it reflects the fact that the flow is now two-way - although Kennard points out that it is still much greater from the US to Japan than vice versa. At a time when the yen's sharp appreciation is eating away export profits and the focus in the group's technology has shifted from hardware to software, Arima says Fuji Xerox is once again looking to its parent for its some of its R&amp;D capability. To the consultants' old joke about buying Xerox, he says: 'We wouldn't dream of it. We're good at making the boxes, but they're better at creating added value.' Kennard adds that the possibility of Xerox buying out any of Fuji's stake is just as unthinkable. Such a move was considered by the Americans in the late 1960s when Xerox took 51 per cent control of Rank Xerox, and again in the 1970s when Fuji Xerox stepped out of line by starting to design and make its own copiers. But recently it has not crossed anyone's mind, Kennard insists. The effect of Xerox obtaining even 51 per cent would be negative, he says. 'We would risk alienating management, hurting the well-earned pride of the Japanese employees and throwing away the stimulus which Xerox gets from the healthy tension between the two of us.' On top of that, he says 'how much practical control we could get would be questionable.'  ----------------------------------------- PROFIT AND SALES  -----------------------------------------                         Profit (Ybn)   Sales    Pre-tax    After-tax  ----------------------------------------- 1983    263.9     26.3       11.1 1984    304.5     30.7       12.2 1985    347.3     33.5       14.1 1986    355.8     29.4       11.9 1987    427.4     36.8       15.4 1988    457.5     48.6       22.2 1989    490.3     52.5       22.3 1990    539.2     54.2       23.2 1991    621.2     48.6       22.3 1992    681.9     38.9       15.5 1993    706.6     39.4       16.7  -----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / White House doubts surface on Japan policy Just as US officials were basking in the afterglow of the Congress vote on the global trade pact, a fissure seemed set to open over administration trade policy towards Japan. It was revealed in a speech in New York on Friday by Mr Jeffrey Garten, the Commerce Department under-secretary for international trade. He apparently surprised his colleagues in the inter-agency trade policy review group by signalling that the Clinton administration would increasingly rely on multilateral channels to put pressure on Japan to reduce its trade barriers. He admitted the US had failed to command international support for its current confrontational policy through bilateral talks and suggested that more could be achieved by seeking allies among 'progressive forces of change' in the new World Trade Organisation, the EU, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), and Japan itself. These would include Japanese consumer groups and companies seeking cheap imports. The apparent rift in the administration reflects differences in the business community at large over whether Japan can best be dealt with bilaterally or multilaterally. The bilateral camp, which includes so-called trade hawks such as Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department negotiator now head of the Economic Strategy Institute, has so far prevailed in influencing US policy. In his speech Mr Garten said: 'In one of the great ironies of the late 20th century, Japan - which has rigged its economic systems for over 100 years - has branded the US as wanting to 'manage trade'. From Seoul to Sydney, from London to Frankfurt, and even around the US, the image stuck. From a public relations standpoint we never recovered.' The administration should not abandon its bilateral tactics towards Japan, but could employ 'a more strategic' and 'sophisticated' policy, Mr Garten said. 'What is required is a degree of subtlety and patience that does not always characterise US policy - in any administration,' he said. 'We could be more proactive in urging Gatt, the IMF, the OECD, Apec, and others to focus on Japanese practices that do not conform to world standards.' Mr Garten said that, though much had been achieved by the current bilateral policy, 'there is a growing fatigue and weariness among the negotiations on both sides of the Pacific which makes the future agenda more difficult'. Mr Garten joined the Clinton administration after officials devised the current 'results-oriented' policy and began negotiating sectoral deals which included 'economic indicators to measure progress'. It has been his assignment to negotiate an opening in the Japanese automotive market, which accounts for 60 per cent of the US trade deficit with Japan. 'Frankly, we have little to show for our efforts,' on this front, he said. But other deals reached bilaterally have been successful. Motorola said US pressure to open and deregulate Japan's cellular telephone market had led to a boom of subscribers - from 12,000 to 150,000 in less than a year - on Motorola's TACS system. It is unclear how much support Mr Garten has within the administration for a shift - or what he calls 'an evolution' - towards multilateralism. The speech drew anger in some quarters although administration officials would not comment publicly on his views. Mr Prestowitz, who works closely with the administration, said the US originally pressed for the Uruguay Round as a means to deal multilaterally with Japan. 'The theory was that other countries would join us, but it doesn't tend to work that way,' he said. Other countries - in Asia and the EU - want to maintain their own invisible barriers. Mr Jules Katz, former deputy trade representative, favours the multilateral approach and says many more cases could be brought before dispute settlement panels of the new World Trade Organisation. 'Why should we be carrying the ball alone, particularly since the results are always multilateralised?' he asked.</p>

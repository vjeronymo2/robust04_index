			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelter clean-up stalled by cash shortage Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, could not afford to renovate its Pechenga smelter, one of the world's biggest polluters, in Russia's Murmansk region, near the Finnish border, Mr Mars Altibaev, logistics manager and the company's representative in London, said yesterday. He said that was the main reason Norilsk, still 48 per cent owned by the Russian government, was seeking foreign investment. The company has retained a Scandinavian consortium including Elkem and Kvarner Engineering of Norway and Boliden of Sweden to carry out the Pechenga reconstruction, which Mr Altibaev said would cost a minimum of USDollars 200m and up to Dollars 1.5bn, depending on what investment the company could attract. Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some falls on the nearby town of Nikel but prevailing winds take two-thirds across Finland and Norway where the acid rain it causes has severely damaged forests. Western observers suggest that the smelter, established in the 1930s and renovated in the 1940s, has only a few years of life left. Pechenga produces about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an intermediate material), which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining. Mr Altibaev said Norilsk was suffering from cash flow difficulties because the central government took half the nickel output and paid in roubles at the domestic price - 47 per cent below world prices. The government also kept most of the income from its platinum group metals sales. The company's inability to pay on time had caused strikes in the May to August period when employees needed cash for their holidays. However, management had reached a compromise agreement with the trade unions that should prevent future strikes. Norilsk claims, in documents prepared for presentations to London financial institutions today, to account for 21.2 per cent of world nickel output; 3.2 per cent of copper production; 18.9 per cent of cobalt and 42 per cent of platinum production. Mr Altibaev said Russian nickel exports to the west would be about 100,000 to 105,000 tonnes this year, similar to 1993 levels. If nickel prices rose, shipments would increase next year. He indicated that Norilsk's copper production, once about 400,000 tonnes, would be less than 300,000 tonnes this year of which up to 100,000 would be exported. He would not comment on platinum or cobalt production and exports.</p>

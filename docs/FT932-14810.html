			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Dutch insurer lifted by banking side INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group, said net profit rose by 6.5 per cent to Fl 1.68bn (Dollars 933m) in 1992, as a strong increase in banking profits more than compensated for a slight decline in insurance results, writes Ronald van de Krol. In banking, ING saw an 11.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Fl 1.05bn and a strong increase in international lending, which was up more than 25 per cent over 1991. ING's insurance operations faced depressed results in non-life and reinsurance activities, though life insurance developed favourably. Overall, pre-tax profits from insurance dropped by 1 per cent to Fl 1.14bn. In early 1993, the company said it was withdrawing from general reinsurance of large risks such as ships, aircraft and natural disasters. The 1992 dividend is to be raised 3.6 per cent to Fl 3.20 per share, with a choice offered between payment in cash or preference shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Qingxian (3769 3237 2009) from the "Talks </F> on Building a Modern Enterprise System" column: "Building a New  System Requires New Knowledge"]    [Text] The government and enterprises are currently facing  the important task of studying the basic knowledge about the  modern enterprise system. Establishing the modern enterprise  system is a new question for study, and most people are still  unfamiliar with this concept. Establishing the modern  enterprise system is also the most important "campaign" now that  economic structural reform in our country has entered the stage  of "storming the fortifications" [gong jian 2396 1017], so we  must work very hard to acquire and understand the knowledge in  this regard. Carrying out reform in this area is a pressing  task for us.    If we say that our previous enterprise reform measures were  primarily aimed at "destroying the old," then the establishment  of the new enterprise system will mainly be aimed at  "establishing the new." The modern enterprise system is not one  or two specific systems in some areas, but a comprehensive  institutional system which is related to all aspects of the  external environment and the internal mechanisms of the  enterprises. The system should clearly determine the character,  position, role, and behavior mode of the enterprises. It should  standardize the basic relationships between the enterprise and  the investor, between the enterprise and the creditor, between  the enterprise and the government, between the enterprise and  the market, between the enterprise and society, between one  enterprise and another, between the enterprise and the  consumers, and between the enterprise and its workers.  Moreover, the modern enterprise system is the result of summing  up the enterprise reform experience in our country, It is the  product of the development of socialized mass production and the  market economy and is based on the integration of the creative  practice from our country's enterprise reform with international  and common practices. It is certain that our existing knowledge  cannot enable us to thoroughly understand all its contents. For  example, we may now hear quite a few specious comments on the  modern enterprise system. Some people have said that the modern  enterprise system was a modernized enterprise system, and the  first requirement in a modernized enterprise system was to  realize enterprise modernization. Other people have said that  the modern enterprise system referred to the conduct of modern  enterprise management. These were interpretations without real  understanding and were just based on people's existing  knowledge. In fact, being a model of the enterprise structure,  the modern enterprise system is the reflection of the  relationship of production, and it does not represent the  modernization level of the equipment in the enterprises and does  not refer to the modernization of enterprise management. If  popular understanding remains at such a level, how can they  establish the modern enterprise system, which is scientific and  standardized?    At present, the relevant central departments and the local  governments are actively selecting the points for carrying out  the pilot schemes for the establishment of the modern enterprise  system. Various provinces are applying for a larger number of  assignments of such pilot schemes from the central departments  concerned. Enterprises are also vying with one another to apply  for carrying out such pilot schemes from the provincial and  municipal authorities. Such enthusiastic reactions show that an  extensive consensus of opinion on the establishment of the  modern enterprise system has been reached, and this is supported  by localities and enterprises. In such circumstances, we should  grasp the opportunity and properly adopt various forms to  organize the local governments and the enterprises to study the  basic knowledge about the modern enterprise system so that  people may fully and more deeply understand the modern  enterprise system.    The government departments must make this study  indispensable  and must not just carry it out in a formalistic way. Such study  is necessary for the enterprises; it is not an extra burden  which disrupts routine operations. Our minds must be armed with  the new knowledge acquired from the study; otherwise, we may  lose our bearings and could even go astray in practice. While  studying knowledge about the modern enterprise system, the  government departments should more scientifically select the  points for carrying out the pilot schemes according to objective  standards so that reform in this regard may be carried out from  the very beginning in a rigorous and regular way, as opposed to  a haphazard way based on some people's wishful thinking.  Through studying the knowledge about the modern enterprise  system, the enterprises will understand why they can or cannot  be assigned to carry out the pilot scheme and will thus reduce  their unnecessary grievances about whether an arrangement is  fair or unfair. Thus, enterprises that are not selected for the  pilot schemes will also actively create conditions in order to  carry out a pilot scheme as soon as possible and to march toward  the modern enterprise system.</p>

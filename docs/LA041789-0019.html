			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GEORGIA FOR THE GEORGIANS IS SUDDENLY NOT SO SOVIET  </P> <P> Foreigners have most often seen the people of Soviet Georgia as carefree and  proud, extraordinarily generous, lavish in their sharing their piquant cuisine  and rich wines. Their spas and beaches have become a favorite vacation retreat  for Soviet citizens less favored by sun and mountains. And whatever prejudices  linger about Georgian entrepreneurs overcharging for fruits and flowers in  Moscow markets, Russians have usually viewed their southern neighbors as an  exotic people of passion and daring.  </P> <P> But in the last week these unexamined biases and romantic images evaporated  when a bloody clash between Soviet troops and Georgian nationalist  demonstrators in the capital, Tbilisi, left at least 19 dead and hundreds  wounded.  </P> <P> The killings have created a major new crisis for Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a native Georgian  and former Communist Party chief in the republic. More than a local flare-up of  nationalism, the Georgian protests are a test of the limits of Gorbachev's  democratization, a trial for peaceful reform and a warning that the aspirations  of non-Russians could very well bring down the program of perestroika.  </P> <P> After 68 years under Soviet control, Georgians have evolved into a compact,  self-conscious nation prepared to defend their language, territorial integrity  and cultural dominance in their republic. With the coming of glasnost,  subterranean nationalists emerged from the ranks of dissent into the legal and  semi-legal political arena. Cultural and political groups such as the Ilya  Chavchavadze societies (named after the leading nationalist poet of the last  century) and the National Democratic Party (modeled for a pre-Soviet  nationalist party) appeared with their own newspapers and platforms. All shared  the common program of cultural resistance to Russian inroads and greater  political control in local hands, but some went further than others in calling  for secession from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Georgians are a nation profoundly aware of their ancient history, beginning in  the 3rd Century BC. Early in the 4th Century AD, Georgia adopted Christianity  and, with its neighbors, Armenia and Caucasian Albania, found itself in time on  the exposed frontier facing militant Islam. For more than a thousand years  Georgians lived in uneasy coexistence with the Muslims of Iran and Turkey,  often retaining a degree of political autonomy, always maintaining their unique  ethnic culture and language. Dominance by shahs and sultans and division among  empires did not prevent medieval Georgia from developing a rich literature or  providing a haven for non-Georgians escaping the ravages of nomadic invaders.  </P> <P> Unity, however, generally eluded the Georgians until the coming of the Russians  at the beginning of the 19th Century. Russian rule -- like Soviet power after  1921 -- brought Georgians together under a single political authority and began  a long social transformation that ended the village isolation of most of its  population. With czarist administration came relative peace and security,  commerce and the growth of towns. European learning, through a Russian filter,  stimulated Georgians to develop their own sense of modern nationhood.  </P> <P> Under Soviet rule, Georgia lost is political sovereignty and the possibility of  expressing its nationalist aspirations. But at the same time Soviet nationality  policy encouraged the "nativization" of the Soviet republics. Armenians, who  before the revolution had controlled the towns of Georgia economically and  politically, now drifted to their own Soviet republic. Georgians were favored  in hiring, and membership in the local Communist Party overrepresented the  percentage of Georgians in the population. So rather than being Russified like  the Ukrainian, Belorussian and Baltic republics, Georgia became ever more  Georgian. Its people developed a coherent national consciousness that stressed  the need to preserve their language and cultural heritage. They took pride in  their native son, Josef Stalin, who though he presided over the worst years of  national repression, forced collectivization and the purging of the Georgian  intelligentsia, nevertheless was admired as the man who had transformed the  whole Soviet Union from a largely agricultural to a primarily industrial Great  Power and successfully resisted the Nazi invasion.  </P> <P> In the last quarter century, however, Georgia suffered from a notorious  corruption, a flagrant wheeling and dealing in a widespread underground  economy. Shevardnadze governed the republic from 1972 to 1985 and tried to  cleanse the country of the worst abuses. Nationalist sentiment steadily grew,  and in 1978 protests forced Shevardnadze to concede that Georgian would remain  the officially designated language of the republic. But that same year the  Abkhazians, a Muslim minority with their own autonomous republic within the  republic of Georgia, condemned Georgian misrule and petitioned to join the  Russian republic. Their demands were rejected by Moscow, even as their  complaints were recognized as legitimate.  </P> <P> This March, the Abkhazians once again raised their demand to join the Russian  republic, fueling anxieties about Georgia's future. Thousands heeded the cries  of nationalist intellectuals that Georgia was in danger. A month earlier about  15,000 had marched to mark the anniversary of the loss of Georgian  independence. (When the Communists came to power in Russia, the Georgian Social  Democrats led the country to a short-lived independence that ended with a Red  Army invasion in 1921.) Now in early April, more than 100,000 were filling the  streets and squares of central Tbilisi to call for autonomy or independence.  </P> <P> The great irony, of course, of this new nationalism is that it was fostered by  consolidation under the Soviets and later unleashed by Gorbachev's initiatives.  It now presents the greatest potential threat to his embryonic democracy.  </P></p>

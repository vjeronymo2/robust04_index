Marwan 'Awad, secretary general of the Ministry of Industry  and Commerce, spoke to the radio on the provisions contained in  this protocol, saying:    [Begin 'Awad recording] Today, the first protocol to emerge  from the Egyptian-Jordanian trade exchange agreement was signed.  This is the first protocol to be signed in the aftermath of the  trade agreement signed in 1992, which replaced the old agreement  signed in 1965. According to the protocol signed today, the  Jordanian and Egyptian sides agreed on two lists of commodities,  one concerning Egyptian commodities and another concerning  Jordanian commodities. The products included in these two lists  will be exempted from customs fees and additional direct fees  and taxes, with the exception of domestic taxes and fees and  sales tax. Moreover, the products included in these two lists  will be exempted from non-customs restrictions. The protocol  stipulated that except for the products included in the two  lists, the trade exchange between the two countries will be  subject to all customs fees and taxes and subsequent fees,  regardless of the type of the trade transactions entailed. This  will be in accordance with the legislations in force in both  countries.    The protocol also stipulated that the Jordanian Trade Center  in Egypt and the Egyptian Trade Center in Jordan will each have  a share of trade exchange confined to $7 million to be used for  importing commodities from the other country. Each center will  be permitted to import its quota of products in accordance with  the legislations and rules in force in both countries. Payments  for such transactions will be made in convertible currency.  [end recording]</p>

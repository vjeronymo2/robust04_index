			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'POLITE BANDIT' SENTENCED TO 28 YEARS IN PRISON  </P> <P> A man prosecutors dubbed the "Polite Bandit" because of his courteous manners  while robbing small businesses was sentenced Friday to 28 years and eight  months in prison.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber imposed the sentence on Gary Allen  Smith, 45, of Long Beach in connection with a string of 30 robberies, 18 of  which occurred in the San Fernando Valley during the first four months of this  year.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had asked that Smith be sentenced to 30 years, nine years less than  the maximum, because Smith pleaded guilty before the case went to trial. They  dubbed Smith the "Polite Bandit" because they said his well-mannered demeanor  distinguished him from typical criminals.  </P> <P> But police called Smith the "Bungler" because he was a robber who bungled,  according to a probation report. Smith once overlooked $3,000 that a clerk had  thrown into a garbage can during the robbery, the report said.  </P> <P> Smith was arrested in April at a drug treatment center in Tarzana when his  mother turned him in after her car was traced to several of the robberies,  according to the report.  </P> <P> Smith told probation officers that he was trying to kick his heroin addiction  at the time of the arrest.  </P> <P> "When you're sick with dope . . . you really do some stupid things," Smith said  in a statement contained in the probation report. "I was trying to detox when I  was caught."  </P> <P> But probation officers recommended a long prison term because they noted that  Smith has a record of drug and other violations dating back more than 20 years.  </P></p>

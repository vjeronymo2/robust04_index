			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LAKER WIN IN GAME 1 HURTS SO GOOD, 113-102;  </P> <P> WORTHY HAS 28 IN GAME 1 VICTORY OVER SUPERSONICS  </P> <P> It is not as if the Lakers are into pain. They do not particularly enjoy  trading bumps and bruises with the Seattle SuperSonics, but they felt compelled  to do it to win.  </P> <P> Sunday afternoon, in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals, the Lakers  absorbed and administered their share of punishment before overcoming the  SuperSonics, 113-102, in a physically demanding game not seen in the Forum  since they took away the ice surface.  </P> <P> But the Lakers, willing to adapt their style, expected such Sonic blasts.  Rather than retreat, the Lakers showed a physical side that usually remains  dormant until the Detroit Pistons come to town.  </P> <P> "You have to beat them at their own game," Laker forward James Worthy, who had  28 points and 12 rebounds, said of the SuperSonics. "That means you have to  push and shove and dive for loose balls and go for every rebound. Mentally and  physically, you have to have that effort.  </P> <P> "We're not known for it. But when we have to adjust, we can."  </P> <P> After cruising through a first-round playoff sweep of Portland in which they  were hardly touched, the Lakers needed more than a half to adjust before taking  control with an impressive show of force and defense.  </P> <P> That was not exactly an unexpected development to Laker Coach Pat Riley, who  talked so much about the physical aspect of the series that he might as well  have used a blocking sled in practice.  </P> <P> "They are one of the most aggressive teams in the league," Riley said. "They  fight and compete for everything. Each team has got a personality. Theirs is  being aggressive. They try to control you with aggressive play, and you've got  to make the adjustment.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of frustrating that develops when you play tough, physical  teams. You can't let their tactics get to you."  </P> <P> As late as two minutes into the fourth quarter, the Lakers still trailed the  SuperSonics and seemed to be wilting in the face of those strong-armed tactics.  </P> <P> But then came a 24-9 Laker run over a 9:10 span that gave them a 110-96 lead  and enabled the gathering of 17,505 to head for the parking lot before the  final buzzer.  </P> <P> During that Laker run, made possible by Seattle's six turnovers and two missed  shots and a blocked layup by Michael Cooper, the SuperSonics were held without  a basket for nearly seven minutes. By the time Xavier McDaniel scored inside,  only 55 seconds remained and the Lakers had a lead in double figures.  </P> <P> While the Lakers credited their trapping defense and aggressiveness for their  fourth-quarter surge, the SuperSonics said it was a self-inflicted loss.  </P> <P> "We didn't lose this game because of missed shots," McDaniel said. "We lost  because of turnovers. We need to attack their press better."  </P> <P> For much of the second quarter and even into the second half, the SuperSonics  were successfully attacking the Lakers. Seattle led at halftime, 54-52, and  after three quarters, 81-80, at which point they also had a distinct rebounding  advantage.  </P> <P> Eventually, though, the Lakers became the aggressors. Although the SuperSonics  shot better than the Lakers (52.6% to 46.9%), the Lakers took advantage of the  byproduct of Seattle's physical play by dominating at the free-throw line.  </P> <P> The Lakers made 37 of 46 free throws. Seattle made 18 of 25. Known for their  tendency to foul, the SuperSonics did not quibble much about the disparity.  </P> <P> "We'll just have to try and play through that," McDaniel said of the 31  personal fouls called on his team.  </P> <P> But that, basically, is how the Lakers hope to handle Seattle's unceasing  pressure. They want to attack rather than retreat, trying to draw fouls.  </P> <P> Those objectives were achieved, but not without difficulty.  </P> <P> Worthy made nine-of-20 shots and made 10-of-11 free throws for a game-high 28  points. He also had 12 rebounds, five on the offense. Magic Johnson scored 11  of his 21 points at the free-throw line and also had 14 of the Lakers' 28  assists. And A.C. Green added 10 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> The Laker defense, meanwhile, contained McDaniel and Dale Ellis, the  SuperSonics' main scorers. Ellis, who averaged 28 points against the Lakers  this season, was limited to 19 points. McDaniel, who had averaged 30 points in  the final 10 regular-season games, attempted only 11 shots and finished with 15  points.  </P> <P> Although he is a forward, Worthy began the game guarding Ellis, and Green, a  power forward, guarded small forward McDaniel. In the second half, though,  Laker guard Byron Scott switched to Ellis and held him to seven points.  </P> <P> "We did a good job on (Ellis)," Scott said. "Any time you can hold him to that  (19 points), it's a good job. My objective is to just not let him get an open  shot. Contest everything."  </P> <P> Added Worthy: "You have to max out on Ellis. It's not an individual thing. It's  a team defensive effort. He is awesome, explosive at times."  </P> <P> But the first indication that the SuperSonics might be fading came midway  through the third quarter after Ellis made a three-point shot for a 67-65 lead.  </P> <P> Seattle's next six possessions resulted in five turnovers. The Lakers didn't  take full advantage, however. They scored six points, taking a four-point lead  that they lost by the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> But when the SuperSonics lapsed into a series of turnovers and ill-advised  shots again in the fourth quarter, the Lakers pounced.  </P> <P> The decisive rally began when Johnson made a long jump shot to avoid a  24-second clock violation. It continued through four free throws and hit stride  when Worthy took a pass from Johnson and drove through the congested lane for a  layup that made it, 94-89, Lakers.  </P> <P> At that point, however, Seattle still was within striking distance. Guard  Sedale Threatt tried to end the scoring drought by driving through the lane for  what appeared to be an easy layup. But Cooper swooped in and blocked Threatt's  attempt. Johnson retrieved the ball and scored on a fast-break layup.  </P> <P> That gave the Lakers a seven-point lead. Boosted by two successful skyhooks  from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (16 points) and a basket off an offensive rebound by  Mychal Thompson (16 points), the Lakers then put it away.  </P> <P> Game 1, that is. Not the best-of-seven series.  </P> <P> The SuperSonics, coming off a first-round playoff victory over the Houston  Rockets, entered the game with fewer than one day of preparation and little  rest. The Lakers, on the other hand, had three days of practice before Game 1.  </P> <P> Compounding their problem, the SuperSonics said they were awakened by fire  alarms at their hotel at 3 a.m. and again at 4 a.m. Sunday morning.  </P> <P> It was not exactly Coach Bernie Bickerstaff's idea of proper pregame  preparation. So, under the circumstances, Bickerstaff said he was pleased by  his team's play.  </P> <P> "I think it could be a good, interesting series," said Bickerstaff, smiling.  "We proved we can be competitive.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what to expect, but I was not surprised by the way we played  today."  </P> <P> Neither were the Lakers.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> As planned, the SuperSonics flew back to Seattle Sunday night. They will  practice Monday and Tuesday in Seattle and return to Los Angeles Tuesday night.  . . . The Lakers have won their last nine playoff games against the  SuperSonics, dating back to the first game of the 1980 Western Conference  finals. . . . With 16 points Sunday, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has scored in double  figures in all four Laker playoff games.  </P> <P> Laker Coach Pat Riley said his only gripe about his team Sunday was a  second-quarter lapse during which the SuperSonics made a 14-8 run for a 54-52  halftime lead. "In the second quarter, our defense really broke down, and our  offense flattened out," Riley said. "But being down two points at halftime may  have been a blessing in disguise. We felt a little pressure." . . . Agent Larry  Fleisher, 58, died Thursday in New York. Fleisher represented Laker players  A.C. Green and Orlando Woolridge. Green, who will be a restricted free agent  after this season, had been negotiating with Laker management on a contract  extension. That apparently is put on hold until Green hires another agent.  </P></p>

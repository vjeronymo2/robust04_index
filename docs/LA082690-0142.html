			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CRAMPS BEAT CONNORS, WHO WON'T PLAY OPEN  </P> <P> Jimmy Connors had to default, but the real loser was the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Connors showed flashes of his old form Saturday in the $350,000 WCT Tournament  of Champions at New York, winning the first set from Ivan Lendl, 6-3, before  losing the second, 7-5, and then being forced to retire by cramps early in the  third set of a rain-delayed quarterfinal match.  </P> <P> Afterward, Connors said he will not play in his 21st consecutive Open this  week.  </P> <P> "I think it would better for me not to play the Open due to the fact that I  don't think I can go out there and play the kind of tennis necessary to give it  an all-out effort," said Connors, a five-time Open champion whose streak will  end second only to the 24 in a row played by Vic Seixas. From 1974 through  1985, Connors reached the semifinals 12 consecutive times.  </P> <P> He has won a men's record 107 matches.  </P> <P> Later in the day, Lendl and Aaron Krickstein advanced to today's title match.  Lendl defeated Leconte, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1, and Krickstein beat Emilio Sanchez  of Spain, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, the No. 1 player in the world, moved into the final of a  $250,000 tournament at Commack, N.Y., by winning two matches. First, he  completed a rain-delayed, 6-4, 6-2 victory over fellow Swede Jonas Svensson.  </P> <P> Then, he defeated John McEnroe, 6-1, 6-4.  </P> <P> Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia beat fourth-seeded Pete Sampras, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3,  and Guy Forget of France, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, to advance to the final.  </P> <P> Ramish Krishnan of India upset top-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina, 1-6, 6-3,  7-5, to advance to the final of a $225,000 tournament at Schenectady, N.Y.  </P> <P> He'll meet Kelly Evernden in today's championship match. Evernden advanced by  beating Brad Pearce, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.  </P> <P> In the women's semifinals, Anke Huber of West Germany defeated Wiltrud Probst,  also of West Germany, 6-2, 6-0, and Marianne Werdel defeated Mercedes Paz of  Argentina, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.  </P></p>

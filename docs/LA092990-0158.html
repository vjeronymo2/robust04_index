			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> PLUNGING NIKKEI SIGNALS SHIFT TO CASH ECONOMY  </P> <P> By custom, it should have been a great week for the Tokyo stock market.  </P> <P> Friday was the halfway point in the Japanese fiscal year, the day corporations  must use to value their stock holdings. For weeks, brokers had been boasting  about how prices would climb as their sales forces, in an effort to please  their corporate clients, drummed up new buyers and pushed up share prices.  </P> <P> This practice of ramping up prices to serve corporate interests is so common at  this time of year that one Daiwa Securities trader bravely predicted last week  that the Nikkei 225-stock index would climb more than 10% to 26,000 in the  final week of September.  </P> <P> No such luck. Even an army of brokers couldn't turn the tide. Instead, pummeled  by high interest rates, soaring oil prices and weakening land prices, the  Nikkei fell 2,794 for the week, crashing through the 21,000 mark seen by many  as an important support level to close Friday at 20,983.50.  </P> <P> Rumors of war in Iraq temporarily brought the market down even more sharply on  Friday before institutional investors came in to stage a minor rally.  </P> <P> With the market already down 46% from its high of 38,915 late last year, few  expect to see another crash. But analysts say another 20% drop during the  coming months is not inconceivable.  </P> <P> The price drop represents not merely an adjustment in what had been an inflated  market but a major structural change in Japan's financial markets, many  observers said.  </P> <P> "Since World War II, stock market declines of 40% have only happened four  times. Each time represented a period of structural change," said a senior  executive of one major Japanese brokerage who asked not to be named.  </P> <P> The latest drop brought an end to a four-year period in which the entire  economy focused on the value of assets rather than on income, he said. In words  that have become a cliche in Japan, he called the latest structural change a  switch from focusing on "stock" to looking at "flow," meaning cash flow.  </P> <P> Driven by a sharp appreciation of the yen at the end of 1985 and the drop in  oil prices, interest rates fell. That, in turn, fueled speculation in land.  </P> <P> Stock prices also shot up, with investors focusing not so much on earnings as  on a company's "hidden assets" -- usually premium land not reflected on the  company's balance sheet.  </P> <P> With a focus on assets rather than earnings, stock prices rapidly outpaced  economic and earnings growth.  </P> <P> In 1980, the total value of the roughly 1,300 Japanese stocks traded in the  first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange was about one-third of the nation's total  economic output, or gross national product. By 1989, the stocks were worth  $4.44 trillion, 1 1/2 times the nation's total GNP. The ratio paralleled that  seen on Wall Street before the 1929 crash. Price-to-earnings ratios reached 60,  four times U.S. levels.  </P> <P> This inflation in asset prices allowed Japanese corporations and individuals to  borrow huge sums which they then reinvested, again driving up prices and  leaving the country awash in cash.  </P> <P> All that has changed. The forces that were driving stocks in an upward spiral  until last year have been turned on their heads. Now those forces are pushing  prices into a downward spiral.  </P> <P> High interest rates have made it more costly for investors to hold land and  stocks that produce little income.  </P> <P> Banks are being forced to cut their lending as their capital base, made up  largely of land and stocks, has shrunk in value. Some analysts worry that a  credit crunch could eventually force some borrowers into bankruptcy.  </P> <P> "If you see the bankruptcy of some large-sized companies, it could even trigger  a panic," said Josen Takahashi, chief researcher at Mitsubishi Research  Institute.  </P> <P> "If property prices come down too fast, it could bring the whole system down,"  said Taek Chong, general manager of Schroder Securities Ltd.'s Tokyo office.  </P> <P> Even the best-case scenario sees a sluggish market during the next six months.  </P> <P> High-priced oil, meanwhile, is driving up interest rates and cutting into  corporate earnings. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, higher oil prices have  cost corporate Japan $29 billion beyond its normal oil bill, according to  financial analyst Akimoto Kogiso.  </P> <P> With long-term bonds in Japan yielding 8.2%, money is leaving stocks and going  into bonds.  </P> <P> At current interest rates, the Nikkei index would have to fall to about 18,000  before stocks would be attractive again, one analyst said.  </P> <P> At that point, shares would sell for about 25 times earnings. They would still  get a 100% premium compared to U.S. stocks, but Tokyo analysts say that is  justified by the competitiveness of Japan's firms and the strength of its  economy relative to the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> The optimists aren't giving in. Since the U.S. Federal Reserve Board eventually  will be forced to ease U.S. interest rates to revive the economy, they have  argued, the differential between U.S. and Japanese interest rates will  eventually disappear. That will draw money back into Japan, driving interest  rates down. Once Japanese long-term bonds again yield about 6.5%, Tokyo stocks  will take on a new shine.  </P> <P> But even the greatest optimists admit that could take a long time. And for all  the talk about patient investing, Japanese investors don't appear ready to wait  it out.  </P></p>

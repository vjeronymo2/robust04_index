			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: ICI finds the right chemistry - Bottom Line Ronnie Hampel, Imperial Chemical Industries' cheery chief executive, had rather more spring in his step than usual on Thursday. After four years of upheaval involving a threatened takeover bid, rationalisation and restructuring, and the largest demerger in UK corporate history, Hampel could argue ICI was back on course. Pre-tax profits were up 40 per cent. Hampel was actually rather surprised by the results. 'If you'd asked me if 40 per cent was achievable even three months ago I would have said no,' he confessed. He said he had been surprised by the strong sales growth and the speed rationalisation had saved the group money. The spectacular sales growth in the second quarter had caught him on the hop, he admitted. The increase showed 'the first tangible signs of a widespread recovery in our worldwide markets. This is an increasingly robust performance from all our businesses,' he said. Group turnover was up an impressive 9 per cent. Continental European sales increased 10 per cent, compared with a flat first quarter, while UK sales rose 13 per cent. The sales recovery should help ICI's profits. The company is highly geared. Once it has covered its high fixed costs, any additional revenue should quickly drop to the bottom-line. But Hampel was cautious. Some trends were sustainable, he admitted. Prices of PVC and methanol were rising and there were clear signs of recovery around the globe. 'There's been an upturn, but not as strong as might be deduced from our figures,' he stressed. There were plenty of one-off events, he explained. The UK fertilisers business, long a drain on ICI's profits, was breaking even thanks to a collapse in Russian exports. That was unlikely to continue, he said. Sales on the Continent had risen so fast, not because of a marked upturn, but because US companies had been exporting less, allowing ICI to gain market share. Some customers had been stocking up to avoid price increases. And much of the group's sales growth was thanks to increased capacity in its core areas. 'The present rate of growth is clearly unsustainable,' he concluded. In addition, the cost-cutting programme, which contributed about half of the 40 per cent rise of profits, is beginning to run out of steam. Hampel estimated that the programme had saved more than Pounds 210m during the first half, and that the savings target of Pounds 490m next year was within reach, he said. Indeed, cost-cutting had been achieved faster than expected, said Hampel. This might well have been the consequence of the demerger which had allowed managers to focus more clearly. ICI was now looking a far tighter ship. The group would continue to look for savings, said Hampel. But analysts wonder how much more can go. Earnings growth will increasingly have to be driven by the recovery and additional investments. The company is betting on areas where it believes it has a technological edge, such as CFC-substitutes and PET and PTA, materials for plastic bottles and polyester. It is also betting on Asia-Pacific where last year, for the first time ever, the group invested more than in the UK. Meanwhile, the group continues to move away from commodity petrochemicals. Hampel repeated his view that ICI would never again build an ethylene plant, and would consider offers for a stake of the Teesside plant, Europe's largest ethylene plant, and fourth most efficient. The group was still looking at the possibility of selling the joint-venture PVC business. ICI's strategy looks sound. Its focus since the demerger is undoubtedly tighter. The outlook seems good. The problem for investors is that ICI's shares have outperformed the London stock market by 13 per cent since the beginning of the year. Those holding the shares should hang on. Those without have, for moment, missed the boat.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Young advice The Tories love gossip as much as anyone. But a topic cropping up rather more than most at Blackpool is whether John Major may be about to ring the changes in the ranks of his leading advisers. One thought is that David Cameron, the home office special adviser who will be 27 this Saturday, might be in line to replace the somewhat older Gus O'Donnell, 41, in the press secretary's hot seat. The helpfully courteous O'Donnell, a successful economist, has long made it clear he does not see his current job as the pinnacle of his career. He could well return to the Treasury - also a previous home of Cameron - for the right job. Cameron is clearly a survivor; he was one of Norman Lamont's special advisers, but Lamont's sacking left Cameron unscathed. He also combines amiability with a cool head and a firm hand - not a bad set of attributes for tough times ahead.</p>

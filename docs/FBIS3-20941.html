Juergen Schrempp, the  chairman of the board of the German Aerospace Company (DASA) in  Munich leaves no doubt that further cuts in the military  procurement budget will seriously jeopardize the existence of  the defense technology industry in the aerospace branch and once  again place thousands of jobs at risk.    He said that DASA defense technology operations have already  been cut back about 60 percent since 1990 and the workforce has  been reduced from 16,000 to 9,000. Now many business sectors are  already facing a "subcritical size." "After a certain point we  can no longer maintain development and production capacities,"  Schrempp said. In some business sectors this point will be  reached if the Defense Ministry actually cuts back the  procurement budget, as planned, for 1994 from about DM8 billion  this year to only DM5.1 billion. Since 1990 this budget has  already been cut back 60 percent from DM18 billion.    But not only is it raining in on the defense technology  division of the Daimler-Benz Company subsidiary in Stuttgart;  the weak aircraft market and Bonn's policy of support for civil  aircraft is making it hard for the aviation division to manage.  Schrempp reported that an agreement concluded by the government  with the United States two years ago enables the aviation  division to continue to obtain indirect support through  government contracts, but it reduces the direct support for  development of from 80 to 90 percent of development costs that  used to be customary in Germany by two-thirds. Indirect aid to  compensate for this loss is not available here at all. Moreover,  the existing already small appropriation in the budget for  aviation of DM60 million for new projects has recently been cut  back to DM16 million for 1994. "And this," Schrempp said, "after  CDU [Christian Democratic Union], CSU [Christian Social Union],  and SPD [Socialist Party of Germany] politicians had shortly  before admitted that there had been omissions as far as the  aerospace industry is concerned and promised to provide  political aid for it."    Schrempp stressed the fact that the six plant closures  announced in October and the reduction of personnel by a total  of 16,000 to 70,000 is the minimum that is necessary under the  present circumstances. He admitted that they should actually  have begun to settle the matter of the all in all 52 plants (in  connection with the merger with MBB [Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm  Company]) sooner. Another two plants, among them the one in  Dresden with 600 employees, are seriously endangered. As  additionally, reported, the personnel measures planned up to now  alone will cost DASA about DM800 million for social contribution  plans and compensation in 1993.    The consequence of the unpleasant basic conditions will not  be that DASA no longer operates in the field of aerospace,  Schrempp said, "but we don't know whether we'll still be  operating in Germany." Even now many operations are only  possible in connection with joint ventures--most of them with  the French Aerospatiale. The following joint ventures and  eliminations are planned:        -  The whole guided missile division will be moved to the  joint subsidiary, Euromissile (with Aerospatiale) with its main  office in Frankfurt.    -  The satellite division, which accounts for about 50 percent  of  DASA's space operations (2,000 employees), is to be brought into  a joint venture (Eurosatellite) with Aerospatiale, probably with  a German main office.    -  There is also talk of German-French cooperation on military  satellites.    -  The 18-seat Dornier 228 propellor aircraft is being  discontinued and is to be built only in China under license.    -  The new 30-seat Dornier 328 will in the long run also be  brought into a European joint venture.    -  DASA subsidiary MTU [Motor and Turbine Union, Inc.] in  Friedrichshafen (diesel engines) is to be transferred to AEG  [General Power Company].    -  DASA is withdrawing to a minority holding in microelectronics  subsidiary Temic [Telefunken Microelectronics] (50 percent held  by DASA and 50 percent by AEG).</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / How to Spend It: The art of being a crafty shopper - Lucia van der Post picks some exceptionally fine presents from some of Britain's best young craftsmen and women THOSE WITH a taste for fine craftsmanship are spoilt for choice. At Liberty in Regent Street, London, there is a wonderful selection of furniture, paintings and objects from the Arts and Crafts period; in Bath a contemporary arts and crafts fair opens today and, at London's Goldsmiths' Hall, a display of work by some of Britain's best goldsmiths and silversmiths opens on Wednesday. Do not be discouraged from going to any of these simply because your price bracket is more Marks &amp; Spencer than Fortnums - much of the pleasure offered by these exhibitions is the chance to wander around and look at exceptional work. Even those in the mood to spend nothing should find much to delight the eye. At Liberty the arts and crafts exhibition is now an established annual event  -the 19th in a row where furniture, metalwork, glass, ceramics and jewellery from the period are not just on show but also for sale. Although the Arts and Crafts Movement spanned roughly the years 1870 to 1890 for this year's exhibition Liberty has some particularly fine pieces from the height of the movement, around the turn of the century, with pieces from Arthur Liberty himself, JS Henry, Heals and the Cotswold school. There will be desks and tables, fireplaces and a set of four Liberty chairs taken from a CFA Voysey design, as well as a group of pre-Raphaelite paintings, including an Edward Burne-Jones. Arts and Crafts furniture, it has to be said, is not to everybody's taste but for those who want to be know more about it - and perhaps gauge whether it is or is not - this is a perfect opportunity. What almost everybody can relate to instantly is the jewellery of the period. Tania Hunter, of Cobra &amp; Bellamy, who used to deal in jewellery of this period, has been putting a collection together for some years. The result can be seen and bought at the Cobra &amp; Bellamy counter at Liberty as well as the shop at 149 Sloane Street, London SW1. As you can see from the photographs here, the pieces are almost without exception exceedingly beautiful, finely made and highly desirable. Today these pieces, sadly for would-be buyers, fetch high prices - at the time the designers' use of relatively inexpensive materials such as horn and glass, silver and Bakelite, and the deeply held belief that artistic merit was more important than the inherent value of the materials used, was revolutionary in the jewel world. Most items are collectors' pieces so they are not cheap. Two of the finest, the CR Ashbee silver and gold brooch, enamelled and set with pearls and an amethyst, and the Archibald Knox platinum, diamond and moonstone pendant, cost Pounds 5,950 each. There are a few smaller things for sale, such as a small silver brooch at Pounds 200, a couple of pendants at Pounds 350 and a carved jade pendant at Pounds 500. At The Goldsmiths' Hall there is dazzling confirmation that when it comes to jewellery, silver or gold, from earrings to goblets, ceremonial platters and tiaras, domestic cutlery, or anything from clocks to rings, the current crop of British designers are hard to beat. No wonder the Middle Eastern palaces, the Japanese board-rooms and the world's posh private houses are filled with the work of bright British jewellers and goldsmiths. The work of between 50 and 60 designers will be there for all to see. Although none of it carries price-tags most of the designers will be at the exhibition and anyone longing for a particular piece will usually be able to come to some arrangement. Even if the particular piece on show is not for sale something very similar can always be commissioned. Anyone who has a special anniversary coming up, a birthday, a retirement party, a christening or a wedding, will find it a fruitful scouting ground. It is encouraging to see that several of the independent retailers, having noted and reacted against the growing influence of the multiples, now see more exciting and better design as a useful tool in the battle for customers. Even retailers that were once renowned for grandiose candelabra and 'repro' candlesticks now have corners or counters devoted to more exciting modern work. Some of the stores worth noting are: Garrards of Regent Street, London W1; Asprey of 165 New Bond Street, London W1; Boodle &amp; Dunthorne of 58 Brompton Road, London SW3, 52 Eastgate Street, Chester, Lord Street, Liverpool and King Street, Manchester; David Robinson of Church Alley, Liverpool, St Michael's Row, Chester, St Anne's Square, Manchester, Lord Street, Stockport and Makinson Arcade, Wigan; David Thomaas, of 65 Pimlico Rd, London SW1 and Hancocks of Manchester. In Bath there is yet more contemporary work - this time in the field of ceramics, glass, wood, furniture, jewellery, knitwear, fashion accessories and the like - to be looked at, admired and possibly bought. Based very much on the format of the now well-established Chelsea craft fair, the organisers have gathered some 100 different craftspeople and anything from candles to bracelets, from handbags to pottery can be seen. Prices vary enormously - most of the work is aimed at everyday usage and is not as precious and fine as that at the Goldsmiths - from a few pounds to several hundred. Again, it is a marvellous chance to do some present buying, to replenish some of the things you might need for your own house and to catch up on the work that more than 100 exhibitors are up to. Bear in mind that it is not just jewellers and silversmiths that like to make works to commission. Most of the craftspeople at Bath love nothing more than the chance to produce a one-off design - whether it be to knit up a sweater in a special colour or pattern, do a range of pottery to match an existing set, paint some furniture to fit into a given room or produce a piece of fine jewellery or silver. Anyone whose work you like can be negotiated with. The Arts and Crafts exhibition at Liberty, Regent Street, London W1. is on until June 13. The Contemporary Designer arts and crafts fair is on at the Bath Arts, Crafts and Design Centre in St Andrews Terrace, Bath, from today until Tuesday. British Goldsmiths of Today at Goldsmiths' Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V, will run from Wednesday until June 26.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA;  </P> <P> SURGEONS OPTIMISTIC ON TRIPLE TRANSPLANT  </P> <P> A day after she became the first transplant patient to receive a heart, liver  and kidney, physicians attending Cindy Martin at Presbyterian-University  Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pa., said she may be able to go home in three to four  weeks. Martin, 26, was in critical condition under intensive care after the 21  1/2-hour operation. Dr. John Armitage, who performed the heart transplant  surgery, said: "Right now, her organ function looks encouraging. She's awake  and writing us notes." The doctors said they planned to begin weaning her from  a respirator, and that post-surgical infection would pose the greatest risk to  her recovery. Although multiple-organ transplants have been done before, this  was the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, Armitage said.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Small firms targeted by new BT rival Energis, the UK's third long-distance telecommunications network, will target small and medium-sized businesses when it launches later this month, promising to undercut British Telecommunication's prices and provide a new range of services. The company, a subsidiary of National Grid, has built a network of 3,500 km using the grid's pylons. It claims its network is more modern, and its overheads far lower, than those of the two existing long-distance operators  -BT and Mercury. The launch of Energis will greatly intensify competition in UK telecommunications, particularly at the lower end of the business market where Mercury has made far less headway against BT than in the large corporate sector. Users with as few as four lines will be approached by the Energis sales force. Energis intends to guarantee a saving of 10 per cent over BT prices - including volume discounts - to all users. Mercury also trades on lower prices than BT's, but its differential in parts of the business market is well below 10 per cent. Energis has signed a preferred supplier agreement with Colt, a US-owned telecoms operator building a network in central London, which will give it access to large businesses in the City. Colt, which already connects 170 City sites, will use Energis for most of its long-distance traffic, while Energis will use Colt for its City traffic. Energis will offer customers an innovative 'telecoms management' service, giving them a month-by-month breakdown of calls made to their premises, including the proportion of calls unanswered and the average time before calls are answered, broken down into periods of the day. It says that no such service is available in the UK, and believes it will prove popular with organisations keen to track their efficiency in dealing with telephone queries. Mr David Dey, Energis chief executive and formerly a senior BT executive, said: 'Obviously we have to trade on price, but we will also be offering a range of new services.' In the residential sector Energis will focus on users with quarterly bills of more than Pounds 100, offering subscribers a 'smart socket' enabling them to use the Energis network without changing their phone or dialling a prefix. Subscribers will pay an annual fee of Pounds 12. Mr Dey said BT, which has an 85 per cent share of the UK telecoms market, was Energis's main target. But it would also be competing strongly with Mercury.</p>

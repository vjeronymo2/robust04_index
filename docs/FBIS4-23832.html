			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It has been an exciting few days for Nigerian  politician Moshood Abiola. He was the presumed winner of last  June's aborted presidential election, and on Monday [as heard],  after escaping from house arrest, he defied General Abacha's  military government by publicly declaring himself president of  Nigeria, then went into hiding. But apparently Moshood Abiola  has now fallen ill. Jeremy Skeet called his home in Lagos and  talked to his wife, Kudirat Abiola, and asked how her husband  was.    [Begin recording] [Kudirat Abiola] You know, before the  inauguration, my husband had been ill. He was even  hospitalized, and as soon as he got out of the hospital, he  decided to proclaim his mandate. On the day of the  proclamation, he was down with heavy cold, and since then he has  been very cold and shivery.    [Skeet] Is he bedridden at the moment?    [Kudirat Abiola] Yes, he is in bed.    [Skeet] Are you in contact with your husband?    [Kudirat Abiola] I am in contact with him.    [Skeet] How do you contact your husband?    [Kudirat Abiola] I do call him over the phone.    [Skeet] Where is he at the moment?    [Kudirat Abiola] He is in Lagos.    [Skeet] But where, exactly?    [Kudirat Abiola] No, I want to keep that to myself for now.    [Skeet] And you say he is ill, but what is his spirit like  otherwise?    [Kudirat Abiola] His spirit is very high, except that he is  tired.    [Skeet] Now, a lot of his supporters want him to appear in  public. When do you think he is going to be better and appear  in public?    [Kudirat Abiola] Well, maybe before this week comes to an  end or early next week.    [Skeet] Is that a guarantee? By the end of next week, are  we going to see Chief Abiola in public?    [Kudirat Abiola] Of course, yes.    [Skeet] Right, because a lot of his critics say that he is a  coward and you are just using this excuse of his illness....    [Kudirat Abiola, interrupting] That is not true! He is not.  My husband is not a coward. He is on the right path. Why  should he run from anybody? If Gen. Sani Abacha who usurped his  power, if that one can be moving freely in Nigeria, what stops  my husband? He is never a coward, and he will never be one.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> ARGENTINA WILL BE MISSING FOUR STARTERS;  </P> <P> TITLE GAME: PENALTIES WILL KEEP CANIGGIA, THREE OTHERS OUT OF THE REMATCH  AGAINST WEST GERMANY.  </P> <P> Argentina will meet West Germany for the World Cup title Sunday without four  starters, including striker Claudio Caniggia, whose goals helped get the team  to the championship game.  </P> <P> Caniggia, who scored Argentina's winning goal in the second round against  Brazil and the tying goal in Tuesday's semifinal victory over Italy, will not  be allowed to play in the championship match because of the yellow card he  received for a deliberate hand ball in the game in Naples.  </P> <P> Also suspended are Argentine midfielders Ricardo Giusti and Julio Olarticoechea  and defender Sergio Batista.  </P> <P> Giusti was tossed out of Tuesday's match for elbowing Italian midfielder  Roberto Baggio in the face. French referee Michel Vautrot's back was turned,  but the foul was spotted by Danish linesman Peter Mikkelsen, who became the  target of extensive verbal abuse from the Argentine players and bench for  pointing it out.  </P> <P> Olarticoechea and Batista each had been cautioned in Argentina's quarterfinal  match against Yugoslavia, and each received another yellow card (and automatic  suspension) on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Just how Argentine Coach Carlos Bilardo will replace the four players is not  yet known. "It's a problem," is all Bilardo would say when asked that question  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Without Caniggia, Bilardo has no one with true speed to penetrate the German  defense and to run to the passes sent in by Diego Maradona. Batista is a  veteran of the 1986 championship team, and his experience was needed against  the West Germans, losers to Argentina in the final four years ago.  </P> <P> Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany's coach, said the loss of the four Argentine  players will not necessarily make his team's task any easier.  </P> <P> "Argentina is a very, very good team," he said in Turin Wednesday night after  West Germany's victory over England. "No game is easy. We don't underestimate  Argentina. They have a lot of other players.  </P> <P> "I just hope it will be as good a game on Sunday as it was tonight."  </P> <P> In Rome Wednesday, long faces were a common sight because, in the words of one  cab driver, "the World Cup is finished."  </P> <P> Italy's loss to Argentina had not been expected, and Italian Coach Azeglio  Vicini tried to explain it by saying: "In the long run, we suffered from  fatigue, but also because we always tried to satisfy the crowd."  </P> <P> What Vicini meant was that Italy, instead of playing its usual defensive style  in the World Cup, had tried to be more entertaining and to attack more often.  </P> <P> "Playing at home didn't help the team," he said. "It forced us to use an  attacking tactic."  </P> <P> In Argentina, the defending champion's return to the World Cup title match was  greeted with delight. One newspaper called Italy "just one more morsel on the  way to the great celebration under preparation to take home the World Cup."  </P> <P> Brazil's Jornal da Tarde was more succinct. One headline in the Sao Paolo paper  stated bluntly: "God is an Argentine."  </P></p>

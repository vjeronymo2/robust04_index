			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities put their faith in recovery THERE WAS a strong rebound in share prices in London yesterday as investors chose to put their faith in prospects for economic recovery and to set aside those for further cuts in UK interest rates. Government bonds gave ground after the announcement of a slightly sharper rise than expected in February's Retail price index warned of inflationary pressure and apparently weakened the chances of another base rate cut for the time being. The FT-SE Index rose 20.4 to 2,900.1, recovering an important support level and closing within 16 points of its Budget eve quotation. The investment emphasis swung back towards the cyclical sectors, with building and construction, motors, stores and merchant banking stocks all performing well. Further demand for second line issues took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 21.4 to another all-time high of 3,154.7. Of overall Seaq volume of 824.1m shares, around 63 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks. Sharelink, the Birmingham-based broker which claims a large share of UK private client business, said yesterday that private investors had been strong buyers of equities this week. The big institutions, more concerned with the Budget changes in Advance Corporation Tax and dividends on overseas corporate earnings, remained subdued yesterday. NatWest Securities said yesterday that holders of around 45 per cent of UK equities could be affected by the changes in treatment of payments on overseas earnings. Traders stressed that technical factors distorted the equity sector. Mid-morning brought expiry of the March futures contract on the FT-SE Index, when the big securities houses juggled their holdings between the futures contract and the underlying blue chip securities. At the close, New York was looking wary of repeating its strong overnight performance as it awaited the Triple Witching hour, when a clutch of derivatives contracts expire together. After some initial hesitation, the stock market moved ahead following completion, without undue strain, of the futures and options expiry. News that headline inflation had recorded an annualised increase of 1.8 per cent last month failed to check equities, although the figure was at the high end of analysts' forecasts and undermined hopes that the Budget might also have brought a cut in UK base rates. Government bonds fell by around  5/8 on inflation nerves, with only Index-linked steady. But equity strategists preferred to focus on this week's unemployment, retail sales and industrial output data as evidence of economic growth.</p>

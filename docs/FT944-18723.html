			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Brussels steel plan expected to collapse The European Commission's plan to cut steel output is as good as dead, according to German steelmakers who say it will be impossible to reach agreement now that economic recovery is picking up across Europe. German steel companies have indicated they are prepared to let the plan collapse and wait for the next recession before trying once more to agree on capacity cuts. They are also happy to forego the aid package promised by the European Commission if the capacity cuts are agreed in full. This includes finance for redundancies, protection from cheaper eastern European imports and a quarterly system for monitoring steel output. Any threat to the capacity cuts plan would be a big setback for Brussels, which has spent nearly two years cajoling steelmakers across Europe to cut capacity as Europe dragged itself through its worst post-war recession. The latest development, however, vindicates the fears of some steel industry observers and private sector producers that a short-term rise in demand might be used as an excuse to postpone cuts designed to correct chronic overcapacity. Last week at an EU ministerial meeting Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, strongly criticised the steel industry for asking the commission to devise a rescue plan when times were hard, but abandoning it as soon as prices picked up. 'It is not good practice for the industry to enjoy support when things are bad and then to not reduce capacity when things get better,' he said. He spoke shortly after Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, announced that unless the EU's steel sector had produced the minimum level of cuts in capacity by November 8, the commission would withdraw its support. So far industry has only achieved 11m tonnes of capacity cuts and is unlikely to meet the 19m minimum required under the plan by the beginning of November. 'The same thing happened in 1985 for the first big steel crisis,' said a senior commission official. 'Reductions in capacity then were below what was necessary, and this led to the second steel crisis in 1991.' But in Germany, one industry source said: 'The plan is as good as dead - you can forget about further capacity cuts. Take hot-rolling capacity  - we're working flat out. We need more capacity.' The German Steel Federation said last week that output this year was expected to be 10 per cent higher than last year and that prices were beginning to improve. It said the German steel industry had shed 140,000 jobs over the last five years, costing producers about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), and that it had made all the capacity cuts which could be expected, including last year's closure by Krupp Hoesch of its Rheinhausen plant. Instead the Germans have pointed the finger at subsidised state-owned Italian and Spanish steelmakers for not doing their part. German steelmakers may also argue that capacity cuts make little sense given that the future of Eko Stahl, the ailing steel plant in eastern Germany, is still uncertain. Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel group, and the Bremen-based Hegemann group are leading the race for a stake in Eko Stahl and both have indicated they would invest in a hot-rolling mill which would probably produce about 2m tonnes annually. Last month British Steel said European demand for strip mill products had risen significantly over recent months, and was expected to continue to strengthen. But there was also a shortage of steel, due partly to temporary closures of some European blast furnaces for relining.</p>

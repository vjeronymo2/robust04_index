This transpires from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's  letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef. Our party affairs correspondent  Yaron Deqel obtained a version of the letter, which paved the  way for SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] return to the  government. These are the four points that Rabin promised SHAS:  The Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians and the  Cairo agreement will not be reopened for negotiations; Jerusalem  will remain the united capital of Israel and under complete  Israeli sovereignty. Rabin also promised Rabbi Yosef not to  compromise with the Palestinians on the right of return, except  for cases of family reunification, and that any peace agreement  involving a return of territory will be brought for a public  decision by means of a referendum or elections.    Rafi Edri, who is directing the negotiations with SHAS on  behalf of Labor, submitted the coalition agreement with SHAS as  well as the letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef to the Knesset's table.</p>

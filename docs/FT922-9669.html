			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Delta downgrading considered MOODY'S, one of the largest US rating agencies, said yesterday that it was considering downgrading the debt ratings of Delta Air Lines, one of the three US 'mega-carriers', writes Nikki Tait in New York. Its review was prompted by 'the outlook for continued losses in the intermediate term'. The benefit from last November's acquisition of Pan Am's European routes 'have fallen short of Moody's expectations, and Delta's domestic business has reflected weak conditions in the US'.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Bangemann accuses French of anti-German sentiment MR Martin Bangemann, the most senior German politician in the European Commission, yesterday accused French supporters of the Maastricht treaty of whipping up anti-German sentiment to secure a 'Yes' vote in this month's referendum. Mr Bangemann, the EC commissioner for the internal market, said it was dangerous and irresponsible for French politicians to argue that the Maastricht treaty on economic and political union was the best means to control German power in Europe. 'I hope Maastricht is ratified,' he said, 'but I can only put up with this (talk) for so long.' Mr Bangemann, a strong advocate of European political and economic union, said he was disappointed at the way French politicians were suggesting that a united Germany might revert to its Nazi past, or that it might wish to break out of the constraints of the EC. 'It is a cheek,' he said. Leading French proponents of Maastricht, including Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, Mr Laurent Fabius, chairman of the socialist party, and Mr Michel Rocard, a potential socialist presidential candidate, have all responded to growing opposition to Maastricht by invoking fear of a resurgent Germany. Mr Fabius recently spoke of the danger of German 'demons' being unleashed if the Maastricht treaty is rejected on September 20. German newspapers have begun to register alarm at the revival of the 'ugly German' being raised in support of the treaty which, they point out, was intended to reinforce the post-war partnership between France and Germany within the European Community. Chancellor Kohl plans to take part in a French television debate today to support President Mitterrand against his anti-treaty opponents. Mr Bangemann, without naming the culprits, claimed French politicians were out of touch with the feelings of the French public which saw Germany as a friend. Mr Bangemann said it would be far better for proponents of the treaty to focus on the domination of the German mark and the power of the Bundesbank which, by fulfilling its narrow obligation of maintaining price stability, was doing great harm to the economies of Italy, France and Great Britain. The Maastricht treaty, which sets out a path for a common European currency and a European Central Bank, would strip national institutions such as the Bundesbank of their sovereignty. 'In France, not everybody has understood that European union will do away with the domination of the Bundesbank,' he said. Echoing fears expressed this week by his fellow EC commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist, Mr Bangemann said French rejection would be a catastrophe. It would allow all 12 member states to re-open agreements and roll back progress made on the single integrated market.</p>

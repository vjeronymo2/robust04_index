			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / ICI agrees 14% staged pay rise and cut in hours UNION LEADERS at Imperial Chemical Industries are to recommend a broad set of changes in working practices in return for a staged pay rise of 14 per cent and a 36-hour working week for most employees within 20 months. The rise will be in addition to the annual pay round, on which talks will start shortly. The deal, which will be voted on by ICI's 23,000 manual workers, would be a significant advance for shorter working hours in UK industry. Engineering unions are planning a campaign for a 35-hour working week by the mid-1990s. The ICI deal was reached at the weekend by management and union negotiators after initial proposals were re-jected. The deal could bring about the single biggest change in work at ICI's 50 plants for 22 years. The company improved its original proposals, under which there would have been a 12 per cent pay rise staged over two years and the 36-hour week would not have been implemented until 1995. In return for the agreement, ICI workers will receive a 6 per cent rise as soon as changes in working practices are implemented at their own plants, and a further two 4 per cent increases over the next two years. Unions were pressing for the money to be paid in two parts rather than three, but ICI wants to contain costs because of trading conditions. The company's pre-tax profits fell by Pounds 560m to Pounds 977m in 1990 because of the recession and a restructuring charge. The agreement would allow a 36-hour working week for manual employees by January 1993, or within a year of new working practices being negotiated and introduced at each of ICI's plants. In spite of a decline in the overall level of earnings increases, with more deals falling between 8 per cent and 9 per cent, UK companies, including Lever Brothers, the Unilever subsidiary, have offered extra money for changes in working practices. Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union and lead negotiator for six unions, said the deal would allow ICI considerably greater flexibility in working practices and put it ahead of other chemical companies. A conference of shop stewards in ICI is to be held on Thursday to consider the deal. It would then go to a delegate conference of ICI workers, and finally to a ballot of all ICI workers before local deals are sanctioned. ICI workers are currently on a 37 1/2 -hour week, and the 1 1/2 hour reduction would give them among the shortest standard working hours in industry. A 37-hour week has largely spread across the engineering industry after a strike campaign by unions.</p>

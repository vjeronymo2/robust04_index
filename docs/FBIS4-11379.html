			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Livia Ferrari: "Sales to Mercosur up 37.56 </F> Percent"]    [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Brazil's trade with the Mercosur  (Common Market of the South) countries totaled $8.73 billion in  1993, an increase of 37.56 percent over the $6.35 billion  recorded the year before. Those figures represent the total of  imports and exports combined.    Putting it another way, Brazil exported goods and services  worth a total of $5.4 billion to Argentina, Paraguay, and  Uruguay and imported the equivalent of $3.3 billion from those  countries. This means that Mercosur accounted for 14 percent of  Brazil's total exports and 13 percent of its total imports last  year.    Brazil's trade surplus with Mercosur also rose: to $2.062  billion, or 11.64 percent more than the $1.85 billion recorded  in 1992. The increase was due mainly to the flow of trade with  Paraguay and Uruguay, since Brazil's surplus with Argentina was  down by nearly $300 million to $1.02 billion in 1993. But  Brazil's trade surpluses with Paraguay and Uruguay practically  doubled from one year to the next, as is shown in the statistics  from the Foreign Trade Secretariat (Secex).

Total exports to  Argentina were $3.5 billion. Mechanical and electrical machinery  and equipment--so-called capital goods--were in second place  among Brazilian sales to Argentina at $738 million, an increase  of 41 percent over the year before. According to the experts,  that result shows how competitive Brazilian industry is in that  it increased market shares despite Argentina's elimination of  its import duty on capital goods for third countries [sentence  as published].    The main item exported to Brazil by Argentina in 1993 was  products of plant origin at $828 million. Half of that value  represented products of the milling industry, including wheat.  The second item on the list of Brazilian imports from Argentina  was mineral fuels (petroleum and petroleum products) at a value  of $520 million--a fantastic increase of 374 percent over the  $110 million worth imported in 1992.    The same statistics also reveal that Brazilian sales to  Paraguay rose 76.8 percent in 1993 to a total of $960.6 million.  At the same time, Brazilian imports of Paraguayan products  increased 45.5 percent to $273 million, the biggest item being  textile products (up 41 percent to a total of $161 million).  Brazil's biggest exports to Paraguay are electromechanical  machinery and equipment at $174 million and food, beverage, and  tobacco products at $172.5 million.    Brazilian sales to the Uruguayan market totaled $775 million  (an increase of 50.7 percent), the main item being  transportation equipment ($198 million). Brazil purchased $428.6  million worth of Uruguayan products in 1993 (up 26 percent),  mainly products of plant origin at $152 million.</p>

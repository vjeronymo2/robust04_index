Mr. Anderson told the deputy prime minister that the  Anderson  Construction Corporation's ambition is to become the first  American construction company to take part in infrastructure  projects in Vietnam funded by the World Bank, IMF, and the Asian  Development Bank after the lifting of the trade embargo, which  public opinion holds can happen in the next few days. He said  that Columbia Anderson Corporation is one of the leading  infrastructure construction companies in the United States and  that U.S.-Vietnam cooperation will be deemed a fine beginning  for normalizing relations between the two countries.    Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai welcomed Columbia  Anderson Corporation's enthusiasm to take part in Vietnamese  infrastructure projects and reaffirmed Vietnam's policy of  cooperation with all nations and foreign companies. He said  that many projects for constructing roads, bridges, and ports in  Vietnam will be tendered this year.

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / N-plant workers will be laid off ONE THOUSAND white-collar contract workers engaged by British Nuclear Fuels to help get its Pounds 2.8bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant into commercial operation are being told this week they are to be laid off in a month's time, Chris Tighe writes. BNF, which recruited the specialist contractors, including engineers and planners, earlier this year, had set a December 1992 target to begin Thorp's active commissioning. But the Pollution Inspectorate has yet to issue its draft authorisation. There will then be eight weeks of public consultation, which may result in a public hearing to air the environmental issues raised. 'We can't pay 1,000 people to do nothing indefinitely,' BNF said.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World News in Brief: Pakistan has A-bomb, says former premier Pakistan has the atomic bomb, opposition leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif (left) admitted. The private PPI news agency reported him as confirming the fact at a rally in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. In the past, the country said it had the capability to make nuclear weapons but had decided as a matter of policy not to make them. Some officials said Mr Sharif's statement could be meant to embarrass the government on home and foreign policy fronts.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Departure of a reformer AT THEIR Edinburgh summit, the European Community's heads of government announced 'strong support' for Mr Boris Yeltsin's attempt to bring economic reform to Russia. The Congress of People's Deputies does not share the west's enthusiasm. But that enthusiasm was rhetorical. If the opportunity to bring about comprehensive reform has disappeared, the west bears a substantial part of the blame. Mr Gaidar's loss is a serious, perhaps terminal, blow for Mr Yeltsin's reforms. The new prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, is an apparatchik brought into the government when Mr Yeltsin was trying to broaden support earlier this year. As gas minister under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Chernomyrdin is associated with the failures of the last Soviet regime. Nothing suggests he understands how to transform Russia into a working, let alone a successful, market economy. Nonetheless, this black cloud has a silver lining. Mr Gaidar's dilemma has been how long to remain in a government that was being diverted ever further from reform. The advantage of staying was his influence upon policy. The disadvantage was the way reform was being blamed for its opposite. Printing bushels of money in aid of the old industrial dinosaurs is not reform. It is just another version of the ancien regime. Mr Gaidar's dilemma has been resolved, but not Mr Yeltsin's. He must now decide whether to oppose this government. Instead of being associated with its blunders, he could blame the unpalatable results upon the conservative elements that have foisted it upon him. Any distance he can put between himself and what is likely to become an increasingly unpopular government should also strengthen his campaign for constitutional reform. This would be a risky path for Mr Yeltsin. With luck it will be unnecessary. Maybe Mr Chernomyrdin and his colleagues will recognise - as has Mr Leonid Kuchma in Ukraine - that radical reform is the only alternative. If so, Mr Yeltsin could support the government with a good conscience. Hitherto, Mr Gaidar has been the standard-bearer for reform. If his policies come to be seen as the logical response to circumstances rather than as personal whims, then the legitimacy of reform might itself grow. Nevertheless, Mr Gaidar's departure does mark the end of the first attempt at transformation of the Russian economy. For the inability of Mr Yeltsin to carry through coherent reform, the west bears some responsibility. In Russia's distorted economy, any reform was bound to create a legion of powerful losers. A part of the solution was political reform. The other part was greater foreign assistance. As Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a senior adviser to the government, has argued, the lack of such assistance 'has made Boris Yeltsin's task vastly more arduous and strengthened the hands of the hardliners'. The west has watched Russia's first serious reform government drown. Should the opportunity recur, it must not fail again.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Judge to review Apple copyright decision APPLE Computer's Dollars 5.5bn copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, the US computer companies, took an unexpected turn this week when a federal judge in San Francisco agreed to reconsider his decision to dismiss most of Apple's arguments in the closely watched case. Apple filed suit in 1988, charging that Microsoft's Windows program and HP's NewWave software violated copyrights on the screen displays of Apple's Macintosh personal computers. Last month Judge Vaughn Walker rejected Apple's contention that the overall 'look and feel' of the computer displays should be compared in order to determine whether its copyrights have been infringed. Instead, the judge compared elements of the displays and ruled that most were not original to Apple or were covered by a prior licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. However, the judge has now reluctantly agreed to Apple's request that he review his decision. He said that he was 'inclined to reject the motion for reconsideration out of hand'. Nonetheless, recognising the importance of the case to the entire computer industry, he granted Apple's request. However lawyers for Microsoft and HP said that they were not concerned by the judge's decision. 'This is just a stay of execution,' said one of HP's attorneys.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Press Review SPAIN A general strike forces everyone to stand up and be counted. And so it was with the Spanish press as it reviewed last Thursday's call by the unions to bring the country to a standstill. The day after the strike, the press examined the same glass and judged whether it was half empty or half full. A lot of people stood up and stayed away from work (many because they feared pickets) and a lot of other people went to work (many because they feared blacklists). El Mundo came out on the side of the unions and headlined 'The majority backed the strike'. El Pas did not and it put a laconic 'The strike was not general' across its front page. There were photographs to suit every mood. Spread across five of its six columns, El Pas used a shot of union militants standing on a railway track holding up a commuter train. El Mundo gave similar prominence to a picture of riot police in full gear protecting a shopping precinct. La Vanguardia, the main Barcelona newspaper, highlighted a good example of Catalan consensus. Its front-page photograph had police, wearing everyday uniforms and not a baton or rubber bullet in sight, patiently persuading pickets to move along so that those who wanted to go to work, or wherever, could board the city's metro. La Vanguardia entitled its editorial comment: 'A not very general strike'. The leader writers at El Pas and at La Vanguardia came out solidly in favour of what had triggered the strike in the first place: the government's decision to deregulate the labour market, particularly its rigid hiring and firing rules. In contrast, El Mundo's editorial urged the government to amend its economic policies in order to avert 'a dangerous and widespread sense of frustration and impotence'. UNITED STATES Ever since it castigated Bill Clinton for not sending his daughter to a state school, New York Times editorials have not shown a general predisposition to be kind to the president. Some ascribe this to the newspaper's long-standing liberal principles, others to a particular animus on the part of Mr Howell Raines, the Times's distinguished editorial page chief, who also happens to be a southerner. It was therefore, perhaps, noteworthy that the newspaper's leader column took its time to comment on Mr Clinton's State of the Union message last week. And when it did, 48 hours after the event, it almost skipped over any comprehensive assessment, preferring instead to turn its critical guns on the omnibus crime bill already passed by the Senate. Just about all it could say in his favour was that 'with a combination of smart legislating and public education, Mr Clinton can make it hard for the Republicans to reassert their claim on the crime-prevention franchise'. Another newspaper whose editorials, for different ideological reasons, do not like the president much, the right-wing Wall Street Journal, was horrified by his 'diktat' on healthcare, threatening to veto any bill that does not include universal insurance coverage ('If anything like the Clinton plan ever passes, don't get sick'). But - in its own typically quirky, semi-sarcastic way - it confessed to being 'impressed' by the president's holistic approach. 'What the Clinton strategy does have going for it is Bill Clinton. As the State of the Union rhetoric made clear, this is a new kind of presidency. Mr Clinton does not merely appeal to the electorate, he tries to envelope it . . . we have, it seems, entered the age of the co-dependency president.' The phenomenon clearly worries the Journal, if only because of the off-chance that it might work. Other comment ranged all over the journalistic lot. The Washington Post commended a 'strong speech', the San Francisco Examiner found it 'oddly passionless', though the San Diego Union-Tribune thought it 'highly emotional', the Baltimore Sun rated the president 'more experienced, more confident', the St Louis Post-Dispatch 'lacking in initiative', while the Los Angeles Times complimented 'a doubly daring venture' that was 'far more than rhetoric'. AUSTRALIA The comings and goings of top personalities have dominated the Australian papers all week. For Alan Griffiths, the nation's upwardly mobile industry minister, it was a question of going. The Melbourne Age revealed at the weekend that his partner in a sandwich shop venture was alleging that party funds had been used in the ailing business, and although denying any impropriety, Mr Griffiths resigned. The irony of having a promising ministerial career unpicked by a sandwich shop in Melbourne's Moonee Ponds suburb - 'best known to most Australians as the home of Dame Edna Everage' - did not escape the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It looks bad when the minister in charge of industry development in Australia cannot profitably run a sandwich shop,' it commented. Next day, under the headline 'A legend in its own lunchtime' the Herald profiled the eatery, explaining why gleeful competitors reckoned chicken and avocado sandwiches at ADollars 2.70 (Pounds 1.20) were a non-runner. But it was the arrival of Prince Charles, and the subsequent Australia Day lunge by David Kang, an anthropology student, which commanded most attention. The Australian press, not overfussed by the royal visit at the outset, cleared its front pages on Wednesday - although The Australian still gave more prominence to the prince's conciliatory remarks on the republic issue than it did to the Kang incident. But much-applauded royal sang-froid didn't seem to win votes. By the weekend The Sun-Herald was citing a mid-week poll of 600 people in Sydney and Melbourne which showed that public support to retain the monarchy had dropped to around 41 per cent, from a previous high of 52 per cent. 'Republic Rockets', it declaimed, adding - in letters one-fifth the size - 'but tour boosts Prince Charles'. BRAZIL The defeat inflicted on Brazil's finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, last week, when Congress failed to pass his proposed corporate tax increase, gave the media a chance to mull over the outlook for October's presidential elections. Mr Cardoso's troubles stemmed from the lack of a quorum in Congress. He criticised the congressional habit of taking long weekends away from the capital Braslia. But the press wondered if his enemies had used the episode to damage Mr Cardoso's electoral chances. Gazeta Mercantil, the main business newspaper, talked of an accord between the centre-right parties to delay Mr Cardoso's economic restructuring plan, seen as the first step to his candidature. The paper said the plan still looked likely to go ahead, but the minister was running out of time. The election front-runner, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party, went campaigning in Amazonia and was pictured planting trees and wearing a tribal headdress. The weekly news magazine Veja concentrated on infighting within the Workers' Party and said industry was confused over who was in charge. Mr da Silva's near 20-point lead in the polls has started to worry politicians of every hue. It even prompted the right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf, to say he might stand down from the race if it helped someone else beat Mr da Silva. But perhaps Mr Maluf, not reknowned for his modesty, is losing his touch. On Saturday he crashed his Porsche 911 in the rain. Luckily he was unharmed.

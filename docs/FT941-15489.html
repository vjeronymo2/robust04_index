			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Shingles drug price war recedes The threat of a price war between SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome, which make the only two drugs that treat the condition called shingles, seemed to be averted yesterday when SmithKline's drug was launched in the UK at virtually the same price as its rival. SmithKline launched Famvir at Pounds 107.35 for a seven-day course. Wellcome cut the price of Zovirax by 5 per cent to Pounds 107.30 for a week-long course as a shingles treatment. SB said it had priced Famvir below the then price of Zovirax because buyers such as general practitioner fundholders were under pressure to spend less. Wellcome said that it had cut the price 'to bring it into line with European pricing (of Zovirax).' Annual UK sales of Zovirax are about Pounds 40m, of which less than one third is for shingles. However, both companies agree that at most only half the potential users of their shingles treatments in the UK are currently prescribed the drug. Mr Jonathan de Pass, pharmaceuticals analyst with BZW, said yesterday: 'There is no need for them to compete on price. The market is now an oligopoly and there are no significant differences between the two drugs.' Famvir has been submitted for regulatory approval in more than 20 countries, with US approval likely next year. About 40 per cent of world sales of Zovirax are in the US; the UK accounts for about 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Soviet communist party to go on trial: Old regime likened to Nazis as Moscow prepares to judge Lenin and his heirs THE communist party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was yesterday sent for trial for violations of the constitution of the Soviet Union, the state which it created. The trial, timed for July 7, will be a public judgment on the darkest chapters of the history of the USSR since the 1917 revolution. Mr Andrei Makarov, the legal counsel of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, set the tone when he likened the CPSU to the German Nazi Party - many of whose leaders were put on trial at Nuremberg after the last war. Mr Gennady Burbulis, Mr Yeltsin's top aide, said after the decision of the Constitutional Court that further action might be taken against specific leaders of the CPSU. The decision of the court to, in effect, put the Party's history on trial came ironically as a result of a suit brought to the court by communist deputies, alleging that President Yeltsin's decrees banning the CPSU and the Russian Communist Party after the August coup were unconstitutional. This was countered by a cross suit brought by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, leader of the Social Democratic Party, that the CPSU had violated the Soviet constitution. The collegium of judges on the bench decided to unite both suits in one  - to the vociferous protests of the many once senior communists in the court - including Mr Yegor Ligachev, formerly number two in the politburo to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and Mr Vladimir Ivashko, Mr Gorbachev's deputy at the time of the coup. The judgment, described by Mr Burbulis as 'brilliant', means that even if Mr Yeltsin's decrees are ultimately judged unconstitutional, the country will be convulsed by promised revelations on the party's murderous past. Mr Gorbachev, the party's last general secretary and, in his role as president, the man who presided over its dissolution, was not himself in court. Mr Burbulis hinted that the court's decision would damage the former president's efforts to rehabilitate himself when he said: 'I doubt he will now engage in further political activity.' Mr Valery Zorkin, the court's chairman, ruled that former party leaders, including Mr Gorbachev, could represent the party if they wished. Mr Yeltsin's side had argued that the party had no legal standing in the court because of the ban on its activities. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, legal aide to Mr Yeltsin, has already given a hint of the evidence to be brought against the party when he produced a document on Monday which showed that the CPSU had authorised shipments of weapons in 1975 to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the most militantly terrorist of the groups within the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Mr Yeltsin said yesterday he would not resign from office during his current term but did not plan to stand for a second spell in 1996, according to Itar-Tass news agency.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Lower than expected US trade figures combined with general profit-taking to bring a retreat in stock index futures, pulling the near month Footsie contract back below the 3,200 level, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening trade in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was recorded at 3,205 and early profit-taking following Wednesday's strong run saw it drift lower shortly after the opening. The decision by the Bundesbank to leave its key interest rate figures unchanged was quickly followed by a retreat in bond markets, triggering active selling in September. After briefly steadying ahead of lunchtime, the contract once again came under pressure after the release of US economic data. Dealers talked of a 'tired market after Wednesday's run', but there were also reports of a big bear position in the market, with one dealer said to have tried and failed to push the market lower. September finished at 3,199, down 8 from its previous close and some 7 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 10 points. Volume was 12,828 lots. The traded options remained buoyant ahead of today's expiry of the index options. Total turnover was 47,883 contracts, of which 20,817 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,206 in the Euro FT-SE option.</p>

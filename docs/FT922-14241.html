			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Israel affirms hard line on peace talks ISRAEL will not attend any of the multilateral Middle East peace talks due to reconvene in May if they include representatives of the Palestinian diaspora, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said yesterday. In a further declaration of the government's unyielding stance, Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, said he planned to step up building for Jews in hitherto Arab areas of east Jerusalem captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, including the Moslem Quarter of the Old City, where previous Jewish settlement has provoked violent protest by Palestinians. Mr Shamir said the inclusion of Palestinians from outside the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip contravened ground-rules established for the series of bilateral and multilateral negotiations launched at the Madrid peace conference last October. The US and Russian co-sponsors of the talks have proposed including Palestinian exiles in several multilateral committees due to begin discussing issues such as refugees, water and arms control next month. But Israel regards their inclusion as a step towards granting such exiles the right to return to their original homeland. 'We will not accept it because it is a violation of all the rules that have been agreed between us and the co-sponsors,' Mr Shamir said. He wants the West Bank and Gazan Palestinians restricted to a joint delegation with Jordan, as in the bilateral talks which resume in Washington later this month. Mr Sharon met Mr Teddy Kollek, the veteran mayor of Jerusalem, to outline his plans for a string of Jewish settlements in Silwan, an Arab neighbourhood just outside the Old City, the Mount of Olives, the Moslem Quarter and the Arab area of Wadi Joz. Mr Kollek opposes such intrusive settlement, which Palestinians regard as intended to break up and marginalise their place in Jerusalem. But Mr Sharon intends to override his objections. The senior officer in charge of Israeli operations in Lebanon escaped injury when two explosions targeted his convoy in southern Lebanon yesterday killing one Israeli soldier and wounding four others, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut. The pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement in Beirut claimed the attack was carried out by its allies in the 'Islamic Jihad of Palestine'. The bombing appears to have been another attempt to avenge the February 16 assassination by the Israelis of Hizbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi.</p>

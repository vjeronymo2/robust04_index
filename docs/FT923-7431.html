			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Report urges upgrading of NZ wool exports NEW ZEALAND should double the amount of value-added processing of wool by the year 2000 in a bid to ensure the long term viability of the industry, according to a wide-ranging industry study. It said the industry must develop more 'higher value wool' promote a distinctive New Zealand wool brand and sell aggressively into new markets. The report was initiated by Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, who last year called for long term strategies to be evolved to bolster the declining fortunes of the wool industry. This followed the collapse in prices after Australia suspended its price support system in February 1991, causing New Zealand to do the same. Other problems related to the virtual end of sales to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, because of currency problems, and erratic buying from China. Adding to the difficulties have been wild variations in price. The average wool price peaked at NZDollars 7.40 a kilogram in October 1988, before plummeting to NZDollars 3.50 in February last year, hitting NZDollars 3.70 in October before rebounding to Dollars NZ5.45 earlier this year. This season, which began three weeks ago began with the indicator at NZDollars 4.71 and rose to NZDollars 4.82 (Pounds 1.35) at Thursday's sale in Dunedin. The report was unusual in that it was the first in which all sectors of the New Zealand trade - farmers, the Wool Board, and brokers - co-operated. It highlighted the declining state of the wool market over the past two decades. It said that sheep farming profits were at their lowest level for at least two decades. The poor profitability of wool growing was being reflected in falling output that would erode the benefits for New Zealand of being the dominant supplier of certain types of wool. The report said that the industry must aim for prices to climb above NZDollars 6 a kilogram, a level considered necessary to sustain production. It suggested that farmers should concentrate on producing higher value wool, especially fine and premium types. Greater efforts should be made to boost the amount of wool scoured before export to 85 per cent by 2000. It said the New Zealand industry must manufacture 10 per cent of the clip to final product stage: at present only 4 per cent is treated this way. A further 10 per cent should be turned into intermediate products such as carpet yarn.</p>

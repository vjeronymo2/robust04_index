			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: News Corp expects debt upgrade NEWS Corporation expects credit rating agencies to upgrade its debt to investment rating within six months, Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting. Mr Murdoch said the international media group's bank debt had been 'dramatically reduced' to bring debt maturities in line with operating cash-flow, which would cover all future bank debt repayments. He also said the group was negotiating a new bank loan at a lower rate of interest to spread debt maturities. 'That is something that will come in the next few months,' he said. Mr Murdoch said News Corp was on the way to 'the high road financially'. However, he said the group expected zero economic growth this year in the US, the UK and Australia. 'We are very bearish about the economic outlook. We are not planning at any point for any improvement in business conditions. We are working on the assumption of zero growth in all the economies in which we are operating,' he said. News Corp recently reported a 65 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 531m (USDollars 379m) for the year to the end of June, demonstrating a dramatic improvement in profitability since the completion of a ADollars 7.6bn refinancing in February last year. Mr Murdoch said he was unable to confirm analysts' forecasts that News Corp would double its profits in the current financial year. However, he said the downward path of interest rates and the improving profitability of core businesses made him 'very confident' of the group's future performance. 'We ran down a long way, we fought our way back and we expect to have an investment grade rating . . . within six months,' he said. News Corp last month announced a twin-pronged debt reduction programme consisting of a worldwide issue of 40m ordinary shares to raise USDollars 690m and a USDollars 1bn issue of senior debt securities. Moody's Investors Service recently upgraded ratings for some of News Corp's long-term debt, and the group has been placed on creditwatch for a positive upgrading by Standard and Poor's. Mr Murdoch said the the US would continue to provide the largest share of News Corp profits. Twentieth Century Fox, the group's film-making arm, expected to release several successful films over the next six months. Mr Murdoch said News Corp's five national UK newspapers were doing well despite the difficult economic climate. 'We don't like to admit that the current recession is any excuse for not doing very well,' he said. 'But let me tell you times are pretty tough in Britain at the moment.'</p>

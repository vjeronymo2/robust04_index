			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the political editor] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] According to available  information that is still incomplete, the network that carried  out the church bombing is made up of three rings:    1. The first is the planning ring, which is Israel. The  information indicates that two Israeli officers visited Lebanon  for this purpose.    2. The second is the implementation one. Several employees  of the Lebanese Forces' [LF] security apparatus were involved,  including some who lived in Lebanon and some who were travelling  and were persuaded to return. Several meetings took place  between those who planned and those who supervised the  implementation. Some of these meetings took place in Israel,  some in Cyprus, and a few in Lebanon.    Some of those who lived abroad returned to Lebanon by sea  from Cyprus with Israeli help involving the Israeli Navy, rubber  dinghies, and frogmen.    3. The third is the protection and concealment one. This  ring was asked to carry out a number of distraction operations  to conceal the effects of the first crime and preoccupy the  people with other imaginary or genuine operations.    The rings operated independently of each other. They only  knew the Israeli liaison officers.    After the operation, most members of the implementation team  were withdrawn by sea or infiltrated to the border strip with  forged identity cards or foreign passports issued for this  purpose. The members of the protection ring were also scheduled  to be withdrawn.    How was the network uncovered?    There is no sufficient information on this subject. But what  is certain is that the security services went back to its rich  archives about explosive experts (these people have records and  are identified by bombs, shells, timers, and the way the bombs  are connected). The security services also benefited from the  treasure they confiscated in the Lebanese Forces' war council  when they seized the building and evicted Dr. Samir Ja'ja' to  where he now lives in Ghidras. In this treasure there was  abundant information about the people, networks, liaison  officers, and explosive experts who received excellent training  in Israel. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Why Fu'ad Malik Was Arrested </H5>   According to the information, retired Major Fu'ad Malik, who  is the second in command of the Lebanese Forces after Ja'ja',  had attended some of the preparatory meetings to plan the church  bombing. He was cited as saying to the young men in one of  these meetings, "May God give you health." By virtue of his  responsibility and military position, he must have been  involved, even if he did not give the order.    According to the information, during his interrogation he  said: "I am not bloody like Samir Ja'ja', and in all my time in  the Lebanese Forces I have not killed anyone..." [passage  omitted]    His arrest, according to this information, might have been  for the purpose of exposing Ja'ja's role. It also might have  been the result of a political settlement involving intensive  U.S. efforts to save the head of the Lebanese Forces' commander  and satisfy some sectarian sensitivities.    It is also said that U.S. Embassy officials in Beirut were  briefed about the investigation and were stunned by the accurate  information (and perhaps also the confessions). Consequently,  no protest or "question" about what has happened to the  leadership of the Lebanese Forces were issued either in Beirut  or in Washington. [passage omitted]</p>

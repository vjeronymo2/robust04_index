			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> CANCEL DRUG SUMMIT, PERU URGES ITS LATIN NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> WAR ON NARCOTICS:THE MOVE WOULD SIGNAL DISPLEASURE OVER U.S. INVASION.  </P> <P> Peru, a key ally in the war on drugs, called Thursday for cancellation of the  upcoming Andean summit conference on drugs, a signal that Latin America's  displeasure over the U.S. invasion of Panama has emerged as a serious threat to  President Bush's anti-narcotics campaign.  </P> <P> U.S. drug fighters officially maintained a stiff upper lip, saying that it is  too early to speculate about adverse side effects that the U.S. move into  Panama may have on their efforts.  </P> <P> But officials worried privately that agents of the Drug Enforcement  Administration stationed abroad now may receive less cooperation and access  from host countries and that governments like Colombia's might become more  distant.  </P> <P> American intrusion on Latin nations' sovereignty has been a highly sensitive  issue as the United States has strived this year to take the anti-drug fight to  the traffickers and producers in their home regions.  </P> <P> In the Administration's drug strategy, American troops -- this week sent to  topple Panama's Manuel A. Noriega -- were to play an important role.  </P> <P> Besides Peru, which recalled its ambassador to Washington to underscore its  protest, Colombia also denounced the U.S. incursion and refused to recognize  U.S.-supported Guillermo Endara as the new president of Panama.  </P> <P> Colombia, the staunchest U.S. ally in the war against violent narcotics  traffickers, did not immediately endorse the call to cancel the drug summit  that it is scheduled to host Feb. 15 -- a meeting that President Bush has said  he plans to attend.  </P> <P> James Hoobler, an official with the State Department's Bureau on International  Narcotics Matters, said: "We're proceeding on the assumption that the summit is  going to be held. We have no indication that this (Panama move) will affect the  war on drugs."  </P> <P> In fact, William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug Control  Policy, declared that the ouster of Noriega would help the drug campaign  because Panama "will no longer serve as a haven or vacation spot for drug  traffickers."  </P> <P> Others were skeptical, however. Never a significant producer or shipping point  for drugs, Panama's major part in the illicit commerce was in the laundering of  traffickers' profits, they said. Even with an honest government in power, that  practice is so ingrained in the Panamanian financial community that it will be  difficult to curb soon.  </P> <P> Drug policy strategists said they hope a new Panamanian government friendly to  the United States might pave the way for a U.S.-Panama treaty that would make  it more difficult for the drug cartels to hide their money in Panama.  </P> <P> Such criminal justice agreements, which helped reduce money laundering in  Switzerland, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, can take years to complete,  and Panama's powerful banking industry could offer serious opposition, one  official said.  </P> <P> Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking indictments returned last year by federal  grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., is charged with accepting bribes of $10  million from members of Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect smugglers and  cocaine shipments and to launder profits and supply drug laboratories.  </P> <P> In Latin America, the protests by Peru and Colombia joined those previously  made by Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Guatemala, Argentina and  Costa Rica. Only El Salvador, heavily dependent on U.S. support for its battle  against leftist guerrillas, said the intervention in Panama was "justifiable."  </P> <P> In Bogota, Foreign Minister Julio Londono declared: "No country can assume the  right to intervene, directly or indirectly, in other state's affairs, whatever  reasons or purposes it may have, much less militarily."  </P> <P> The Organization of American States, composed of the United States and most of  the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, was moving at its session  Thursday toward condemning the invasion but had not worked out the wording of  the resolution.  </P> <P> Londono said representatives of several Latin nations plan to meet in  Washington over the weekend to study possible solutions to the crisis. A  Justice Department source said officials there regard the statements by Latin  American leaders to be pro forma.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone here believes there is anything but a positive reaction  on the drug war from the steps taken in Panama," the source said.  </P> <P> Con Dougherty, a spokesman for the DEA, said he could offer "no speculation on  what might be the effect" of the Panama invasion on such projects as the large  U.S.-backed anti-drug mission in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru.  </P> <P> "The drug summit meeting is still on the schedule," he said. "It's too early to  speculate about other things." The summit was called to intensify and  coordinate the multi-pronged assault on traffickers in the Andean nations.  </P> <P> Another Administration official involved in the drug war, while acknowledging  concerns, remarked that "the honest answer is it's too soon to tell" whether  the Panama invasion will impede Latin American cooperation.  </P></p>

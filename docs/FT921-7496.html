			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries down at short end in speculative trading US TREASURY prices eased at the short end but held their ground at the long end yesterday in a quiet session dominated by speculative trading. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 101, yielding 7.905 per cent. The two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 1/4 , to yield 5.267 per cent. Prices had been lower across the board in early trading, a reaction to reports that an influential newsletter had suggested that Federal Reserve officials now believe the economy is growing faster than expected. The market recovered some of the losses later, although it was unclear whether news of an 18,000 rise in weekly jobless claims sparked the rebound. The day's other economic news, the posting of a Dollars 45.94bn merchandise trade deficit in December, was generally ignored by market players. In the credit markets, the Fed arranged Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase agreements in an attempt to push the Fed funds rate nearer its target of 4 per cent. By late afternoon, Fed funds had eased from 4 1/8 to 4 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds ended higher after the release of favourable money supply data raised hopes of a cut in interest rates. Money supply grew at a record low rate of 1.8 per cent in January from a year earlier, compared with a rate of 2.0 per cent in December and 2.4 per cent in November. The slower growth rate raised hopes of an easing in monetary policy. Prices climbed in the afternoon after the release of the money supply data, but slipped taking and as the yen weakened against the US dollar. The Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen after the US currency strengthened to 128.25 yen. However, despite repeated intervention by the central bank, the dollar ended the day at Y128.60. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue ended at 5.37 per cent, having opened at 5.41. BELGIAN government bond prices closed higher on the day, helped by a successful auction of the new 15-year bond issue. The Treasury sold a total of BFr38.66bn of 15-year bonds at an average weighted price of 98.335, yielding 8.69 per cent. After the auction, the price of the 15-year bond rose as investors switched out of 15-year Dutch government paper into the 15-year Belgian issue. The combination of profit-taking and switching into Belgian stock pushed Dutch government bond prices slightly lower. The Dutch central bank lowered its special advance rate yesterday but the cut, from 9.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent, had little impact on the bond market. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds traded in a narrow range as the market awaited the release of the January money supply figure. The Liffe bund futures contract moved from its opening of 87.78 to 87.86, helped by a rise in the US Treasury bond market, but drifted back to close at 87.71. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, was reported as saying that an inflation rate of around 4 per cent was unsatisfactory, adding that there was no hope of an easing in monetary policy in the near future. UK government bonds traded in a narrow range, ending slightly stronger due to the firmer US Treasury market. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.23 and climbed to 98.00 before closing at 97.27 on below-average volume. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt opened at 116 3/16 , unchanged on Wednesday's close, and traded up to 116 3/8 to yield 9.32 per cent.</p>

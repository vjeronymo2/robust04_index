			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Radio psychologist David Viscott will be back on KABC-AM (790) starting Monday  afternoon, returning to the station from which he resigned in July. Viscott  says he now finds it possible "to pursue my line of questioning and my  programming again in a style which is natural to me." He left KABC last summer,  he said, because of disagreements with then program director John Rook, who has  since resigned. Viscott will be heard weekdays from 1-2 p.m. Sonya Friedman,  who took over Viscott's 2-3 p.m. hour when he left, will continue in that slot.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

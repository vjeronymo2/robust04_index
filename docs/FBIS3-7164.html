"Russia's proposal for an eight-party conference is part of  the efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through  dialogue. We note the intentions behind it," a Foreign Ministry  official said in a commentary.    "In solving the North Korean nuclear problem, efforts at the  U.N. Security Council are important at this moment. The issue  of an eight-party conference requires careful consideration by  the United States, Japan and other involved nations," he said.    Russia's proposal invites participation by South and North  Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia along with the  United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Seoul's reaction apparently reflects its reluctance to place  Korean issues on the international table, although it seeks  global coordination on the nuclear dispute. It has also chosen  to rely on the South Korean-U.S. alliance at the moment instead  of a multilateral arrangement.    Ministry officials said they were notified in advance of  Moscow's proposal on Thursday afternoon.    Meanwhile, the officials welcomed Moscow's commitment to  support the Security Council resolution on North Korea.</p>

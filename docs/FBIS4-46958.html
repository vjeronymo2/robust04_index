			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Government Invites Supreme Council to </F> Constructive Dialogue"]    [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers press service has  disseminated a statement to the press that says that the  government shares the concern over the socioeconomic situation  in the republic expressed in the statement of the Supreme  Council of 27 May 1994. At the same time it is emphasized that  the lack of confidence in the government policy that was  expressed is unconstitutional--according to the country's Basic  Law, the Cabinet of Ministers is answerable to the president of  the republic.    In the government it was hoped that the statement from the  Supreme Council would be a contribution to a constructive  dialogue between the representative and executive organs of  power. But, unfortunately, one can see in it signs of slogans  whose sources lie in the emotions and passions of the recent  election campaign.    With the current socioeconomic situation a painful  transition  period is inevitable but the objective preconditions for  overcoming it are in place, thinks the Cabinet of Ministers. The  government has acted in compliance with the anticrisis program  approved by the Supreme Council. Structural transformations in  the economy are continuing, defense industry enterprises are  being converted, the nonstate sector is developing, and under  the conditions of the most severe nonpayment crisis a mutual  offsetting has been conducted within the republic. Spring field  work is being completed--under the most difficult of conditions  the agricultural workers as of today have planted about 15  million hectares in grain crops and the planting of potatoes and  vegetables and other crops was conducted at the optimal times.    At the present time the government has submitted about 60  draft laws to the Supreme Council regarding urgent issues of  economic reform and strengthening the state, legality, and law  and order in the country. The adoption of these and other  documents would make it possible to improve the legal base of  the reforms and make social protection of the population more  targeted.    It says in the statement of the press service that the  government is inviting the Supreme Soviet to exercise its  constitutional authority to adopt laws and also to engage in a  constructive dialogue for the sake of preserving political  stability and interethnic harmony, and strengthening  Kazakhstan's prestige in the international arena.</p>

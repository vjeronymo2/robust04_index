			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Funds pledged for London health services SUBSTANTIAL funds have been set aside next year to improve health services in London, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday while announcing financial allocations to regional health authorities. The extra money will help introduce the proposals of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report into the capital's healthcare. This recommended reducing hospital beds and developing family doctor and community services. However, the amount the government intends to commit in 1993-94 will not be known until the new year, when Mrs Bottomley decides on the Tomlinson report's recommendations. Under the overall financial allocations for 1993-94 announced yesterday, the four Thames regions covering London and the south-east will receive increases of 0.4 per cent over forecast inflation. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'I understand the government intend to fund their programme of hospital closures in London by means of loans from the other regions. This is a cruel trick that Mrs Bottomley has yet to formally announce.' He added that the government's figures failed to take into account numerous factors including the rapidly ageing population. The government is moving towards allocating health funds based on the size and demographic characteristics of regional populations. If this formula applied fully next year, three of the four Thames regions - south-west, north-east and north-west - would suffer budget cuts of between Pounds 13m and Pounds 26m. This reflects the declining population of inner London, a long-term trend significant in this year's allocation because 1991 census data was used for the first time. The biggest funding increases next year will go to the population-growth regions of Wessex, East Anglia, South-West and Trent. Mrs Bottomley has allocated a total Pounds 17.5bn to the regions, retaining Pounds 2.66bn for purposes such as the London restructuring and Aids services. She also announced that a further 121 hospitals and other services had expressed interest in becoming self-governing trusts from April 1994. If most are approved, the drive to local self-management that started with last year's health reforms will be almost complete. Management, Page 11</p>

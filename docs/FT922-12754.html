			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: US brokers post record earnings THE CLEAREST evidence yet of Wall Street's sparkling first quarter was provided yesterday when three large US securities houses, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Charles Schwab, reported record earnings for the opening three months. Profits at Merrill Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, rose 53 per cent to Dollars 277.5m, at PaineWebber they jumped 135 per cent to Dollars 74.3m, and at Charles Schwab, the west coast-based broker, they soared 180 per cent to Dollars 29.7m. The figures show the momentum from late last year, when a big cut in US interest rates lured more individual investors back into stocks, spurred large issues of corporate debt and equity, and lifted share prices, was maintained in the first quarter of this year. Commission fees from individual investor business, asset management revenues, earnings from stock and bond underwritings and principal trading revenues were all higher over the three months. Expenses, other than performance-related compensation which rose sharply, held relatively steady due to cost containment measures. Merrill Lynch fully capitalised on its position as the country's biggest retail stockbroker and the world's busiest corporate debt and equity underwriter during the quarter. Total revenues for the period increased 9 per cent to a record Dollars 3.4bn. Revenues from investment banking were Dollars 361m, principal transactions, Dollars 574m; commissions, Dollars 685m; while asset management and custodial business registered Dollars 220m. Although non-interest expenses at Merrill Lynch climbed 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.7bn, the rise was due primarily to a rise in costs related to business activity, profitability and compensation. At PaineWebber, revenues increased 39 per cent to a record Dollars 658.7m with its core businesses  - retail sales and marketing, capital markets, asset management and investment banking  - recording improvements in earnings. The biggest increase was in PaineWebber's investment banking revenues, which more than doubled to Dollars 97.9m. San Francisco-based broker Charles Schwab saw its first-quarter earnings leap 180 per cent to a record Dollars 29.7m, based on revenues of Dollars 219.9m. Big increases were reported throughout the company's business. Commission revenues rose 62 per cent to Dollars 137.3m, assets in client accounts increased 40 per cent to a record Dollars 51bn, and average daily trading activity gained 47 per cent. Analysts believe the securities industry will be unable to maintain the first-quarter pace of earnings growth throughout the rest of the year. US interest rates are unlikely to fall much further, the rate of new corporate debt and equity issues has slowed, and stock prices have remained stuck in a narrow trading range. The companies' shares improved in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, but profit-taking reduced their gains. Merrill fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 , PaineWebber was unchanged at Dollars 20 3/4 and Charles Schwab added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 1/2 .</p>

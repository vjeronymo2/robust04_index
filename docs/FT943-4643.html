			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Engine makers face hard choices, says GE chief - The Farnborough Air Show Aero engine makers face a tough time deciding whether to produce engines for all types of aircraft, Mr Eugene Murphy, the new chief executive of GE Aircraft Engines, the aero engine subsidiary of the US industrial group, said yesterday. He said manufacturers would have to decide whether to launch new engine programmes or opt out of a given engine market if they felt there was not room for three competing engines. 'Companies are going to have to make a difficult call. Can they afford to offer engines on every aircraft,' he said. GE is locked in battle with its two principal rivals - Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK - to supply a new generation of large engines to power the Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-bodied airliner. GE and its international partners are spending Dollars 1.5bn on the development of the GE90 which competes against the Rolls-Trent 800 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney BW4000 to power the new Boeing 777s. Mr Murphy conceded that GE was facing a very tight schedule to meet the certification timetable for the GE90, which has been selected by British Airways to equip its new fleet of Boeing 777s. But he insisted that while the GE90 programme had encountered some 'mechanical problems' there were no major design flaws in its ambitious large engine programme. He said GE was continuing to strive to improve productivity and reduce costs to position itself strongly to capitalise on the eventual recovery of the civil aircraft market. However, he said he did not expect a recovery in the market until 1996, echoing a similar forecast by his UK rival Rolls-Royce. 'We are hopeful the market will bottom out in 1995 and we will be on the road of recovery the following year.' Although the order outlook remains disappointing this year, he said GE in combination with its French partner Snecma in the CFM International aero-engine joint venture continued to account for more than 50 per cent of new engine orders in the world market. For the first seven months of this year, GE and CFM won around 70 per cent of all new commercial aircraft engine orders for aircraft of more than 100 seats with firm orders for more than 210 engines. In contrast Pratt &amp; Whitney had taken 25 per cent of orders and Rolls-Royce 3 per cent. The International Aero Engine Group, in which Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney are the main partners, secured 1 per cent of new orders in the first seven months. Mr Murphy said GE also intended to step up its globalisation efforts and was targeting such markets as China and the former Soviet Union which he said held strong long term prospects.</p>

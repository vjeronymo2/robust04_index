			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Time bomb ticks: France's new government must bite the bullet on farm subsidies Last November, just after the US presidential election, I found myself talking to a senior figure in Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party - a man likely to be a member of France's new government. We were at one of those transatlantic gatherings where Europeans get their ears bashed by Americans for being parochial, protectionist and so forth. The tune of the moment was that Europe had better pull its finger out and clinch a Gatt deal while nice Mr George Bush was still in the White House, because once nasty Mr Bill Clinton got there all bets would be off. The logic of this advice seemed so impeccable that people were even predicting it would be taken. During a coffee-break I wandered over to my Gaullist friend and asked if he thought this at all plausible. To my surprise he said yes, a deal before January 20 was quite on the cards. 'What,' I said, 'you think the French Socialist government will bite the bullet before the elections?' 'Look,' he replied. 'Obviously this thing is a time-bomb that they're trying to leave for us when we take over in March. But they're not going to get away with it. It's ticking too loudly.' Well, he was both right and wrong. A week or two later the European Community and the Bush administration did reach an agreement on agricultural subsidies, the most divisive issue in the Uruguay Round negotiations. The French government denounced this as unacceptable, provoking shrieks of scorn from the opposition. The latter predicted scathingly, and no doubt hoped secretly, that the government would end up capitulating en rase campagne (in open country), handing over France's farmers gagged and bound to the dreaded Anglo-Saxon adversary. But somehow the time-bomb failed to explode. Mr Helmut Kohl and Mr John Major, both needing French co-operation on other issues, agreed not to make the Gatt an issue at the EC Edinburgh summit last December. At the Gatt itself other matters prevented a comprehensive agreement being reached before January 20. Mr Clinton duly arrived in office and appointed Mr Mickey Kantor his trade negotiator. As Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan called each other names across the Atlantic, the pressure on France relaxed. Now my friend and his colleagues are moving into ministerial offices in Paris, only to find the time-bomb still ticking. Their position recalls that of Harold Wilson in 1974, when he returned to power, pledged to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EC. He had to go through the motions of doing so, with the grudging co-operation of Britain's European partners, even though all concerned knew he was not going to get any significant improvement on the terms negotiated by his predecessor. It is hard to see how the EC can avoid going through some such exercise now with France. To expect the new government to sign the deal with the US as it stands, after denouncing it so stridently in the election campaign, is hardly realistic. But it is equally unlikely that the Clinton administration will accept significant concessions beyond those agreed by its predecessor. A cosmetic 'renegotiation' seems the only way out, but it will require great diplomatic ingenuity. Some politicians in both Paris and Washington will hope the deal collapses, each reckoning the blame can be pinned on the other side. Yet that cannot be in either French or American interests, let alone those of the rest of the world. The boost to world trade from a successful conclusion of the round is almost the only hope left of generating the extra resources needed to honour commitments made at the Rio earth summit last year, and to help Russia and other ex-communist states make the transition to capitalism without causing global disaster. More parochially, but still very important, it offers the only hope of pulling western Europe out of its present miasma of unemployment and pessimism. The interest of western Europe in that happening is obvious enough. But it is crucial to the future of central and eastern Europe too. Last week at the annual Anglo-German gathering in Konigswinter I listened to pleas from those concerned with the welfare of central and eastern Europe, urging the absolute necessity of west European markets being opened to products that east Europeans can produce competitively, notably steel. The German steelworkers marching through Bonn, on the other side of the Rhine, were just out of earshot. Their interests, and those of their UK counterparts, were represented by politicians well aware that imports from the east are only a marginal factor in the unavoidable contraction of the west European steel industry. Yet none of them volunteered to go and put the case of Czech, Slovak or Polish steelworkers to British and German constituents faced with rising unemployment. That will not change until there are real prospects for those made redundant to find other jobs in new, more competitive industries. And that in turn will not happen until there is an upturn in the west European economy, for which a renewed expansion of world trade offers the best hope. As France's new rulers nerve themselves for the inevitable accusations of betrayal from angry farmers, let us hope they can keep that broader economic picture in mind. In last week's column I wrote, incorrectly, that many of the present Russian parliamentarians 'were chosen under the old Soviet system, which gave seats to organisations . . . as well as to territorial constituencies'. In fact the 1990 election was held only in territorial constituencies, although under communist rule and without other organised parties.</p>

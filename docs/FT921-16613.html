			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Evaluating the worth of oil: The falling share prices of UK independents THE SUCCESS of Lasmo's strongly-contested bid for fellow oil group Ultramar has piled gloom on the UK independent oil sector where shares have followed the declining oil price on its downwards spiral. Lasmo's bid valued Ultramar well below the City's estimate of the company's worth. Now with many share prices in the sector at their lowest since the last oil price plunge of 1986, some analysts are reassessing the basis on which they value the independents. Many of these companies are still valued on paper at almost double their current share price. 'The market is valuing us on the basis of Dollars 18-a-barrel oil production with nothing in there for our exploration potential at all,' said Mr Paul Zatts, finance director at Clyde Petroleum. Clyde's share price has dropped from more than 150p last year to 77 1/2 p against an net asset value by County NatWest of almost 100p a share. Some of the smaller companies in the sector could feel the pinch enough to look for mergers and are vulnerable to takeover. 'I think we will see a lot more forced mergers amongst the smaller companies in the next six to nine months,' said Ms Angela Burns, oil analyst at County NatWest. AmBrit International, the small oil explorer quoted on the unlisted securities market, is currently facing a hostile offer of 6p a share from Pittencrief, the Scottish oil investment group. The absence of cash-rich predators in the North Sea over the past year has contributed to the share price malaise. Many foreign-owned national oil companies have in the past been hungry for acreage in the North Sea and have buoyed the value of the UK independents by paying generously for packages of assets and companies. But, in spite of Lasmo's low, initially all-paper offer for Ultramar, no white knight stepped in, which meant the company acquired Ultramar at 285p a share - well below some of the lowest City valuations which had put the diversified oil and gas group at 400p a share. The UK oil exploration and production sector underperformed the FT All-Share index by 20 per cent during the two-month bid and continues to drop. Lasmo itself now looks vulnerable in spite of its increased size. The company's share price has plummeted since the takeover and, at 223p a share, against the City's valuation of almost 100p a share more, Lasmo is one of the cheaper companies in the sector. The asset valuation belies the company's potential which has now been enhanced by Ultramar's assets. But some of the points made by Ultramar in its defence - such as Lasmo's expensive costs of finding oil - have needled shareholders who could be susceptible to a cash bid. Lasmo is moving swiftly to unlock shareholder value by selling Ultramar's North American refineries which could be worth as much as Pounds 1bn. The company has been talking to interested purchasers, but most interest has been shown in the Wilmington plant in California which could be sold by February when Lasmo announces its annual results. The Quebec refinery and Canadian petrol stations are expected to be floated off locally. Lasmo is also looking to rationalise its North Sea portfolio and is expected to put up a package of assets for sale in a few months. These will probably consist of small stakes in fields - less than 10 per cent of the whole. Other companies in the sector are also coming under pressure from shareholders to release value by selling acreage as soon as large discoveries are made. Hardy Oil and Gas has recently participated in a large discovery on the Elgin block of which it owns 20 per cent. The field is believed to contain about 150m barrels of oil and up to 1,000bn cu ft of gas and will be one of the biggest of the new generation of North Sea fields when it is developed in conjunction with the neighbouring Franklin field later in the decade. 'There is a view put forward in the City that we could sell it,' said Mr Peter Elwes, deputy chairman and chief executive, who has seen the company's share price drop to 144p compared with an asset value of 250p. 'But that is a very short-term approach and in trying to build this business we have to look five to seven years ahead.' Mr Roger Aylard, analyst at Warburg Securities, believes Lasmo's takeover of Ultramar will divide the UK exploration and production sector into a two-tier group, headed by Enterprise Oil and Lasmo which can be rated on earnings as well as asset values. Suggestions by some analysts that all companies in the sector should be judged on earnings rather than asset values are quickly shot down by many of the smaller companies which devote all of their resources to exploration. In any case, as Mr Roland Shaw, chairman of Premier Oil, stresses: 'Our earnings have increased this year (1991), but our share price has still dropped by 60 per cent.' The fall in share prices has cut off one of the traditional ways for small companies to raise finance for their exploration programmes as it is impractical to launch a rights issue when prices are so low. Pict Petroleum raised almost Pounds 12m from a recent rights issue, but Mr John Lander, managing director, said the company was not happy about having to offer the rights at a 15 per cent discount to the share price. Since then, the share price has dropped further and take-up of the rights was just over 50 per cent. 'We have to work twice as hard to get the price back up again with good exploration news,' he said. There is little joy on the horizon for the UK independents until the oil price and the strength of the dollar show some recovery. Oil prices, which are usually fairly buoyant in winter, have dropped Dollars 5 since October to below Dollars 18 a barrel. In addition, the weakness of the dollar against the pound has translated into a sterling oil price of Pounds 9.50 a barrel when many North Sea operations require a price above Pounds 10 a barrel to be profitable. 'We're at the end of a cycle and share prices are at ridiculous levels, but that doesn't mean we're finished,' said Mr Shaw.</p>

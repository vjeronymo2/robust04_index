			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Universal electronic accountant - The growing fortunes and share price of QSP BOOTS the Chemist, Nottingham-based and laced with Midlands' caution, is in the early stages of installing accounting software from Quality Software Products. QSP, based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, came to the market in March at 380p. The shares are now priced at 587p. The jump indicates the faith the City has in the company's products, and in particular in its new accounting software designed for the tomorrow's computing world of clients and servers, for which read computer networks. Boots, however, with millions of transactions a day to track, is not installing the wonderproduct Universal On Line Accounting System (Universal Olas). It is taking Olas, its well-proven predecessor, which runs on IBM mainframe computers. 'Boots will move to Universal Olas only when it is tried and tested' said Mr Philip Matthews, Boots' director of finance. The innate conservatism of finance directors faced with deciding whether to trust their company's business data to an innovative computer system may be the greatest obstacle QSP has to overcome in establishing Universal Olas as a important contender in the accounting systems market. Universal Olas is important because it can run on any hardware opening up the prospect of greatly increased sales. Last week it cleared the first barrier, selling the Universal Olas general ledger module to a Swiss Bank's London subsidiary for a six figure sum. Conversion work to move it to the bank's choice of hardware and database is expected to take 12 weeks. Here is the wonder of Universal Olas. Written for IBM workstations and the Oracle database, it is being converted to Sun workstations and the Sybase database in a matter of weeks. Mr Al-Noor Ramji, Swiss Bank's head of technology said: 'It is looking good. If QSP meets all the dates it promised, I'll say nice things.' Much will depend on the consistency with which QSP can roll out the rest of the modules to complete the accounting suite. Software to process accounts payable and accounts receivable is due in the fourth quarter of the year and Mr Mordain was confident it would be on time: 'There have been no hitches and it gets easier as we go on.' That a UK company should be in contention to supply large scale packaged accounting software to blue chip customers is, in itself, remarkable. In earlier years companies either wrote their own software or used packages from US software suppliers like MSA or McCormack &amp; Dodge. Today, these software houses are no more, absorbed into Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software. Meanwhile companies like QSP, which had developed accounting packages operating on-line rather than batch mode and providing management information in addition to juggling the numbers, were beginning to thrive. Olas was chosen, for example, by Pearl Assurance, for its new headquarters and data centre in Peterborough. Mr Tony Richards, the general manager for finance, found when he arrived in 1991 an organisation starved of information. The company was using a standard US-developed accounting package. It was taking the computer output and employing armies of accountants to rejig the information manually. The Olas system was installed on the same IBM mainframe computer as the software it was replacing and went live after six weeks of parallel operation. Mr Richards said: 'A number of organisations, including Boots, have come to see what we have achieved and been impressed'. Despite the regard in which Olas is held, QSP has its critics. One is Mr Richard Holway, author of the Holway Report which each year analyses the financial performance of the UK's computing services companies. He is concerned that almost alone among UK software houses, QSP capitalises its research and development costs. 'The latest accounts show a net book value of Pounds 7.1m. You should be aware that this is Pounds 3m greater than the total profits (Pounds 4.2m) earned by QSP over the past four years.' He is also concerned about the apparent slow down in sales of ordinary Olas in the past year. Some analysts, in addition, are becoming concerned that QSP's share price may be inflated. It has been boosted by a new enthusiasm for high technology stocks including Microfocus, the UK's most successful software products company now trading at Pounds 21.53 and Tadpole Technology, a hardware maker, which came to the market at 65p and is now trading at 323p. Mr Mordain agreed the market was taking an enthusiastic view of the shares in advance of the profits the company expected to make in 1994. '1993 will not be our year. We are still completing development of the new products. 1994 will be when it all happens, when we will not be poised between old and new software.' Analysts are looking for up to Pounds 3.5m in pre-tax profits in 1994. A share price of about 520p might more realistically balance the risk with the potential.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris regains 1,900 level on interest rate hopes MOST senior bourses had a more positive day, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS looked for an interest rate cut, and regained the 1,900 level for the first time in more than a month. The CAC-40 index rose 21.58 to 1,915.23 in good turnover of some FFr3.7bn. Suez rose FFr7 to FFr291.50, helped by reports that it might resolve its dispute with UAP, FFr9 higher at FFr583, over shareholdings in the Victoire insurance group. Lyonnaise Dumez put on FFr19.70 to FFr456.90 after forecasting a 'marked' rise in 1993 profits while Generale des Eaux advanced FFr19 to FFr2,233 on steady first quarter sales. Ahead of today's annual meeting LVMH was steady at FFr3,710 in spite of champagne producers saying that they were to lower prices by up to 25 per cent in an effort to counter falling sales. FRANKFURT edged up again as a strong dollar helped export sensitive shares. The DAX index scored its fifth consecutive gain, up 11.46 at 1,673.07, turnover easing from DM5.5bn to DM5.4bn ahead of today's public holiday. Steel and engineering shares continued to show widespread gains, with little apparent discrimination between those which have produced satisfactory results this year, and those which have disappointed. Linde, an engineer which comes into the steadier category, rose DM13 to DM752, up DM36 in a week; but Thyssen, the steel group recommended by Nomura as a buy on bad news a week ago at DM163, put on another DM3.60 to DM175.80. AMSTERDAM rallied as Royal Dutch closed at a record high helped by the strength of the dollar and a positive Opec ministers meeting in Geneva. The shares gained Fl 3.80 to Fl 172.50 as the CBS Tendency index gained 1.3 or 1.2 per cent to 107.0. Amev was another riser, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 71.40 ahead of today's first quarter results: NatWest Securities in London forecasts a 6 per cent increase with a rise of about 7 per cent at the operating level. MILAN found some encouragement in Fiat and Olivetti, while Ferruzzi and Montedison continued to slide as fresh rumours swept the market. The Comit index closed 4.50 higher at 525.90. Fiat rose L210 to L5,570 at the fix and further to L5,675 on the kerb for a gain of nearly 6 per cent on the day. Interest was revitalised by its announcement of a new small car to replace the Uno. The model is expected to be available by the autumn. The last day of Olivetti's L903bn rights issue saw active arbitrage between the ordinary shares and the rights, with the former rising L95 to L1,290. Ferruzzi was suspended temporarily as it fell more than 9 per cent. There were various market rumours concerning the group, including one claiming that its debts might be double the amount previously published. Investors are also worried that minority shareholders will lose out under the terms of the restructuring plan presently being negotiated. The shares fixed L59.30 down at L823.80, off the day's low of L795. MADRID recovered some of its post-election losses, the general index closing 2.38 higher at 256.29 in turnover of Pta18.6bn. Banks improved slightly, and the construction sector was little changed on balance; among individual stocks, two of the best gains came from Telefonica, up Pta25 at Pta1,390, and Repsol, which recovered Pta75 to Pta3,200. ZURICH ended at a record close, led by chemical and financial blue chips. News of lower Swiss year to year inflation, slightly easier money market rates and firmer bourses elsewhere in Europe helped lift sentiment as the SMI index of leading shares rose 16.9 to 2,311.4. BRUSSELS featured a 5 per cent rise in Solvay, up BFr550 at BFr11,500 and another good performance from Petrofina, up BFr100 at BFr8,450, as the Bel-20 index gained 10.07 to 1,207.44. STOCKHOLM was positive on Skandia on news that institutions had bought a 39 per cent stake previously held by Uni Storebrand of Norway and Hafnia Holding of Denmark. Its shares rose SKr5 to SKr123 as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 2.3 to 1,080.7 in high turnover of SKr2.7bn. HELSINKI fell for the third consecutive session, the Hex index down 16.6 at 1,098.5.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 9                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes           Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1173.84   1175.36   1175.38   1178.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1224.16   1225.62   1225.82   1227.89  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1179.13   1180.16   1181.19   1181.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1228.06   1228.16   1229.71   1230.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 8     Jun 7     June 4    June 3    June 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1168.70   1167.78   1159.95   1160.81   1155.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1218.08   1219.66   1214.21   1217.28   1215.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1182.29 ; 200 -  1230.89 Low/day: 100 -  1173.42  200 -  1223.66 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: MMH acquired for Dollars 25m - Tie-up has come sooner than expected after management buy-out Morris Mechanical Handling, the Leicestershire cranes, hoists and warehouse systems producer, has been taken over, just four months after Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group, sold it in a management buy-out. Harnischfeger Industries, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has bought Morris, formerly Davy Morris, for about Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.8m). The combination of Morris and P+H, Harnischfeger's materials handling arm, will create a new world force in the industry. The old Davy Morris had been only a very small part of Trafalgar House, acquired in the 1991 takeover of stricken process plant contractor Davy Corporation. Its purchase in June by management, for undisclosed terms, was the prelude to a search for link-ups in materials handling, aimed at establishing Morris as a world player in the industry. In the event, a tie-up has come much quicker than expected. The alliance combines P+H's strengths in the US market with Morris's strong customer base in the rest of the world. It will have annual turnover of Pounds 150m and 1500 employees at manufacturing centres in the US, UK, South Africa and Mexico. Morris has about 750 employees, two thirds of whom are based at Loughborough, and annual sales of about Pounds 60m. It is expected to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m for the year ended September 30. The Leicestershire company has one of the industry's broadest product ranges, making everything from huge ship-to-shore cranes to hand-operated pull-hoists. Engineered products account for two thirds of turnover, with standard or mass-produced products making up the rest. Mr Mike Maddock and Mr Bruce Norridge, managing directors of the two product sectors, said Morris and P+H had a complementary range of cranes, hoists and controls and associated services; the new combined operation would be extended by Morris's range of engineered cranes and automated warehousing equipment. The deal was carried out through the purchase by Harnischfeger of MMH (Holdings). It is part of the US company's strategy to transform its materials handling group into a core business with the technological knowhow, global presence and after-market potential to generate significant profits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 13 May (MENA) -- The first  Egyptian-Russian trade company for promoting Egyptian exports to  the Russian and CIS markets has been established with a paid  capital of $50 million and an issued capital of $200 million.    Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the Egyptian-Russian trade  section at the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Chambers,  said the new company, which belongs to the private sector, will  work to make a success of barter deals between Egypt and the  Russian Federation and the CIS, with a population of 300  million. Most Egyptian companies lost the former Soviet market  after the collapse of the Soviet Union.    Sultan said the company will work to conclude many trade  agreements with the Russians to restore part of this important  market and raise Egyptian exports to their old figure of 1  billion Egyptian pounds. He noted that current exports to the  Russian market are 25 percent of the old figure, while Egyptian  imports from Russia stand at 1 billion pounds. [passage omitted]</p>

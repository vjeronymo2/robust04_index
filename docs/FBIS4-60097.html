			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Solidarity To Abort Foreign </F> Funding of Terrorism"]    [Text] There may be a gray cloud over Egyptian-Kuwaiti  relations as a result of some irresponsible behavior by certain  groups or societies, either through good intentions or bad, on  the pretext that they are working for the Islamic call, even if  this conflicts with the values, principles, and tolerance of the  religion. No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti  organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it.    Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer  for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue,  which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the  fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey  home from China to the material and propaganda support the  terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies.    Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it  exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view  well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who  has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in  Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a  suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to  publish some books.    We must praise the successes of the Egyptian security  forces,  which have recently taken matters into their own hands. They  have succeeded in forestalling numerous terrorist acts, and in  following and tracking down the leaders of this terrorism and  the people who plan and support it inside and outside Egypt.  Undoubtedly this is an important and necessary accomplishment  to confront this criminal scheme. The objective of this scheme  was to shake the stability and security of Egypt and cause  seriously hurt the Egyptian people.    The fact that the security organs found large amounts of  foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions  about its sources.    It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that  there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend  set up and carry out terrorist crimes.    It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that  hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some  groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on  the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a  just religion. But these funds are actually being used to  support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly.    In Kuwait, when meeting with Egyptian Tourism Minister Dr.  Mamduh al-Biltaji and his delegation at the beginning of this  week, Kuwaiti Amir Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad focussed on the firm  Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations.    He said that under no circumstances could his country forget  the kindness of Egypt and the Egyptians during the liberation  war, and in fact for scores of years even before that, before  God granted it its oil wealth.    He said that Egyptian teachers, engineers, doctors, and  workers have contributed toward the education and medical  treatment of Kuwaiti citizens. This means that Kuwait's  progress and development go back to their efforts.    The amir of Kuwait added that Egypt is the heart of the Arab  nation and that what befalls it, befalls the whole Arab nation.  The amir of Kuwait pointed out that terrorism and extremism  have nothing to do with the true religion; extremism is a  phenomenon in all religions. He affirmed that Islam has  absolutely nothing to do with such behavior.    As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he  spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations  between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti  citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear  terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any  Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that  harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti  Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest  measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains  ideas of this kind or violates the law.    Actually, what the amir and heir apparent of Kuwait said in  my presence confirm the importance of Arab and Islamic  solidarity in containing the phenomenon of terrorism, whose  objective is to weaken the Arabs and harm Islam, which is being  subjected to a slander campaign by being linked to murderers,  criminals, and saboteurs.    During the big party given by Khalid al-Marzuq, the great  lover of Egypt and owner of AL-ANBA' newspaper, which was  attended by high Kuwaiti officials in honor of Egypt and the  Egyptian delegation led by Mamduh al-Biltaji, the issue of the  Kuwaiti citizen arrested in Cairo with thousands of dollars was  brought up. Investigators claim that he was supposed to hand it  over to some terrorist elements. This came out at the party in a  chat Dr. al-Biltaji had with Shaykh Khalid Sultan, head of the  Kuwaiti society to which the arrested Kuwaiti citizen belongs.  Shaykh Sultan tried to deny that this Kuwaiti had any ties with  Egyptian terrorists. He affirmed to Dr. al-Biltaji his respect  for Egypt and concern for its security and stability.    It has become well-known that terrorist operations, which  Islam is being falsely accused of, are only a continuation of  the campaign to attack and destroy the unity and solidarity of  the Arab and Islamic nation in confronting international changes.    Perhaps the most important proof of this is that the current  image that terrorism is blatant arose after the foolish Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait. Also, terrorism is not at all free of  responsibility for sedition in fraternal Yemen, which is  currently going through a bloody and terrible war, the victims  of which are the Yemeni people themselves.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Heston Resigns From Actors Equity Over 'Saigon': Charlton Heston announced  Tuesday that he is resigning his membership in Actors Equity, saying he was  angered by the controversy the union sparked when it barred British star  Jonathan Pryce from the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon." "Actors Equity  was the first union I joined," Heston said in a letter to the union.  </P> <P> "Until now, I've always been proud of my membership. I'm now deeply ashamed.  The council's obscenely racist rejection of Jonathan Pryce's right to play the  part he created in 'Miss Saigon' revolts me." The play's producer Cameron  Mackintosh canceled the production following the union's vote last week to  oppose the casting. The union is expected to consider the issue on Thursday.  </P></p>

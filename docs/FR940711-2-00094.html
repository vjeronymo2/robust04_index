Form partnerships with highway safety officials (e.g., Governor's Highway Safety Representative, police) to promote bicycle helmet usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Seek community input and generate community support for bicycle helmet usage promotion activities. Coalitions of appropriate individuals, agencies, and organizations with experience and interest in bicycle helmet usage campaigns may be established in support of intervention activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention activity and the program as a whole using evaluation guidelines for State injury control programs developed by CDC/NCIPC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Perform related injury demonstration projects. These may be related by population at risk, nature of the injury, causal chain, or intervention methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. For Fire-Related Burn Prevention Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Provide a full-time director/coordinator and staff who have authority, responsibility, and expertise to carry out the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Define the magnitude of the fire-related burn problem; define the population at risk and areas affected, and collect adequate injury data. These data include deaths and injuries attributable to fire-related burns, smoke detector use rates for various geographic areas of the community, and barriers to smoke detector use. Potential data sources include: E-coded hospital discharge data, emergency department data, public safety data (e.g., fire department data), and random digit dial phone surveys of community residents to obtain information on behaviors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Develop and implement community-based prevention programs to encourage the installation, use, and maintenance of smoke detectors. These include promotional, educational, and legislative (State and local) strategies utilized in a multifaceted approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Form partnerships with public safety officials (e.g., fire departments) to promote smoke detector installation and maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.

For Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Provide a full-time director/coordinator and staff who have authority, responsibility, and expertise to carry out the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Define the magnitude of the motor vehicle injury problem; define the population at risk and associated costs and collect adequate injury data. These data include deaths and injuries attributable to motor vehicle crashes, use of occupant protection (seat belts, child safety seats, air bags, or a combination of these), and barriers to occupant protection use. These data might best be derived through linkage of various data systems (e.g., hospital discharge and police data).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Develop and implement or enhance existing State and community-based programs to encourage the use of occupant protection devices. These include legislative (State and local), promotional, and educational strategies utilized in a multifaceted approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Form partnerships with highway safety officials (e.g., Governor's Highway Safety Representative, law enforcement) to promote motor vehicle occupant protection use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.

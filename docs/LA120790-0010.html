			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA WINDS TO BRING WARM WEEKEND WEATHER  </P> <P> A Santa Ana condition caused by high pressure over southern Idaho is the cause  of San Diego County's unseasonably warm weather, according to the National  Weather Service.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana will begin to weaken Saturday, but the warm, sunny days and  clear, cool nights associated with the high pressure will linger through the  weekend, forecaster Terry Schmeichel said.  </P> <P> The mercury reached 77 degrees Thursday at Lindbergh Field, 10 degrees above  the norm for a Dec. 6. The overnight low early Thursday was 46, more in line  with the norm of 50.  </P> <P> Expected winds of 30 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h in the mountains failed to materialize  Thursday. However, winds of up to 25 m.p.h. along the coast and 30 m.p.h. in  the mountains and deserts are predicted for today, though they will die down by  Saturday, Schmeichel said.  </P> <P> Temperatures at the beaches are expected to range from 70 to 76 today,  decreasing to 68 to 74 over the weekend. The water is 61 degrees and the surf  will be 2 to 4 feet.  </P> <P> Coastal regions will experience highs of 75 to 81 today, dropping to 74 to 79  degrees over the weekend, Schmeichel said, and night temperatures will dip to  38 to 47.  </P> <P> Inland areas will have highs of 79 to 86 today and through the weekend, with  nighttime lows of 37 to 46, he said.  </P> <P> Temperatures in the mountain will peak at 57 to 67 today, Saturday and Sunday,  dipping to 26 to 36 at night. Desert highs will be 68 to 77, with lows of 37 to  43.  </P></p>

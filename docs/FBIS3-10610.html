The meeting, which began at 1100 and was attended by the  delegates representing both countries, was presided over by  Francisco Gil Diaz, Mexican undersecretary of finance and public  credit, and Estuardo Mendez Herbruger, Guatemalan public finance  vice minister. The delegations agreed that the suspension would  enter into effect while the search would continue for a definite  solution that is favorable to both countries.    On 24 January, the Mexican finance authorities implemented  measures directly affecting Guatemalan and Central American  migrants travelling from the United States and crossing Mexico  carrying goods and other commodities. Both delegations agreed  on a study to harmonize timetables along the common border in  order to prevent bottlenecks in those areas, as well as  technical cooperation between customs authorities with the  objective of solving any problems that may rise.    Mendez Herbruger stated that both delegations plan to search  for convenient procedures whereby those who need to cross  Mexican territory will be able to do so without any delays  caused by Mexican custom regulations. He indicated that  Guatemala is evaluating a Mexican proposal because the Mexicans  reacted to comments forwarded by the Guatemalan authorities, who  in turn received feedback from the migrants. Therefore, they  are all working to benefit Central American citizens.    On the other hand, Mexican Ambassador Pedro Vasquez  Colmenares expressed satisfaction with the dialogue that had  been held and announced that the Mexican authorities had met and  exchanged opinions with the Salvadoran, Nicaraguan, and Costa  Rican customs directors at the Central American Integration  Secretariat.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: More means testing is no answer to rise in poverty Sir, Contrary to what was stated in your editorial, 'Work and benefits' (June 27), it is not welfare benefits which trap their recipients, so much as those which are means tested. Means-tested benefits are withdrawn as income rises: it is from means-tested benefit paid to the husband that a wife's earnings are deducted. These are just some of the reasons why they are such a poor response to the increasing insecurities of today's 'flexible' labour market. It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that the advent of the job-seeker's allowance - which brings with it more means testing - is greeted with enthusiasm in your editorial. Yet there is no avoiding the truth that means testing brings with it work disincentives, and not because benefits are paid at too high a level. Income support has been shown to be inadequate to meet even a low-cost budget. Between 1979 and 1991, the number of people in work who are living in poverty (defined as less than 50 per cent average income after housing costs) has increased from 4.1 per cent to 11.7 per cent, as a percentage of all in employment. No longer does being in work mean being out of poverty. The problem is not that benefits are over generous, but that rates of pay are far too low. Contributory and universal benefits, such as child benefit, do not bring with them the work disincentives of means testing. They can even go some way to alleviating them - child benefit forming a helpful bridge from unemployment into work. Cutting benefits and introducing more means testing will do nothing to halt the dramatic increase in poverty (particularly child poverty) experienced in the UK over the last 15 years.

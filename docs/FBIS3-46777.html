"It's about time North Korea recognized universal values,  such as freedom, respect for human rights and welfare," Yi told  reporters.    "North Korea must also ride the trend of world history for  inter-Korean reconciliation and coprosperity, and for this we  must tell the North Koreans things that sound harsh to their  ears."    Values respected in democratic societies must also be  respected in North Korea, said Yi, who is also unification  minister.    "We must induce the North Koreans into realizing the basic  value of respect for human rights," he said.    Noting that the most important human rights problem facing  both South and North Korea is the issue of separated families,  he said it shames the Korean people that these families still do  not know whether their beloved are alive.    "Meeting itself is no longer an end in inter-Korean  relations, and we must now make this relationship move forward  to a higher goal," he said. "If they don't agree on our  principle, we won't respond unconditionally to their proposal  for a meeting. So far we've tried to bring them over to the  meeting table and we've avoided telling them what they don't  like to hear. But now we need to awaken them to the universal  values of mankind, however harsh it may be to their ears."</p>

The club recognizes the need for treating toxic waste but  says that the Premex Antstalt's project contradicts the Latvian  law on dangerous waste and a respective Basel convention.    The project provides to build a plant for burning highly  toxic chemical waste in the vicinity of the Riga port. The firm  plans to process not only Latvia's own waste but to bring it in  from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the CIS and  the United States.    The first stage of the project envisions to build one  processor able to burn down 50 percent of the totally planned  volume of noxious substances. Later, two more processors would  be built. From their total burning capacity of 300 tons per  year, 20 percent would be Latvia's own and 80 percent --  imported waste.    The project requires a $450 million investment and 10  million  U.S. dollars in yearly operational costs.</p>

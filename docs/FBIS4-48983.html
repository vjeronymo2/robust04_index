			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan businessmen should  cooperate with their Turkish partners to tap lucrative markets  in Turkey and other central Asian states, according to the  president of the Turkish International Cooperation Agency.    President Umut Arik is in Taiwan as the head of a Turkish  trade mission. In a speech on Monday [25 April], he touted  Turkey's potential for Taiwan businessmen seeking to expand to  the Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States markets.    Arik's visit marks the opening of a series of business  promotions, including speeches, trade workshops, and visits by  Turkish business groups to Taiwan, a China External Trade  Development Council (CETRA) official said.    The Turkish Entrepreneurial Association Musiad, which boasts  17 affiliate organizations and more than 1,800 members, is  scheduled to host a trade and investment workshop Thursday at  CETRA headquarters, the official said.    The workshop aims to promote investment cooperation between  Turkey and Taiwan and expand Turkish distribution networks which  target the Asia-Pacific region, he added.    Despite an inflation rate of 71.7 percent last year,  Turkey's  economic development potential should not be ignored, the  official said.    Turkey's foreign trade stood at U.S.$44.8 billion in 1993  with industrial products dominating the imports and manufactured  goods and textiles and garments forming the bulk of the exports.    Taiwan's imports from Turkey totaled about U.S.$220 million  in 1992 with crude steel dominating the imports. The island's  exports to Turkey, totaling U.S.$150 million in the same year,  including mainly consumer's goods and electronic products, CETRA  reported.</p>

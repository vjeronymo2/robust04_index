			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON'S FEUD WITH UMPS MAY AFFECT ORIOLES  </P> <P> The danger is not that Frank Robinson will quit. Oh, he threatened as much, but  it was heat-of-the-moment type stuff, not rational thought. The Baltimore  Orioles are in first place at the All-Star break. It's highly doubtful the man  who guided them there will jump ship.  </P> <P> The real danger is exactly what Robinson fears -- the effect his fiery disputes  with umpires will have on his young club. Robinson exploded after Sunday's 7-2  loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, fuming over his treatment by umpires. His anger  probably will subside. His problem may not.  </P> <P> Among other things Sunday, Robinson accused umpire John Shulock of lying after  hearing his post-game version of a contested play at second base. Then, 10  minutes after his initial tirade, he dropped his bombshell: "I'm seriously  thinking about stepping aside."  </P> <P> Said Robinson: "How can I manage the ballclub the way I want to manage the  ballclub? You tell me. I can't stand in the dugout and question a call. I can't  go out on the field and talk about a play I think they missed. It's not fair to  these guys (the players) if I can't manage the way I want."  </P> <P> That wasn't all. Robinson also cursed Brewers Manager Tom Trebelhorn and called  him "very ... unprofessional" for protesting the Orioles' protest of the game.  It was a misunderstanding -- Trebelhorn actually objected to the way the  umpires handled the protest -- but the perceived insult only fueled Robinson's  rage. He said he lost respect for Trebelhorn.  </P> <P> Surely, Robinson and Trebelhorn will patch up their differences, especially  since they identified a common enemy. Robinson's threatened resignation is  something else. The Orioles' coaching staff expressed shock when informed of  the news, but hitting coach Tom McCraw said, "If that's what he said, I'm sure  he's serious." Bullpen coach Elrod Hendricks said he knew nothing about it.  Indeed, Robinson said the idea just popped into his head.  </P> <P> The question is what happens next. McCraw charged that the umpires' treatment  of Robinson may be racially motivated. Robinson is one of two black managers  (the Toronto Blue Jays' Cito Gaston is the other) in the majors. McCraw also is  black. All four umpires Sunday were white.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he's getting more respect from umpires than he did before," McCraw  said. "But they'll have to come around to the fact he's a good manager. A lot  of them resent Frank, I truly believe that."  </P> <P> Plate umpire Ken Kaiser denied any grudge against Robinson or his club. "If we  didn't have it in for Earl Weaver, why would we have it in for Frank Robinson?"  Kaiser said. "He's a small-time complainer compared to Earl. His timing may be  a little off, that's all. He was a Hall of Fame player. He's got to realize  umpires and players might not be on his level."  </P> <P> The friction between Robinson and the umpires has been present since he took  over as Orioles manager six games into last season, but it became intense on  the club's 3-3 road trip. First-base coach Johnny Oates said an umpire in  Toronto told him the Orioles were "the luckiest team in the world," but refused  to identify who said it -- Greg Kosc, John Hirschbeck, Dale Ford or Larry  Barnett.  </P> <P> Are the Orioles victims of unfair treatment? Oates said no. "This is my first  year in the league, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary," he said. "In  this business, you can't take it personally. I think it was just a tough day  for Frank. Wait 'til Thursday (when the season resumes). If we win, everything  will be fine."  </P> <P> Robinson was not ejected from Sunday's game; nor was he ejected Saturday night,  when he had a heated exchange with crew chief Jim McKean and wound up arguing  with every umpire but Shulock. As he walked off the field following the  Orioles' 5-2 victory, Robinson said he told (umpire) Larry Young, "I dislike  you as much as you dislike me."  </P> <P> Sunday's turmoil erupted with the score tied 1-1 and none out in the fifth  inning. Phil (5-for-5) Bradley was on first when Joe Orsulak hit a chopper up  the middle. Bradley crashed into Brewers second baseman Jim Gantner as they  reached second simultaneously, and Shulock called him out for interference.  Shulock also called Orsulak out, saying Bradley's action thwarted a possible  double play.  </P> <P> It is a judgment call based on whether Gantner had the ball. Shulock told  reporters he did not -- "There was contact before the ball was there," Shulock  said. "That caused the interference."  </P> <P> Robinson and Bradley, however, insisted Shulock told them precisely the  opposite, that Gantner fielded the ball. "Then it's nothing more than a  fielder's choice," Bradley said.  </P> <P> Soon after, Robinson filed his protest -- the Orioles were stifled by Chris  Bosio (9-5, 2.76) and Tony Fossas the rest of the way, as Dave Schmidt (8-8,  4.91) allowed 10 of the Brewers' 14 hits in six innings. Trebelhorn lodged his  protest when Kaiser allowed play to continue instead of immediately noting  Robinson's action. Trebelhorn said he was only trying to protect his club by  objecting to procedure in the event Robinson wins his protest.  </P> <P> The crowd of 39,238 booed when the public-address announcer said Robinson  protested the game, then cheered Trebelhorn's apparent mockery of Robinson,  which led to his mistaken appearance on Robinson's post-game hit list. "Frank  did right. Frank did fine," Trebelhorn said. "This has nothing to do with  Frank, nothing to do with the Baltimore Orioles. He doesn't know all of it."  </P> <P> The real danger is not that Robinson will quit. The real danger is that the  umpires, human beings that they are, might not forget. Which, ironically  enough, was Robinson's point from the start.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 15 May -- Direct contacts and talks  between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia themselves  could become a principle factor stabilizing the situation in the  area under the emergency situation. This is what Shmidt  Dzoblayev and Oleg Novikov, members of the Russian president's  public chamber told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today after their  visit to the area under the emergency situation in North Ossetia  and Ingushetia.    The members of the public chamber under the Russian  president  and heads of the two republics agreed on cooperating more  closely to settle the conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia.  In particular, Shmidt Dzoblayev, who is general secretary of  the Assembly of Democratic Forces of the Northern Caucasus,  proposed holding a conference of ethnic leaders in the region in  the immediate future to reconcile the "brothers" [krovniki].  This would create the conditions necessary for the ethnic  Ingush and the peoples of North Ossetia to be able to live  together in the future.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telspec pathfinder prospectus out TELSPEC, the fast-growing Rochester-based manufacturer of sophisticated electronic telecommunications equipment, which is coming to market next month, issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday. The placing is likely to value the company at more than Pounds 40m. The group designs and manufactures advanced equipment which enables customers like BT, Telecom Australia and Deutsche Telekom, to improve the efficiency of their networks and reduces the cost of installing or expanding local telephone services. In the year to December 31, Telspec, which has manufacturing operations in the UK and Australia, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.36m on turnover of Pounds 18.2m. In the first half of the current year, pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.94m were reported on turnover of Pounds 8.53m. The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 5m for the company, which will be used to fund increased capital expenditure and expand overseas service and support facilities.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row over claim of conspiracy to damage Nadir CLAIMS THAT intelligence services were involved in a plot to undermine Mr Asil Nadir and help destroy the economy of northern Cyprus yesterday heightened the row at Westminster over the treatment of the fugitive businessman. Detailed allegations and answers in the 48 pages of papers published by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, again raised concerns at Westminster over the activities of the Serious Fraud Office. The row also spilled over into renewed efforts by Labour to turn the focus back on to politically embarrassing donations to the Conservative party. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday attempted during Commons question time to heighten the funding controversy by demanding that the Tories returned Pounds 1m which he said had been donated to the party by Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK. Mr Botnar has been accused by the Inland Revenue in court of being the prime mover behind Britain's largest-ever tax fraud. The most serious claim by Mr Michael Mates, the former minister, was raised in a meeting last December, when he told Sir Nicholas that he believed there might be 'strong political pressure for Mr Nadir to be convicted in order to provide a solution to the problem of northern Cyprus'. Just over three months later he telephoned the attorney-general's office to report that BBC television's Panorama was planning a programme alleging a conspiracy involving the Cypriot, British and US intelligence services. The intention was to bring about Mr Nadir's downfall. Downing Street yesterday called the suggestion 'rubbish'. It also emerged last night that Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, was among the other hitherto unnamed MPs who had made representations to the attorney-general about the SFO's handling of the case against Mr Nadir. Mr Lloyd passed on the complaints of a constituent about the case.</p>

At the same time, the talks between Israel  and the PLO on economic issues will resume in Paris. This was  decided today in a phone conversation between PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The two men also  decided to meet again in Cairo if the need arises to break  through a stalemate in the talks.    Mr. Peres conferred today tete-a-tete with the prime  minister. They were later joined by IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  commanders and senior Foreign Ministry officials.    Speaking to our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, Mr.  Peres said: We overcame mountains of tension and suspicion, and  the negotiations with the Palestinians may now be held at a  faster pace.

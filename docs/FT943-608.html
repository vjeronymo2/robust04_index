			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Czech energy deal near completion A Dollars 700m plan for restructuring the Czech Republic's petroleum industry is close to approval by the government, clearing the way for foreign investment in the sector. The cabinet is meeting today to discuss the industry following a recommendation by the council of economic ministers that four international oil groups, Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total, be allowed to enter negotiations with the country's two oil refineries. This is something they have been seeking for more than two years. The companies were confident yesterday that their proposal, which calls for splitting refining capacity from the petrochemicals division, would be waved through. They have jointly offered to pay Dollars 180m for 49 per cent of the two refineries, at Litvinov and Kralupy outside Prague, and are committed to a Dollars 520m five-year investment programme. Fierce domestic opposition to the proposal has led to several delays in reaching a decision on the industry's future. Chemapol, the monopoly Czech importer of Russian oil, on which the country is dependent, has tabled a rival offer which promises to keep the two divisions together. But the lack of finance guarantees in its proposal has undermined its attempt to win control of the industry. The government originally supported Chemapol's offer, but Mr Vaclav June, the company's chief executive, became the target of allegations that he was a secret police informer during the communist era. Senior ministers became concerned the controversy was damaging the Czech Republic's image abroad.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / BIS chief warns of world financial crisis A WARNING that the world might be at risk of financial crisis came last night from Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank. Mr Lamfalussy said at the City University in London that a crisis could be triggered by the pace of financial deregulation over the past few years, unstable asset prices and a lack of transparency in financial systems. Mr Lamfalussy, highly respected in the international financial community and a long-time advocate of prudence in monetary and fiscal policy, said the changes in the financial world in recent years had created 'fertile ground for full-blown crises'. He said the removal of regulatory barriers which had provided new sources of finance for many individuals and organisations had brought 'numerous benefits' from the vantage point of users of financial services. But the downside was the 'systemic risk' that such a process involved for shaking the foundations of stable money and asset prices on which the financial services industry was based. In a world in which huge amounts of money could be shifted between organisations in seconds using modern telecommunications networks, 'you have prime ingredients for an environment in which financial asset prices become more unstable, adding to the dangers of increased fragility'. Mr Lamfalussy also said he was worried by the 'increasing opaqueness' of many financial systems. The scope for off-balance sheet accounting and 'creating hitherto unknown linkages' between different parts of the financial services industry produced an environment which may have had a part in the emergence of the Maxwell and Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandals, he said. With many aspects of the world financial system tending towards instability, Mr Lamfalussy said it was essential for national central banks to create conditions of sound, non-inflationary growth. 'They should actively contribute to the creation of a macroeconomic environment which minimises the risk of a global crisis,' he said.</p>

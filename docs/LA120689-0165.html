			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AMERICANS LOSE LONDON MATCH  </P> <P> Americans Jim Courier and Pete Sampras, the youngest pair in the history of the  tournament, were beaten by Australians Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann 6-2,  6-2, 7-6 on the opening day of the Masters doubles championship today.  </P> <P> Courier and Sampras said they needed more experience to make an impact in  top-class doubles.  </P> <P> "You need to know about court coverage. You need knowledge and experience,"  said Courier, 19, a year older than his partner. "Doubles is less about pure  skill and more about strategy."  </P> <P> In the other group of the round-robin event at Royal Albert Hall, South  Africans Piet Aldrich and Danie Visser -- second in the 1989 Nabisco points  rankings -- beat Todd Witsken of the United States and Jorge Lozano of Mexico  6-2, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.  </P> <P> The format of the five-day tournament is the same as the singles Masters, won  last weekend by Sweden's Stefan Edberg. Eight high-ranking teams play three  days of round-robin matches, then go into elimination play for the semifinals  and final.  </P></p>

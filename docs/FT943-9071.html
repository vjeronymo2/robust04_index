			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: A Don Quixote to be remembered for all the right reasons Sir, Having seen the Royal Ballet's production of Don Quixote first during its original run in 1993 and a further two times during this year's summer season, I still cannot agree with Clement Crisp who in his latest biting attack opted for 'bloodbath'('Coppelia', August 12). The Royal Ballet's reading of the the text is much more in line with the tradition of classical ballet than a first glance suggests. One has to remember that, in the 19th century, ballet music, to use Konstantin Skalhovsky's fitting comparison, was supposed to enliven the dance as colour enlivens a drawing. Marc Thompson's witty, though admittedly unusual, designs are but a natural extension of this view. Instead of competing with the dancing it positively encourages the eye - and the mind - to concentrate on what ballet is all about. And what wonderful dancing it was. When this ballet was shown for the last time a fortnight ago Fiona Chadwick and Zoltan Solymossi, as Kitri and Basilio respectively, gave one of the most inspiring performances I have ever seen. Their sparkling pas de deux, flashing variations and a joyous finale was classical dancing at its very best. The audience was still captivated long after the last of a seemingly endless number of much deserved curtain calls. With respect to the supporting roles, Nicola Tranah - in much the same way as Rachael Whitbread on the previous night - proved the casting policy absolutely right with a beautiful and highly lyrical reading of the Queen of the Dryads. Jane Burn and Belinda Hatley (Ann De Vos on Friday night, respectively) showed joyful dancing just as it is supposed to be done.

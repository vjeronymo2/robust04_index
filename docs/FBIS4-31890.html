			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 14 June (MTI) -- Tuesday's [14 June]  Hungarian national dailies devote extensive coverage to the  Austrian referendum held on Sunday [12 June] on the country's  European Union (EU) membership. Commentators stress the high  voter turnout, and applaud the decisive majority of "yes" votes,  saying that Austria's EU membership will make Hungary a direct  EU neighbor.    MAGYAR HIRLAP says, "the Austrians saw it as important to  vote...., and we can draw comfort from our neighbor's EU  membership."    MAGYAR NEMZET also emphasizes the two-thirds support  declared  by Austrians for European integration. "The result of the  referendum may help spur the EU's expansion, and the community  will move precisely in the direction recently urged by U.S.  President Bill Clinton at the French National Assembly: to the  East."    NEPSZABADSAG calls attention to a few lessons regarding  Austria's EU membership. "The Socialist-Conservative coalition  governing our neighbors jointly led the country into the Union,  an example worth following. Public opinion did not see joining  as dependent on party policies, one reason why they supported it  with such a heavy majority. This is also why Austrian  anti-integration rightists failed so seriously with their  arguments against EU membership, so familiar to Hungarian ears."</p>

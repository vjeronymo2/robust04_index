			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Fuel tax no answer to road congestion, and tolls may need a sweetener Sir, Following my article, 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll' (Personal View, February 11), Patrick Barr and B W Barton (Letters, February 15 and 17) suggested that higher fuel duties would be better than tolls. Fuel duties are a reasonably good levy on pollution, but they bear little relation to congestion and are unfair to country drivers. I could use 50 litres of petrol driving on empty rural roads in Scotland and cause no congestion at all, while just 10 litres used in the rush hour in London or on the M25 motorway would add to the tailbacks. With electronic tolls, peak-hour drivers would pay a surcharge over normal rates, and there would be discounts at night. That would cut congestion, so bus companies and delivery companies would need fewer vehicles. Benefits like that offset the costs to the economy of collecting tolls. Christopher Raymond (Letters, February 16) argues that these benefits must be balanced against people's dislike of paying tolls. Maybe a sweetener is needed: every household could be given Pounds 1,000 worth of shares in the road companies. There would still be some Pounds 50bn of privatisation left for the government.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 9 [dateline as received] (YONHAP) --  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  may find a breakthrough in their negotiations this week and a  team of IAEA inspectors could soon visit the Stalinist state, it  was reported Monday.    There is also a strong possibility of considerable progress  in talks between North Korea and the United States in New York  on a third round of high-level dialogue designed to improve  their relations.    North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim  Chong-su, refused to disclose details of the  Pyongyang-Washington contact in New York on Monday.    But he indicated that considerable headway was made when he  said, "History always moves ahead and (we) always look at  everything optimistically."    Ranking diplomatic sources here said the North Korean  nuclear  issue could be referred back to the UN Security Council if  Pyongyang and the IAEA cannot resolve the question of conducting  additional inspections by this week.    The U.N. Security Council, in a presidential statement, has  urged Pyongyang to permit additional checks of its nuclear  facilities before next week.    "Since both the United States and North Korea are hoping to  hold a third round of talks, there is a possibility of finding a  breakthrough in their negotiations," one source said.    The United States and South Korea agreed earlier to resolve  the North Korean nuclear row through dialogue without having to  refer it to the Security Council.    Seoul and Washington have also reached an understanding that  Washington will proceed to the next round of talks once North  Korea shows some flexibility on IAEA inspections.    Details of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations are being kept  secret, but sources said Pyongyang had showed willingness to  maintain the continuity of nuclear safeguards by allowing the  IAEA to conduct additional inspections of a key radiochemical  laboratory and change film in surveillance equipment.    But North Korea refused to accept the IAEA request on  collecting samples from spent fuel rods for later checks.  Therefore, the two sides could be seeking a compromise on this  point, the sources said.    At Monday's contact in New York, the U.S. side was  understood  to have stressed that the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be  broken off if IAEA inspectors were not present at the changing  of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon.    The United States asked North Korea to delay changing the  fuel rods until IAEA inspectors arrive, sources said.    The Americans also pressed the IAEA to reopen negotiations  with North Korea so that it can send an inspection team as soon  as possible, they said.    Monday's contact involved Kenneth Quinones, the State  Department's North Korea desk officer, and Han Song-yol, a  counsel at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations.</p>

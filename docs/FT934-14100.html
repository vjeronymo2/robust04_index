			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Employers criticised on training THE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY yesterday criticised the 'astonishing failure' of many employers to check the value of the staff training that they pay for. According to the society's quarterly survey, employers spend an average of Pounds 492 per head on training, with each employee spending a total of just over four days a year being trained. However, only 36 per cent of personnel directors questioned said their organisation defined objectives for each training and development programme before the programme began. The survey covered about one-third of the society's 12,000 member organisations. The majority simply did not know if objectives were fixed, indicating, said the society, that if such a policy existed it was unlikely to be properly carried out. With the exception of questionnaires, most organisations did very little to discover employees' views on how effective their training had been. This made it very difficult to ascertain if training programmes had been successful. Many employers were 'wasting precious investment' in skills, said Mr Andrew Forrest, the society's human resources director. Organisations needed to take two vital steps to ensure the maximum return on their investment in skills. 'Training has to be closely linked to business objectives, not a sideshow with little connection to corporate strategy,' he said. 'Employers need systems to evaluate the aims of training before it happens and the effectiveness of training after it happens.' The Investment in People initiative, administered by training and enterprise councils, is intended to help companies link their training more effectively to their business plan. Mr Forrest said a surge in support for the scheme was an encouraging sign that organisations were trying to tighten control of their training activity. Tecs were becoming increasingly effective at serving business locally, with IIP one of the topics they were most often contacted about.

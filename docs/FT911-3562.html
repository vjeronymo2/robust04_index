			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / End of recession in sight chancellor tells directors MR NORMAN LAMONT, the Chancellor, yesterday tried to convince a sceptical and occasionally critical audience of 3,000 executives that an end to the recession was in sight. He told the Institute of Directors' annual convention at London's Royal Albert Hall he expected a recovery in output - 'albeit relatively slowly at first' - in the second half of the year. He believed his first budget and the recent reductions in interest rates would help pave the way for an improvement in business optimism. The government, he stressed, was on course to achieve a sharp and sustained reduction in inflation, although unemployment would continue to rise after conditions began to improve. The chancellor sat down to respectable applause but immediately found himself on the defensive in a question-and-answer session. . He denied that ministers were 'going soft' on the need to control public expenditure and reaffirmed their determination to cut personal taxes in the medium-term. After Mr Lamont left, the government's handling of the economy came under heavy fire from sections of a traditionally supportive gathering which appeared still to be in mourning for Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, led the criticism, claiming that Britain's business renaissance had been 'torpedoed by runaway inflation'. Governments, he said, should be expected to deliver zero inflation but they were too often prepared to fuel it to win elections. He added: 'This awful recession . . . is a failure of government economic management. It is a government failure, not market failure'. He attacked the government for failing to cut income tax further. The 20p target had 'moved from the realm of commitment and conviction to 'jam tomorrow' rhetoric'. Mr Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, expressed surprise and regret that after 12 years in power the government still had to make the conquering of inflation its first priority. But he stressed that government alone was not to blame. Management had often 'let free enterprise down'. The tussle later transferred to the Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, taunted Mr John Major, the prime minister, with Mr Morgan's remarks. He said the IoD also realised the recession was 'hand-made in Downing Street'. As a former chancellor, the prime minister had to bear 'a special, personal burden of guilt'. Mr Major dismissed the accusation. Far from 'flattening' the economy, the government was flattening inflation and interest rates, he said. Lamont shifts emphasis of economic monitoring, Page 10</p>

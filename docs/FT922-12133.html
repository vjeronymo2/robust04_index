			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / EOC is criticised over value for money THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is failing to provide value for money in its operations, according to early conclusions of a Civil Service investigation. The draft findings of the inquiry into the EOC are likely to be submitted at the end of the month to the Department of Employment which, since the general election, has taken over responsibility from the Home Office for overseeing the commission's work. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, who also has cabinet responsibility for women's issues, could be embarrassed by the report and attempts may be made to tone it down before it is presented to the commission. Mrs Shephard is unlikely to want a confrontation with the commission at a time when she is coming to grips with equal-opportunities issues and expectations from women's groups are high. There is added tension because some EOC commissioners have made it clear they opposed the transfer of responsibility for the commission and were annoyed there had been no consultation on the issue. The commission argued that it needed to be overseen by a central policy department and that its activities were far wider than just employment - taking in education, health, housing and consumer rights, among other issues. The early conclusions of the investigation are that the commission is overstaffed and some employees are too highly graded by Civil Service criteria. In 1990-91 the commission spent Pounds 2.6m on staffing costs associated with its 160 employees, out of a total income of Pounds 4.7m. Departments were reorganised in late 1989 with further changes in 1990 aimed at integrating legal strategies and other activities. The current investigation is part of a programme of management audits. All government departments and government-funded bodies are subject to independent scrutiny every few years. The commission was last investigated about six years ago. The commission said yesterday that it was not in a position to comment on the initial findings of the investigation because it had not yet seen a draft of the report.</p>

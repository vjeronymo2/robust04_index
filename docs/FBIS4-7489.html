			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Swiderek: "Privatization in a New Way"] </F>   [Text] Will an employee of a privatized firm have the  right to free shares in his enterprise? Will farmers supplying  a privatized factory be able to count on free shares? When will  the one and the other be able to get free shares?    Today the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers  will  deal with the draft of the new law on privatization of state  enterprises. This draft enters into the composition of the laws  creating the Pact on State Enterprises and, should it become  law, will replace the standing law on privatization. The draft,  prepared by the Ministry of Ownership Transformations, has  already passed through the so-called interministerial  coordination.  <H5>  Workers' and Farmers' Shares </H5>   The draft foresees the cancellation of the right of  employees  to buy, at half price, up to 20 percent of the shares or  interest in a privatized firm. Instead, the work force would  receive for free up to 15 percent of the shares (interest).    The draft imposes a condition, however, in that the combined  face value of the shares for the employees cannot be greater  than 18 average wages in industry (average estimate based on six  months' worth of wages, beginning one month before the share is  issued) multiplied by the number of employees in the firm.    The employees would receive their shares over the course of  six months from the time the joint-stock company, which resulted  from the conversion of the state enterprise, is entered into the  trade registry.    At present, employees may buy shares in their firm only two  months after the shares have been accessible to other investors;  in other words, in reality, from about 12 to 30 months after the  company has been entered into the trade registry.    The draft states that employees who received free shares  will  not have the right to vote at general assemblies of the company  until the time of "the first general assembly convoked following  the disposal of at least half of the general amount of shares  (interest) by the state treasury."    The same rights as those held by employees would be offered  to private farmers and fishermen who supply the factories with  raw materials. However, they will have to submit a written  declaration "of intent to acquire shares" within one month from  the day the company was entered into the trade registry.  <H5>  Capital Privatization </H5>   This path would change the name to an intermediary and could  follow the progression of:    --invitations to bid publicly;    --open tender or negotiations undertaken on the basis of a  public invitation.    In the ordinance, the minister will be able to designate the  rules for acquiring shares.    Without the agreement of the finance minister, shares of  privatized companies will not be available for purchase by,  among others, state enterprises, state banks, or banks that are  joint-stock companies, the sole shareholder of which is the  state treasury.  <H5>  Direct Privatization </H5>   In the standing law, direct privatization is called  privatization by liquidation, and it assumes that the enterprise  privatized in this manner can be sold, used as a contribution  into a company, or accepted into a leasing arrangement  ["repayable exploitation"] by a so-called employee-owned  company. Decisions about privatization by liquidation are  undertaken by the so-called founding agencies [organy  zaloczycielskie] (for example, those controlled by voivodships),  but they require the permission of the privatization minister.    In addition, the draft states what kind of factories can be  privatized using this method. Direct privatization cannot be  carried out if one of the following three conditions is met:    --at the time of the commencement of the preliminary  proceedings, the factory employs more than 400 people;    --the value of the sale of goods and services during the  year  before the preliminary proceedings is more than 12 million ECU's  (converted to zlotys at the rate announced by the NBP [National  Bank of Poland] on the day of drawing up the balance sheet for  that year;    --the sum of the statutory capital and the enterprise  capital, counted at the end of the year preceding the  commencement of the preliminary proceedings, is more than 8  million ECU's (conversion principle as above).    The draft assumes that, in justifiable cases, the  government,  at the request of the privatization minister, may agree to  direct privatization even if a firm fulfills the condition  dealing with the value of sales.    The draft assumes, among other things, that the installment  payment of the debt on the factory in the case of leasing may  last up to 10 years, and the ownership rights to the factory may  be assigned to the employees after payment of one-third of the  amount stated in the agreement (but not before two years). The  time limit of two years may be reduced to one year, if the  company has paid a minimum of half of the debt.    In addition, the draft states that the participants in the  employee-owned company may not be foreign firms or individuals  residing permanently outside of Poland.  <H5>  Detailed Changes </H5>   The draft also assumes many detailed changes, among others,  surrendering the existing entry that "Privatization Directions"  for this year are passed together with the budget. In the  future, this document will be a supplement to the budget  because, as is written in the explanatory statement,  "privatization is not something separate from the whole of the  economy. It is a basic element in the economy."    The draft also regulates the principles for calling forth  boards of directors of companies and guarantees a place in the  boards for employees as well as for private farmers and  fishermen.    It also proposes deletion of the entry that a one-person  company of the state treasury should be privatized within two  years. In practice, this entry was not implemented in many  cases because there were no takers for the privatized factories.  <H5>  Transition Provisions </H5>   The draft assumes, among other things, that the proposals on  converting enterprises into companies not considered up to the  date the new law becomes effective will be considered in  accordance with the new law. If, however, as a result of the  new law's provisions, there is an obligation to supplement the  proposal, the proposer of the motion must do so within two  months of the date the law goes into effect.    In addition, if, on the date the new law becomes effective,  the state treasury has not yet begun making company shares  available to the employees, they will receive them on the basis  of the new law. Where such access has already begun, it will be  completed on the old model.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP PONDERS POLITICAL 'SWAMP';  </P> <P> CAMPAIGNS: THE CANDIDATE'S INITIATIVE PROMISES TO DRAIN IT, BUT HIS OPPONENTS  SUGGEST HE MAY ALREADY HAVE WET FEET.  </P> <P> For John K. Van de Kamp, Democratic candidate for governor, California attorney  general and veteran politician, it was a question of the ticklish kind. But not  necessarily the trivial kind.  </P> <P> Here he was, in front of the massed Capitol press corps on Monday, denouncing  special interest money as having made a moral "swamp" of state government. Here  he was, offering the final draft of his bold ballot initiative proposal to  "drain the swamp" with 64 pages of new laws -- limiting campaign spending,  offering taxpayer financing for candidates, restricting their terms in office  and imposing a broad code of ethics on elected officials.  </P> <P> "The quest for campaign money never stops. Those who do not play the game are  very quickly overwhelmed by those who do. So the rule becomes play or die. And  everybody plays," he said.  </P> <P> But, then, what of Van de Kamp? What special treatment has he given to special  interests during his career in politics? After all, for seven years as state  attorney general and seven before that as Los Angeles County district attorney,  Van de Kamp has proven an accomplished fund-raiser, with broad support in the  very special-interest community he blames for strangling government through  semi-legal corruption.  </P> <P> "I think it can be said that those who have contributed in the past have often  asked to come in and talk. Frankly, I see them," Van de Kamp replied, as if,  yes, special interests had received special treatment. Most politicians grant  that money does buy access, not more.  </P> <P> But then Van de Kamp added quickly, "At the same time, I would see anyone who  called in and made a special request to talk, even my opponents. That's just  the way I behave. . . .  </P> <P> "I don't think my decisions have been influenced by those (special interest)  groups," he added.  </P> <P> As for others, though, he was not so kind: "By all accounts the worse abuses  occur in soliciting campaign contributions. Yet our laws in that area are so  weak that only the very dumb or the very careless are ever caught violating  them."  </P> <P> The question of righteousness, in one form or another, is bound to follow Van  de Kamp in the upcoming 1990 campaign for governor. His sponsorship of this  ballot proposal, titled "The Clean Government Initiative," was from its  conception an effort to reshape his image as a crusading political outsider  rather than status quo insider. And it has spawned powerful enemies as well as  eager allies along the way.  </P> <P> Both of his major opponents in the 1990 campaign zeroed in on the question  Monday.  </P> <P> The campaign of Republican candidate and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson drew attention  to several positions Van de Kamp has taken over the years.  </P> <P> "For the last seven years John Van de Kamp has lifted nary a finger for the  legislative program for the California district attorneys. Instead I think you  will find he has been exceptionally close to the California trial lawyers, who  are on the other side," said Wilson aide Otto Bos.  </P> <P> Also cited by Bos was Van de Kamp's lead role in opposing a ballot measure in  1986 to limit tort claims in personal injury cases, a measure strongly opposed  by trial lawyers. In 1982, Van de Kamp also was one of only two district  attorneys to oppose an anti-crime ballot proposition called the Victims' Bill  of Rights. Again, he was on the side of trial lawyers.  </P> <P> "We haven't heard a peep from John Van de Kamp on this issue of ethics. . . .  Only now that it's politically expedient does he posture as Mr. Outsider while  all along he has happily been partaking as Mr. Insider. I think frankly the  public is not going to buy that," said Bos.  </P> <P> From Democrat Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco and also a  candidate, came similar criticism. "Here's Mr. Insider trying to reposition  himself as Mr. Outsider. Remember, as chief law enforcement officer for  California he is the one responsible for rooting out corruption in California.  And he hasn't done it."  </P> <P> The major elements of Van de Kamp's proposal were outlined at an earlier series  of press conferences. His appearances Monday in Sacramento and San Jose were to  divulge the precise language of the complicated ballot measure -- and to see  how much more news attention he could draw with the issue. This initiative is  one of three that form the major planks of Van de Kamp's campaign platform --  the others dealing with environmental protection and criminal justice.  </P> <P> In this case, the passage of time between first announcement of the measure and  Monday's press conferences gave opponents time to sharpen their attack.  </P> <P> From the Legislature, Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra bored  in on what may be the measure's biggest soft spot: partial public financing of  campaigns.  </P> <P> "This is going to open the state treasury and provide tens of millions of  dollars to politicians running for office," Johnson said through a spokeswoman.  </P> <P> One goal set by Van de Kamp, and his ally in the effort, the activist group  Common Cause, was to limit overall campaign spending for all state offices. The  Supreme Court has held that the only effective way to limit spending is to  offer candidates taxpayer funding.  </P> <P> In this case, candidates for the Assembly could spend up to $250,000 in the  primary and $400,000 in the general election. For the state Senate, $425,000  and $700,000. Statewide offices, such as attorney general and insurance  commissioner, $1.5 million and $2.4 million. For governor, $4.5 million and  $7.2 million.  </P> <P> Candidates who agree to such limits would receive some of their total allotment  direct from the treasury. To try and ease the sting of the idea, Van de Kamp  proposed allowing citizens to designate on their income tax forms whether they  want $5 of their taxes to be used to help finance these campaigns. The total  cost to the treasury was estimated at $15 million. If citizens did not cover  the bills with check-offs, Van de Kamp acknowledged, "we may have to go to the  general fund."  </P> <P> All kinds of politicians have previously reacted unhappily to a third major  element of the proposal: A limit of two four-year terms for governor and other  statewide offices and 12 years for a seat in the Legislature. Van de Kamp noted  with a smile that he has lived up to the spirit of his reform by never trying  to hold an office longer than his proposal would permit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Valid signatures of 595,484 registered voters will have to be collected in the  next five months to qualify this proposed amendment to the state Constitution  for a spot on the November, 1988, ballot. A rule of thumb is that from 800,000  to 1 million raw signatures will be needed to assure enough valid ones.  </P></p>

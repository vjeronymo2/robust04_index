			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] Criticism by [Social  Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf] Scharping regarding Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel's summons of French Ambassador Francois  Scheer to the Foreign Ministry met with heated contradiction  from the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. According to  the Social Democratic Party [SDP] chairman, Kinkel must "take  along some putty" when he goes to Paris soon. Kinkel permitted  his behavior toward the French ambassador last week to be  determined solely by domestic policy reasons, Scharping said.    FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer accused Scharping of the  "foul creation of legends." The summons of the French envoy was  "appropriate and necessary." It is dishonest that Scharping now  tries to turn this into ammunition for the election campaign,  Hoyer said.</p>

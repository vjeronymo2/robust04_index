			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Management: A boss's life at the sharp end / A look at Gillette's controversial decision to close its Seville factory Every day Alberto Morales goes to his office at a factory near Seville and stays inside until it is time to go home. He no longer visits the shopfloor, even though he is the boss - or rather, because he is the boss. Two bodyguards, ordered by Morales' US superiors, wait outside to accompany him off the premises. His house is under 24-hour guard. Life for the general manager of Gillette's Spanish manufacturing subsidiary has been like this since the morning of March 18 when he told the works council the company had decided to close the factory. Gillette is abandoning the Seville facility, employing about 250 people in the industrial zone of Alcala de Guadaira, in order to concentrate European razor-blade production at Isleworth, west of London, and Berlin. The announcement - recalling the row early last year over Hoover's plans to move vacuum-cleaner production from eastern France to Scotland - has provoked bitter protests. The Andalucia regional government contested the legality of the move. The Spanish industry ministry described it as 'a provocation'. And one senior labour ministry official floated the idea of a Gillette boycott. Spain's labour laws allow for collective redundancies on certain specified grounds, but Gillette's move did not seem to correspond to any of them. Recently approved reforms, designed to make the rules more flexible, will allow authorised cutbacks for reasons of reorganising production. Senior government officials insist that this is intended to cover reorganisation within Spain, not cross-border transfers. The Seville closure is part of a 'realignment' announced by the Boston-based consumer products group in January, affecting 2,000 of its 34,000 employees worldwide. The lost jobs, mostly outside the US, are expected to be replaced by jobs elsewhere, including China, Russia and Poland, where Gillette has new ventures. Gillette does not justify the Seville decision on grounds of new technology or economic problems: 'The reason for closure is not that it is unprofitable,' says Morales, 'but that it is superfluous.' The plant, which enabled Gillette to exploit what was then a highly protected Spanish market, still makes the old-fashioned double-edge blades, the only Gillette plant in Europe still to do so. It has two other lines, the twin-blade disposable razor known in Europe as Blue II and in the US as Good News, and the GII, the original twin-blade fixed razor head. Morales, an engineer who joined the plant 20 years ago, was called to London to receive advance notice of the plan for Seville. 'It was a surprise,' he says. 'I always knew the factory would end up being closed, but I thought it would happen little by little. In two or three years the factory would have died by itself.' Instead he now finds himself in the firing line. 'I live in this office,' Morales says glumly. He has not even tried venturing into the main part of the factory, where production has been going on as normal. 'It is better to maintain calm,' he reckons. He says he has been the target of personal attacks from employees but does not want to go into details. This is, after all, the place he has spent his whole career, with the exception of two years at Gillette headquarters in Boston. Morales 'had to accept' the US management's decision to dispense with the Spanish operation. Having accepted the role of executioner, he is not optimistic that Gillette will provide a suitable alternative post when it is over. 'I know they could only offer me somewhere like India,' he says, evidently not keen on the idea. 'In Europe I don't fit. I am a factory manager, and there are two factories in Europe.' Morales says Gillette concentrated its modernisation effort in the UK and Germany because of government support. 'Here we have not had any government subsidy,' he says. Improved production methods have left Isleworth and Berlin with excess capacity. Gillette has already reduced its Seville workforce by about 60 per cent since the mid-1980s, getting rid of activities in the group's perfume and writing-instrument divisions. To avoid lengthy administrative procedures, Spanish companies tend to offer the maximum redundancy compensation of 45 days' pay per year's work. Gillette's standard package has added to this an extra Pta1m for every five years' seniority. Morales hints it may pay even more this time to achieve a negotiated settlement. It took more than two months of confrontation before the works council agreed to hear the company's preliminary offer (on May 25). The open-ended proposal includes a retirement plan, outplacement services and a range of insurance policies. Like a ship's captain, Morales will be the last to leave. He will stay on until next year to liquidate the company. Then, at 54 and after six years as general manager, he expects to be out on the street.</p>

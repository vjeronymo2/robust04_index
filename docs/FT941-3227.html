			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Inter-party row deepens over council tax levels Conservative and Labour politicians were yesterday engaged in an increasingly bitter spat over the amount of council tax to be levied by local authorities. Signs that the issue will dominate campaigning for May's local elections have fuelled the row. Ministers again accused Labour authorities of 'waste, mismanagment and inefficiency', arguing that they would charge more than their Tory counterparts in each of the council tax's eight property bands. Labour tried to shoot down the Tories' figures, claiming that they were 'spurious' and that the only sensible comparison of council tax levels was to be found in the average council tax per dwelling. These figures show Labour councils charging less than the Tories and Liberal Democrats. Sides paraded their different claims in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon. Mr David Curry, local government minister, said that he could think of no less sensible way of expressing the payments than an average, 'be-cause nobody pays an average tax'. He added: 'Whether you are with modest means and a modest house, whether you have got a middle-income and a middle-band house, or even if you are relatively well off in Band H, you are always paying less under Conservative than you do under Labour or under Liberal Democrat councils.' Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said that both the Department of the Environment and Tory central office had used average figures in March last year when setting out the impact of the tax. 'Did central office use those figures before they discovered that average household council tax bills per dwelling are Pounds 40 lower in Labour areas than they are in Conservative areas?' asked Mr Straw. A Labour official said yesterday that the council tax issue was one on which his party was unlikely to win. But he said the aim of Labour's campaign was to ensure that the government did not score an easy victory. Councils demand, Page 11</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Farm funds go to Europe and the greens - Agriculture and the environment THE cost of reforming the EC Common Agricultural Policy, added to agricultural spending on the environment, will boost planned expenditure by the agriculture ministry by Pounds 670m to Pounds 2.38bn in 1993-94, and by a further Pounds 790m to Pounds 2.52bn the following year. The CAP increases dwarf the reductions in government expenditure on domestic agriculture, which will fall Pounds 20m to Pounds 1.09m and Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.1bn in the corresponding years. Total planned expenditure is projected at Pounds 3.49bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 3.64bn in 1994-95. Overall, environmental programmes have been spared the cuts - almost all have extracted more government cash for the next three years. Spending on the main schemes by the environment ministry is expected to rise from Pounds 617m this year to Pounds 649m in 1993-94, Pounds 682m in 1994-95 and Pounds 695m in 1995-96. Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said yesterday that the costs of last May's CAP reform represented a switch in the cost of farm subsidies from consumers to the EC budget. Farmers would themselves be receiving less money under the reforms. If the CAP had continued unchanged the Pounds 790m extra cost expected in 1994-95 would have been Pounds 1.5bn, he suggested. The EC's switch to direct payments to farmers per hectare or per head meant that the UK would recieve a higher proportion of total CAP expenditure than in the past. The agriculture ministry will also give Environmentally Sensitive Areas, pilot schemes to protect sensitive landscapes, Pounds 43m in 1995-96 compared to Pounds 11m this year. A further six Environmentally Sensitive Areas will go ahead six months later than planned. An extra Pounds 30m is being made available in the UK in the next three years to help reduce levels of nitrates in drinking water and on other agricultural schemes. Environmental groups welcomed the protection given to environmental protection bodies such as the Countryside Commission and the National Rivers Authority, but criticised the relaxation of rules on private funding of road building, fearing a further stimulus to traffic levels.</p>

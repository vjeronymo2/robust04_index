			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Unilever steps up European expansion UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, plans to increase further its presence in central Europe by making three more acquisitions in Poland and Czechoslovakia this year. If the deals go through on schedule, Unilever expects to expand its annual sales in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary from about Pounds 200m (Dollars 356m) this year to almost Pounds 700m in less than five years. Without the planned acquisitions, sales in the region would rise to almost Pounds 500m. The deals involve the purchase of a margarine and food manufacturing business in Poland, and of foods, detergents and soap operations in Czechoslovakia. Total investment, including planned spending on plant modernisation, would be almost Dollars 70m. Mr Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's regional director for continental Europe, said negotiations on all the deals had been completed and were awaiting approval by the Polish and Czech governments. He said the investments would largely complete the company's acquisition drive in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and that any further deals would be small. He said more than three-quarters of Unilever's sales in central Europe were locally produced. Its operations in the region would be profitable in five years if they achieved their growth targets. The acquisitions would make Unilever one of the most active western investors in central Europe. They would come on top of the Dollars 120m which it has invested, or agreed to invest, in central Europe since it began acquiring there last year. Its first acquisition was of an 80 per cent stake in Lever Polska, a Polish detergents producer. In Hungary, Unilever this year bought the ice cream business of the state-owned VMTV dairies.

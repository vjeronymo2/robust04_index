			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Clarke attacks Delors plan to create jobs The UK government yesterday attacked plans by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, to create jobs by borrowing money to pay for environmental and transport projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link. One the eve of the European summit in Brussels, Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said there was no evidence of the need for borrowing for infrastructure improvements across Europe. 'Here are the commission for the first time saying they are going to borrow billions of Ecu as a commission and dish it out to as yet unspecified projects across Europe,' he said on BBC Radio. All EU governments were trying to reduce borrowing to create the right conditions for growth. Mr Clarke added: 'It really is rather perverse for the European Commission to say: 'Oh but we are going to have a public sector borrowing requirement of our own now and we are going to start borrowing billions of pounds' which might start driving things in the wrong direction.' The government's negative reaction to the commission's proposals was criticised by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor. He accused ministers of 'spoiling for yet another fight in Europe'. 'Many of the proposals the government now rejects out of hand are modelled on the December summit agreement in Edinburgh in 1992 for which the prime minister once claimed credit' he said. Mr Brown added: 'It is clear that the negative, destructive, anti-European attitudes now being expressed even by declared pro-Europeans like the chancellor are designed to hold the Conservative party together.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, accused the government of trying to 'placate a handful of primitives on its back-benches' and called for a positive policy on Europe that was in Britain's interests. Earlier Mr Clarke said: 'We don't want these white papers produced on a Monday, trundled through a heads of government conference at the weekend, accompanied by a press release indicating that something like Pounds 100bn worth of borrowing can speed up the construction of the networks across Europe.' But Mr Brown asked: 'Why does the government refuse to back action that would clearly be of benefit to the Channel tunnel rail link and prevent the national humiliation until 2002 of trains travelling at 185mph from a link already opened from Paris to Calais but at only 47mph from Dover to London?'</p>

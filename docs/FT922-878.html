			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Nationalists to dominate in Slovakia SLOVAKIA'S new cabinet will be dominated by hard-core nationalists after its regional parliament yesterday approved the choices of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the republic's new prime minister. Eleven of 14 members of the cabinet will belong to Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Party in Slovakia, the eastern republic of Czechoslovakia, which is on its way to independence following the strong showing of nationalists in this month's elections. Mr Meciar, whose party fell two seats short of an absolute majority in the Slovak parliament, also appointed Mr Ludovik Cernak, a member of the pro-independence Slovak National party as trade and economics minister. The remaining two members of the Slovak cabinet claim to have no party affiliation. They include Gen Jozef Tunycha, a former intelligence officer in the Czechoslovak army named yesterday as Slovak interior minister. Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the new Slovak privatisation minister, said yesterday that 'the privatisation will continue in Slovakia but its negative effects will be have to be corrected'.</p>

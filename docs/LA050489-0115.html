			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Medstone International Inc. reported first-quarter net income of $359,000, a  57% drop from the $833,000 profit for the same period a year earlier. However,  revenue was up to $4.2 million from $2.8 million. The Irvine-based company said  its first-quarter performance in 1989 was significantly below 1988 results  partly because its first-quarter profit last year included $350,000 in tax  credits. Medstone develops, manufactures and markets shock wave systems for the  disintegration of kidney stones and gallstones.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Victory for American in TWA gates bid AMERICAN Airlines, one of the largest US carriers, yesterday won US bankruptcy court approval for its proposed purchase of Trans World Airlines' (TWA) three gates and 40 landing slots at Chicago's O'Hare airport. Its victory came after United Airlines, American's big rival, withdrew a competing offer for the assets in the middle of a court hearing yesterday. TWA, the heavily-indebted carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code since January. The need for court approval over the proposed sale to American gave United an opportunity to start a bidding contest. United, based in Chicago, has an established presence at the key O'Hara hub. American, however, has been trying to expand its operations there. United had offered a slightly higher price for the assets - notes with a stated value of Dollars 235m, against American's Dollars 211m. But TWA and its creditors argued that a deal with American was more likely to close quickly. Accepting a United bid, they claimed, could expose TWA to lengthy litigation with American. Under the deal with American, TWA will get two notes - a 'slot note' which will continue to act as collateral for Shawmut National Bank, and a 'gate note'. TWA can ask for the latter to be 'pre-paid' in cash, bringing in a much-needed Dollars 41m. The pre-payment value of the slot note is Dollars 109m. MAXXAM and Continental Airlines Holdings said they had a preliminary agreement whereby a Maxxam-led investment group would invest Dollars 350m in the bankrupt US carrier, Reuter reports. The companies said 'the investment is to provide Continental with the financial resources to enable it to emerge from Chapter 11 (protection from creditors) and assure its continued operation as an independent company.' The agreement, which is to become effective when Continental emerges from Chapter 11, calls for the investors to get Dollars 325m in the restructured Continental's secured notes. Investors would also receive 65m Class B common shares with three votes per share and warrants to buy 130m class a common shares. The company's unsecured creditors will get 60m Class A shares, and other constituencies could receive up to 15m Class A common shares. After such a transaction, the Maxxam-led group would control about 72 per cent of Continental, on a fully diluted basis. Maxxam, based in Houston, Texas, operates in three main businesses, aluminium, forest products and real estate.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News in Brief: The Equitable seeks revaluation of DLJ arm THE EQUITABLE, the US life insurance company which is 49 per cent owned by France's Axa group, told shareholders yesterday that it was looking at ways in which it might bolster its balance sheet by attaching a more accurate valuation on its Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette brokerage unit, writes Nikki Tait. Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable's chairman, told the annual meeting that options included floating shares in DLJ separately on the stock market, or selling an interest in the business to an outside investor. However, he stressed that no final decision had been taken. DLJ is currently carried on Equitable's books for about Dollars 500m, but Mr Jenrette suspected that the market value could be 'about double' that.</p>

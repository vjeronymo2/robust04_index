			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: Approval nearer in France FRANCE cleared another hurdle on the road to Maastricht in the early hours of yesterday morning when the senate approved changes in the French constitution required for ratification of the treaty. Virtually all the Socialist, centrist and centre-right UDF members voted for the revision, which was mainly opposed by the Gaullists and the Communists. The one technical hitch is that the senate introduced detailed amendments to the text passed by the national assembly. Since the constitution can only be revised on the basis of identical texts, the senate version will go back to the assembly today for a new vote. However, the size of the senate majority (192 in favour and 117 against) strengthens expectations that the government should be able to complete the constitutional revision in its final parliamentary phase, a special congress of the national assembly and the senate, in the palace of Versailles, probably on June 29. A three-fifths majority will be required at that meeting. This seems entirely feasible, since the separate votes in the two houses of parliament add up to a majority of just over 66 per cent. However, should the congress fail, the government will submit the treaty for ratification in a referendum in the autumn. Polls continue to suggest that the treaty would be approved.</p>

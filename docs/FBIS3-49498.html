I have expressed this  interest on various occasions, including in the letter I  addressed on 18 September 1993 to the NATO General Secretariat,  to Mr. Manfred Woerner.    "Romania considers the North Atlantic Alliance, that has  proved its ability to adjust to the new realities emerged after  the close of the Cold War, as being the only organization apt to  ensure stability on the European continent and guarantee the  values of democracy and the state of law.    "I have received with special interest the `Partnership for  Peace' proposal, perceived in Romania as being an important  preliminary stage in the process of the country's full  integration into the NATO structures. My country has shown  willing to participate in this new form of cooperation, with  respect of the requirements imposed by the status of member of  the alliance.    "I would like to use this occasion to reassert Romania's  strong conviction that, as an European state, it has a rightful  place into NATO.    "In analyzing our request, please take into account  Romania's  vital interests of security, that have been given new dimensions  following the recent political developments in the areas in the  proximity of my country.    "Moreover, Romania is resolute to get more actively involved  in ensuring stability in the region and in Europe in general, it  is willing to assume all responsibilities it would have as a  member of the alliance.    "I am sure that Romania's integration into NATO would offer  us security guarantees absolutely necessary to create conditions  adequate for translation into practice the democratic  transformations and the economic reform Romania has firmly  committed to.    "In my outlook, to be a member of NATO is an essential  constituent of the global process of integration of Romania in  Euro-Atlantic structures (NATO, WEU [Western European Union],  the European Union, and the Council of Europe), this is the  essential objective of the Romanian foreign policy.    "I hope that during the debates to be held at the high level  meeting in Brussels you will consider the position of my  country, on which all political parties in Romania's Parliament,  the whole Romanian people, have agreed."</p>

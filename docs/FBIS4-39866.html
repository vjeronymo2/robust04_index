			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Mikhail </F> Shevtsov and Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 11 Jun -- The Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev has said that his talks today with Geydar Aliyev, the  president of Azerbaijan, were "successful." Commenting after  the meeting on its outcome the head of the Russian defense  department said that the main attention had been focused on two  purely military matters.    The first matter concerned the future of the Gabala  [Gabelinskaya] missile attack warning station, a large  installation in northern Azerbaijan that was previously under  the control of the armed forces of the former Soviet Union.  Pavel Grachev said that on this matter he had met with full  understanding on the part of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev  that this station is of strategic importance not only for Russia  and Azerbaijan but also for other CIS countries and the states  of the whole world. Grachev stated that experts have been given  the task of studying this matter very quickly so that an  agreement can be signed on the operation of the installation.    The Russian delegation also put forward for consideration by  the Azerbaijani side a proposal to create a single air defense  system in the Transcaucasus. This proposal had been discussed  earlier at talks between Armenia and Georgia, and had been  accepted by those countries. The head of the Russian defense  department said that Geydar Aliyev welcomed the idea, and had  instructed the Azerbaijani defense minister to look into this  question. Grachev said he hoped for a positive solution. In  any case, even if Azerbaijan does not give us a positive answer,  we will build a single air defense system in the Transcaucasus,  with the participation of Russia, Armenia, and Georgia, -- the  Russian minister underlined.    Speaking of the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict, Grachev said that he had learned a lot in a one-to-one  conversation with Geydar Aliyev. The Russian minister said he  would brief in detail President Yeltsin on his return to Moscow.  Grachev said he had learned two important things from this  conversation. The first one relates to the influence of the  internal political situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict  there. The second, according to the minister, is that no narrow  or departmental agreement on the cease- fire and on stopping the  military action would have a positive effect until a  comprehensive political treaty between Russia, Azerbaijan, and  Armenia on settling this problem has been signed. Such a  document is now being developed by the Foreign Ministry and  other departments, he said, speaking of this issue.    At present, Azerbaijan and Armenia on the whole are  observing  the cease-fire agreement, Grachev said. However, according to  his information, each of the sides was building up its forces  and this could lead to a resumption of military actions. At the  same time, the minister gave assurances that Russia, as  mediator, was monitoring the situation in the conflict zone.    Grachev said that the question of introducing Russian  peacekeeping forces into the region had not been discussed at  the meeting.    It has become known that the Russian defense minister and  those accompanying him will return to Moscow this evening.</p>

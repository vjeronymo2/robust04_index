			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 13 May, BNS -- Latvia's foreign and defense  ministers will join the Western European Union's [WEU] sessions  and the Latvian Government will build closer contacts with WEU  Governments since the Baltic country received associate  partnership of the group, Justice Minister Egils Levits told  reporters Thursday [12 May].    The partnership of the European Union's fledgling defense  group will help Latvia regulate relations with Russia, Levits  said.    Levits described cooperation with the WEU as "entrance into  NATO via detour."    As reported, the three Baltic republics of Latvia,  Lithuania,  and Estonia, as well as six East European countries, were  offered WEU "associate partner" status Monday in Luxembourg.    In addition, the Baltic defense ministers met in Luxembourg  by themselves and decided to join efforts to refute Russia's  "alternative Partnership for Peace" program in the forthcoming  Nordic defense ministers' conference, said Latvian Defense  Minister Valdis Pavlovskis.</p>

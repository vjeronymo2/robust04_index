He has sacked Mr Kighoma Malima, his finance minister and replaced him with 42-year-old Mr Jakaya Mrisho Kikwette, a staunch insider of the ruling Revolutionary party. He has fired prime minister John Malecela, a strong reformist, in favour of Mr Cleopa Msuya, who is tipped to become presidential candidate in multi-party elections due next year.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Summertime, and the going is busy: Japanese politicians are spending August locked in cabals and committees Pity Japan's poor politicians. While their European counterparts head for Tuscany or the beach for their August break, Japan's politicians will be hard at work, in Tokyo's choking heat and humidity, for the second summer in a row. Take the leaders of the fragmented seven parties of the mainstream opposition. They will spend much of the next few weeks talking - in a meeting room in the Hotel Okura, an ostentatious 1950s building in central Tokyo - about how to forge a single grand party. The hotel is favoured by former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, who defected from the LDP to the opposition last month, for the discretion of its staff and its pleasant swimming pool. His chances of becoming prime minister again will sink or swim on the result of these talks. This time last year, what is now the opposition was struggling to form a coalition government after a general election ended nearly four decades of rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic party. Three governments later, the LDP has schemed its way back into power by forming a curious partnership a month ago with its former arch-enemy, the leftwing Social Democratic party. The old structure of Japanese politics has been turned upside down in the past year. The aim of the Okura talks is to regroup into a single large opposition, informally christened Shin-shinto or the 'New New party', capable of challenging the LDP-SDP alliance in a general election. A troika of former prime ministers, Mr Tsutomu Hata, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Kaifu, met in the Okura on Thursday, for the second time, in an attempt to get Shin-shinto moving. For its part, the new government will be just as busy. Cabinet ministers will be locked in parliamentary committee meetings churning through the backlog of urgent legislation, from tax reform to the redrawing of elec-toral boundaries, delayed by the past year's epic power struggles. While the politicians toil, the public can look forward to a novel experience, a return to a period of stability. The heat wave, dog shows and the import bargains resulting from the high yen have over the past weeks supplanted politics as the top items on television news. It is no surprise that politicians have decided to go backstage. Voters have given up trying to discern the difference between the nascent New New party, the Japan Renewal party, the Japan New party, the New Harbinger party and the New Future party. And the likely date of the next election is receding by the day. When the LDP-SDP odd couple took power a month ago, it seemed they would only just manage to suppress their policy differences until the autumn, when new electoral boundaries are due to be in place. This was generally accepted as the first opportunity for an election under Japan's recently reformed political system. Now politicians in both government and opposition are talking about an election for the lower house, the more powerful of the two chambers, some time after the upper house elections next July. Japan's prime minister looks set to stay in office at least long enough for people to remember his name: Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the first Socialist in the job for 47 years. Both government and opposition have good reasons, political and financial, to keep him there. For one thing, the LDP and SDP are getting on better than either side had dared hope. The pacifist Mr Murayama, with the tacit support of a majority in his party, has leaned to the right. He has, for example, dropped the Socialists' most extreme dogma, which included opposition to the US-Japan security treaty and a belief that the military is unconstitutional. In return, the LDP, the coalition's senior partner, has courteously inclined to the left. It has said it might accept Socialist demands to curb military spending and has agreed to defer indefinitely a rise on consumption tax - a nod to almost the only Socialist policy the leaders of Japan's SDP still uphold. The opposition, meanwhile, needs several quiet months of backroom bargaining to create its super-party. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the opposition's strategist, broke a month-long silence recently when he claimed that the new party would pull together enough lower house members by the end of next month to outvote the LDP, with its 206 seats. He may be too optimistic on the timing, given the reservations held by some potential Shin-shinto members over working with the accident-prone Mr Ozawa, who contributed to the demise of the previous government by driving the Socialists out of the old coalition and into the arms of the LDP. Yet the incentive to unite is strong. In its present fragmented form, the opposition will be too poor to compete against the government in the next election, explains a former cabinet minister. The detail of a new law to control political funding explains why. Corporate donations to politics have dried up over the past year, which means that political parties will have to rely on state subsidies, paid under the new funding law from next January. One feature of the funding rules, inserted to win a reluctant LDP's support, is that they favour large parties such as the LDP. A Y30.5bn annual subsidy is to be shared out between parties, in proportion to the number of lower house seats; but the subsidy for any individual party is subject to an upper limit determined by its annual turnover. That means the LDP and SDP, with their high spending, qualify for a combined subsidy of Y20bn next year, while a small new party run on a shoestring, such as Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party, gets only Y200m, says the former minister. If the troika of former prime ministers now in opposition manages to round up all 220 people who supported Mr Kaifu after he left the LDP to stand against Mr Murayama last month, it could qualify for as much as Y15bn of subsidy, he explains. That is a compelling reason for Shin-shinto to come into being. Money politics are as present as they were in the old days before political reform. At least the rules of the game, as it unfolds round the Hotel Okura swimming pool over the next few weeks, are official. The new funding system might, despite its imperfections, put pressure on Japan's politicians to move towards the simple two- or three-party system that the original reformists had in mind.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       JAPAN'S POLITICAL TREE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNMENT: conservatives, for economic growth, deregulation and low-profile foreign policy.  Liberal Democratic Party (206), composed of 50 or so old guardcaring conservatives; and a minority who might defect to the opposition.  New Harbinger Party (21), a former LDP splinter group.  Social Democratic Party (74), the mainstream of which has given up abandoned most of its many left-wing policies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OPPOSITION: reformists - support deregulation, an overhaul of the tax system and a higher profile foreign policy.  Troika comprises Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal Party (62); Toshiki Kaifu (22) an LDP defector; Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party (33). All three lead groups of reform-minded former LDP politicians.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTSIDE THE TROIKA:  Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party (52), latterly close to Mr Hata's JRP but which has doubts over working with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who is Hata's mentor; and the Democratic Socialist Party (19) which is wavering for the same reason  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE REST:  independents and vacancies (7), plus the Japan Communist party (15), which has been untouched by the past year's upheavals. Figures in brackets denote number of seats in the 511-seat lower house of parliament  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

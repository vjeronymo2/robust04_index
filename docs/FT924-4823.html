			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Lamont faces payment probe: Spending watchdog to investigate Pounds 4,700 government contribution AN INVESTIGATION into a Pounds 4,700 government payment towards Mr Norman Lamont's personal legal costs was launched by the National Audit Office last night as the weekend disclosure of the contribution sparked a political row at Westminster. Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, told the public accounts committee of MPs he would conduct a close examination of the affair for 'his own satisfaction and concern'. Sir John heads the National Audit Office, the independent watchdog responsible for monitoring government expenditure. He indicated that he would report back to MPs in 'two or three weeks time' after studying the relevant papers. His decision came after the chancellor had sought to defuse the row - arising out of his eviction last year of a self-styled 'sex therapist' who had rented his London home - by publishing Treasury documents supporting his decision to accept the money. The documents showed that the payment had been made with the full approval of senior civil servants. But they were dismissed as irrelevant by opposition parties which demanded a House of Commons statement from the chancellor. Conservative MPs voiced fears that the controversy had further dented the chancellor's reputation by putting a question mark against his political judgment. Ministers said there was no question of Mr Lamont being forced to resign. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, dismissed the controversy as 'silly'. But in private, senior Conservatives acknowledged Mr Major was under pressure to move Mr Lamont from the Treasury in a new year cabinet reshuffle. Mr Lamont responded to the opposition attacks by publishing a minute prepared by the then permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Peter Middleton, setting out the case for a public contribution towards his legal costs. The document said it would have been 'unreasonable' for Mr Lamont to bear all the legal expense because much of it was due to his position as chancellor and the corresponding need to take immediate action. It showed that Sir Peter had suggested that the Treasury might defray more of the expenses than Mr Lamont accepted. The rest of the Pounds 23,000 legal bill was met by anonymous Conservative benefactors. In a letter to Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, Mr Lamont said the documents fully supported his statements that the payment had been legitimate. He also published extracts from the guidelines for Whitehall civil servants which allow for ministers to be indemnified from public funds in some legal actions. Mr Brown said there was no precedent for a minister accepting taxpayers' money to meet a private legal bill which was unrelated to his public duties. Whitehall officials, however, were confident that Sir John's inquiry would show that Mr Lamont and senior Treasury civil servants had acted entirely properly.

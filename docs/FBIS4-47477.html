			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G.A. Vesnicheva and A.Yu. Ivanov, St. Peterburg </F> Institute of Aviation Instrument Engineering; 07;02]    [Abstract] Considering that stable radiation emission by a  liquid laser requires a sufficiently large number of molecules  in the active medium, a uniform distribution of the liquid over  the emission zone, and a precisely aligned high-Q dispersive  optical cavity, these conditions are applied to dye lasers  featuring the best performance characteristics of all: not only  wavelength-tunability over the 0.26-1.3 m range and up to 10  kW power emission pulse but also compactness and cost  effectiveness. When dye and solvent are being thoroughly mixed  while being pumped by pulse trains of optical radiation,  however, both hydrodynamic and photothermodynamic turbulence  with attendant heat-induced convection of the solution will  inevitably develop as the dye flow rate and the pump radiation  intensity exceed the respective critical ones. The result will  be randomization of the emission process with attendant lowering  of both pump and laser efficiency. In search of a way to avoid  this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are  analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance. As  the main limiting factors are regarded not only both turbulence  modes and thermal convection but also photodecay of dye  molecules upon incidence of a pumping radiation pulse, their  subsequent restoration, and the stroboscopic effect. As the  optimum construction of the active element is selected a  cylindrical cell with dye solution and a cylindrical mixing  device inside. Thus are established the conditions under which a  ``window'' will exist in the dependence of emission irregularity  on the dye flow characteristics and the pump radiation  characteristics within which the emission process is least  disordered, allowing a dye flow rate sufficiently high for  stable replacement of dye molecules during the interval between  pump radiation pulses. The relations established in this  analysis indicate the feasibility of a laser with dye molecules  in different instantaneous states and thus of wavelength tuning  without a resonator. A rhodamine-6G laser pumped by a neodymium  laser with second-harmonic 10 kW radiation pulses of 10 ns  duration was designed and built. Tests revealed no turbulence  throughout the 1.2x10[.sup]-7[/]-1333 l/s range of dye flow  through the emission zone. References 8.</p>

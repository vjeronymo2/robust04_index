			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: FCL to merge Canadian pulp, paper units FLETCHER Challenge, the international forest products, energy and construction group based in New Zealand, is merging its two Canadian pulp and paper units in a deal which is valued at nearly CDollars 900m (USDollars 750m). The result will be a net CDollars 177m cash transfer from the enlarged Canadian company to the parent in New Zealand. FCL will continue to hold 72 per cent of the enlarged Fletcher Challenge Canada, which will have annual sales of more than CDollars 1.5bn and rank among the top four Canadian integrated forest products companies. Total capacity will be about 1.4m tonnes of newsprint and coated papers and 400,000 tonnes of pulp annually. The timber side is profitable now, but the pulp and paper operations continue near break-even pending recovery in North American market prices. FCC officials in Vancouver said that the merged company would have sales potential of far more than CDollars 2bn a year once North American prices returned to normal. The new company will include a new quoted paper mill in the US. The merger is proposed in three steps and will be put before FCC shareholders in January. FCC buys the assets of Crown Forest Industries, a Vancouver Island pulp and paper and timber producer from the New Zealand parent for CDollars 897m. FCC has been managing Crown Forest for the parent on a fee basis since 1988. FCC makes a public equity issue to raise about CDollars 177m to be paid to the parent in part satisfaction of the purchase price for Crown Forest. FCL will finance the balance of the purchase price partly by taking up FCC equity to maintain its interest at 72 per cent. Mr Raymond Kilroy, pulp and paper analyst with Nesbitt Thomson, Toronto, said that the terms were reasonable and they were in line with industry values. The enlarged FCC will have a favourable debt-equity ratio of 30-70. 'The mills are in excellent shape and both companies have already shed non profitable assets. 'The new FCC will be ready for the upturn in 1993-4,' he said.</p>

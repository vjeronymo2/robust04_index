			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: STATE ASSEMBLY;  </P> <P> PRINGLE APPROPRIATES SOME OF UMBERG'S ENDORSEMENTS  </P> <P> A mailer sent to voters this week by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove)  claims endorsements from at least four law enforcement groups that have  actually pledged their support to his opponent, Democrat Tom Umberg.  </P> <P> Pringle said the mistake was inadvertent. An umbrella organization that  represents about two dozen police groups endorsed Pringle and told him in a  letter: "Feel free to use our name and affiliate list."  </P> <P> He did, but several of the affiliates had already endorsed Umberg on their own.  </P> <P> Umberg was unsympathetic.  </P> <P> "I know Curt is having problems getting law enforcement groups to support his  reelection," he said. "I guess he just got desperate."  </P> <P> Umberg's campaign manager, George Urch, said: "If I was Pringle, I would have  been more cautious. We've been working very hard on this. He's trying to create  the impression that he's got a lot of law enforcement support, which he does  not."  </P> <P> Pringle said that he was only following the instructions of the California  Union of Safety Employees (CAUSE), the umbrella group that endorsed him. He  said he will not include the disputed endorsements in future mailers.  </P> <P> "When a group endorses me and tells me to use their name, I will use it," he  said. "And if I'm told there's an error, then I'll correct it."  </P> <P> Pringle said he learned of the error in letters he received Monday from three  of the police groups. Two had endorsed Umberg and one had not endorsed anyone,  but Pringle had used their names in a mailer a few weeks ago. Pringle said,  however, that it was too late to correct the mailer that some voters received  on Thursday.  </P> <P> Umberg said that at least nine law enforcement endorsements claimed by Pringle  are erroneous.  </P> <P> Eight are members of CAUSE, and four of them have endorsed Umberg. Umberg said  the other four have not endorsed anyone. Representatives from some of the  organizations were unavailable Friday.  </P> <P> The ninth group, the Latino Peace Officers Assn., has apparently split into two  factions with the same name, and the splinter groups have chosen opposite sides  in the race.  </P> <P> The groups in Pringle's mailer that have actually endorsed Umberg are the  California State Police Assn., the Hospital Police Assn. of California, the  State Park Peace Officers Assn. of California, and the California Fish and Game  Wardens Protective Assn.  </P> <P> Richard A. Holland, president of the Hospital Police Assn., complained Friday  that CAUSE directors knew some of their affiliates had endorsed Umberg and  should not have told Pringle he could use their names.  </P> <P> "CAUSE doesn't have too much integrity," he said. "They have no right to say  'Feel free to use the affiliates' names.' "  </P> <P> Cecil E. Riley, president of CAUSE, and other officers of the group were  unavailable for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Crime is the major issue for voters in Pringle's 72nd Assembly District, which  includes Stanton and parts of Santa Ana, Westminster, Garden Grove and Anaheim,  so police endorsements are a key factor in both campaigns.  </P></p>

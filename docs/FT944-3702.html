			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Referendum required Mr John Major no longer rules out a referendum on a single European currency. This is clearly a change from his previous hostility on principle to 'referendums in a parliamentary democracy'. He still wants to 'consider the constitutional implications for British democracy of referendums generally', but now sees advantages as well as disadvantages. Inevitably these remarks have been greeted with cynicism by Mr Major's opponents, as evidence of a classic deathbed conversion. And Mr Major would not have altered his thinking on this point if he were still in full control of his party and backed by a solid parliamentary majority. Agreement to differ about Europe, leaving the most divisive issue to be settled by popular vote at a later date, may be the only way the Conservatives can reunite and hold together from now until the next election. That would perhaps be a good enough reason for Mr Major to change his mind. It would not in itself make a referendum a good idea. Indeed, there is no guarantee that it would have the desired effect. The single currency is not the only European issue which divides the Conservatives; and feelings against Mr Major are now running so high that his continued leadership may in itself have become an unsurmountable obstacle to party unity. Profound importance There is, however, a much better reason for holding out the promise of a referendum, which is the same reason that induced Mr Major, quite rightly, to promise a referendum in Northern Ireland on any change in its constitutional status. The issue is one of confidence between rulers and ruled in the short term, and one of the legitimacy of political institutions in the long term. Britain's relationship to the European Union is not a problem for the Conservatives alone. Indeed, Conservative MPs would not be tearing their party apart over it if they did not sense that it is an issue of profound importance to the country as a whole. It may not evoke such an immediate popular response as the poll tax. But many British people remain unconvinced that the country has benefited from its 20-year membership of the European Community, and many more are aware that a single currency, along with some other changes currently canvassed on the continent, would transform the nature of the Union and mark a further very significant pooling of state sovereignty. That does not mean there is a settled majority opposed to such changes. Indeed, if a moment comes when the government of the day is convinced that Britain's main partners will go ahead with a new stage of European integration and that Britain's national interest is to be involved rather than to stand aside, it should be able to impart that conviction to a majority of the British people, and would probably be helped in doing so by the leaders of the other political parties. Political expediency But constitutional change of this magnitude will lack legitimacy without the 'full-hearted consent of parliament and people', as Sir Edward Heath recognised when he led the country into the EC in the early 1970s. He did not hold a referendum then, but it proved necessary to hold one retroactively in 1975. That too was in part a matter of political expediency for the party then in power, but it also served to legitimise the decision taken by a previous parliament, and effectively ended the argument about British membership of the Community as it then existed. The UK is indeed a parliamentary democracy, but parliament has difficulty in delivering the consent of the people on European issues in a convincing way, because Europe cuts so sharply across the party lines on which general elections are held. One can imagine - though without relish - a massive restructuring of British politics, with attitudes for and against European integration replacing 'left' and 'right' as the permanent defining issue of party loyalties. Short of that, a device other than a general election has to be found to enable the electorate to give its verdict, and that can only be a referendum. That does not mean holding a referendum on every decision affecting the EU; only on a decision which radically alters the constitutional status of the UK. Monetary union would be such a decision. A federal constitution for Europe would be another, if such were to be the outcome of the 1996 intergovernmental conference - which at present seems far from likely. The Maastricht treaty as passed last year, without a final commitment to monetary union, was a borderline case. It would be wrong to reopen that issue now, but ministers must be aware that the less-than-full-hearted consent they obtained for the treaty has tainted the legitimacy of the Union to which it gave birth. The British public have become suspicious that a federal Europe is being imposed on them by stealth, much as the majority in Northern Ireland fear that Irish unity is being constructed behind their backs. The solution, in the one case as in the other, lies in assuring them that no fundamental change will be made without their consent being explicitly sought and obtained.</p>

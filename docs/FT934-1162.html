			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Liable to a flood of litigation - Changes to Japan's commercial code that facilitate shareholders' actions against directors Recent changes to the Japanese commercial code making it easier for shareholders to take legal action on behalf of a company against its directors and officers and a spate of such 'derivative actions' arising out of the 1991 Japanese securities houses scandal have raised fears among Japanese companies of a flood of litigation. Although derivative actions were introduced in Japan in 1950 they have seldom been used. The stamp duty payable to initiate litigation was very high and, if the shareholder won, only the company benefited. Also, the cost of being involved in litigation, which could last for more than 10 years, was prohibitive. Notwithstanding these difficulties, there have been some notable cases. In September directors of Mitsui Mining were ordered to pay Y3.5bn (Pounds 21.4m) to the company by the Japanese supreme court for their part in an illegal purchase of its own shares in 1978. The company had been sued by a shareholder over a loss it made by purchasing shares from a big shareholder who had objected to its plans to merge with another mining company. Mitsui had paid a price 25-30 per cent higher than the market price and assigned them to its own subsidiary companies for a price below the market price. Another case, still pending before the supreme court, involves the restructuring of Janome, a sewing machine manufacturer. Two shareholders accuse the main bank involved in the restructuring of ensuring its own interests as a creditor at the company's expense through directors seconded from the bank. And there have been a number of derivative actions arising out of the 1991 securities scandal in which Japan's big four securities houses secretly paid compensation to favoured clients for trading losses. In a case involving compensation of loss paid by Nomura Securities to favoured customers, the district court of Kyoto rejected shareholders' claims that directors had not acted in good faith and had not exercised care as good managers. The court said directors would not be liable unless there had been a careless error in their perception of facts or the decision-making process was excessively irrational. It could be 10 years before this case is finally decided. Amendments to the commercial code, which came into force in October, should make it easier to bring derivative actions. The main change concerns the amount of stamp duty payable to initiate an action. Stamp duty is calculated on the the size of the claim. Last year a shareholder of Nikko Securities initiated a derivative action over compensation paid to favoured customers. The contested amount was Y47bn and the stamp duty Y235m, or 0.5 per cent. The shareholder argued, however that the stamp duty should be calculated on a different basis. The claim was not a proprietary one because, if he won, the contested amount would be paid to the company and not to him. The Japanese law on the costs of civil litigation provides that for non-proprietary claims the contested amount is deemed to be Y950,000. The district court rejected his argument but the Tokyo appellate court accepted it. The latest amendment to the commercial code expressly provides that derivative actions will be treated as non-proprietary and the stamp duty will be set at Y8,500, so making it much easier for shareholders to bring claims. This change has long been opposed by companies which feared increased liability and a flood of actions against directors. The change eventually came out of the Structural Impediments Initiative trade talks between Japan and the US. The Americans argued shareholders' rights were not properly protected in Japan and that Japanese management was almost free from control by shareholders. Japanese companies are, indeed, relatively free from shareholder control. A majority of shares are held by stable corporate shareholders which tend not to complain about the performance of a company because of Japan's system of mutual shareholding. The standard of care required of directors was also rather low compared to the US. In recent years, some foreign investors, especially institutional investors, have been horrified to find after buying Japanese shares how little control they have over management. Most of the changes to the commercial code are part of the effort to meet their concerns. It is now, for example, mandatory for big companies to have at least one external auditor, the equivalent of the English non-executive director. Sumitomo Corporation has recently appointed a former prosecutor general as its external auditor. Companies are nervous of the changes to the code, particularly the steps taken to make it easier to bring derivative actions. They fear shareholders may initiate actions just to embarrass the company or for the purpose of extortion. They worry that directors may become more timid in making decisions. The code has a potential safeguard against frivolous or vexatious actions, empowering the courts to order the plaintiff to place a deposit if the defendant requests one. Others believe that, because derivative actions are time-consuming and do not bring any direct financial benefit to the plaintiff, their number will not increase dramatically. Yet many companies are investigating whether they can insure their directors against derivative actions. The author is Sir Ernest Satow Professor of Japanese Law, University College London.</p>

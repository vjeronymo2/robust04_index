			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] This week, the Malian Government and Tuareg rebels  from the Azaouad Movement have signed an agreement in Algiers.  Under the terms of the agreement, the former Tuareg rebels will  be integrated into the Malian Army and civil service. But  today, two different organizations who have an interest have  given their reaction to the agreement, one is (Ganda Koi), an  organization representing Africans who have had their own  problems with Tuaregs in northern Mali. The other is the Malian  Trade Union Movement, and it seems that neither of them are  happy. From Bamako, Moussa Fofana telexed this report:    In an appeal published in a daily newspaper today, the  (Ganda  Koi) movement urged Malians to fight against the Tuareg rebels.  It said that the country was in danger, and said it would fight  until the eradication of rapists, murderers, and looters -- who  are known as rebels. The movement, however, said that it would  not attack the Malian Army, peaceful civilians, and foreigners.  (Ganda Koi) is a movement composed of members of the black  ethnic group Songhai, who live in the north of the country in  the Tuareg areas. The words (Ganda Koi) mean: masters of the  land.    Meanwhile today, the powerful grouping of Malian trade  unions, the UNTM, issued a communique reacting to the  government's decision to integrate Tuaregs into the Army and  civil service. The unions say that ethnicity should not be the  basis for employment in the civil service. The secretary  general of the UNTM, Mr. (Issa Doukoure), told me that the trade  unions could use strike action and other forms of civil  disobedience in order to force the government to back down. He  said that the unions would never accept the allocation of civil  service positions to people who did not possess the necessary  skills to carry out their jobs properly.</p>

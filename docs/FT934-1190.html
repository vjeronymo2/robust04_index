			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Openness on lottery bids allowed Applicants for the licence to run the UK's multi-billion-pound National Lottery will be able to make as much information about their bids public as they wish. The move to potentially greater openness represents a change of heart by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery. Last month's draft rules set out rigid conditions of confidentiality for all applicants. The draft documents said they would 'be required formally to agree' that neither they nor the director-general would be allowed to publish anything but the names and addresses of applicants without the approval of the other. Mr Davis originally said he thought that both press and public risked being 'confused' by the release of incomplete information. He has changed his mind after considering a number of submissions arguing for greater openness. Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin Group chairman bidding on the understanding that all profits will go to a charitable foundation, said there was a duty to publish details of a bid and its strengths. It is believed that when the licence conditions are published today they will give the freedom Mr Branson and others asked for. At least eight groups have said they will apply, or are seriously considering applying. Meanwhile, Mr Des Wilson of Mr Branson's UK Lottery Foundation declined to give details of how the group planned to raise the multi-million finance it would need without an equity base. He said only that talks with a bank were nearing completion</p>

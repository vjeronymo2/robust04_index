			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikalay Halko: "Henadz Karpenka Has an Answer to </F> Any Question"]    [Text] On 19 April at the House of Publishing, People's  Deputy Henadz Dzmitryyevich Karpenka, [leader of the Party of  People's Accord] one of the candidates for the presidential  office, held a news conference with journalists.    The first issue he considered necessary to emphasize was  that  he will not fight with his opponents by collecting compromising  materials against them. Henadz Dzmitryyevich briefed on his  meetings with company staffs in Brest and Kobryn. Even though  high officials were trying to obstruct these meetings -- since,  according to Karpenka, they had been requested to support [Prime  Minister Vyacheslaw] Kebich, the talks were constructive. In  general, Karpenka believes, the interests of the working class  remain undefended.    Which problems does Karpenka consider most urgent? The first  most painful problem is the lack of housing (the candidate has  his own proposals in this regard); second -- stabilization of  enterprises' work; third -- reasonable reorganization of the  taxation system.    When the conversation touched upon the ruble zone and the  agreement signed in Moscow, Henadz Dzmitryyevich quite sharply  criticized eulogies published in the press in this regard, since  such a campaign has only one goal -- to support Kebich.  Karpenka said that the document should have been signed three  years ago. At that time however, Vyacheslaw Frantsavich had a  different opinion and wanted to create a "financial zoo"  [relates to nicknames of the Belarusian currency] in Belarus.  He has currently renounced this idea. It was not the first  time Karpenka publicly stated that the Cabinet of Ministers is  stuck in a political mire and neglects economic issues, which is  the reason behind the current economic collapse. The Cabinet of  Ministers has wasted three years on blabbing and now it is  describing the signing of the Moscow agreement as an astonishing  achievement.    Continuing to answer the questions concerning the ruble  zone,  Henadz Dzmitryyevich voiced concern over the fact that the  methods of establishing the zone do not conform to Belarus'  interests, but are dictated by Russia's powerful economic  organizations. However, as Karpenka believes, in two or three  months, everyone will see that we have received another "useless  scrap of paper," as has already happened before. The people  have heard many sweet promises of Kebich. Where are those  promises now?    The presidential candidate provided examples of Minsk Oblast  officials who have been neglecting agricultural problems,  conducting a smear campaign against the Molodechno City Council  chairman instead, which vividly describes the rotten  administrative system and its immorality.    Karpenka also presented his opinion on the agricultural  sector. Perhaps Vasil Staravoytaw, the well known chairman of  the Rassvet kolkhoz, whom Karpenka highly respects, has  something to do with that. His agrarian program envisions a  unique approach and advocates support for large and medium-sized  kolkhozes; small ones can be transformed into farms.    It is impossible to relate all topics addressed at the news  conference. Karpenka provided comprehensive answers to all  questions, including those concerning his family. His  adversaries used to claim that he is the son-in-law of this or  that secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central  Committee. As a matter of fact, Karpenka's father-in-law has  nothing to do with the KPB Central Committee.    Unfortunately, attempts to drag someone through the mire  have  not disappeared, but have become even more frequent. Karpenka  won journalists' sympathy thanks to his openness, erudition, and  ability to deeply analyze the state of affairs.</p>

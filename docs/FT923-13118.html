			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Harmonious voices soar above dissent: At the Democratic convention, Jurek Martin finds Bush-bashing to the fore THE FIRST night of an American political convention is the overture to the work of the week, and the Democrats certainly sang it in harmony on Monday. But not everybody belted it out with the same raucous vigour. Take the lead tenor from New Jersey. There was a time when Bill Bradley could hold an audience in Madison Square Garden in the palm of his hand on any given evening. That stopped 15 years ago. 'Bradley back in the Garden' - to quote the buttons on every New Jersey delegate in sight - was not wearing basketball sneakers and a number 24 shirt, but the dark suit and tie of a professional politician increasingly regarded as the Democratic party's thoughtful conscience and, albeit less widely, as its best presidential candidate - not this year but before too long. Senator Bradley's keynote address on Monday night showed him at his least, and most, impressive. On the down side, one conclusion is safe. Rumour has it that he has spent almost as many hours practising his public speaking as he did his jump shot. If so, it was to much less effect. The Garden did not hang on his every word, not in comparison to his fellow-keynote speakers. Governor Zell Miller of Georgia, for example, had them rocking in the aisles with his full-frontal assault on the Republican opposition. Yet even he paled into insignificance when the final act. Barbara Jordan, black and now confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, delivered a soaring, cadenced civics lecture, in its way as memorable as the address she gave in the same arena to the 1976 convention when a congresswoman from Texas. As a formal speaker, Mr Bradley still lacks the necessary attributes of timing and delivery. He swallows his good lines and talks on when his audience is applauding. There are other considerations. First, one speech does not necessarily a political summer or winter make. Mr Mario Cuomo gave a great one to the 1984 convention and is still only governor of New York; Governor Bill Clinton delivered a terrible one to the 1988 convention and is about to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Second, there was, as ever, substance to the Bradley speech. The theme - facing up to collective responsibilities rather than indulging in 'individual thrills' - is not new for him, but he is developing it all the time. It is one that is not easily reduced to slogans. 'What we face is a crisis of meaning,' he said in one of his pithier passages. 'Without meaning, there can be no hope; without hope there can be no struggle, and without struggle there can be no personal betterment. Individualism degenerates into greed without agreement on its limits. The microchip may be faster than the human brain but it isn't connected to a heart. A new drug might defeat a disease but it won't eradicate hatred.' Or, again on a more hopeful note: 'It is sometimes said Americans lack a sense of tragic life. It would be more correct to say that Americans are not content to let tragedy have the last word. The United States is history's greatest experiment in the elimination of despair.' This is the sort of reflective philosophy that political conhear. Add to them Barbara Jordan's reflections - the need for equality of sacrifice, including social entitlement programmes, the impermissibility of racism, be it black or white, and the imperative of valuing reason over emotion in assessing character - and it cannot be said that the Democrats were sent home to bed with nothing to think about. The vague sense of dislocation is that this was not the intended dual theme of the first night. One part of this was to be a lot of Bush-bashing, to which Mr Bradley ponderously contributed. Perot-pulverising, however, was much less in the score, though there was some of it from Governor Miller. The Democrats have worked out that the Bush-Perot conflict helps them. The other element was to demonstrate that this is no longer a party of pot-smoking, draft-dodging subversives - not in living memory have its delegates been presented with such an orgy of flag-waving patriotism, derived from Republican choreography. Emotions were wound up not, as in days of yore, by the haunting and socially-conscious songs of Woody Guthrie (This Land is Your Land) and by gospel choirs, but by a succession of marching and big bands straight out of high school and Las Vegas floor shows. This was designed as a celebration of America, marred only by the fact that a whole line of white tubas was clearly emblazoned with the name of their Japanese manufacturer. Dissent was also dismissed with Republican efficiency. When 600-odd delegates began chanting 'let Jerry speak' on behalf of the former governor of California, the other Brown, Ron, the party chairman, moved briskly to other business. It will require an act of some magnanimity for the Californian to be permitted to address the convention. Mr Nelson Mandela, who is to speak tonight, was much easier to fit in at short notice. Hardly a word was heard from the podium that might embarrass the party nominee. Barbara Boxer, running for the Senate from California, got in a dig at the free trade agreement with Mexico, which Mr Clinton basically supports, and Mr David Dinkins, New York mayor, went further than Mr Clinton in demanding that US cities be rebuilt before those in Russia. But that was about it. Unless Mr Cuomo, who is to nominate Mr Clinton tonight, publicly urges him to come clean and raise taxes, as he did on television on Sunday, departure from the party line is not scripted. The delegates responded to this new direction. They cheered at every invocation of their national spirit and at every imprecation against the Republicans. The Idaho delegation leader epitomised the spirit of the night by declaring that he was from 'the state which knows how to spell potato' (which Vice-President Dan Quayle does not). In this mood, they might have expected something more rollicking from Bill Bradley. When he talked, so did they, among themselves, which is standard practice most of the time, but not necessarily in front of keynote speakers in prime televised time. It took a Jordanesque gift of oratory to make them listen. It was indeed a first night which, for all that its target was middle-America, was not without its subtle contradictions. Mr Clinton will have to square them when he speaks before the final curtain.</p>

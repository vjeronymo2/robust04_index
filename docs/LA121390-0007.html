			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Rose &amp; Crown British Pub, 647 Camino de Los Mares, San Clemente.  </P> <P> Open daily 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 240-2392. This is not a place for a quick  drink. If the Queen's English conversation doesn't make you want to linger, the  British brews and the salt and vinegar crisps will. A favorite pastime here is  darts. The pub's in a bit of an unlikely spot, so watch for the red  double-decker bus parked in the field next door. AMY McCURDY  </P></p>

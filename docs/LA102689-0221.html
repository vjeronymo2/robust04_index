			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NANCY TO JAPANESE: JUST SAY NO  </P> <P> Former First Lady Nancy Reagan today presented her "Just Say No" anti-drug  campaign to television viewers in relatively drug-free Japan.  </P> <P> In a live 25-minute interview, she talked about a problem that is incomparably  worse in the United States than in Japan.  </P> <P> Japanese police confiscated less than a ton of marijuana and stimulants in  1988, whereas U.S. authorities often confiscate many tons of marijuana in  single arrests.  </P> <P> Arrests in Japan for as little as a gram of cocaine and less than an ounce of  marijuana still make headlines in national papers.  </P> <P> While the Reagans were in the White House, despite Mrs. Reagan's efforts, drug  use in urban America grew from a problem to a crisis, former President Ronald  Reagan said in a televised interview.  </P> <P> The Reagans are visiting Japan for nine days as the guests of the Japanese  government and Fujisankei Communications Group, which is reportedly paying them  $2 million.  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Good week for small companies - At a glance Hoare Govett raised Pounds 28m for its investment trust linked to its smaller companies index, but only Pounds 500,000 of that came through the public offer, a sign that private investors are yet to be convinced that the small companies revival is due. Nevetheless, it was another good week for small company shares. The County index rose 0.3 per cent from 866.01 to 868.43 over the seven days to December 10; the Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) also jumped 0.3 per cent from 1122.54 to 1126.07 over the same period.</p>

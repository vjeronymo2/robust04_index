			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by Zenkichi Teruya, chairman of Kin Township </F> Assembly, and Tokujitsu Miyagi, mayor of Kadena, regarding 26  March incident in which a Cessna airplane from Kadena Air Base  made an emergency landing at Kin's Blue Beach]    [Text] [Teruya] I was shocked after first learning about  the incident. Although I do not have all the details, we were  lucky since it could have been worse, with one false move  turning the incident into a great tragedy. The incident  occurred because there are military bases on Okinawa. I feel  both deep regret and anger. It is hoped such accidents will not  occur in the future.    [Miyagi] I question whether there is room for an aeroclub on  Kadena Air Base, which is already overcrowded as it is. The  people of Kadena have been forced to endure unbearable  conditions, with most of their town being taken away and used as  a military base under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement. One  false move could have turned the incident into a major accident.  We will have the matter investigated, and depending on the  results we may demand the aeroclub be abolished.</p>

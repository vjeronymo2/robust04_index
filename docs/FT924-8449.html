			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Move to ease fears over coal contracts THE government will try to ease the uncertainty over British Coal's new coal contracts by stating whether it would be willing to see them concluded before the results of its energy policy review are known. The electricity industry is trying to pull together a five-year deal with British Coal. But several companies are unwilling to commit themselves to a deal while the review is in progress. Although British Coal is negotiating with the power generators, these need to secure long-term supply deals with the distribution companies in England and Wales before the whole package can be agreed. The government will make its view known in a Commons written answer from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in the next few days. Talks on the contracts must progress so that new terms can be in place by next April. But they must leave room to accommodate extra coal deliveries if this is the effect of the new policy, which will not become known until the new year. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, said yesterday that National Power was looking into the possibility of signing long-term deals with individual companies rather than waiting for an industry-wide agreement.</p>

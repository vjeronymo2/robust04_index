			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs keep peace verdict secret: Decision believed to be a notional 'yes' with conditions attached Bosnian Serbs, in a deft move that will exasperate international peace brokers, yesterday reached a verdict on a peace plan for the republic but resolved to keep it secret. The decision, contained in a sealed envelope which will be delivered to the five-nation 'contact group' on Bosnia in Geneva, was believed to amount to a notional 'yes' with up to six conditions attached. The contact group - made up of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - has told Bosnia's warring parties to expect an escalating series of punitive measures unless they agree to a plan which splits the republic 51-49 between the Moslems and Croats on one hand and Serbs on the other. Mr Miroslav Toholj, the Bosnian Serb Information Minister, emerged from a two-day debate in the Serb stronghold of Pale with the sealed message and said: 'The Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday and today has adopted a decision which is in this envelope and which will be submitted to the contact group.' Earlier Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, indicated that the assembly was likely to endorse a conditional approval. 'We have reached no decision but I hope we can accept it in some way.' The conditions were believed to include: guarantees that the Bosnian Serb state would have full independence from the Moslem-Croat federation and would enjoy the right to join up with Serbia proper; access to the Adriatic for the Serb entity; a new partition of Sarajevo. During their emotional, closed-door debate, Serb deputies are reported to have railed bitterly against a plan which they described as a international diktat. guaranteed lifting of sanctions on both Serbia and Montenegro; By voicing conditional approval, the Serbs appeared to be hoping to weaken the resolve of the contact group to impose punitive measures, and possibly divide the group down the middle. Russia, a traditional friend of the Serbs, will now be able to argue that its proteges are being relatively co-operative and should not be punished any further. Serb officials said that if the international community insisted on a straight yes or no, the existing peace plan would have to be put to a referendum which would almost certainly deliver a rejection. AP adds: The chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal for the Balkans said yesterday he expected indictments against suspects from the former Yugoslavia by the end of the year. Prosecutor Richard Goldstone of South Africa also told a news conference that he hoped the tribunal would be a first step in setting up an international court to prosecute crimes against humanity. The tribunal was set up in The Hague in February 1993 to investigate hundreds of alleged war crimes committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. It is the first of its kind since the 1945 Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. 'If this tribunal is effective, it must act quickly,' said Mr Goldstone. 'Already too much time has elapsed. I will consider myself to have failed if indictments are not brought before the end of the year.'</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: English wood, isn't it good? - Furniture THERE is something heartbreaking about works of art that exhibit a rare feeling for materials, are meticulously designed and superbly crafted, but which are, nonetheless, ugly. That fate is particularly cruel for much of the furniture produced by John Makepeace, for Makepeace is not only a virtuoso craftsman but a visionary. He has made a significant contribution to perpetuating the arts and crafts tradition in Britain and to developing the neglected resources of native woodlands. In 1976, Makepeace bought Parnham, an idyllic but dilapidated Elizabethan manor house in Dorset. It gave him space in which to set up alongside his own well-established workshop a much-needed residential school for craftsmen in wood. The school's two-year courses provide practical instruction in craft and design skills and essential business management for those wishing to set up their own furniture workshops. Moreover, Parnham's restored interiors allowed him the opportunity of proving - as the Italians had already demonstrated - that the finest contemporary work could look well in a traditional setting. The Parnham Trust, the educational charity established to administer the school, embarked on a second pioneering venture in 1983, purchasing 350 acres of neglected woodland from the Forestry Commission at nearby Hooke Park. Hooke Park College, which is funded by private enterprise, took its first students three years ago. Here the aim is to develop techniques for the efficient use of indigenous, sustainable and renewable resources of timber in the production of anything from furniture and artefacts to buildings and bridges. It is training a new generation of entrepreneurs to turn principles into practice, and to regenerate the rural economy. The college building itself is a light and ingenious construction using forestry products which are normally wasted - notably roundwood thinnings which represent up to 50 per cent of a forest's annual crop. At present, 90 per cent of all wood products in this country are imported - to the tune of some Pounds 7bn a year. It is projected that over the next decade, 375,000 acres of under-exploited British forestry will become redundant. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the John Makepeace Workshop, and 15 years of The Parnham Trust and Parnham College. To celebrate, Sotheby's in London is playing host to an exhibition which is at once a retrospective of Makepeace commissions and prototypes, a showcase for both Parnham alumni and the class of '92, and an introduction to the work of Hooke Park. It is unfortunate that the first Makepeace exhibit we encounter is the recent 'Erudition' chair with raised book-rests at the end of each arm. Made out of yew-wood, burr elm and leather, it looks squat, heavy and decidedly not user-friendly. The second piece is the hefty 'Liberty' dining table with its oak-shaped leaves and supports like tree trunks, surrounded by a suite of ill-proportioned turned chairs. Almost everything else here reflects far more favourably on Makepeace's formal inventiveness and imaginative use - and treatment - of wood. Many items exult in the sheer beauty of their materials. There is the glorious slab of burr elm used for the dining table designed for the late Robert Bolt's medieval manor house. Burr oak and elm weathered like stone are employed for an altar-like serving and storage unit for a Cyprus house. We find oak ferrous-washed and polished with a lime wax to interesting effect, or overlapping oysters of mulberry, gilded beneath. There are arresting combinations too. The 'Mitre' chair, with its clean, sinuous Gothic-inspired lines, is a remarkable piece of 20th century design, and a technical tour-de-force of intractable macassar ebony. Its back and seat are made not of woven cane but of nickel silver. Another covetable but more rustic piece is a kitchen chair of pale, scrubbed oak with a seat of beaten and softly reflecting polished aluminium. The 30 exhibits are impressive witness to the exacting standards of the Makepeace workshop. It seems unlikely that such care, intelligence and attention to detail were ever lavished on the construction - rather than the decoration - of furniture before this century. Even the grandest of antiques cannot boast the degree of finish of, say, the 'Bangkok' collectors' cabinet combining satinwood, lacquer and velvet, its draws gliding open and close. On the evidence of work here, the school must be congratulated not only for maintaining high standards but for allowing students to speak with their own voices. The range of interests here is striking. Particularly pleasing are the form and textures of Paul Gower's shot-blasted Douglas fir and patinated copper chest, Suzanne Watson's cheery multi-coloured hatboxes - a must for quality freaks - at Pounds 78, and Robert Cullen's low table. Glass marbles are supported between the latter's waving bands of thin oak, which casts interesting shadows as well as providing a surface surprisingly flat enough to carry all but the smallest glasses. Ben Brooks similarly exploits the rippling lines of thin bent wood, and plays visual tricks with planes of American cherry in his sculptural 'Paradox' table. It seems that they all might have been boat builders. Petter Southall, formerly of Hooke Park College, certainly was. The fluid lines and thoughtful construction of his dining table and chairs place them among the most impressive exhibits in the show. Nine makers represent Parnham alumni. Their work ranges from the cutlery canteen in the form of Charterhouse Chapel, made for an old boy out of his own yew - price guide Pounds 20,000 - to wall-mounted coat hooks in anodysed aluminium at Pounds 34. Sotheby's, New Bond Street, W1, until July 28. Parnham House, Beaminster, Dorset, is open on Wednesdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays until October.</p>

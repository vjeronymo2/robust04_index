After arriving in Kronberg  this afternoon for the G-7 meeting, Shokhin stated: "We want to  take this opportunity to improve our relations with the  international financial organizations."    His delegation will first brief the G-7 representatives on  the economic and political changes in Russia. Russia's goal is  closer cooperation with the G-7 and the IMF. With its Bosnia  initiative, Russia showed a few days ago that it continues to be  a major power, Shokin pointed out. Russia must improve its  cooperation with the West, both in political and in economic  areas. Thus, the economics minister considers that expanding  the G-7 -- which now consists of the United States, Japan, Great  Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada -- to include Russia  is desirable for political and economic reasons.</p>

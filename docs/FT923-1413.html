			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate advances 7% to Pounds 13m DESPITE THE depressed property market, Brixton Estate, the investment and development company, turned in pre-tax profits ahead 7 per cent at Pounds 12.6m for the six months to June 30. The bulk of the company's revenue comes from letting its properties; rental income was up 9 per cent at Pounds 24.9m. 'The vacancy rate for the company's property portfolio remains at about 7 per cent, and in the City of London, which is probably the most difficult area, I am pleased to report that all of our buildings are fully occupied,' said Mr Harry Axton, chairman. Earnings per share were up to 5.64p (5.2p) and the interim dividend is increased to 3p (2.9p). Mr Axton plans to retire as chairman after next year's annual meeting. He is succeeded by Mr Douglas Gardner.</p>

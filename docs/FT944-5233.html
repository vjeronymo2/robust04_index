			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: Film/Video Just when you thought it was safe to pack the children off to the cinema to be engulfed by Disney revivals, here comes a wave of semi-radical sci-fi. After Frankenstein everyone in the movies is tinkering with life, birth and death. We kick off with the comedy variant. In Junior, scientist Arnold Schwarzenegger is made pregnant by fellow boffin Danny De Vito. Not, we hurriedly add, in anything like the traditional way. De Vito invents a drug which as side-effect can make men conceive. Whom better to try it on than his colleague, played by a man whose whole life has been spent making his body swell in strange places? Ivan Twins Reitman directs; Schwarzenegger gamely dons the stomach padding; and rave reviews precede the film from across the Atlantic. Children may be unscathed by Junior, but think twice before risking them on Cronos. This Mexican horror film is the grand guignol hit of the 1994 film festival season. A macabre gold bauble with mobile claws impales victims' flesh, thereby conferring immortality. Several strange characters chase it and each other around Mexico City, as the film turns into the year's wittiest, most sleekly shot essay in modern Gothic. Writer-director Guillermo Del Toro is already in Hollywood fielding movie offers. Add The Shadow, The Nightmare Before Christmas and the new gay ghost story To Die For - a British black comedy remaking Ghost with a boy-meets-boy/boy-loses-boy/boy-is-haunted-by-boy slant - and we wonder if we aren't in the afterglow of Halloween rather than the run-up to Christmas. You can always take a break from heavy-duty big screen fantasy. Leave your stocking out at night to be filled with videos and Santa Claus may deposit Naked In New York. A cast of ancient and modern luminaries - Kathleen Turner, Tony Curtis, Jill Clayburgh, Quentin Crisp - swap high-class banter in a tangy comedy of Manhattan manners. Or Santa may leave you The Last Seduction; the sly, dark tale of a woman crook (Linda Fiorentino) dabbling in sex, murder and film noir stylistics. As we said, the times may not be very Christmassy. But who says we adults don't need a festive break too from time to time?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the State Duma sitting on 13 April, Ivan Rybkin,  chairman of the parliament's lower chamber, read his statement  regarding the NATO air strikes against Serb positions near the  Bosnian town of Gorazde. Rybkin said that the State Duma was  not going to remain an indifferent observer. He demanded that  NATO should immediately stop its unsanctioned and unilateral use  of military force and called upon the parliaments of all  countries to actively participate in developing the process of  peaceful political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.    The speaker's statement was not enough for the State Duma's  deputies and they decided to discuss the issue at the plenary  meeting on 15 April. A relevant proposal was submitted by the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], PRES [Party of  Russian Unity and Accord], and Agrarian Party Duma groups.</p>

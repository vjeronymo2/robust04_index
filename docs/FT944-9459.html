			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): Worries over fraud - Computer security It is an article of faith that hackers and fraudsters never even think of attacking financial institutions. And were such an unlikely event to occur, they could not possibly succeed in penetrating the physical and electronic security that protects the cash and data assets of these respected bodies. This is the diplomatic line that all banks adhere to, even as they invest millions of pounds in security measures. The truth is that banks are seriously concerned about the rise of ingenious hackers and the growing awareness of computer fraud as a practical criminal tactic. Paul Rogers is marketing manager for self-service systems at AT&amp;T's UK computer arm - the company supplies 70 per cent of the Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in Britain. Mr Rogers agrees that most attacks on ATMs are physical assaults aimed at wrenching out the cash box, but that is no cause for complacency. 'Designing ATMs is a case of trying to keep one step in front and making an effort to prejudge what could possibly happen,' he says. Mr Rogers is determined to pre-empt the resourceful hacker. He notes that the latest generation of ATM is based around the industry standard OS/2 computer operating system. The core of this cash dispenser is no different from office personal computers that have sold by the million. This is a mark of the triumph of open systems and common standards, but it throws up an unpleasant possibility - because there are many people out there with an intimate understanding of the OS/2 platform. How can potential hackers be discouraged from turning this knowledge against AT&amp;T's clients? Mr Rogers' answer is to create a customised security shell around the central chip and its software - 'we give the customer an open system, but we protect that system from risk. Our Self Service System Software (S4) will not allow a thief to breach an ATM and then lay another program on to the system or download customer information that's stored on a remote host computer.' Fraud involving cash and credit cards remains a big problem, however. Frank Hickman is a principal consultant with Unisys, the computer systems company. He joined Unisys from consultants Touche Ross where he investigated the practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Put simply, AI is a field of technology that attempts to replicate the human brain through computer programmes. Despite many dubious claims by developers in the past, AI seems to have thrown up a useful product in the form of neural networks. 'Neural technology means a program can be shown many examples of a process and can then understand and discriminate within that data or process,' explains Mr Hickman. This search for a recognisable pattern has an instant attraction for banks. The speed of credit card transactions makes spotting a stolen or counterfeit card more difficult. Some institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland claim success in the battle against fraud by adding account holder photographs to bank cards. But check-out staff under pressure might neglect to check a signature properly so there is no guarantee that a photo will be any more likely to grab their attention. If a neural program can sit on the network and spot a break from the typical spending pattern of one consumer, then fraud can be intercepted. This solution means looking at the transaction itself - and that can only be done using clever software. Mr Hickman characterises the problem as 'M25 fraud - thieves zooming between superstores via the motorway system.' While banks have to protect themselves from the fraud that springs from common theft, they are also coming under increasing pressure to regulate the kind of funds flowing into accounts. International initiatives against drug trafficking and organised crime can have expensive consequences for financial institutions. The US Treasury now requires banks to ensure that a transaction is not destined for an account that has been blocked on grounds of criminal connections. The Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (Ofac) can impose a fine of Dollars 10,000 - Dollars 500,000 for each example of non-compliance. So the total fine for a series of infractions could run into millions of dollars. A bank may only be one stop in a chain of destinations that culminates in a bank account with a blacklisted country or individual. But if that bank is 'the first stop' the funds make in the US, then it is culpable. When Ofac issued its blacklist of embargoed accounts, 18 months ago, the US arm of the UK systems house Logica set about devising a solution for banks that could not monitor every transaction manually. Its response to the problem of inadvertent money-laundering is Hotscan, launched in September. This is a Dollars 25,000 program that automatically scans all payments and messages against a database of blocked accounts. Hotscan resides on a personal computer but is linked to the bank's own payments system. At the final stage of payments processing, Hotscan refers each transaction to the blacklist database. If it spots a match, Hotscan flags the transaction indicating that action is necessary. According to Philip Izzo, senior vice president for international funds transfer with Logica in Boston, Hotscan has already made its mark - 'the Bank of Nova Scotia in New York is the first Hotscan site to go live,' he says. 'In the first hour of operation, Hotscan caught out a payment going to a bad guy]' Mr Izzo reckons that Hotscan will soon be in action in Europe - 'we developed it with an eye to the future: we hear that money-laundering is a concern in the UK. US regulators have become more aggressive with the banking community, and there are suggestions of more mandatory controls in rest of the world.'</p>

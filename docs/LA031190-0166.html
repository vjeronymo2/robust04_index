			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLONE BREAKS MOLD, DEVELOPS A PERSONALITY  </P> <P> Gather around and listen, for there's good news this morning. Are you ready?  "Clonehood" is curable.  </P> <P> About two years ago, a restaurant called Sostanza opened on Wilshire with a  menu that resembled Prego's . . . a lot. It resembled it right down to the  typography.  </P> <P> Granted, the restaurant has never looked like Prego. A garish mural of a  Medieval Italian horse race covers one wall right up the unusually high  ceiling. That mural is cloned from one in a New York restaurant called Palio.  But, not long ago the kitchen got a new boss, a former sous-chef at Chianti  Cucina and Locanda Veneta, and the menu he's put together is distinctly new.  </P> <P> His style is a little hard to pinpoint. For instance, he makes mussels and  clams in white wine sauce flavored with garlic and saffron (frutti di mare en  guazzetto), nothing unusual except that this huge bowlful is an appetizer. He  uses imported prosciutto, pale pink and wonderfully delicate in flavor, but  it's for an appetizer of prosciutto with dates instead of melons, not at all a  bad idea.  </P> <P> My somewhat reluctant vote for the best appetizer is the polpettine misteriose:  turkey meatballs in a purplish-brown sauce of wine, meat juices and sweet onion  marmalade. It is not so much misterioso as capricious, but grows on you.  </P> <P> There's a short list of pizzas. They have crisp, thin crusts and standard  Westside toppings, the most exotic being rosemary and moderately thin slices of  potato on the cheese and tomato sauce base. The pasta list is long by  comparison, and the menu is organized to suggest that you have pasta as a  second course, between the appetizers and the meat course.  </P> <P> Having a meat course afterward is probably wise unless you distinctly plan to  eat light, because the pasta portions are semi-dainty. For instance, the  lobster-filled ravioli allo zafferano is in a particularly luscious saffron  cream sauce. Then there's the somewhat riskier choice of tortelloni agli  asparagi, in which the pasta is filled with ricotta but served in a sauce of  pureed asparagus and probably a little olive oil. It's more subtle than saffron  and cream, and it's lighter and fresher.  </P> <P> The steak is in the finest tradition of huge Italian steaks and probably the  best thing on the menu. It's an aged Porterhouse covered with red wine sauce  flavored with rosemary and black olives (California ripe ones, not any of the  more powerful Italian kinds). Actually, it's half-covered. The delicate filet  portion is thoughtfully left nude.  </P> <P> The next best thing is costolette svitate, a baby rack of lamb in peanut sauce.  This is not one of the flamboyant Southeast Asian peanut sauces, though, but a  classicizing and distinctly European one, mostly wine and meat juices with just  a hint of peanut flavoring.  </P> <P> By comparison the other meat entrees are nowhere near so flashy. The braised  lamb shanks (agnello alle manzane) are cooked well-done, soft enough to cut  with a spoon, but the sauce of eggplant chunks in a little tomato sauce is  somehow drab.  </P> <P> For dessert, there's a ricotta cheesecake of unparalleled creaminess that is  positively rich. A chocolate torte made with red wine tastes like a huge  chocolate truffle candy with a little winy bite to it. The mandarin orange tart  might have been made with fresh tangerines.  </P> <P> Good work, Sostanza. Go forth and clone no more.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: polpettine misteriose, $6.95; ravioli allo zafferano,  $10.50; bistecca del mangione, $17.95; costolette svitate, $17.95; ricotta  cheesecake, $5.  </P> <P> Sostanza, 12100 Wilshire Blvd., West Los Angeles, telephone (213) 207-4273.

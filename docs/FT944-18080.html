			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Gore or more? Mark Melcher, a political analyst at Prudential Securities in the US, cites a recent poll which asked women whether they would rather sleep with Bill Clinton or vice-president Al Gore; 70 per cent plumped for Gore. He had trouble believing that, so checked the wording of the question. In fact, the women were asked whether they would rather sleep with Al Gore or with Bill Clinton again.</p>

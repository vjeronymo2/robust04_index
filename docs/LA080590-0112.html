			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY PLANNING: PATTERN OF BLUNDERS;  </P> <P> UNSEEMLY ACTIONS, LAND-USE FUMBLES ARE DISTURBING  </P> <P> This is turning out to be a year when the public is learning some very  disturbing things about how business is done with and by the Orange County  Planning Commission.  </P> <P> We've heard about planners riding in the golf carts of developers, and seen the  district attorney investigate allegations that some commissioners had a hand in  a fund-raiser for a political candidate. There is the continuing saga of the  Laguna Niguel land transfer, a kind of summer mystery novel whose recent  chapters strongly suggest that it was county planners who dropped the ball.  </P> <P> All of this inevitably affects public perceptions, raising doubts about the  competence and fairness of the process for all. Just ask the new homeowners in  Laguna Niguel who now find that they have bought houses on 96 acres supposedly  set aside for open space.  </P> <P> Can others like them make real estate choices confidently when they know that  county commissioners are taking freebies from developers and have fumbled away  public land? The Laguna Niguel case adds questions of staff thoroughness to  those already raised about commissioners' cozy relations with developers.  </P> <P> The land transfer is not all the county's fault, of course. There are problems  at the local level that the district attorney is investigating. The  questionable stroke of the pen by James F. Krembas, formerly Laguna Niguel  Community Services District vice president and now Laguna Niguel councilman, is  inadequately explained by his statement that he believed it was part of another  transaction.  </P> <P> But it has also become apparent in the weeks since the scandal broke that  county planners fell down much earlier in their obligation to the public. This  failure unquestionably invited the current mess, with or without the  compounding error of Krembas.  </P> <P> The quality of communication between county planning staffers and county  planning commissioners on matters of vital interest to the public is a central  point in the Laguna Niguel fiasco, as far back as 1985. We now know, from the  curious explanations offered by key players, that Planning Commission staffers  recommended that the commission approve a revision proposed by Taylor Woodrow  Homes, without pointing out that the houses would be built on designated open  space, and without requiring a new environmental impact report.  </P> <P> The former manager of that staff work has offered the lame explanation that  because there were no rare or endangered species on the site, and because  traffic and the number of units were projected to be the same, there was no  need to raise the open-space question with commissioners.  </P> <P> But don't just blame the planning staff. It's the responsibility of approving  commissioners to anticipate problems that may be raised by staff reports on  previous agreements, such as the one that was in place for the Laguna Niguel  land. The public could have been spared all the trouble by a skeptical  commission that asked whether there were any problems with the land. But  commissioners appear to have waved the revision through.  </P> <P> This year's revelations raise important doubts about the approaches of Orange  County planners to land-use questions. Until the public is assured of better  communication between commission and staff, and until there is some sense that  commissioners keep their distance from developers, homeowners and those who  care for Orange County's environment are right to rest uneasily.  </P></p>

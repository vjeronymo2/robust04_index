			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Molyneaux praises Major Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday praised Mr John Major for 'avoiding every trap contained in the IRA so-called peace process'. He told UUP members at Banbridge, County Down, that he hoped delegates at next week's Conservative party conference would back the prime minister's 'determination to advance only when he judges it appropriate and safe to do so'.</p>

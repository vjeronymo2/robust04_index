The "Regulations (Trial Implementation) on Strengthening and  Improving Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots  Units" were laid down according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of army building in the new period and the relevant  guidelines laid down by the Central Military Commission and on  the basis of inheriting the fine tradition of our Army's  political and ideological education and of summing up our Army's  reform experience in political education. Opinions had been  widely solicited in the whole Army before the document was  issued to units at the lower levels.    The document put forward suggestions for improvement and  made  concrete stipulations on the guiding principles, the content of  education, the method of organization and implementation, the  system and form of education, and other issues related to  ideological and political education in the grass-roots units.  Compared with past practices, these regulations realize the  spirit of being essential and effective in the content of  education and set up, in a relatively stable manner, six  branches of study, specifically, the study of the basic party  line, the study of current affairs and policies, the study of  our Army's glorious tradition and patriotism, the study of the  revolutionary soldiers' outlook on life and values, the study of  legal knowledge, and the study of circumstances and combat  readiness, with each focusing on key points in a concise manner.  As far as the goals of education are concerned, attention is  paid to different categories of people at different levels; the  ideological education of cadres at the grass-roots level is  standardized; and different demands are set for new soldiers,  veterans, and volunteers. As far as the system and method of  education is are concerned, the emphasis is on doing well the  three links of preparatory educational meetings, preparing  lessons and giving lectures, and organizing class discussions.  Units are being asked to set up systems for an educational  week, for listening to and watching the news, for reading  newspapers and writing reports on current affairs and policies,  for taking attendance, for giving supplementary lessons and  evaluations, and for inspection and supervision. Moreover, nine  patterns and methods of education are summarized: classroom  education, individual education, random education, mass  self-education, ways to integrate army units with families and  society, ways to apply education to cultural life in the  barracks, the application of modernized education, ways to  publicize typical examples, and ways to create a good  educational environment.    The document stressed that every ideological and political  education activity in the grass-roots units must be close to  reality and must strive for practical results. In organizing  and conducting educational activities, it is necessary to be  familiar with the objects of education; to conduct ideological  and political education in military training and various  practical activities; to strengthen behavioral guidance so as to  cultivate, learn, and manifest decent behavior through  education; and to strive to display each unit's distinctive  features in light of its own characteristics so as to improve  the effect of education and to vigorously guard against  formalism.    The document made explicit demands on the task of  strengthening the administration of ideological and political  education in grass-roots units: First, when making arrangements  for educational activities, units at all levels must give full  consideration to grass-roots units' receptivity, take notice of  unforeseen circumstances, and refrain from increasing burdens at  each level; second, propaganda departments are in charge of  various educational activities; third, brigades and regiments  must coordinate the activities, ensuring that they are proceeded  in a normal and orderly manner and that the prescribed  educational tasks are fulfilled.    The document also urged various units to accomplish the work  of protecting the service of ideological and political education  in grass-roots units and to conscientiously strengthen the  building of the contingent of teachers and the construction of  teaching facilities.</p>

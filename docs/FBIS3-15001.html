Nursultan Nazarbayev Defended Russia During His  Recent Visit to America"]    [Text] Almaty -- At a news conference held in Almaty,  Nursultan Nazarbayev returned several times to the subject of  his personal attitude toward Kazakhstani-Russian ties. In his  opinion, relations between the two states are developing  normally at present, and no actions aimed at infringing Russian  interests were undertaken during his visit to the United States.    The president of Kazakhstan confirmed that during his U.S.  visit, many people asked about the situation in Russia. He  tried to convince his partners in the talks that they should  gamble not on the specific persons carrying out the economic  reforms in Russia but on the actual process of democratic and  economic transformations. He raised objections with those  interlocutors in America who called the Chernomyrdin government  conservative; according to Nazarbayev, he was able to  demonstrate why he disagreed by using as a basis his own  personal experience of relations with the Russian head of  government.    The president illumined in detail the problem connected with  the upcoming removal of the nuclear warheads of strategic  missiles from Kazakhstani territory.    Kazakhstan is claiming 10 percent of the estimated value of  all the uranium of the missiles which are on the territory of  four CIS states and which are subject to reduction.    On the whole, Nursultan Nazarbayev advocated lending  viability to the CIS states' economic union as quickly as  possible. He said that Russia remains Kazakhstan's priority  partner. At the same it must be taken into account that "it  takes two to tango," the president emphasized figuratively.  Therefore the desire for cooperation must be mutual.</p>

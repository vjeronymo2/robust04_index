			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Warning of 3.25m jobless THE NUMBER of people unemployed and claiming benefit will continue to rise until at least the spring of 1994, the independent Employment Institute has warned. By then, it says, almost 3.25m people will be unemployed compared with the current 2.8m. The institute, a research and consultancy body, analyses the chancellor's Autumn Statement in a report and says a clear flaw in the package was the failure to do more to help the unemployed, particularly those out of work for more than 12 months. It adds that the government's decision to offer more opportunities on job search programmes was welcome but not enough. It questions the funding of programmes for the adult unemployed - Employment Training, the main training scheme, and Employment Action, the work experience scheme, have been combined. The new scheme, to be called Training for Work, will have a budget of Pounds 936m in 1993-94 - Pounds 40m less than is being spent on ET and EA this year. Training places should have been expanded. 'This is the ideal time to re-skill the unemployed and help reduce the skill bottlenecks which fuel inflation and which will inevitably occur when the economy begins to grow more rapidly.' The institute says skill bottlenecks will be only one of the supply-side problems. It points out that although unemployment is rising the Department of Employment's budget will be a third lower in real terms in 1993 than in 1987-88, when unemployment was falling.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary by Jose Armas] </F>   [Text] A few days ago, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus said that if he is elected OAS Secretary General, he  will work hard to ensure that Cuba will again become an active  member of the regional organization. This is not the first time  statements on this topic have been made by politicians,  governments, or unity-seeking groups; however, the United States  has always used various excuses to reject the idea of Cuba  rejoining the organization. This time the rejection has been  expressed by Alexander Watson, assistant secretary for  Inter-American Affairs. When asked to comment on Bernd Niehaus'  statement, Mr. Watson said that it was premature to consider  Cuba's reinstatement in the OAS because, according to him, the  factors that determined Cuba's exclusion from the OAS in 1962  continue to prevail.    Let us stop here for a minute and add: At no time has Cuba  requested reinstatement as a member of the OAS. Our country's  position regarding this matter is as follows: If the regional  organization believes it would be useful and convenient for  Latin American unity, and should it request Cuba's reinstatement  in the organization, then our country would have no reason to  deny the request, despite the presence of the United States.  Second, those excluding factors Mr. Watson has mentioned are  none other than the socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and  Cuba's categorical refusal to assume the role of subordinate to  U.S. policy. Since this is what Mr. Watson is referring to, then  the factors continue to prevail. Third, Cuba, as a Latin  American and Caribbean country, has worked as hard as any other  country to ensure well-being and security for the peoples of the  continent. It has worked hard to ensure unity and integration of  the peoples of the continent, based on absolute respect for the  rights of sovereignty and self-determination.    We wish to remind Mr. Watson that: Cuba is willing to be a  part of a united and integrated Latin American and to sit down  and broach any issue. President Fidel Castro, at the First  Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991, said: The  important thing is to unite our wills and efforts to ensure not  only economic, but also political integration and unity.    There can be no greater commitment to a neighbor than this,  whether or not we are members of the OAS. Mr. Watson must not  forget this.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA, LAGUNA FREEWAYS LINK TO CLOSE  </P> <P> Caltrans' forecast for Monday traffic out on the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine:  Bad to worse, with apologies.  </P> <P> The northbound Santa Ana Freeway connector to the southbound Laguna Freeway in  Irvine will be permanently closed by Caltrans at 7 a.m. Monday for bridge work.  </P> <P> State Department of Transportation engineer Hillary McMahon said the closure is  necessary in order to widen the freeway from three regular, mixed-flow lanes at  that location to four such lanes plus a car-pool lane on the northbound side of  the freeway.  </P> <P> Caltrans has suggested using the Alton Parkway exit from the Santa Ana Freeway  and Sand Canyon Avenue to leave the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> "Caltrans regrets any inconvenience this might present," the agency said  Friday. But the work under way is intended to "increase efficiency and better  accommodate traffic volume."  </P></p>

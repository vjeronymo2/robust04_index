			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Management: Waxing lyrical on cholesterol - Health Check Anybody who is serious about health and fitness cannot afford to ignore cholesterol. No matter how religiously you exercise, your chances of having a heart attack may not change much unless you also find some way to regulate this waxy substance. There has been much research into the role of cholesterol in heart disease, but what is known for sure? Cholesterol is a family of waxy substances necessary to life. It is needed for the production of hormones and membranes; it is also important for fat digestion. Cholesterol is broken down into different types depending on its density: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - the so-called 'bad' cholesterol  - is thought to be responsible for waxy cholesterol deposits in the arteries. The lower the level of LDL, the better. This means bringing your weight under control and restricting your intake of saturated fats. In particular, go easy on red meat - beef, pork and lamb  - all cheeses, butter and lard. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) - the so-called 'good' cholesterol  - is charged with the delivery of cholesterol to the liver for processing and elimination. The more HDL, the better for the heart. In order to increase the level of HDL, stop smoking and take more exercise. Experts agree that knowing your total cholesterol level is not enough: to understand how your blood fats are affecting the condition of your heart, you must know the relationship between the total cholesterol level and your HDL. This is a measurement that your doctor should make routinely as part of a standard health check-up. According to the National Health Laboratories (USA), the range for this ratio is from under 3 for vegetarians (who eat very little animal fat) and marathon runners (who are thin and take a lot of exercise) to more than 23 for those with chronic, hyper-cholesterol problems. If you maintain your ratio at around 3.5, you will cut the risk of heart disease to half the average. The range for an typical male victim of heart attack is 5.5 to 6.1. Instead of embarking on a drastic nutritional plan, try first this practical strategy designed to achieve long-term success: The first step is to take stock. Count the number of meals that you eat every week that have saturated fats in them - including any butter, red meat, cheese, and the coconut or palm oil used in cereals, muesli and candy bars. If you find that 20 out of 21 meals contain saturated fats, eliminate the fat in only four (20 per cent). So now you are still enjoying some of the richer foods that are generally part of business life, while moving in the right direction. We are are going for the 'cure' here which allows you to decrease your fat intake, reducing a concentrated source of calories as well as slowing total cholesterol synthesis by the liver. You can accelerate the process of cholesterol control by consuming pectin fibre (found in apples and citrus fruits). Remember: 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'. Re-check your ratio after three months. By choosing a relatively modest 20 per cent decrease in 'fat meals' to start with, you leave yourself plenty of margin to manoeuvre in either direction once you re-check your ratio. The new ratio will give you an indication of how far you still have to go. Keep a graph the trend over time and follow it yourself, with your doctor's guidance. Lastly, do not attempt to try to obtain a total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein ratio of around 3.5 in several weeks: this will result in failure and a possible rebound in the ratio. Instead, dedicate the next six to 12 months to bringing your cholesterol under control and to doing your heart a favour. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</p>

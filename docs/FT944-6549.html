			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Williams cools down the fire: Acquisition 'slowdown' to follow Pounds 80m purchase of BBA hoses-and-foam unit Williams Holdings signalled a slowdown in its hectic acquisition campaign as it announced plans to purchase the fire protection arm of BBA Group, the automotive components company, for Pounds 80m, including assumed debt. The deal brings the total spent on acquisitions by the diversified industrial group to almost Pounds 250m in the past 12 months. Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, expected the pace of acquisitions to slow. 'We have got to digest these businesses first,' he said. Williams has bought four other businesses since December, some of which were funded by a Pounds 267m rights issue in April. Angus Fire, which makes hoses, foam and foam equipment for the fire industry, will propel Williams into the world number-one slot for fire hoses with 21 per cent of the Pounds 110m global market. Williams will also rank second after Monsanto of Italy in the manufacture of foam and foam equipment, with roughly 20 per cent of a market estimated at about Pounds 300m. Last year Williams' fire protection division returned operating profits of Pounds 48m on sales of Pounds 249m. Mr Rudd said there would be considerable industrial synergy and cost savings from merging Angus's operations with Silvani of Italy, the foam fire protection group acquired for Pounds 16.5m in October, and the company's Kidde subsidiary. He expected that within two to three years the business would be achieving a return on sales of about 15 per cent, against the 8 per cent. Williams is expected to incur costs of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m for reorganising Angus. For BBA, the disposal marks a step towards completing the restructuring launched last year. So far, the group has raised roughly half of the promised Pounds 200m in disposals. Mr Roberto Quarta, BBA chief executive, said of the Angus sale: 'It is a good fit for Williams and a good price for us.' BBA expected a profit on disposal this year of about Pounds 22m. Williams accompanied the announcement of the acquisition with a trading statement described by analysts as 'rather dull'. The company reiterated its comments at the interim stage that it expected to achieve its 1994 expectations. 'That's not enough for a stock trading on a 12 per cent premium to the market,' said one analyst. 'We are not getting indications that earnings momentum is accelerating. That probably killed the joy of the deal.' The shares closed flat at 348p. Angus reported operating profits of Pounds 7m, on sales of Pounds 76.1m for the year to the end of December. Net assets were Pounds 27.4m. Williams will pay Pounds 69.9m in cash and assume Pounds 10m in debt. The consideration will be subject to a net asset adjustment. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Rise in jobless subsidies proposed INCREASED subsidies for companies willing to take on long-term unemployed people and for the jobless individuals themselves have been proposed by Mr Frank Field, chairman of the Commons social services committee, and Professor Dennis Snower, professor of economics at Birkbeck College, London. Under the Workstart scheme, to be tested in four areas soon, companies will be given Pounds 60 a week in the first half year of employment and Pounds 30 in the second half. Mr Field and Prof Snower view this subsidy as insufficient. They suggest: Offering companies a voucher of Pounds 1.50 per week for each week beyond six months that an individual has been unemployed, up to a maximum of Pounds 150 per week. Offering individuals who had been jobless for at least four years and who find jobs paying at least Pounds 60 a week, a subsidy up to the level of their welfare benefits, provided that the employer is able to show that the job amounts to a net increase in the size of the workforce.</p>

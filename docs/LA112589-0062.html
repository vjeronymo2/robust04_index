			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FACES: PLAUSIBLE POLITICAL PLOT  </P> <P> When Tom Skerritt was approached to play the lead in HBO's "Red King, White  Knight," he was intrigued "because the script smacked of newsworthiness."  </P> <P> That assessment of the glasnost-era spy thriller proved increasingly true,  Skerritt notes, as the project moved through production in politically-tense  Hungary last spring and toward its debut date tonight. With the destabilizing  Eastern Bloc as a background, "Red King" centers on a hypothetical plot to  assassinate Mikhail Gorbachev by anti-reformists -- a concept, Skerritt says,  that the film team thought of as all-too-plausible.  </P> <P> "We talked about that, but not with any great concern about giving anyone  ideas, because it's already within the realm of possibility anyway," says the  actor.  </P> <P> Skerritt says with a laugh that he did no research for his role as a burned-out  ex-CIA man destined to meet his ex-KGB adversary (Max von Sydow).  </P> <P> "I don't do any of that kind of stuff," says the veteran actor, whose  rough-hewn features have long been familiar to the public via such films as  "MASH," "The Turning Point," "Alien" and "Top Gun" in addition to numerous TV  roles.  </P> <P> A type-B presence in a type-A profession, the Detroit native frequently comes  up with such statements as "There's no big secret to movie acting" and "When  I'm not working, I really don't think about the business." He prefers to stay  out of Hollywood, in the quiet surroundings of the Seattle home he shares with  his wife, Susan, and their 11-year-old foster son.  </P> <P> Skerritt's easygoing attitude extends to his other current role as Sally  Field's husband in "Steel Magnolias." Working with five leading ladies  successfully is just a matter of "knowing when to keep your mouth shut," he  says with a soft chuckle.  </P> <P> Just what does that mean?  </P> <P> "Oh, well, I was the man, you know," he replies. "They tried to include me, but  they had a lot to say to each other."  </P> <P> * TV REVIEW: F13 STACY JENEL SMITH  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Wall Street expects bidding war on Paramount SHARES in Paramount Communications soared yesterday as Wall Street anticipated a bidding war for the entertainment group. This followed a Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.2bn) hostile offer launched on Monday night by QVC Network, the home shopping television company headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry executive. Paramount's shares closed at Dollars 77, up Dollars 7 3/8. QVC's bid topped an agreed bid for Paramount launched on September 12 by Viacom, a cable television service and programming company best known for its MTV pop music channel. Wall Street analysts expected Viacom to improve its offer substantially to remain in the battle and they thought other US media groups might enter the fray. Viacom said acidly that the 'marriage of strategic assets of Paramount and Viacom cannot be matched by the combination of Paramount and a shopping service'. However, QVC's bid was helped yesterday - the first opportunity for the market to express a view on its offer - by the fact that after a morning dip its shares ended the day slightly higher. The stock closed up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 56 1/8 on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. That meant that its bid, consisting of Dollars 30 in cash and 0.893 of a share for each Paramount share, was worth Dollars 80, the same price as when it was launched. Viacom's offer of Dollars 9.10 in cash and a mixture of its stock was worth only Dollars 60.55, with Viacom's A shares falling Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 and its B shares down Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 50 7/8. That gave the offer an overall value of Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.7bn) compared with Dollars 8.2bn at launch. However, Mr Diller has a strong reputation in the entertainment industry. Other leading shareholders are Comcast, a large cable service company, and Liberty Media, a cable programme concern spun off from Tele-Communications, the largest US cable service company.

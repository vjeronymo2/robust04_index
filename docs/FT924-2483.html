			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Dushanbe falls to 'old guard' POLITICIANS from Tajikistan's old Soviet hierarchy assumed power in the capital, Dushanbe, yesterday after irregular troops with armoured vehicles seized the government's main building. The new parliamentary speaker, Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, entered Dushanbe after a week of fighting in and around the city, according to the deputy chief of Russian forces in Tajikistan. Russian Colonel Anatoly Ivlev said Mr Rakhmanov, becoming head of state after the collapse of the Islamic-dominated coalition government, immediately began peace talks with his opponents. The development could help stabilise the Central Asian republic of 5m people, where dozens of private militias have vied for power for months. For now, Tajikistan's Islamic politicians, whose strength had risen all year, have lost any role in government and are likely to make peace with Mr Rakhmanov. But there were signs that ethnic tension could give rise to new violence in Tajikistan, where hundreds have died in fighting in the past year and more than 200,000 have fled their homes. Tajikistan's old-guard leadership, composed mostly of hard-line Soviet era politicans and industrialists, officially overturned the former government three weeks ago. It did so by militarily crushing Islamic-dominated troops outside Dushanbe and then - with the coalition government stripped of its muscle - having the old guard-dominated parliament vote their opponents out of power. Until yesterday, the Islamic forces continued to hold out in Dushanbe. But my mid-morning, armoured forces loyal to Mr Rakhmanov seized most of the capital's key installations - the presidential palace, parliament, the KGB building and the interior ministry. That gave Mr Rakhmanov the security to enter the capital. While politicians have profited from Tajikistan's war, it is essentially a battle between traditional ethnic enemies - clans from the nation's Garm and Kulyab regions. The former largely backs the Islamic coalition, while Kulyab supports the Soviet era elite.</p>

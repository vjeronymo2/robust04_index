			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) The Section 106 process should be used during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning process to progressively narrow resource concerns and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues requiring resolution about historic properties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic preservation. Ultimately, the objective is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve outstanding conflicts between proposed undertakings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their effects on historic properties, and to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available an appropriate level of information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmakers so that they can ``take into account'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of those undertakings on historic properties when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflicts are not completely resolved. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process will be most effective when planning, review,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation, and decisionmaking steps are explicitly linked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the nature and scope of the undertaking as well as to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant planning and program requirements to the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Agency Official should establish a procedure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule for completing the Section 106 process that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the planning approach and approval schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the undertaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Agency Official should begin the Section 106 process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and integrate it with other planning needs at the earliest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible time, when the widest feasible range of alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is open for consideration. The process should be fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated with actions and preparation of documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NEPA) and other environmental and planning requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This will help to ensure that planning and decisions fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect historic preservation issues and cultural values and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns, maximize program and budgetary efficiency, and head  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off potential conflicts later in the process that could lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to delays and litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Early planning.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the earliest feasible stage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning any undertaking, in conjunction with the preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Statement (DEIS) under the National Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy Act (NEPA), and in consultation with the State Historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preservation Officer where appropriate, the Agency Official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Establish the nature of the proposed undertaking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it deal principally with operation of a program with a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of public policy objectives, management or maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources and resource types, or planning and approval of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific project? What is the extent of public investment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the undertaking? Will the effects of the undertaking be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widespread or localized?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determine what decisions need to be made about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed undertaking, and who needs to make them.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Does the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency Official for a single agency have jurisdiction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control over the undertaking, or is that jurisdiction shared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other agencies? At what level will decisions be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the agency? If there are other Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved, who will be the lead Federal agency, and how will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities be apportioned? Is all or part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaking on tribal or State lands, and subject to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal requirements?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

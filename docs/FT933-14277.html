			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / MPs condemn lack of research for legal aid reforms THE government acted in ignorance when it reformed the legal aid system, a committee of backbench MPs said yesterday. The Commons public accounts committee expressed concern that the Lord Chancellor's department did not have enough information about the likely impact of changes to legal aid introduced on April 1. In a report published yesterday the committee acknowledges that the Lord Chancellor's intention in changing eligibility for legal aid was to contain the rise in spending while targeting aid at those who needed it most. But the report says that the department's officials 'did not know the number of adults who would no longer be eligible for support, and were unable to confirm or reject the worrying estimates that had been made by the legal profession'. It adds: 'The department had no figures on the likely impact of their measures on the number of people who represented themselves and on the extra costs and delays that might be incurred.' According to the report, neither the department nor the Legal Aid Board had any information or analysis on why offers of legal aid were not taken up, even though that could help in forecasting and monitoring legal aid spending. In 1991-92, 2.8m people were assisted by legal aid at a cost of Pounds 947.1m, an increase of nearly 40 per cent on the previous year. Spending is expected to rise to Pounds 1.1bn in 1992-93 and to Pounds 1.5bn in 1995-96. The MPs argued that whatever the eligibility framework, the biggest opportunity for saving on legal aid spending was controlling the cost of cases. Court cases are now much more costly in real terms than 10 years ago, the report says. The MPs urge more control over the assessment and payment of the costs of court cases and action 'to eliminate additional costs arising from delays and shortcomings within the systems of civil and criminal justice'. In his annual report on the court service, also published yesterday, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, says that his department's priority will be to control legal aid costs and spending on the courts while maintaining standards of service.

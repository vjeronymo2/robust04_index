He said that Japan  should set up "effort targets" on condition that "failure in  achieving such targets should not be subject to sanctions," thus  showing a flexible attitude toward setting up some kind of  numerical figures to measure progress in opening the Japanese  market. This has been reported by news agencies. Since Mr.  Ozawa was deeply involved in past Japan-U.S. negotiations on  economic issues, his remarks have invited negative reactions  from those concerned with negotiations saying: "Since term  `targets' will be taken as a pledge, numerical targets should  not be set."    In dispatching reports on Ozawa's remarks, such news  agencies  as the AP News Agency and KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS INC used the  term "targets." According to their dispatches and participants  of Ozawa's meeting with foreign correspondents, Mr. Ozawa  reportedly said that: "Japan and the United States should make  mutual efforts while keeping mutual reliance. It is good for  Japan to set up targets for Japan's effort to promote market  opening if the targets are not subject to sanctions." Moreover,  he reportedly said that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  "should be concluded by the end of March," thus showing  confidence in settling the issue at an early date.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH GETS TOGETHER TO DECIDE HOW A PIER SHOULD APPEAR  </P> <P> Tile-roofed Mediterranean!  </P> <P> Cape Cod quaint!  </P> <P> More fishing!  </P> <P> A less fishy smell!  </P> <P> Having finally decided to rebuild their landmark, storm-shattered pier, the  residents of Redondo Beach gathered this week for the first of three meetings  to discuss how it should be rebuilt.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Barbara Doerr expressed disappointment that only 60 people showed  up for Thursday's well-advertised public meeting, most of them activists and  business people whose opinions are well-known.  </P> <P> But Torrance architect Edward Carson Beall, who has been retained to design the  pier -- which will cost between $6 million and $7 million -- said the meeting  gave him plenty of ideas to work with. He expects to return in six to eight  weeks with variations of two basic layouts. They will be based on the  horseshoe-shaped structure that was decimated by fire and storms two years ago.  </P> <P> "Somebody said 'Make it the statement of your career.' Well, why shouldn't I?"  Beall said. "I'd like to make this thing part of Redondo again. It's been sort  of divorced for so long."  </P> <P> Nearly destroyed in 1988, the 60-year-old pier is a shadow of its former  bustling self, and the community has argued whether Redondo Beach should bother  to rebuild the landmark at all. Despite vocal opposition from neighboring  homeowners who argued that the pier is a magnet for riffraff and vermin, an  advisory question on the June ballot showed 58% of voters wanted the pier  rebuilt.  </P> <P> The question now, city officials say, is determining the future look and feel  of the pier.  </P> <P> Thrown out by the audience Thursday was a wide array of ideas and demands.  </P> <P> One suggestion, for example, was to rid the pier of the fishy fragrance that in  the past hung over the area like a stale fog. Though some have contended that  any attraction involving fishing is bound to smell like fish, Beall said the  smell could be greatly diminished by refrigerating the garbage and doubling the  garbage storage capacity at eateries, which would halve the number of times the  trash would have to be hauled past crowds to the dumpsters.  </P> <P> Other suggestions:  </P> <P> * Separate fishing areas from walkways for the general public, possibly by  creating a step-down fishing deck.  </P> <P> * Plant shade trees and grass to create at least three miniature "parks" on the  pier (an idea that Beall said might also create maintenance headaches).  </P> <P> * Give the pier a theme based on a single architectural style -- either Cape  Cod, to match the buildings on the pier parking structure, or a more  Californian style such as Mission Revival or Mediterranean.  </P> <P> * Get rid of the pier's unisex bathrooms and build separate facilities for  women and men.  </P> <P> * Do something, anything, to keep the pier cleaner this time around.  </P> <P> But a few in the crowd remained convinced that the only way to improve the pier  area is to tear the whole thing down.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Several defense-related organizations,  led by the League of Defense Enterprises of Russia, have started  a high-profile, glossy publication providing information on  recent Russian weapon systems. It is titled "MILITARY PARADE:  MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX JOURNAL." The January/February 1994  issue published in Moscow is a slick publication similar to  several Western defense journals oriented on the arms industry.

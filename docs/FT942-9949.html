			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Klimt brings top price at auction: Saleroom Sotheby's sale of top quality Impressionist and modern art in New York on Wednesday evening was a success, in sharp contrast to Christie's disappointing auction on Tuesday. Some 69 paintings and sculptures were offered and 50 of them sold, for a total of Dollars 51.5m (Pounds 35.2m). The highlight was the Dollars 11.6m paid for an exceedingly decorative painting by Gustav Klimt, 'Lady with a fan'. The price was a record for the Austrian artist and way ahead of estimate. It was sold by the estate of the late Mr Wendell Cherry, founder of Humana, the healthcare company. 'Composition No 8' by Mondrian also did well, making Dollars 5.6m. The artist took this strictly linear work to New York when escaping from the London Blitz in 1942 and it was acquired by the late Mr Gates Lloyd, the Philadelphia banker who later became deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency. His estate sold it yesterday for comfortably more than its Dollars 3m estimate. Another good price was the Dollars 2,092,500 paid for 'Peniche sur la Seine' by the Fauve artist Maurice de Vlaminck, and the same sum acquired a pastel by Degas 'La toilette', one of his many compositions of women bathing. Another work from the Gates Lloyd collection, Henry Moore's bronze, 'Festival reclining figure', one of five created for the Festival of Britain in 1951, sold at its high estimate, Dollars 2m. There was even keen bidding for some of the unsold lots. 'Bird', a marble sculpture by Brancusi, was bought in at Dollars 6m, and bids for a Monet view of Venice went as high as Dollars 5.7m, which must be close to the reserves fixed by the vendors.</p>

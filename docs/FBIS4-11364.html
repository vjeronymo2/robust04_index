			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 23 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, the  Salvadoran left-wing coalition described the death threats  against Vice Presidential Candidate Franciso Lima as a "dirty"  trick by the ruling ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance]  party. Lima, who is 76 years old, said telephone calls had been  received over the last few hours warning him of an attack on his  home.    Lima and coalition presidential candidate Ruben Zamora said  during a news conference that the calls were made to an office  of the former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)  guerrillas and to the home of party coordinator Shafik Handal.  The vice presidential hopeful recalled that Jose Maria Mendez, a  lawyer friend, was threatened a few months ago with an attack  against his wife if he did not help convince Lima to give up his  FMLN candidacy.    Lima, an attorney and successful businessman, expressed  concern over these events, especially after the police increased  his security because "if they are worried, it is only natural  that I should be worried; it is me they want to see buried."    Ruben Zamora said that in addition to the threats against  Lima, FMLN radio repeaters in San Salvador and the Chinchontepec  Volcanoes were sabotaged over the last few days, which "does not  contribute to the atmosphere of peace" that should prevail  during the elections. Zamora, who is 52 years old, will compete  for the presidency for the second time against the ruling ARENA  party candidate.</p>

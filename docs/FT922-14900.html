			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Hospital chief wins businesswoman award THE chief executive of a leading cancer hospital yesterday became the first candidate from the public sector to win the Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year award. She is Miss Phyllis Cunningham of London's Royal Marsden Hospital. Miss Cunningham, 54, heads a staff of 2,000 at the hospital's two sites in west London and Sutton, Surrey. She handles a Pounds 60m annual budget and is responsible for the hospital's Pounds 25m cancer appeal. 'Businesswoman is not a term I would use of myself, but that is exactly what I am. I don't think people understand that hospitals manage very large budgets and very large numbers of staff in probably more diverse and complex ways than in general business,' she said. In the past year Miss Cunningham has eliminated a Pounds 2m revenue deficit without reducing the number of patients treated, and seen the Royal Marsden become the first National Health Service hospital to win the Queen's Award for technical achievement. She became a trainee hospital administrator after graduating from Manchester Business School in the 1960s and joined the Royal Marsden in 1974. Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the Royal Marsden, said: 'Phyllis is tireless in her dedication to the hospital and its staff.' Previous award winners have included Ms Anita Roddick of Body Shop, Ms Debbie Moore of Pineapple dance studios and Ms Sophie Mirman of Sock Shop. Observer, Page 15</p>

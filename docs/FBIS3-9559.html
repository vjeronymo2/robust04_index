			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lubomir Sedlak: "Outlook Bleak for Slovak </F> Economy"]    [Text] The decline of the Slovak economy is likely to  continue in 1994, according to a new study by Slovak experts.    A major report published by the quasi-official Prognostic  Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences presents a gloomy  view of rising unemployment, falling productivity and continuing  high inflation in Slovakia.    But many Czech economists who have reviewed the report say  that it may even be a bit optimistic.    The report, written by economists Pavol Karasz, Juraj  Rencko,  Iveta Pauhofova and Edita Bauerova, contains some hard-hitting  predictions, many of which run counter to the Slovak  government's official position.    Among the report's predictions:    Falling productivity. The gross domestic product  in 1994 is projected to be between 0.8 and 3.3 percent lower  than it was in 1993.    The report predicts that the 1994 GDP will total 166.4  billion-170.6 billion Sk ($4.8 billion-4.9 billion). That would  be the fourth annual decline since the 1989 revolution, though  the rate of decline seems to be slowing.    Using constant values, the GDP totaled 172 billion Sk in  1993, 180 billion Sk in 1992, 194 billion Sk in 1991 and 227  billion Sk in 1990. The report does forecast a dim light at the  end of the tunnel: zero GDP growth in 1995, which would be an  improvement over the continual decline.    But Anton Marcincin of Prague's Center for Economic Research  and Graduate Education (CERGE) said the institute's projections  are too optimistic, adding that Slovak GDP could easily fall by  as much as 6 percent in 1994.    Rising unemployment. The report projects that  unemployment, which hovered around 12.9 percent in 1993, will  jump to 15.6-17.3 percent this year, and could possibly climb as  high as 20 percent. Between 390,000 and 433,000 people could be  out of work by year's end.    Marcincin, however, predicts that unemployment will reach  20-25 percent.    Deficit spending. The Slovak government projects  that it will run a deficit of around 14 billion Sk, equaling 3.7  to 3.9 percent of the expected GDP. But the Prognostic Institute  report predicts that the deficit will reach 4.2-5.4 percent of  the projected GDP. Nevertheless, that's still better than last  year's rate of 6.2 percent.    Rising inflation. The report predicts that  inflation will be 14 to 16 percent in 1994, even though real  income will either continue to fall or, at best, remain flat.    But Jiri Schwarz, president of the Liberal Institute, a  Prague-based think tank, warns that the inflation rate and  budget deficit could both go much higher if Slovakia has early  elections this year, as politicians spend more money on public  works in order to trim the growing unemployment rate.    CERGE economist Marcincin predicts that inflation could  reach  22 percent.    Growing poverty. The report indicates that many  young families, especially those with several children, a single  parent, unemployed parents or parents who work in a  recession-hit sector of the economy, have joined the group that  lives at or below the poverty line, previously made up  predominantly of pensioners.    The "social patience" of Slovakia's man in the street is  gradually running out, the report warns.    The report concludes that no fundamental turnaround in the  Slovak economy should be expected this year. And even if the GDP  flattens out next year, it remains to be seen whether it will  then be replaced by growth or simply by long-term stagnation.  That depends to a large extent on just how able Slovakia is to  change the structure of its economy.    Czech economist Zdislav Sulc, an adviser to the first  post-1989 Czechoslovak government, said the Slovak economy in  general is too "spontaneous," since the government still has not  formulated a clear, well-defined economic policy for the  country. Sulc also says the privatization process has come to a  virtual halt in Slovakia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P.C. Wu and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (CNA) -- Ties between Taiwan and  Indonesia have improved significantly since President Li  Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit to Indonesia in February, a  Taiwan official stationed here said Tuesday [21 June].    Lu Pao-sun, representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade  Office in Jakarta, noted that Taiwan had invested a total of  US$8.6 billion in Indonesia as of the end of May, making it the  second largest foreign investor in the Southeast Asian country.    In comparison, he pointed out, aggregate Taiwan investment  was about US$4 billion as of the end of 1993. It's really  amazing that investment from Taiwan made such a big jump in the  five-month period, he said. Annual two-way trade between the  two countries stands at nearly US$3 billion, he added.    Lu made the remarks at a cocktail party in honor of a  delegation of Taiwan manufacturers taking part in the Jakarta  fair, which opened last Saturday and will continue through July  16.    The delegation is led by Ronie H.K. Huang, secretary-general  of the Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council.    Stressing that the delegation aims to strengthen trade and  investment cooperation between the two countries, Huang said he  has invited Indonesian entrepreneurs to display their products  at the Taipei import fair, which is scheduled for October.    Earlier in the day, Huang called on Commerce Minister  Joedono  and Rudy Langkong, chairman of the Export Promotion Commission  under the Ministry of Commerce.    Also speaking at the party, ROC legislator Lin Shou-shan  said  the Taipei government has promoted the "southern strategy" in a  bid to help enhance the economic progress in Southeast Asian  countries and Taiwan's overseas investment.    Taiwan is willing to share its experience in economic  development with other countries, Lin noted.    In return, Langkong extended his welcome to the Taiwan  delegation, saying that longstanding relations between the two  countries have been solid despite the lack of diplomatic ties.  He said that Indonesia will definitely be represented at the  1994 Taipei import fair.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: SNP suffers severe blow in Govan THE Scottish National party suffered a severe blow early this morning when Mr Jim Sillars, the party's deputy leader, lost his Glasgow Govan seat to Labour. Labour's Mr Ian Davidson took the seat that Mr Sillars won in a sensational by-election in 1988. The SNP also failed to take Western Isles, a seat it had held until losing it to Labour in 1987. In other early results in safe Labour seats the swing to the SNP was less than the party had hoped. However, the Nationalists still hoped to win three seats from the Conservatives including that of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, while Labour was also expected to take seats from the Tories. The Conservatives rallied, however, winning Aberdeen South from Labour after the Labour vote was eroded by the SNP, and regaining Kincardine and Deeside, its recent by-election loss to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Michael Forsyth, the junior Scottish Office minister, held Stirling against a strong Labour challenge. The SNP and Labour hopes of gains against the Tories were based on projections of the original BBC exit poll. If realised, they would plunge Scotland into a constitutional crisis with the Tories suffering a near wipeout in Scotland while remaining the largest single party in the United Kingdom with Mr Major staying in Downing Street. If the Conservatives won half a dozen or fewer Scottish seats they would have barely the number needed to man the Scottish Office - unable to choose who to field unless they drafted in MPs from England, which would be unprecedented. The outcome would be a further challenge to the legitimacy of the Conservative party's rule in Scotland and increase the dissatisfaction of many Scots with the Westminster system. In addition to Mr Lang losing his seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale to the SNP, the Tories would lose two other seats to the SNP. These are Perth and Kinross where the MP was Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, and Tayside North where the MP was Mr Bill Walker. In a hung parliament the SNP could come under pressure to do a deal with Labour, a key element of which might be speedy implementation of Labour's plans for devolved Scottish parliament. While the SNP has totally ruled out deals with the Tories, it has been less categorical with regard to Labour though it has said it will give 'no blank cheques' to anyone. A pale-looking Mr Sillars, having lost by about 4,000 votes, summed up the situation, saying: 'Scotland has not yet resolved the paradox of what it does when it votes Labour and England votes Tory.'</p>

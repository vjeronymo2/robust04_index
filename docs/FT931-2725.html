			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: DTI's significant role in promoting overseas trade Sir, I was interested to read the article about the Australian Trade Commission ('Trading with purpose', March 4), which asked the question: 'Can trade promotion organisations really help?' I have no doubt that the help given to UK companies by the joint Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign and Commonwealth Office overseas trade services organisation plays a significant role in improving access to overseas markets and boosting UK exports. Our staff overseas spend much of their time helping to bring overseas buyers and UK sellers together in one way or another. They also spot thousands of opportunities every year that are passed on to UK companies. We continue to help UK companies in easy markets (especially smaller firms) as well as devoting resources to the important high-growth markets in Asia and good prospects elsewhere. We are clearly ahead of the Australians in at least one area. We have for some years now used an independent survey organisation to ask companies that have used our services for their views. While of course there is room for improvement, I'm pleased to report that the feed-back we get is very good. Around 90 per cent praise the helpfulness of our staff, a similar number will use our service again, and less than 10 per cent overall are dissatisfied with some aspect. We are devoting much effort to building on this success by improving our quality of service and putting more resources into work that will help British business to win in world markets.

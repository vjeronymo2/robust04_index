			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $66,000 FINE PROPOSED FOR MOBIL VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> State health officials are proposing a $66,000 fine against Mobil Oil Corp. for  violations of hazardous waste disposal laws at its Torrance refinery. Mobil has  not decided whether to accept the penalty or contest it, a company spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Inspectors in November found that the company had not disposed of a five-inch  blanket of caustic soda that was eating through a concrete pad. In addition, a  pipe was leaking the caustic material onto the ground. Inspectors also found  that Mobil had sent more than 450 truckloads of dirt contaminated with lead and  chromium to landfills without analyzing the level of toxicity, as required by  federal regulations.  </P> <P> Last July, Mobil settled a suit filed by the Department of Health Services,  agreeing to pay a fine of $125,000 for several other violations and to make up  to $225,000 in improvements in the handling of hazardous wastes at the  refinery.  </P> <P> Violations cited in that case included charges that Mobil had improperly  disposed of oil-contaminated dirt and lacked adequate space and emergency  communications equipment in waste storage areas.  </P></p>

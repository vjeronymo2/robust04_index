			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Solution to share option tax relief for executives Sir, It would be a pity if the government reacts to recent publicity about executive options by simply abolishing the income tax relief for approved 'discretionary' schemes. This would unnecessarily penalise participants in the growing number of 'all-employee' share option schemes, which use the 'discretionary' scheme legislation because of the inflexibility of the requirements for savings-related (SAYE) share options. It would also further encourage employees to sell their shares immediately after exercising the options, instead of holding on to them for a longer period. If the government feels that tax relief for 'discretionary' schemes needs to be restricted, may I suggest that it is continued for all schemes where options are granted to employees generally. Limited tax relief should also be available for executive options, but only in respect of those shares which are still held for, say, two years after the option exercise date.

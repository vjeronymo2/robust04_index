			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney The prospects for Euro Disney shareholders go from bad to worse. Not only were revenues for the half year to the end of March down 12 per cent on the comparable period of last year, mainly as a result of a 6 per cent fall in admissions. It also appears that shareholders are going to suffer even heavier dilution than previously feared in the theme park's forthcoming FFr6bn rights issue. The new shares now seem likely to be sold at under the FFr10 price that the market had been envisaging. The share par value is being cut from FFr10 to FFr5, and it looks as if Euro Disney is proposing to offer the shares at the deepest of discounts. If a price of FFr8 were chosen, 750m new shares would be created - or more than four for every existing share. The potential dilution is even greater when Euro Disney's plan to issue all shareholders with warrants is taken into account. Though the company's share price fell a further 2 per cent to FFr31.65 yesterday, it is hard to see why it should hold at even this shrunken level. Euro Disney could move modestly into profit in 1996. But earnings growth will be restrained as interest payments to banks and royalties to Walt Disney, the 49 per cent shareholder, kick in again from 1998. Even if good profits materialise at the start of the next century, they will have to be shared between around 1bn shares.</p>

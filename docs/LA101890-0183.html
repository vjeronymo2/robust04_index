			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> WORST INTERSECTIONS NAMED  </P> <P> The city's five most dangerous intersections have been identified in a traffic  safety report that names the corners of Central and Myrtle avenues and Live Oak  Avenue and Peck Road as the spots with the most collisions during the past  three years.  </P> <P> Each intersection has had 22 traffic accidents between 1987 and 1990, according  to the study.  </P> <P> The other intersections with the highest accident rates since 1987 are: Duarte  Road and Myrtle Avenue, with 21 collisions; California and Central avenues,  with 16, and Myrtle and Pomona avenues, with 12.  </P> <P> Public Works Director Robert K. Sandwick said work will be done to improve  safety at those and other dangerous intersections. Monrovia has only one  intersection, Myrtle Avenue and Huntington Drive, that generates enough traffic  to be put in the Caltrans category of congested, Sandwick said.  </P></p>

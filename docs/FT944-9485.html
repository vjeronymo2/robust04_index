			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Late buying surge sees Footsie approach 3,100 - Market Report Strong support for the dollar and international bonds ahead of today's crucial decision on the course of US interest rates encouraged London's equity market to launch another attack on the 3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index. The late flurry of buying across most international markets produced a surge of support for the Footsie future and drove the cash market to the day's best level at the close. The FT-SE 100 settled 19.4 higher at 3,095.3. And dealers were hopeful of another good showing by UK equities when the market opens this morning. Some dealers harboured suspicions that activity in specialist derivative products, involving specially tailored options, could have played a significant part in the late drive by leading stocks. Activity in these deals has played an increasingly large part in the London market in the past 12 months. Aiding the much improved mood in the market was news of a possible merger involving two big UK companies, Johnson Matthey and Cookson, which could produce a Pounds 2.5bn new entrant for the FT-SE 100 Index, and more highly encouraging news on the dividend front from the leading UK companies as British Steel pleased the market with a top of the range interim payment. One of the few minor disappointments for the market was the level of turnover which, at 492.4m shares, continued the recent run of dismally low volumes. Last Friday saw the value of customer business just manage to creep above the Pounds 1bn mark. Turnover in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 302m shares, more than 61 per cent of the day's total. Second line stocks failed to register any significant gains, however, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ending just 1.6 firmer at 3,538.1. Big gains in the leaders at the close were a reversal of the early trend in the market, when prices slipped away on very low volume as dealers became increasingly nervous ahead of today's FOMC meeting at which the Federal Reserve is expected to hoist its Fed Funds rate for the sixth time this year. A 50 basis-point rise is viewed as the very minimum the markets would take as acceptable if the Fed is to be seen as maintaining a responsible attitude to containing US inflationary trends. Many analysts would prefer a rise of 75 basis points and many would like to see rates increased by a full point. The first of a big batch of economic numbers from both sides of the Atlantic, UK producer prices, were broadly as expected and played little part in determining events in the market. Along with the outcome of the FOMC meeting today brings US retail sales numbers, industrial production details and capacity utilisation figures. At its worst, shortly before midday, the FT-SE 100 was down 6.4 and being strangled by lack of interest. Sentiment began to improve over lunchtime, however, with the stronger dollar and a firm opening by Wall Street prompting keen demand across Europe. 'The sellers dried up and the futures boys moved in,' said one senior trader, who added that the market was in a bullish mood at the close. There was heavy turnover in the banks, where switching out of Barclays was said to have driven National Westminster and other leading clearers better. Lloyds were lifted by a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Vodafone took the accolade as the FT-SE 100's best individual performer, responding to increasing optimism over next week's interim figures. The English power generators moved ahead confidently, with the market looking for the companies to fulfil high expectations for their respective interim dividends. Payments in excess of 20 per cent are being sought by the sector's bulls.</p>

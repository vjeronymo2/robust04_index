			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Time and Venue for the South-North Summit </F> Talks"]    [Text] Presently, there are many speculative and  prospective remarks concerning the South-North summit talks.  The important thing is for the summit meeting to be successful.  Everything is important regarding the question of the  reconciliation between the South and North and of national  unification, including the North's nuclear issue. The issue of  averting a war at this very moment is also very urgent.    For the realization and success of the summit talks--on  which  the future fate of our nation depends--both the South and North  should approach this issue in a sincere and prudent manner.  This is because we should solve the question of our nation's  survival, not the issue of systems or regimes. In this regard,  we think it fortunate that the North side has agreed to our  side's proposal for a working-level contact at Panmunjom on 28  June.    This notwithstanding, the North side is still continuing  vilifying broadcasts toward the South and has spread word that  President Kim Il-song told a Japanese woman that he hopes the  summit will take place in Pyongyang on 15 August. If this  report is true, we have to take issue with his real intention  regarding his preference for 15 August. The day of national  liberation is really a good date, however, the problem is that  the North will be holding a political event, the so-called "15  August pannational rally," on that day.    Needless to say, the "15 August pannational rally" is part  of  the North's idea for the convocation of "the political  consultative conference"--whose realization the North has  pertinaciously advocated--in connection with its strategy for  the reunification front against the South. If they propose  holding the summit talks in tandem with such a pannational  rally, we cannot but suspect their ulterior motive on two  points. First, we suspect that they might weaken the  significance of the summit talks if it is part of the  pannational rally. Second, we suspect that under the pretext of  opposition from the South, they might attempt to bring the  summit meeting itself to naught and, at the same time, to avert  sanctions related to their nuclear development. Under whatever  circumstances, if the summit meeting is suspected to be  connected with such an ulterior motive, it will be meaningless,  therefore, we find this very unacceptable.    As proposed to us through former U.S. President Carter, the  North has to prove its sincerity and seriousness to the  unconditional South-North summit talks. To this end, it should  change its irritating or antagonistic attitude toward the South.  It ought to call off vilifying and seditious broadcasts against  the South that spoil the atmosphere for the summit talks and to  give up the idea of launching a big offensive of political  propaganda by convening the pannational rally with the  participation of a South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils [Hanchongnyon] representative.    Of course, it is not so easy to remove the antagonistic  sentiments--which have been pent up over the past half a century  of national division--and to achieve the long-cherished national  desire for unification. It is, therefore, all the more  necessary for the South and North to show a sincere and serious  attitude to the reconciliation and dialogue between the South  and North. National unification will be more remote if the  North, as well as the South, should try to make use of the  summit talks to maintain their respective political power; and  in the North's case, from the viewpoint of its strategy toward  the South. We should also make a prudent approach to the time  and venue of the summit talks. North Korea, too, should  corroborate its sincerity for the realization of the summit  talks at the preliminary contacts.</p>

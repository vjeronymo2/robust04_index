			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: UK mechanical engineering sector can fight back Sir, Andrew Baxter ('Charting the mechanics of decline', February 22) makes reference to the fact that UK industrialists complain that they are forced to buy foreign equipment. He goes on to say that process plant contractors say it is 'no longer possible to buy big UK-produced compressors'. As managing director of Peter Brotherhood, I can assure him that large gas compression equipment, whether reciprocating, centrifugal or screw machines, is manufactured in the UK, most notably by ourselves in Peterborough. While I cannot speak for any other UK manufacturer, I can assure him that process plant contractors, and other customers, continue to buy our equipment on the basis that our quality, delivery and prices are competitive with those of any other manufacturers throughout the world. In view of the dismissive comment about the British machine-tool sector by the head of a German machine-tool company, I can only hope that the complacency contained in his remarks continues. While there are many aspects of German industry worthy of study, my experience of buying specialised equipment from Germany is that the equipment is often delivered late, of poor quality and accompanied by an attitude on commercial matters that borders on arrogance. On that basis, maybe UK industry can start to fight back. Finally I would say that size is not the issue with regard to the mechanical engineering sector. Neither indeed is the absolute value of currency. What really matters is the ability of UK companies to penetrate their markets properly and to offer high-quality goods delivered on time, and manufactured cost-effectively. If we get these matters right, then everything else will follow. P Salisbury, managing director, Peter Brotherhood, Lincoln Road, Peterborough PE4 6AB</p>

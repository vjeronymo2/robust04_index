			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE ON SCHOOL BOND MEASURE AUTHORIZED  </P> <P> Voters in November will be asked to approve a $75-million general obligation  bond measure to help repair buildings in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School  District, an action the school board authorized this week.  </P> <P> The bonds, which would require approval by two-thirds of the voters, would be  used to make the schools structurally safe, to bring each campus up to a state  of good repair and to modernize the classrooms.  </P> <P> Many of the schools are more than 50 years old.  </P> <P> The bonds would be paid by property tax increases. They would cost the average  homeowner in the district $5.66 a month over a 25-year period of debt  repayment, according to report by an advisory committee. The board also  unanimously authorized the superintendent to begin planning with a bond counsel  and a financial adviser.  </P></p>

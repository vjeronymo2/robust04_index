			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / High ideals and small deeds of Cold War victors order: Peter Norman surveys the beginnings - and the potential pitfalls - of a new world economic AFTER the end of the Cold War and the Gulf war, the world's leading industrial powers are groping towards a new co-operative, international economic order. But they still have to muster the political will and financial wherewithal to make their ideals more than aspirations. That at any rate is the impression left by the meetings in Washington this week of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. US pressure on Germany to cut its interest rates dominated the headlines for much of the meetings. This was a pity. The row overshadowed the ferment of ideas now unleashed - not least in the US Treasury - on how to ensure that all parts of the world can benefit from the Cold War victors: market economy, pluralism and democracy. On the other hand, the interest rate spat exposed the painful gap among western policy makers in general - and in the US in particular - between sometimes impressive analysis of the problems of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America - and feeble and frequently self-serving policy prescriptions. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, and Mr David Mulford, his undersecretary for international financial affairs, did the world a service in drawing attention to the shortage of global savings at a time when demands for capital are likely to rise. Economic restructuring in eastern Europe, reconstruction in the Gulf region and the gradual economic rehabilitation of Latin America's debtors threaten to add to problems caused by a sharp decline in Arab oil surpluses and Germany's move into current account deficit. But just as the US analysis had some merit, its prescription was at best nave and at worst mischievous. US Treasury officials were never able to explain how lower interest rates in Germany and elsewhere could encourage savings. Experience tells that forced cuts in official interest rates often result in higher long-term rates as bond market investors fear new inflationary pressures. The US stand on interest rates can be excused by the approach of the 1992 presidential election. But in other respects, a big gap was apparent between Washington's hopes for a new post-Cold War economic order and its ability to support this goal with deeds. The rhetoric was captured in Mr Brady's remarks to the IMF Interim Committee. 'The success of Desert Storm has shown what can happen when the international community focuses its energies of a singular objective,' he said. 'Now is the time to extend this spirit of international co-operation to meet the major challenges we face on the economic front.' The reality of what is now dubbed 'responsibility sharing' was somewhat different. When the US was asked recently to contribute to a Dollars 1bn loan for Czechoslovakia from the group of 24 industrialised countries, it offered just Dollars 15m. The US has also made sure that its allies finance help for Poland. It dragooned the Paris Club of western creditor governments into forgiving 50 per cent of Poland's official debt while being one of Poland's smaller official creditors. It is now attempting to arrange a similar deal for Egypt and ring-fence the principle of large scale debt forgiveness to exclude other hard-pressed middle-income countries from similar agreements. The official explanation for such inconsistency is that Poland and Egypt are special cases because of their high levels of government-held debt. But the differentiated policy approach can also be explained in terms of domestic US politics and foreign policy priorities. Because of the Polish diaspora, there are many millions of US voters with Polish surnames or ancestors and relatively few US citizens of Czech origin. In Egypt's case, 'Realpolitik' dictates generous treatment of one of Washington's more dependable friends in a very volatile region. The inconsistencies of US policy are also a sign that Washington no longer has the financial muscle to be an economic superpower. The military successes of the US-led coalition in the Gulf conflict have not given the US the capacity to bend its trading partners to its will. For this reason, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, was determined when in the US to gain US recognition for Germany's large DM25bn (Pounds 8.4bn) contribution to economic reform in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Germany fears that without some careful coaching, the US will focus responsibility sharing on the problems of the Middle East at the risk of neglecting the Soviet Union which Bonn considers has huge crisis potential. By focusing on disagreements, one could easily ignore that there is a remarkable consensus over the principles by which the world economy should be be managed. Pluralism, democracy and the market economy are now economic mantras in the developing world as well as in the industrialised countries and the former communist states of eastern Europe. The experience of the Gulf war has persuaded the US and other industrialised countries that democratic regimes deserve to be given financial help and that financial leverage should be used to curb further arms races in the developing world. Symbolic of a huge shift in attitudes was an aside by Mr Norman Lamont in his speech to the Developmemt Committee on Tuesday. Britain's conservative chancellor cited with approval the speech by the finance minister of Guinea  -a state that until the mid-1980s was trying to create its own breed of socialism in Africa.</p>

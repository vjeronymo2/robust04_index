			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Clegg's Wace backer traced to South Africa THE WOMAN who said she produced the original stake money used by Mr John Michael Clegg to buy into the Wace Group said yesterday that it came from a family inheritance. Mr Clegg abruptly resigned last week as chief executive of Wace after market speculation had linked the company to the Irish Republican Army. The Wace Group is conducting a 'wide ranging inquiry' into all aspects of the company. Mr Clegg denied the allegations but told Wace's board he was leaving because of possible speculation about his family which might embarrass the company. No evidence of links with the IRA has been found by the security forces. Wace, the company he built into the world's largest pre-press printing specialist, has launched a wide ranging investigation covering the eight years since he bought into the group using funds supplied by his cousin, Mrs Jayne Riley. Mrs Riley, formerly Miss Jayne Wright, was last night traced by the Financial Times to a suburb of Durban, South Africa, where she lives with her husband, Mr Keith Riley. Mrs Riley confirmed she was Mr Clegg's cousin and that she had given him about Pounds 700,000 to invest in her name. Asked whether Mrs Riley would be prepared to put her account of events to the Wace board, her husband replied: 'Of course she would. Why wouldn't she? She has got nothing to hide.' She had not been in touch with Mr Clegg since he resigned.</p>

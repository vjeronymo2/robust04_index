			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post strong long-end gains on Fed move US TREASURY prices posted exceptionally strong gains at the long end of the market yesterday as last Friday's news of a subtle shift in the Federal Reserve's policy stance continued to provide support for investor sentiment. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/32 at 104 3/16 , yielding 5.944 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.793 per cent. Prices rallied strongly late last week after the minutes from the August meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee were released showing that the central bank's policy-makers had voted to shift the bias of monetary policy back to neutral from its previous stance of a possible tightening. That rally caught many dealers short of bonds, and as buyers returned to the market yesterday, prices rose sharply at the long end of the maturity range. The early firm tone of trading was also helped by the day's economic news of a 1.3 per cent decline in August existing home sales, and by end-of-quarter 'window dressing', when investment managers buy bonds in the hope of driving up the value of their assets for quarterly accounting purposes. EUROPEAN government bonds rose in early trading on relief that the weekend had brought no escalation of political tensions in Russia, but eased back in the afternoon to end only slightly firmer. Retail activity was scant and trade remained technical, with the futures pits once again setting the pace. German government bonds jumped nearly  1/2 point at the opening, but shed most of their early gains in the absence of follow-through buying. With little in the way of market-moving data or news, prices remained range-bound on moderate volume. At today's announcement of Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements, most dealers are calling for another round of fixed-rate repos rather than a return to variable-rate repos. Given current tightness in the money market, a switch to variable-rate repos could actually push the repo rate above last week's fixed 6.70 per cent, sending the wrong signal, traders said. FRENCH government bonds underperformed bunds in quiet trade. The yield on the 10-year French government benchmark ended on a par with its German counterpart at 6.10 per cent, after yielding 5 basis points fewer on Friday. Early hopes that the Bank of France would ease interest rates at its repo allocation were disappointed, causing price slippage in the afternoon. Moreover, bond market sentiment was dampened by the franc's weakness on the foreign exchanges. Traders are focusing on August jobs data, due for release on Thursday, as well as industrial production numbers expected some time this week. UK gilts had a quiet day, with futures prices supported by firmness in the German market but little cash activity reported. The December long gilt contract ended at 112 27/32 , up  7/32 from Friday. Prices are expected to remain range-bound today ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. ITALIAN bonds were among the day's strongest performers, gaining more than 1/2 point on the day. The December BTP future on Liffe ended at 114.87, up 0.64 point from Friday and is expected to test technical resistance at 115.05 today. Friday's late announcement that the government will soon implement a law enabling foreign investors to reclaim withholding tax charged on interest income from Italian bonds had boosted prices, said Mr Andrew Roberts, bond analyst at UBS. This triggered switching into higher-coupon bonds yesterday, Mr Roberts added. Spanish bonds also rose, boosted mainly by the firm tone in most other European markets. The December notional Bonos contract traded in Madrid rose by 0.66 point to 99.24. JAPANESE government bonds hit a six-year high for the second consecutive trading day, with the December JGB future rising to 112.51, from 112.28 on Friday.</p>

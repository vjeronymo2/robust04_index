			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 1.3 per cent on fears over yen Further worries over the yen kept most investors absent and the Nikkei index lost ground on technical selling amid low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Arbitrage selling depressed the 225-issue by 273.46 points, or 1.3 per cent to 20,766.75, off 3.4 per cent on the week. Volume thinned to 350m shares against 389m. The index opened at the day's high of 20,998.30, but soon declined on arbitrage selling and index-linked trading which overwhelmed buying of blue chips by investment trusts and public funds. The index hit a low of 20,755.45 in the afternoon. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.17 to 1,673.07 and the Nikkei 300 closed down 2.08 at 303.99. Declines led advances by 677 to 364, with 154 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.67 to 1,362.66. A no confidence vote by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party against the minority government also unnerved investors. Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,240 and Mitsubishi Bank declined Y20 to Y2,660. Daiei, which attracted buying on Thursday following reports that it would start a joint retailing venture in China, lost Y60 to Y1,670 on profit-taking. Large capital steels also declined on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y5 to Y357. But Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y3 to Y795 on investment trust support. The yen's late rise eroded earlier gains posted by high-technology stocks, which were supported by investment trust led buying. Hitachi closed unchanged at Y1,040, but Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,110. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.19 to 23,242.38 in volume of 28.8m shares. Roundup A weak US dollar and uncertainties over interest rates continued to preoccupy the region. HONG KONG ended lower on the US dollar although local bargain-hunting was encouraged by optimism on the new airport. The Hang Seng index closed down 85.75 at 8,881.00, 2.6 per cent lower on the week. KUALA LUMPUR recovered with the return of foreign buying. The benchmark KLSE Composite index closed up 11.53 at 1,015.03, still 2.2 per cent down on the week. Volume was thin, reflecting investors' caution over the market's direction after falls on Wall Street overnight. TAIPEI moved higher on buying in the paper and plastics sectors, although brokers said that the upsurge might not last long with investors short of confidence. The weighted index closed 68.48 higher at 5,939.62, 3.6 per cent lower on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 47.36bn from Thursday's TDollars 52.64bn. SYDNEY's trading was inflated by the expiry of options, the All Ordinaries index closing 34.2 lower at 2,017.9, down 1.6 per cent on the week as turnover soared from ADollars 579m to ADollars 1.46bn. SEOUL ended lower on a strike by railway workers, although some blue chips staged a rebound from earlier declines as the composite index fell 6.12 to 929.45, up 1.2 per cent on the week. Kepco gained Won200 to Won26,200 and Korea Mobile Telecom advanced Won900 to Won313,900. Volume was 47m shares against 62.3m on Thursday. WELLINGTON lost more ground in the international investment gloom, the NZSE-40 index ending 21.24 lower at 2,038.77, down 2.9 per cent over the week. Telecom was hit again by arguments for investment in fixed interest securities, as local and world interest rates continue to rise, as well as by selling on Wall Street. MANILA fell through the the 2,800 support level, sparking fears of a downward spiral if no positive factors emerged. The composite index closed 33.01 lower at 2,789.14, down 3.2 per cent on the week as most blue chips fell on profit-taking. Turnover more than doubled to 1.34bn pesos, compared with the previous 654.28m. JAKARTA closed lower in sluggish trade, with overseas investors sidelined mainly on concerns over US interest rates. The official index ended 2.09 lower at 468.87, 1.6 per cent down on the week.</p>

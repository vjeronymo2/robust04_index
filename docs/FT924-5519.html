			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Glaxo must hope yesterday's patent award in favour of SmithKline Beecham does not start a run of bad luck. The market was understandably unsettled by a defeat for Zofran, one of the new drugs supposed to offset the US patent risk to Zantac, its blockbusting anti-ulcer compound. In itself, though, yesterday's decision looks little more than an embarrassment for Glaxo. It may end up paying a handsome royalty to SmithKline on sales of Zofran to cancer patients in Europe. But that would hardly blow a hole in profits. Meanwhile there is nothing to prevent Zofran growing market share. Whether Glaxo can ever replace Zantac, though, remains an open question.</p>

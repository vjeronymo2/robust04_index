			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL GUIDES FOR BUDGET TRAVELERS  </P> <P> The 1989 Mobil Travel Guide "Lodgings for Less" steers budget-minded travelers  to clean, comfortable and highly rated accommodations throughout the United  States and Canada. Average price per night for two is about $50. (As rooms for  less than $50 are scarce in some areas, the guide also lists more costly  lodgings when necessary.)  </P> <P> Information is contained in three compact regional volumes covering major  cities and resort areas in the South, Northeast/Midwest (plus Canada) and West  (plus Canada). Published by Prentice Hall, each volume retails at bookstores  and other outlets for $5.95.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: INFORMAL, INEXPENSIVE AND IN FASHION  </P> <P> While sophisticated upscale restaurants (you know: the kind with $28 entrees  and $50 Chardonnays) are languishing all over town, more and more informal,  inexpensive restaurants are opening -- and, for now at least, doing very well.  </P> <P> Owners of the 8-month-old Daily Grill in Brentwood, for instance, report that  they've been serving between 600 and 800 meals a day -- in a 90-seat restaurant  -- and expect to take in roughly $3 million in receipts this year! They're so  pleased with business, in fact, that they are now working on a second Daily  Grill -- in the new Beverly Connection complex. The new place, scheduled to  open before Christmas, will be larger than the Brentwood original, with 120  seats and a 30-seat private dining room -- but will otherwise remain true to  the formula (good, honest grill Americana at reasonable prices; no  reservations; coffee-shop decor) that seems to be working so well.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Silvio DeMori, proprietor of Tuttobene in Hollywood and Tuttopasta  downtown, is plotting a second version of the latter -- which frequently has  people lined up outside waiting for a table, despite what he considers a  terrible location in the Subway Terminal Building on Hill Street. The new  Tuttopasta, which will open in about two months, is located across the street  from the aforementioned Daily Grill in Brentwood.  </P> <P> "It will definitely be another Tuttopasta," says DeMori, "but it will be more  of a trattoria, and it will be more comfortable than the downtown one."  </P> <P> The new Tuttopasta will be open only for dinner -- though, says DeMori, he does  a good lunchtime delivery business from the downtown location. "We put in a fax  machine for orders, as a joke," he adds, "and now we have to buy a second one."  </P> <P> WHAT'S NUA?: When I spoke with Kenji Seki (ex-manager of Chinois on Main and  co-creator of New York's China Grill) last October about the restaurant he was  planning to open in Beverly Hills, he said that it would be called Noa Noa, and  that it "must open by March, 1989." March has come and gone with no Noa Noa.  But, says Seki, construction has finally started on the place, and he does plan  to be in business by early August.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he has changed the restaurant's name to Nua Nua, in order to avoid a  possible conflict with the Noa jazz club in Santa Monica, and has announced  that his chef will be none other than Masayuki Ishikawa -- whose Ishi's Grill  was one of the first restaurants in the country to successfully blend Japanese  and contemporary American cooking.  </P> <P> SPAM, SPAM, SUSHI AND SPAM: Bento Xpress in San Jose has added Spam sushi --  marinated Spam on rice wrapped in seaweed -- to its otherwise conventional  Japanese menu. The creation, which has reportedly been a success with local  diners, is said to be a popular dish in Hawaii -- a place whose most famous  dish, it might be noted, is a paste made from taro root.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The best places to go for help and advice Where can the smaller company turn for advice and funding? Advice and help with exports can be sought from the larger chambers of commerce with international expertise (notably London, Birmingham and Manchester) or from organisations such as the British Exporters Association (Tel 071 222 5419) and the Institute of Export (071 247 9812). A number of banks still have smaller exporter schemes (see table) though not all local managers may be aware of them. There are also a number of what are known as credit policy managers - companies which buy their credit insurance from, for example, NCM and then sell it on in smaller amounts. These include Credit Management Resources (081 647 8833), Clear-a-Debt (081 683 0141) and Intrum Justitia (0789 415181). An exporter may make a direct approach to one of the factoring companies for a quotation. Most of the larger factoring companies are bank-owned. Rates for export factoring services are typically 1-1.5 per cent for administrative charges plus 0.5-1 per cent for credit which the factor buys in from the insurer. Details of the main factoring companies are available from the Association of British Factors and Discounters (071 930 9112). Companies could approach NCM direct (0222 824000) though it would not normally take on a company with exports worth less than Pounds 100,000, or Trade Indemnity, another leading credit insurance group (071 739 4311). Several of the general insurance brokers have export credit insurance departments while the largest specialist broker is the Credit Insurance Association (071 235 3550). Smaller exporters are unlikely to have the volumes of business needed to justify using a broker. However, CIA would normally expect clients to have export turnover of Pounds 4m or more, says James Larkin, a director. Exporters of this size could expect to pay premiums of 0.5 per cent of turnover though this could be lower for higher volumes of business or higher in high-risk markets. The level of premium charged would reflect the customer's competence in administering his export business, the credit rating of customers and the countries in which he does business. The very small exporter might find all of these routes barred, in which case he will need to deal on a cash basis with customers (only possible if he has a strong market position) or by means of credit card payments. Letters of credit could be used but they are a cumbersome and costly process for smaller deals and do not provide complete insurance against loss.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- A phased approach to  financing the government's Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] was "eminently sensible", the South African  Chamber of Business [SACOB] said in reaction to the budget on  Wednesday [22 June]. SACOB welcomed the reduction in the  standard corporate tax rate, the removal of certain import  surcharges and the maintaining of the value added tax (VAT)  rate, saying these would encourage economic growth.    "Given the extraordinary increase in expenditure directly  linked to the transition, the Minister (of Finance Mr Derek  Keys) has been bold in dealing with the matter directly."    SACOB said the appointment of a commission of inquiry into  taxation avoided immediate tax decisions and prolonged  uncertainty about a future tax regime. "It is to be regretted  that the overall effect of the tax changes has been to increase  the burden on individuals at a time when personal savings are  still at a low level and the effect of budget creep on  individuals has not been addressed."</p>

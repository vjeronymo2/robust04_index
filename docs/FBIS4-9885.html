			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information News"] </F>   [Text] Since last weekend, electricity generation in Cuba  has been seriously hampered because of breakdowns in  thermoelectric plants located in various provinces of the  nation. The demand for this service is much greater than the  generating capacity, and therefore power outages of 8-10 hours  daily are currently scheduled for the population. Originally, a  lack of fuel forced thermoelectric plants to operate at lower  capacity, and now, on top of this, is the problem of equipment  breakdowns.    In a conversation with Jorge Carballo, the power supply  chief  at the Electrical Union of the Ministry of Basic Industry, the  following was explained:    [Begin Carballo recording] We are experiencing very  difficult  times. On some days, we have no problems with the petroleum  supply, but then on other days we lack petroleum, and then on  other days it is the [words indistinct]. I can tell you that  the current problem is not a lack of petroleum, but there will  be a cutback in services because of breakdowns. There will be  longer-than-normal power outages of 8-10 hours. Nevertheless, I  hope that during the early hours of the day we will be able to  [words indistinct], and that during the early hours we will not  have power outages. [end recording]    A lack of spare parts for electric power plants together  with  the years the equipment has been operating and the continuous  forced shutdowns have all affected electricity production.    [Begin Carballo recording] The trouble is that we are  working  without any spare parts. Can you imagine? If you have a  thermoelectric system working at full capacity when the (words  indistinct] fails you have a power outage. If you have a  thermoelectric system working above capacity, when one of the  [word indistinct] fails, what you do is turn on the [words  indistinct], but service is not halted.    This is the accumulation of many small problems: It is the  fuel problem, the quality of the fuel, the lack of maintenance,  and the continuous shutdowns because of the lack of fuel. Some  equipment is designed to be shut down and started up again, but  other equipment is not designed for this. Some equipment is  designed to run 24 hours a day. In terms of the equipment  designed to work 24 hours a day, if you shut it down, start it  up again, and shut it down again, little by little the equipment  will eventually wear out.

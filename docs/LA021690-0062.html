Yosef Harish has dropped a criminal investigation of dovish  Science Minister Ezer Weizman, demoted for alleged contacts with the Palestine  Liberation Organization, Israel Radio said. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  removed Weizman from the policy-making Inner Cabinet last month after accusing  him of meeting with a PLO official in Geneva. Israel Radio said Harish dropped  the investigation because of a lack of evidence and after determining that  Weizman had parliamentary immunity from prosecution.  </P></p>

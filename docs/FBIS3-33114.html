			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Finance Secretary  Pedro Aspe Armella announced that during the current year Mexico  will earmark 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to  servicing its external and internal debts, which up until five  years ago absorbed up to 18 percent of the GDP.    The finance secretary indicated that while five years ago an  amount equivalent to 18 percent of the GDP was funneled into  servicing external and internal debts, only 2 percent will be  used during 1994 for the same purposes.    The announcement was made during a visit to the cities of  Durango in the northern State of Durango, Culiacan in the  northwestern State of Sinaloa, and Hermosillo in the  northwestern State of Sonora. Aspe Armella reiterated that the  federal government plans to continue with its policy of strict  fiscal discipline, public finance equilibrium, cutting  inflation, and encouraging productivity in order to accomplish  3-percent economic growth during the current year.    Last year the government's objective was to achieve economic  growth of not less than 2.9 percent, but according to estimates  by some experts GDP growth was barely between 0.5 and 1.0  percent. At any rate, Aspe Armella indicated that the government  is determined to augment productivity.    Public finance equilibrium, Aspe Armella stated, will  provide  the government with sufficient resources to support the  agriculture sector through the Direct Agriculture Support  Program in order to raise agriculture productivity and encourage  business through tax breaks.

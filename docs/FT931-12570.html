			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / German bankers back tough interest rate line HOPES of early and substantial cuts in German interest rates were dealt a blow yesterday after two members of the Bundesbank's policy-making council spoke out in defence of the central bank's hardline monetary policy. Coming the day after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said that excessive pay awards in eastern Germany would rule out early cuts in interest rates, the comments from the presidents of the regional central banks of Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg led to speculation that the Bundesbank had launched a deliberate campaign to lower expectations of a rate cut. Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Landeszentralbank in Bayern, the Bavarian regional central bank, said that he saw no reason why he could agree to a cut in interest rates under present circumstances. Speaking in Freiburg, Mr Guntram Palm, president of the regional central bank for Baden-Wurttemberg, said he was worried about the calls from government, unions and businessmen for a cut in rates. Such a cut would only come when the fundamentals justified a cut, but the dangers for price stability had not lessened, he warned. The remarks of the two council members, together with those of Mr Schlesinger the previous day, come at a highly sensitive time, as the government is locked in negotiations over the budget and the 'solidarity' pact and has yet to reach a deal on public sector pay claims. The private sector meanwhile is negotiating with the powerful IG Metall union over pay in the eastern part of Germany. Economists said that the timing and the apparent co-ordination of the remarks appeared designed to ensure that governments and unions did not take a rate cut for granted as they entered into the final stages of the crucial negotiations. The comments also served to knock some of the euphoria out of the financial markets, which have risen sharply this year in expectation of rate cuts by late February or early March. Yesterday the DAX index of 30 shares fell back 13.84 points to 1,562.32 on fears that the rate cut would come later rather than sooner. The remarks are consistent with the Bundesbank's orthodox line that a cut in the Lombard and discount rates, currently 9.5 and 8.25 per cent respectively, can only come after inflation and money supply have been brought under control. The key figures are January M3 money supply growth and February inflation, both published next month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/278: "The Commission Decides To </F> Refer the Greek Embargo of the FYROM to the European Court of  Justice"]    [Text] The [European] Commission today decided to refer the  embargo established by the Greek Government against the FYROM  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] to the European  Court of Justice. The Commission's decision is based on article  225 of the EC treaty which applies to cases in which article 224  has been cited unjustifiably by a member state in support of  unilateral measures which would otherwise be in violation of  Community law.    The implementation of the decision is suspended until 13  april 1994.    At the same time, the Commission issued an appeal to the  governments of Greece and FYROM to renew their dialogue in an  effort to resolve the points in contention between them. The  Commission called upon FYROM to reconsider its position on  questions in contention regarding its constitution and flag as  part of a search for a simultaneous solution to all outstanding  issues including the name of the state. The Commission is  continuing its efforts to facilitate the resumption of dialogue  between Athens and Skopje and is in touch with all the parties  concerned, in close liaison with Mr. Cyrus Vance, the United  Nations mediator, and with Mr. Mathew Nimetz, the United States  envoy.    On 16 february, the Greek Government took unilateral  measures  towards FYROM aimed at preventing trade through the port of  Thessaloniki of goods coming from or going to FYROM as well as  the import into Greece of products from FYROM. Since then, the  Commission has repeatedly been in contact with the Greek  Government in order to ascertain and to evaluate the reasons put  forward to justify the embargo.    As these arguments, which are based on article 224 of the EC  [Euroepan Commission] treaty involve political considerations  related to public security in Greece and the risk of war, they  were discussed by the European Union's foreign ministers at  their meeting in Ioannina on 27 march 1994. This discussion  confirmed the Commission's doubt as to whether these arguments  are well-founded and as to whether the measures are compatible  with Greece's obligations under the EC treaty, particularly in  the areas of customs union, the common commercial policy and the  internaL market. Despite calls upon Greece by the Commission and  by the foreign ministers to lift the measures, they still remain  in force.    Accordingly, as guardian of the treaty and as an institution  responsible for ensuring the consistency of the Union's external  activities, the Commission has decided to bring this question  before the European Court of Justice.</p>

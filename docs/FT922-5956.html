			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Dutch education leads to higher output than UK PRODUCTIVITY in the Netherlands is higher than in Britain because of the superiority of Dutch education and training, according to National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In this month's National Institute Review, three researchers emphasise the relative inferiority of British workers in skill levels. Comparisons of manufacturing plants found Dutch productivity at least 30 per cent higher in engineering and more than 15 per cent higher in biscuits. The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research fellow - highlight three contrasts: higher emergency downtime in British plants, reflecting poor standards of machine maintenance and diagnostic skill; greater difficulty in maintaining product quality; and higher shopfloor manning levels in Britain because of a comparative shortage of workers able to switch between products and tasks. The researchers say that Dutch schools place greater emphasis on 'early systematic preparation for a career'; they achieve markedly higher standards in maths and science; and offer a vocational route which about a third of Dutch children follow after the age of fifteen. The Dutch require companies to give all those aged 16 to 17 two days' leave a week to attend college - but that affects only a minority because three quarters of students aged 17 to 18 remain in full-time education, half at intermediate-level vocational colleges. 'Dutch education has a much greater variety of secondary schools with highly differentiated curricula for pupils of different career ambitions and aptitudes,' they emphasise. The conclusions are similar to the institute's comparisons of British and German productivity. Explicit parallels between the Netherlands and Germany are drawn in the latest paper, which describes the Dutch model of full-time vocational schooling as 'a successful variant' of Germany's 'dual system' of apprenticeship training.</p>

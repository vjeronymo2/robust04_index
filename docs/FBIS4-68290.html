			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Fund for the Social Protection of Servicemen </F> President Reserve Major Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov by an  unidentified KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent: "Our Principle--An  Equal Partnership: Fund for the Social Protection of  Servicemen"]    [Text] There are currently many funds for the social  protection of servicemen. Yes and not all of them are of any  real benefit; many have given way to commerce...    But concern about military people essentially forms the  basis of the development and consolidation as a market structure  of the fund that is located in the capital's Smolenskaya-Sennaya  Ploshchad [Square]. But then again, the Fund for the Social  Protection of Servicemen President Reserve Major Erast  Aleksandrovich Galumov will discuss this in more detail.    Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov is a reserve major who was  born in 1958. He is a Tbilisi native. He graduated from Tbilisi  Higher Artillery Command School in 1979. He served in  TransBaykal and was released into the reserve due to reductions  in 1990. He is a businessman.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, the ritual question  is: Is the fund--also a technique for earning money?    [Galumov] That is not the main thing. You can earn--more and  more rapidly--by not founding a fund for social protection.  Moreover, the fund's founders do not have that urgent need--all  of them are successful businessmen.    Something else is essential. An enormous group of highly  qualified, disciplined, experienced people are leaving the  army's ranks. Some do not know where to go in the civilian  sector, others want to start their own businesses but do not  have start-up capital, and still others need organizational and  legal assistance... They can find all of that at our fund.    Recently, several junior officers, who will be released into  the reserve in the near future, visited my office. They have a  productive idea that permits them to develop a quite profitable  business but they have neither the money nor the experience of  "going into business". We are subsidizing them and we are  carrying out, speaking military language, organizational and  legal support at no charge, without requiring any dividends  whatsoever...    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Altruism? Is there a place for that in our  market?    [Galumov] The issue is not altruism. We know that an  enterprise that the fund can help to stand on its feet will  certainly begin to cooperate with it. This is not our first day  in the market and we have at our disposal commercial experience,  a data bank, ties in the world of finance (we are co-founders of  the Moscow City Bank), and a network of partners throughout the  country... And therefore, as partners, very promising.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] What are the primary directions of the  fund's activities?    [Galumov] They are varied. There is a broad spectrum of  legal  services. We are engaged in job placement. During the past year,  we helped people find work--in accordance with the skills and  requests of the very people who have been released into the  reserve--approximately 2,000 people. And the data base continues  to be augmented by enterprises' requests for reserve officers  whose cadre value is already universally recognized in our labor  market.    Investments occupy a large place in our plans. The  preference  is for regional investment programs. For example, right now we  are developing an investment program at a defense plant jointly  with the Russian Academy of Sciences. Incidentally, the regional  direction of our investment programs helps us to create locally,  figuratively speaking, "cadre subunits" that can immediately be  deployed and ensure rapid realization of larger programs in the  regions if necessary.    We are aggressively participating in purely scientific  projects. And major scientific institutions willingly cooperate  with us. Because we are uniting people who have gone through the  army school--those who, due to their professionalism, discipline  and ability to work under the most complex conditions, are worth  so much right now.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] But what socially oriented programs have  you already managed to carry out and what's in the plans?    [Galumov] In our view, philanthropy must have a precise  address. For example, we assumed responsibility for distinctive  pension support for some veterans of war and disabled people who  have lost the ability to work. We pay 50,000-500,000 rubles per  month in addition to the state pension of each one depending on  the specific situation. For the time being, we are allocating R5  million per month for this purpose. We recently conducted a  discharge sale at military hospitals at reduced prices. (We sold  goods at prices that were much lower than the purchase prices)...    What's in the plans? Let's put it this way: Let our  philanthropic acts become pleasant surprises for everyone.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, just how active in  the sphere of entrepreneurship are those reserve officers whom  you have helped?    [Galumov] They are active and this equally applies to Great  Patriotic War veterans' social organizations and to junior  "reservists". For example, branches of the fund in Vladivostok,  Khabarovsk, Chita, Bratsk, and Novosibirsk, that are led by  recent cadre officers, are operating with a high return and more  than 20 major commercial programs are in the stage of  realization today.    And, in general, I must tell you that our fund acts, and  let's hope, will act henceforth as a center of gravity for  former servicemen. We are our own people: Until recently we ate  from the same pot, we lived according to the same regulations  and according to the same code. We are loyal to it even today,  officer's honor. So we understand and trust each other. And  perhaps there is no other path--we need to jointly, shoulder to  shoulder, resolve all problems. Moreover, how many former  military personnel (currently entrepreneurs, frankly speaking),  are flailing around in our market, not knowing where to find a  place for themselves and becoming easy targets for any criminal.  We need to unite; we will be stronger and more confident. This  will be required; for the purpose of this unification, the fund  is prepared to offer in principle an equal partnership for  everything at its disposal: information support, the accumulated  experience of entrepreneurship, ties, and resources...    The address of the Fund for the Social Protection of  Servicemen is: Building 6, No 30, Smolenskaya-Sennaya Ploshchad,  Moscow. Contact telephone -- 241-21-71.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has urged the opposition to play  its constitutional role and adopt a path of understanding and  conciliation in the national interest. Speaking to reporters at  Parliament House in Islamabad this evening, Benazir Bhutto asked  the opposition to reconsider its decision to boycott the  National Assembly proceedings. The government wants the  opposition to make decisions in the interest of the people. She  said when the Northwest Frontier Province Assembly members  elected Pir Sabir Shah as chief minister, the Pakistan People's  Party [PPP] accepted the decision. Now that the same members  have decided to make Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao leader of the  house, the opposition should accept this decision. She  emphasized that everybody must follow the Constitution.    Answering a question on the opposition members submitting  their resignations to their leaders, the prime minister said the  speaker has not received any resignation from any member. She  asked the opposition leader not to speak about resignations, but  to make efforts at conciliation with the government. In  response to another query, Benazir Bhutto said that as prime  minister and former opposition leader, I invite the opposition  to return to the National Assembly. Answering yet another  question, she said democracy is in the hands of the people and  there is no danger to it. She said the opposition is taking  these steps because it is afraid of action against it. She said  that the PPP has been trying to establish the rule of law and  hold aloft the rights of the people. Her government has not set  up tribunals for disqualification in order to make the  opposition the target of a vendetta, as the former government  did during its tenure.</p>

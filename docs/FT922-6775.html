			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Technology: Tools at fault It sounds like a familiar story. Europeans are ahead of the Japanese and the US in a new machine tool technology - but the Japanese could once again take the lead. The issue is fault-tolerant control technology, a package of hardware and software that would enable a machine tool to function at higher performance, with greater precision, fewer breakdowns and reduced idleness. Most of the faults that stop a machine tool can be detected easily. But according to Piet Ephraim, of the Eastleigh-based company Stewart Hughes, it takes only five sensors to provide the 30-40 items of data required to monitor continuously the condition of a machine and forecast, or even prevent, most faults. Stewart Hughes and Macclesfield-based Amtri are behind developments that have brought the fault-tolerant technology project - originally part of an EC Esprit programme - to fruition. Amtri designed the most complex of the sensors that need to be fitted to the machines. Stewart Hughes developed the control system which processes the data coming from the different sensor systems and feeds back the results to the machine tool's own control unit. At one test site operated by Pegaso, the Spanish trucks company, the savings are expected to include a 60 per cent reduction in scrap parts and 40 per cent fewer stoppages in production. In the automotive industry, the average machine tool spends about 30 per cent of its possible running time not cutting metal, says Pierre Boisson, director of machine tool engineering at PSA, the French automotive group. The cost of incorporating the technology in a machine tool would add 5-10 per cent to its current sales price, according to Nicolo Vincenyo, director of innovation at Mandelli, the Italian machine tool builder. The question remains, though, whether European customers will accept the economic arguments for the technology, preventing yet another European machine tool advance from being thrown away.</p>

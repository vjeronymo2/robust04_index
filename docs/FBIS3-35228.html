			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First part of "text" of "Pledge and Accord Document" </F> drafted by the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee on 18  January -- numbering and lettering of paragraphs as published]    [Text]  <H5>  Preamble: </H5>   Praise be to God Who says: "And hold fast, all together, by  the rope Allah stretches out for you, and be not divided among  yourselves." [Koranic verse]    From 1 Jumadi al-Akhir to 7 Sha'ban 1414 Hegira,  corresponding to the period from 22 November 1993 to 18 January  1994, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee held continuous  meetings in both Sanaa and Aden in a determined and sincere  effort to contain the homeland's political crisis and to find  genuine solutions to advance the march of the blessed Yemeni  unity realized on 22 May 1990. This effort is intended to  strengthen unity and democracy and lay down firm and stable  foundations for the state of order, law, and institutions.    The Political Forces Dialogue Committee's effort began after  the political crisis and its repercussions went beyond all  acceptable boundaries. That effort was in response to an urgent  need for cooperation among all Yemenis to put a speedy and  decisive end to that crisis and its negative and harmful  consequences, which seriously threatened the homeland and the  people together, and their unity and cohesion. That crisis  threatened the people's national gains, which were realized  after many years of suffering and struggle, during which  caravans of martyrs offered their blood.    As a result of that crisis, Yemen inevitably seemed to the  entire world to be standing on the edge of an abyss. Basically,  that crisis was the outcome of a lack of confidence,  accumulating mistakes, serious transgressions and confusion in  tasks and authorities, and the failure to abide by the  Constitution and established laws and regulations. All this has  exacerbated the security and economic situation and gravely  harmed the people's way of life.    Painstaking and sincere efforts have been exerted to define  the steps and final rules for the return of stability and  security to the cherished Yemeni homeland. In order to avoid  the recurrence of what has happened, to safeguard unity, expand  popular participation in the making and implementation of  decisions, establish a true democracy that goes from the village  to the top of the state's hierarchy, and lay down strong bricks  in the building of a strong Yemeni state that safeguards rather  than threatens, and maintains resources rather than squanders  them, the dialogue committee drafted this document. This  document constitutes the sound beginning for the building of the  new Yemen, the Yemen of unity and freedom. The document shows  Yemeni wisdom and places reason and logic above all  considerations.    Having signed and announced this document to the Yemeni  people, all political parties declare their commitment to it and  to continuing all efforts to implement it in the way it  describes.    This national document covers the important issues addressed  by the political forces' dialogue. These are as follows:  <H5>  I. Those Charged in Cases of Security Violations: </H5>   1. Firm measures should be adopted to capture fleeing  suspects in incidents of assassinations, attempted  assassinations, highway robbery, and other security incidents.  Legal and public trials shall be held immediately for those who  have been captured in connection with acts of sabotage.  Fairness and speedy implementation of penalties shall be  ensured in these trials.    2. The dialogue committee stresses the contents of the  government's statement concerning measures for combating  domestic and foreign terrorism and for deporting non-Yemenis  proven to have carried out acts that contravene Yemen's policy  and laws or to have propagated or instigated such acts. All  those who are convicted after legal and public trials in which  fairness and the implementation of penalties are ensured should  be deported by competent authorities. Elements charged with  terrorism should not be allowed to be brought into or employed  in the country.    3. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee declares that it  stands firmly against any negligence or procrastination in the  adoption of firm legal measures by competent authorities against  those involved in acts of terrorism and sabotage.    4. Whoever shelters or hides a defendant concerning whom a  notice has been issued by the official agencies or an escapee  from prison shall be considered a law breaker, and legal  measures shall be taken against him.    5.

Such cases  shall be investigated by specialized, competent, and impartial  investigators, provided that the cases are referred to the  prosecutor's office as they take place.    7. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee stresses the  speedy issuance of the arms-carrying list and the organizing of  compliance with it. It stresses studying the current law with a  view to making it firmer in order to limit the carrying of arms,  their spread, and trading in them.    8.

Cities will be vacated by the Armed Forces, which will be  redeployed within a maximum period of two months in accordance  with a central redeployment plan prior to merging, redressing  their situation, and reorganizing these forces. The plan shall  be submitted by the Defense Ministry, approved by the Council of  Ministers, and ratified by the Presidential Council. The merger  operation shall not exceed a four-month period after the  implementation of the vacating and redeployment operation, which  is within the framework of building up a modern national army  that embodies national unity, and is in keeping with the  democratic course, free of all provincial, family, tribal, and  sectarian influence, incorporating all military units without  disrcimination or exception. Implementation will start after  the accord document is adopted and signed by the national  dialogue parties.    10.

Experience of the past  years since the proclamation of the establishment of the  Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way the  country was run obstructed the merger of the two previous  systems and the building of the unity state.    From this premise, the dialogue of the political forces has  sought to leave the crisis atmosphere behind and to proceed  within a serious democratic atmosphere that will achieve  stability and balanced economic and social development and that  will enhance national unity. That is why, in addition to the  general bases and principles, this document focuses on defining  the bodies of the central and local authorities, their  prerogatives and their tasks in order to prevent interference  and the intermingling of duties which causes confusion and leads  to crises.  <H5>  1. General Bases and Principles </H5>   The following bases and principles shall constitute the  foundation for building the state and its institutions to  establish a state where order and law prevails. These bases also  secure the establishment of a modern Yemeni state on the  following:    1. Islam as faith and law.    2. All powers emanate from the people. They exercise these  powers in a direct manner, or through a referendum and general  elections. They also exercise these powers in an indirect manner  through the legislative, executive, and judicial institutions  and through elected local councils.    3. The Republic of Yemen is an Islamic and Arab country and  Arabic is its official language.    4. Yemeni unity and republican system.    5. National unity is the basis for safeguarding and  enhancing  its pillars.    6. Democracy, the peaceful transfer of power, and political  and party pluralism.    7. Administrative and financial decentralization are part of  the bases of the system of government.    8. Protection of public liberties.    9. Respect for human rights.    10. Freedom of trade union and professional activities, as  well as of intellectual and cultural creativity.    11. Encouragement of scientific research in all walks of  life.   <H5>    II. The State Institutions: </H5>   It was one of the major targets of all participants in the  dialogue committee and of all proposals that have been submitted  to the committee to build the state, develop its institutions  and central and noncentral departments, and to complete the  issuance of its laws, regulations, and statutes. This is based  on their desire to rectify the course of our new unity and  democratic experiment and to build the state of law, order, and  institutions, a state that follows decentralized administrative  and financial methods to run the affairs of the united Yemeni  state. These methods should be able to absorb the state's  national requirements that are based on local government and its  law-governed specializations in the fields of development,  services, administration, and finance.  <H5>  III. The Central Authority Institutions: </H5> <H5>  1. The House of Representatives: </H5>   It is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen. It is  elected by the people through secret, free, and direct  balloting. The Constitution defines its authorities, tasks,  membership conditions, and nomination and voting methods.  <H5>  2. The Consultative Council: </H5>   It consists of an equal number of members representing local  government units and is elected by the provincial councils. The  Constitution specifies the number of Consultative Council  members from each administrative unit, membership conditions,  and nomination and voting methods. The Constitution defines the  specializations and tasks of the Consultative Council as follows:    1. To give advice on fundamental laws, especially the ones  concerning local government, as referred to it by the  Presidential Council, to which they are referred by the House of  Representatives. Afterward, such laws are issued by the  Presidency.    2. Together with the House of Representatives, it elects  members of the Presidential Council.    3. To give advice on the state draft budgets and the  economic and social development plans referred to it by the  government, before they are approved by the House of  Representatives. The council then sends its observations to the  government, which in turn refers the draft budget to the House  of Representatives after studying the council's observations and  proposals.    4. It elects members of the Republic's Higher Court. The  republic's judges present twice as many the number of nominees,  concerning whom a presidential decree is issued. [sentence as  published]    5.

It gives advice on treaties and border issues referred to  it by the government before it refers them to the council of  representatives.    9. To study any issue referred by the government to the  council.   <H5>    3. The Presidency: </H5>   The presidency represents the state's sovereign authority.  It consists of a five-member Presidential Council, jointly  elected by the House of Representatives and the Consultative  Council. The Presidential Council elects a chairman and a vice  chairman among its members.    -- Membership in the Presidential Council shall not exceed  two electoral terms.    -- The chairman, vice chairman, and members should not  pursue  any party work while serving as members of the Presidential  Council. (This does not apply to the current Presidential  Council members for the present term).    The Constitution defines the Council's powers and functions  as follows:    1. Representing the Republic domestically and abroad.    2. Inviting the voters for general elections at the  established date.    3. Dissolving the House of Representatives after holding  consultations with the Council of Ministers in accordance with  the article stipulated in the current Constitution.    4.

The Government </H5>   The Council of Ministers is the government of the Republic  of  Yemen. It is the state's supreme executive and administrative  agency. All of the state's executive administrations, agencies,  and institutions, without any exception, are affiliated with it.    By adopting administrative and financial decentralization,  the Government is responsible for foreign affairs, the Armed  Forces, the public security, the currency, and the sovereign  resources. It is also responsible for formulating the  financial, monetary, economic, social, and cultural policies and  for proposing draft laws and supervising their implementation.    The Government is fully and collectively answerable to the  House of Representatives.  <H5>  5. The Judiciary </H5>   The judiciary comprises the Republic's Supreme Court and the  courts specified by law, as well as the public prosecution. The  judiciary is fully independent. Members of the Supreme Court,  who must be practicing judges and lawyers qualified in Islamic  shari'ah and law, are elected by the Consultative Council for  life. The term of the Supreme Court's member expires with  either death or when the member reaches retirement, or when he  violates the profession's ethics. In this case, he shall be  dismissed and will never be allowed to work in the judicial  system. The Constitution and law shall specify the tasks and  powers, and methods of electing and dismissing members of the  judiciary.  <H5>  IV. Local Government </H5>   The desired local government system is based on  administrative and financial decentralization under the umbrella  of the single Yemeni state. It is also based on the principle  of large-scale popular participation in government and a  democratic course enhancing national unity. Citizens of the  republic in the various administrative divisions shall exercise  their constitutional rights and fulfill their duties in a way  that will enable them to engage in a positive competition to  build the edifice of the single Yemeni state through the  economic and social prosperity of its administrative units and  the establishment of justice, security, stability, and wellbeing.  <H5>  V. The Administrative Division </H5>   The local government is based on a new administrative  division of the Republic of Yemen that overcomes the existing  administrative structures and units, and which will help to  fully integrate the country in such a way that will terminate  all manifestations of fragmentation and emphasize national unity  and the new Yemen.    This division must be based on scientific principles that  take into account population and geographic factors and the  entire economic, social, and services conditions of the  population, and must provide the basic pillar for balanced  development. On that basis, the republic shall be divided into  four to seven administrative units called makhalif [provinces].  Sanaa, the political capital, and Aden, the economic and trade  capital, shall constitute independent administrative units  (municipalities). They both shall be considered separate legal  entities and shall enjoy financial and administrative  independence. They will have their own elected councils in  accordance with the principles and regulations specified by law.  The status of Aden as a free zone must be taken into  consideration.  <H5>  VI. Powers of the Local Government </H5>   The local government is based on the principle of direct,  free, and fair elections of its agencies. Councils of  government must be elected and enjoy full administrative and  financial powers that will enable them to run the  administrative, development, and services affairs of that unit  on the basis of positive competition within the framework of  unity. The task of building the country can be distributed by  moving some of the affairs of the central administration to the  local government agencies. These can be summed up as follows:   <H5>    Financial, Administrative, Economic, and Social Affairs </H5> <H5>  1. Administrative Affairs </H5>   The local government in the administrative units shall run  the affairs of the citizens and employees. The local government  is fully responsible for the issues of labor, education, health,  municipalities, social and economic affairs, and cultural  activities within the administrative unit in accordance with the  general policy of the state. The local government is also in  charge of road building, city planning, and other works that do  not fall within the framework of the state's sovereign tasks.  The local government is also in charge of organizing the  relationship with the central departments with regard to these  activities on the following bases:    a. General planning and supervision are the tasks of the  central administration.    b. Planning at the level of the administrative unit,  participation in the general planning, and full responsibility  for implementing these plans are the task of the local  government.  <H5>  2. Financial Affairs </H5>   Decentralization in the financial field is considered the  basis of the local government. This should produce high  efficiency in mobilizing financial revenues and higher  efficiency in utilization.    For further clarification, a line should be drawn between  the  resources that fall within the powers of the local government  and the ones that fall within the sovereign resources:  <H5>  The Sovereign Resources </H5>   -- Customs revenues.    -- Income taxes on the profits of companies working on the  level of the republic.    -- The state shares from the annual profits of the general  enterprises working on the level of the republic.    -- Returns on oil, gas, minerals, and fisheries.    -- Any other sovereign resources defined by the law.  <H5>  a. Water Resources </H5>   The water resources count as resources of the sovereign,  and,  therefore, their development and rationing use are of vital  importance. They should be developed and used in accordance  with rules and controls set out by law defining the relevant  responsibilities of the central and local governments.  <H5>  b. Local Resources </H5>   -- Local fees decreed by a decision issued by the  administrative unit in accordance with a law that defines the  powers and bases on which decisions are made and systems worked  out by the local councils.    -- Taxes on income, free enterprise, and commercial  activity in the context of the local unit.    -- Returns on economic activity in the context of the  administrative unit.    -- Alms.    -- Tax and fees on khat.    -- Tax on real estate    -- Traffic, transportation, and land fees.    -- Environment protection tax.    -- Support offered by the central budget.    These definitions are not exclusive; they are given by way  of  explanation only. Sovereignty and local resources shall be  defined by law.    Regarding spending, the spending listed in the annual budget  of the local unit includes the social services and economic  activity of the general units falling under the umbrella of the  local unit and other related activities. Local spending does  not cover items centrally funded, like key highways and other  transport systems linking units or strategic projects, such as  oil and gas and key minerals.    -- The Central Bank will set up branches in the  administrative units to handle part of its major functions.</p>

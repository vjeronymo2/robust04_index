			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / US trade groups puzzled by selection of Kantor THE election of Governor Bill Clinton to the presidency set off a gunfight among candidates for the US trade representative's job. When the smoke cleared, the victor was Mr Mickey Kantor, an able, energetic long-time political adviser to the Democratic candidate, chairman of the Clinton campaign and a novice in the international trade arena. The nomination was greeted with dismay by many in the US business community, who had hoped to get a Uruguay Round deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade done quickly and the increasingly controversial North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress. Mr Kantor's views on trade - if indeed he has any at all - are as undefined as those of the president-elect. In fact, when he was nominated at a press conference last week, the Californian lawyer was perhaps the only cabinet nominee to say nothing at all about the job he would hold if confirmed by Congress. It fell to Mr Clinton to explain that American economic security now depends on trade, but where there is opportunity there are also 'serious risks' to businesses, workers and the environment. The trade representative must ensure that America's trading partners 'play fair'. Clearly the job is a reward to Mr Clinton's old friend, who moved his family to Little Rock during the campaign. With Mr Clinton intent on choosing an ethnically and gender-correct cabinet, Mr Kantor - as a white male - could count himself fortunate to get a job. Opponents of both the Gatt deal and Nafta, on the left of the Democratic party, had hoped for a trade representative more ideologically attuned to their concerns about lost manufacturing jobs and the environment. Many farm groups want a total unravelling of the agriculture liberalisation deal so painfully negotiated by the US and EC this month. They were pleased with the nomination of Mr Mike Espy, a young black Mississippi congressman as US agriculture secretary, who they believe will give them access to decision-making. In Mr Kantor, however, they have an enigma. Mr Clinton himself speaks in favour of free trade but campaign operatives had a long list of changes they wanted in the Uruguay Round negotiating text and an apparent conviction that the 107 other Gatt members would be delighted to accommodate US views. Perhaps Mr Kantor will bring some new thinking to drive a path through the minefield of competing interests in Geneva and in Congress. Some of the most able trade representatives have been political pros - among them former Russian ambassador Mr Robert Strauss. Mr Kantor will follow another lawyer from California, Mrs Carla Hills. She, too, knew little about the intricacies of trade. He can be expected to also put in long gruelling hours to learn his brief. If he is untried as a trade negotiator, he did prove his mettle in another sphere. It was he who apparently out-negotiated Mr James Baker, the former secretary of state, in making arrangements for the televised campaign debate which paved the way for Mr Clinton's election victory.</p>

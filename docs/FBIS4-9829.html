			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Public Relations Secretariat of </F> the Presidency in Guatemala City on 2 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said the  government of the Republic hereby condemns the murder of Chief  Justice Eduardo Epaminondas Gonzalez, president of the  Constitutionality Court [CC], and has ordered an exhaustive  investigation into the incident. The president said he was a  close friend of the slain attorney, for whom he had great  respect. The president was appalled by this undescribable crime,  which has caused him great consternation. Such feelings are most  surely shared by the people of Guatemala.    We began an investigation as soon as we learned the news,  the  president added, assigning the case to the best investigative  specialists available to the security forces. De Leon Carpio  said the investigative teams have instructions to use all  resources at their disposal to capture the perpetrators. De Leon  added Gonzalez' death means the loss of a model Guatemalan  citizen, a jurist of renowned prestige, and a true defender of  democracy and peace. De Leon recalled that Justice Gonzalez, as  CC president, played a leading role last year by enacting the  resolutions that restored constitutional order following the  events of 25 May.    In condemning this crime, De Leon stated, the government  reaffirms its determination to press on with its efforts to  establish an atmosphere of security and coexistence in  Guatemala. He concluded by expressing his condolences to  Gonzalez' family, as well as his fellow justices, CC officials,  and administrative personnel, wishing them forbearance in this  moment of tragedy.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Social policy think tank to be relaunched THE SOCIAL Market Foundation, a think tank founded by supporters of the now defunct Social Democratic party, will be relaunched today with the backing of Mr David Sainsbury, one of Britain's wealthiest businessmen and a leading supporter of the SDP until its demise. The foundation will promote discussion of social policy in the framework of a capitalist market economy. The social market ideas espoused by Christian Democrats in Europe have attracted increasing interest among Conservative thinkers such as Mr Chris Patten. The foundation's new board includes two Conservative MPs who entered the Commons at the last election after serving as advisers to the prime minister: Mrs Judith Chaplin, who was Mr Major's private secretary, and Mr David Willetts, who was director of studies at the Centre for Policy Studies, the Conservative think tank founded by Lord Joseph and Mrs Thatcher. Mr Andrew Tyrie, a former Treasury adviser who worked for Mr Nigel Lawson and Mr Major, also joins the board. The board includes a wide range of other interests, including Mr Samuel Brittan, an assistant editor of the Financial Times, Professor John Kay of the London Business School and Ms Sue Slipman of the National Council for One-Parent Families. Reflecting the drift of many leading lights of the SDP towards Mr John Major's Conservative party, the foundation will be chaired by Lord Skidelsky, an SDP life peer who has recently taken the Conservative whip in the Lords.</p>

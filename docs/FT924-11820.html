			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Regulation of offshore oil fields is eased MR TIM EGGAR, energy minister, yesterday gave a boost to the North Sea oil industry by reducing regulation in order to speed up development of new fields. Mr Eggar, speaking at a conference in Aberdeen, said changes in procedure would streamline the system for approving field developments. He said: 'I am confident the changes will produce very real benefits for field operators and their partners, not only in terms of cost savings, but also in greater flexibility to meet their commercial objectives.' North Sea operators have been pressing for lighter regulation to enable them to develop more cheaply the smaller and less economic fields which now characterise the area. Mr Eggar's most important proposals were for officials from the Department of Trade and Industry to work within company project teams during consideration of some new developments, and for the DTI to make greater use of data and materials available within companies when assessing proposals. He also suggested that the DTI would concentrate its resources on the largest developments, while smaller ones would be subject to less rigorous assessment. Other proposals were: DTI officials would have greater authority to agree technical proposals during the evaluation of 'Annexe B' proposals (development proposals), to give an earlier indication of the department's position. Less information would be required by the DTI at all stages. Development consents would be tailored more closely to circumstances of the field concerned. The DTI would give more of the responsibility for monitoring operations to field operators, while itself taking a more selective role. Mr Harold Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore Operators Association, said he welcomed any move that would lessen the manpower, expense and time involved in meeting DTI require-ments. 'The department is moving to a less prescriptive formula and that is a very sensible development in view of the economic fragility of some of the new fields,' he said. 'What was appropriate for a massive platform in deep water may not be appropriate for a small, unmanned gas platform in the southern North Sea.' Mr Eggar announced the first award of North Sea production licences outside the usual licensing round procedure. Licences were awarded for blocks 39/1 and 39/2 to Amerada Hess and Premier Consolidated Oilfields because they were 'prospects which merited early exploration'. Mr Eggar said the arrangements were aimed to speed development of potential reserves.</p>

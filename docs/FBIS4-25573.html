			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lu Jen (7627 0086)] </F>   [Text] Since the beginning of this year, top CPC leaders  have pointed out on various occasions that the year 1994 is  crucial for China's reform and development, stressing that the  situation brooks no undue optimism. In a speech made at  the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission held in late February this year, CPC General  Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly stressed the need to develop a  "sense of crisis." Jiang's speech was so abridged that the  term "sense of crisis" and relevant content disappeared when  published by the news media, but the essentials of the speech  remained unchanged.  <H5>  Jiang Spoke About the Reasons for Developing a Sense of </H5> Crisis    In August last year, Jiang spoke about combating corruption  at the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, concentrating on making preparations for an  anti-corruption campaign. In a speech at the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission meeting in late February this year,  however, he mentioned the anti-corruption campaign in a more  serious manner and made a grimmer estimation of the situation.    In appraising the anti-corruption campaign last year, Jiang  said: "Corruption does exist in our party and government  departments and it continues to spread in some areas." "If we  treat the problem lightly and allow the malpractice to go  unchecked, our party, the people's political power, and our  socialist modernization drive will be doomed." Based on the  findings and prosecutions over the last six months, Jiang  admitted the problem was serious. "Corruption has penetrated  into many areas of our social life," "the crimes of abusing  power for personal gain and of perverting justice for bribes  have reached an appalling point."    After advancing nine specific opinions on combating  corruption, Jiang dwelt on the CPC's future. He pointed out  that the CPC would fall from power if it failed to make  achievements in promoting economic development or to hold  corruption in check despite its success in economic construction.    A source said the seriousness of a great number of  problems exposed by the anti-corruption campaign since last year  was well beyond the CPC hierarchy's expectations. This is one  of the reasons Jiang stressed the need to develop a sense of  crisis, the source added.    Aside from this, Jiang also mentioned other problems which  he  said could not be underestimated.    The Clinton administration's policy toward China aims at  achieving the same political evolution as that in the former  Soviet Union so that the CPC will step down and China will  become a dependency of Western countries. But Jiang maintained  that recent developments in Russia had not followed the course  expected by the West. The United States makes use of China's  human rights to find fault in a bid to achieve something through  pro-democracy activists. These pro-democracy activists are not  dangerous; so long as our comrades keep in step with the party  Central Committee politically, we can remove certain  destabilizing factors in time. As disclosed by Jiang, a certain  number of rather high-ranking leading cadres fail to keep in  step with the party Central Committee politically. Jiang warned:  We are clearly aware of this. Never suppose that we are in the  dark.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji Said "Approval Procedures Give Rise to Corruption" </H5>   Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau standing committee and vice premier, has spoken about  corruption in the economic field on many occasions since the  beginning of this year.    Zhu pointed out: Abuse of approval rights is a major  reason for corruption. Many people believed that Zhu's remark  referred to the serious and hardly suppressible corruption in  the economic field. China has not separated politics from  economics for a long time. Efforts have been made over the last  few years to separate the two, but with little success. The  functions of the administrative department have been basically  separated from those of enterprises in form, but various  approval procedures makes it possible for the administrative  department to rule the roost, subjecting enterprises to its  control. The fact that the administrative department requires  enterprises to apply for approval before they can go ahead with  their plans can only serve to prevent enterprises from  exercising their right to make their own management decisions,  thus leading to corruption. This is because such a  practise will allow power to be traded for money.    Zhu said while telling cadres in the administrative  department to correctly exercise their approval rights in the  public interest, we must simplify approval procedures. The  reform is aimed at lifting restrictions. This does not mean we  should do away with the approval procedures, but we should  minimize them. This is also essential to eliminating  corruption, Zhu added.    When commenting on China's property development, Zhu  called for early introduction of the system of appraising land  prices. We should appraise land prices on a scientific basis  and enlist the assistance of experts to act according to  economic laws, Zhu continued. Zhu pointed out that the right of  government officials to fix land price is also a cause of  corruption.  <H5>  Serious Inflation Brings High Pressure To Bear on Top CPC </H5> Leadership    China's excessive inflation, which constitutes a serious  problem, has applied high pressure to the CPC hierarchy. In his  1994 government work report to the NPC, Li Peng proposed to keep  the 1994 growth rate of retail prices below 10 percent.  Developments in the first quarter, however, indicate it will be  difficult to attain this intended goal.    According to the statistics released by the State  Statistical  Bureau, the economic growth rate has dropped to 9 or 10 percent  in the first quarter of this year, but the inflation rate has  continued to surge. Nationwide retail prices increased by 21  percent over the same time last year. The inflation rate was 13  percent nationwide last year. In June last year when  macro-controls were put into effect, the growth rate of retail  prices was only 12.5 percent.    China's present inflation bears two unprecedented features.  One, inflation is found in both urban and rural  areas. In the past, prices climbed in major and medium  cities, but they remained relatively stable in the countryside.  However, the countryside registers a two-digit inflation rate  now. Two, both old and young suffer from inflation.  In the past, only prices of consumption goods and charges for  services not essential to daily lives were affected, but people  have to pay more for the services and items of everyday use now.  The CPC hierarchy has realized that if the situation worsens,  economic order will be jeopardized and a large number of social  problems will follow.    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are said to  have held several meetings after national conferences of the NPC  and the CPPCC National Committee to study the current economic  situation. They have decided to control the total volume of  credit and of fixed assets investment to curb inflation and, at  the same time, to increase the deposit rate in compensation for  the people's losses incurred by the inflation. This  notwithstanding, the possibility of a galloping inflation cannot  be ignored.  <H5>  Presevation of Political and Economic Stability Is of </H5> Paramount Importance    In light of the present situation, the CPC has focused  on maintaining political and economic stability this year in  implementing the principle of "reform, development, and  stability." Many economic reform measures which were to be  introduced this year have been put off. In the political field,  the CPC will conduct positive ideological education and take  strong measures against destabilizing factors to eliminate them  in the bud.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The China Dialectics of Nature Research Society,  the Heilongjiang Provincial Scientific and Technological  Association, the provincial economic and trade society, and the  provincial Dialectics of Nature Research Society, cosponsored  the seminar which was held in Harbin today on the present  situation and prospects for developing economic and trade  relations with CIS countries. Over 60 specialists and  representatives from six provinces and cities across the  province studied the issues on the influence that the political  and economic situations of CIS countries impose on us, the  current existing problems in border and local trade,  countermeasures for this, and prospects for developing  cooperation with the south and opening up the north, and on the  basic role they may play.    During the seminar, Vice Governor Wang Zhongzhang  emphatically pointed out: At present, the difficulties which we  have met in our economic and trade work are temporary. These  difficulties are not caused naturally. We should unswervingly  implement the measure proposed by the provincial party committee  on attaching strategic importance to opening the border areas to  the outside world, do a good job in readjusting the trade items,  strengthen economic and technological cooperation, accelerate  the pace of building our province into an international main  channel, establish long-term economic and trade relations with  foreign countries, and promote continued development of foreign  economic and trade relations in our province.    More than 40 academic theses and research reports were  submitted to the seminar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- The decision to  withdraw South African Defence Force [SADF] troops from Thokoza  on the East Rand "was not working", Archbishop Desmond Tutu said  in a statement on Tuesday. Archbishop Tutu said the conflict in  Thokoza had been brought under control by the SADF in recent  months, but it had again intensified since the withdrawal to the  point when 19 people had died violently since the weekend.    The church, said Archbishop Tutu, had supported the  formation  of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], but the NPKF was  being asked to do an impossible job.    "Reports from church members indicate there is a strong  desire that the SADF should return and we call on the  Transitional Executive Council as a matter of urgency to send  the soldiers back."</p>

This  time the heads of 19 republics, autonomous okrugs, krays, and  oblasts from the Siberian region met in Omsk.    Having exchanged opinions, the members of the coordinating  council concluded that different territories share many common  problems. In this sense the experience of one of the programs  of "Siberian Accord" -- Omsk conversion -- is particularly  noteworthy. Despite the fact that only one-third of the funds  required to implement the program have been allocated, the  conversion program has nonetheless commenced. And it is already  possible to speak of practical results. These include the An-74  -- the first Omsk aircraft -- a tractor, and television sets.    But, sadly, everything could end there. Because there is not  enough money to start series production of the new articles and  goods. It is in this area that a common solution must be found,  along with an answer to the question of what should be done  next. If the country needs this aircraft, it means that we  should pool the financial interests of all the region's oblasts.  The coordinating council members viewed this means of  integrating funds on mutually advantageous terms as one of the  options for developing industry. Admittedly, other proposals  were made too -- to appeal once again to the government to  allocate money. But these suggestions were not supported by the  majority, since there have already been many such appeals, but  they have had little effect.    The conference participants adopted several fundamental  decisions. These included the creation of new  financial-industrial groups and an integrated data base, and so  forth.    An organizational matter was addressed too. The new  coordinating council chairman was elected. He is Valeriy  Roshchulkin, deputy head of the Omsk Oblast Administration. The  former council chairman -- Leonid Polezhayev -- has become the  head of the interregional association.</p>

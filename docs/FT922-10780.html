			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / US insurer to pay Dollars 157m for sex bias STATE FARM, the largest car insurance company in the US, has agreed to pay Dollars 157m (Pounds 88.7m) to settle sex discrimination charges. The settlement relates to legal action brought against the Illinois-based company's Californian operation, and centres on hiring policies for independent sales agents which existed in the 1970s. The State Farm settlement will be shared by 814 women. There have been larger individual awards in sex discrimination cases  - a Californian court awarded Dollars 20.7m in damages to a Texaco employee  - but yesterday's agreement is thought to be one of the largest totals paid to settle such charges. The original lawsuit was brought against State Farm in 1979, alleging the insurer had discriminated against women applicants seeking sales agent positions in California. In 1985 a judge found the company liable, and the question of damages was addressed. At first an attempt was made to assess these on an individual basis, via a trial process. However, according to State Farm, after two years only 150 cases had been considered, prompting a new effort to reach an overall settlement. This resulted in the current agreement.</p>

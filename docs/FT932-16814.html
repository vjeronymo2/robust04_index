			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Fokker slips to Fl 20m FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft producer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent drop in 1992 net profits and warned that prolonged recession and the cost of planned redundancies would further depress this year's results. Net profits fell to Fl 20m (Dollars 11.17m), from an adjusted Fl 77m, on sales of Fl 4.08bn. Operating results were steady at Fl 131.3m, against Fl 134.6m in 1991. Final earnings were depressed by heavy financing costs, up from Fl 62m to Fl 126m. The group will forgo a dividend payment for the year. Fokker, in which Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary is to take a majority stake, recently unveiled plans to cut production and trim its workforce by 2,118 from the present 12,500 by year-end. The job cuts are expected to save the group some Fl 270m in annual wages, but will initially entail heavy, but as-yet undetermined, costs.</p>

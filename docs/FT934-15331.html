			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Markets wait for German court decision on Emu EUROPEAN bond markets were quiet yesterday as participants eyed today's ruling by the German Constitutional Court on the Maastricht treaty for European monetary union (Emu). Moreover, holidays in Japan, the US and Canada kept a lid on activity, leaving prices to drift lower on moderate volume. While Germany's supreme court is widely forecast to rule in favour of the treaty, many expect it to attach provisos which could further delay the timetable for Emu and undermine the weaker currencies in Europe's exchange-rate mechanism (ERM). These expectations triggered some unwinding of trades based on European economic convergence and sparked speculative switching into German assets, causing bunds to outperform most markets and reinforcing the D-Mark. After a short-lived breach of key resistance at 100 - hitting a record high at 100.02 - the December Bund future drifted lower to end at 99.76. The Bundesbank's call for repo tenders is likely to be closely watched today. Most market participants expect another two-week repo at a 6.70 per cent fixed rate and a variable-rate four-week repo, in spite of speculation last week that both tranches could be offered at variable rates. With payment on the government's new bunds due Friday and October tax payments beginning to drain money-market liquidity this week, 'a reversion to variable-rate repos on the shorter tranche could risk a small rise in the minimum rate which the Bundesbank probably would wish to avoid', said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior German economist at MMS International. Elsewhere, the government today will issue 10-year bunds via the federal bond consortium, with another portion to be auctioned tomorrow. Traders are betting on a 6 per cent coupon and expect the issue to total DM10bn. UK gilts drifted lower in line with most European markets and the December long gilt contract slipped  5/32 to 114 9/32 . Remembering how higher-than-expected August inflation data had sent gilts tumbling last month, many investors remained nervously sidelined ahead of tomorrow's release of September RPI. Participants are eyeing Friday's announcement of the next gilts auction, with many traders expecting a new five-year benchmark for next year. IN France, the December notional bond futures contract eased 0.04 point to 123.98 on moderate turnover. Traders reported some switching into bunds out of OATs, which caused French 10-year bonds' yield premium over bunds to widen to six basis points from two basis points on Friday. DANISH bonds were the day's only winners, with the 10-year benchmark bond rising 0.30 of a point after the central bank cut its leading interest rates by  1/2 point. Denmark has taken advantage of its new latitude to cut rates independently of the Bundesbank, aided by the strength of the krone, since the fluctuation bands for most ERM currencies were widened to 15 per cent on August 2. BELGIAN bonds posted the biggest losses, with the 10-year benchmark bond falling nearly  1/2 point on the day. The 10-year yield premium over bunds rose to 133 basis points, from 126 basis points on Friday. Nevertheless, Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, feels 'there is good value for medium-term investors with the spread around 130 basis points'. For one, Mr Hall argues, the market has discounted much of the uncertainty over the likelihood of a social pact. Moreover, he expects a compromise pact to be delivered, and while it may not solve all of Belgium's problems, it will defuse the threat of an outright debt crisis. He warned that a failure on the pact could push the spread out to 150 basis points and recommended that 'more cautious investors wait until we see what the pact actually looks like'. The report from the committee of experts charged with preparing the social pact talks is expected to be published next week.</p>

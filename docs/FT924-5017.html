			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A scheme with benefits for all - Planning Your Pension / Marilyn McKeever and Tony Foreman on the virtues of FURBS A FUNDED unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) offers tax benefits with flexibility to both senior executives and their employers and looks set to become a useful element in the remuneration packages of high earners. How does it work? For executives: It can be set up for individuals so that the fund is earmarked for them. They pay income tax on the company's payment to the FURBS as if they had received a bonus. Once funds are in the FURBS, the investments made are subject to a maximum rate of income and capital gains tax of only 25 per cent. The normal restrictions on benefits from pension schemes imposed by the Inland Revenue do not apply. Accordingly, there are no limits on the amount of the benefits under a FURBS. There is great flexibility as to when the executive can take those benefits, and all can be taken as a lump sum. There is no tax liability when, eventually, they cash in their FURBS for a lump sum. If they die before cashing in the FURBS, the whole fund can be paid to their family free of inheritance tax. What does a FURBS offer for employers? They will get tax relief when they makes a contribution to the FURBS in the same way as if they paid salary or a bonus. They will not normally be liable for the 10.4 per cent National Insurance contributions which they would pay if they increased the executive's salary or paid him a bonus. It can be used as a 'golden handcuff.' The scheme rules can be framed so that the executive benefits only if he stays with the employer for a specified period. A FURBS will be particularly attractive for an executive who has a greater salary than he needs for his living requirements and can save some of the excess. Provided that the employer's contributions to the FURBS take account of the fact that the executive will pay tax on them, the up-front tax charge need not be a disincentive. So, how can a FURBS complement other tax-favoured investments? There is, of course, a place for investments such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) in an executive's portfolio but, by their nature, such investments generally are limited in amount or relatively inflexible. FURBS are not limited. Nor is a FURBS intended to replace an approved pension scheme. It can, however, complement an approved scheme in providing funds for retirement investment and in tax planning generally. The benefits payable under an approved scheme always have been limited by reference to the employee's salary at or near retirement. The maximum permitted pension is only two-thirds of that final salary figure, and there also are restrictions on the amount of the benefits which can be taken as a lump sum. In 1989, the government imposed a 'cap' on the amount of final salary which could be used to calculate pension benefits. The present cap is Pounds 75,000, so the maximum possible pension that can be paid under an approved scheme is Pounds 50,000 while the maximum lump sum is Pounds 112,500. This applies whatever the executive's salary. Further, the Revenue prescribes a minimum age from which a company may pay an approved pension. This is usually 50. Pension schemes can be very valuable and sometimes are worth more than the employing company itself. In the past, private companies have been able to use schemes as a source of corporate finance but now there are stringent restrictions on investment by most approved schemes in the employer company. None of these difficulties applies to a FURBS. Contributions and benefits can be of any amount. Indeed, the rules relating to unapproved schemes were relaxed at the same time as the cap was introduced, with the object of letting employers provide additional retirement benefits for their high earners through unapproved arrangements. FURBS can, thus, be used to 'top-up' the pension from an approved scheme where this would be inadequate to support the executive in retirement. A FURBS also is much more flexible than an approved scheme where it is used as part of the employee's general investment and tax-planning strategy. An employee can 'retire' at any time and any age, and the meaning of 'retirement' is wider than you might think. It includes retiring from one job and taking up another. Even if an executive continues in the same employment, he can still take his benefits under a FURBS where there is a change in the conditions of his employment. The employee may also receive his benefits if the scheme is wound up - something that can happen at any time. In addition, the whole of the fund which has built up for the executive's benefit can be taken as a tax-free lump sum. A FURBS will be particularly attractive to private companies. The investment restrictions which apply to approved schemes are irrelevant so far as unapproved arrangements are concerned. A FURBS has many benefits. As part of a tax-efficient remuneration package, it will help an employer to recruit and retain high-flying employees. It is an attractive investment vehicle for the employees themselves. It can supplement an otherwise restricted pension from an approved scheme. And a director/shareholder of a private company can take advantage of the tax breaks offered by a FURBS while using it as a source of finance for the company.

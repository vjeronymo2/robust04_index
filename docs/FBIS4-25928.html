			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Dialogue is Better Than Confrontation"] </F>   [Text] These days, the Korean nuclear issue has become the  focus of much interest and conversation again among officials in  the United Nations. This March, the Korean nuclear issue, which  had been going in a positive direction, began to take a sudden  change due to the differences in views between the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the DPRK regarding the  replacement of fuel rods.    On 10 June, the IAEA decided to suspend its plan for  technological coordination with the DPRK on investigating  plutonium and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. On the other  hand, the DPRK side announced its decision to immediately  withdraw from the IAEA.    Carrying out busy activities inside and outside the United  Nations, the United States hopes that the UN Security Council  will impose sanctions against the DPRK. People have not  forgotten that the United States repeatedly [words indistinct]  for this purpose. However, the U.S. assertion failed to win  recognition from the international community. Many in U.S.  political and social circles disagree this view.    The Chinese delegation [to the United Nations] persistently  opposed dealing with the Korean nuclear issue at the UN Security  Council. It also opposed UN Security Council moves to adopt a  resolution, including sanctions, regarding the issue.    The Chinese delegation repeatedly indicated that the United  States, the IAEA, the DPRK, the ROK should remove differences in  opinion and solve problems through dialogue and negotiations.  The Chinese delegation also indicated that threat, blackmail,  and pressure would not help solve problems, but would bring  about destructive consequences because they may intensify  conflict.    Based on such principles, when the chairman of the UN  Security Council announced a statement regarding the Korean  nuclear issue, the Chinese delegation, in view of the  contemporary specific situation and proceeding from its  constructive attitude, immediately clarified the Chinese  Government's position toward the issue and expressed the hope  that parties concerned should continue negotiations to seek  reasonable ways for solving the issue.    Facts prove that (?a series of negotiations) for solving the  Korean nuclear issue, though faced with many difficulities, have  eventually developed gradually into a positive direction.    When the United States and the DPRK made a principled  agreement in June last year, the DPRK side announced its  suspension of the unilateral decision to withdraw from the  Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. As the DPRK achieved new success  in negotiations with the IAEA and the United States, on 15 and  25 June of this year, respectively, inspections of nuclear  facilites in the DPRK were conducted, and, accordingly, all  duties were completed.    Differences in views and difficulties have been created  again  now over the replacement of fuel rods. However, such  differences in views and difficulties are only momentary.  Therefore, a certain amount of room and and some possibility  remains for a solution of the issue.    In the Korean nuclear issue, China has persistently adhered  to two basic goals, namely, the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and the preservation of peace and stability on the  Korean peninsula. This assertion has become the common  recognition of the member states of the UN Security Council and  won support from the international community.    If relevant parties sincerely make constant efforts to  acheive these two goals, they can remove differences in their  views gradually and achieve mutual understanding.    The most important thing at the present time is that  relevant  parties assume a prudent and patient attitude. There is a  Chinese proverb which says "When one gets angry one should seek  reason and when one is in danger one should observe (?decorum)."  If one clings to sanctions and pressure tenaciously and uses  rash threat by force of arms simply because of momentary  (?difficulties), the positive success achieved in the  negotiations of the (?three parties) will end in failure and  tension will be aggravated again.    The international community does not want to see the  consequences that may result from closing the door of  negotiations and will not accept them. The aggravation of the  situation on the Korean peninsula will not only create a great  shock in the Northeast Asian region, but also pose a threat to  world peace and stability.    The problem is very grave. Therefore, the parties concerned  should prudently ponder over it and [words indistinct].    Sanctions and threat are, in actuality, of no use, and  sincere and patient negotiations are the most reasonable  measure. Dialogue is better than confrontation.</p>

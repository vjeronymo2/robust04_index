In particular, we read in a release from the League's press  office that the "worrying" approach taken by President of the  Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro toward PDS Secretary Achille  Occhetto is open to criticism. "The Northern League," we read  in the communique, considers as unacceptable the statements made  by PDS member of parliament Correnti, for whom "justice is too  serious a matter to be left in the hands of the judiciary," and  is even more concerned at the intervention of the head of state  who, after convening the chairmen of the lower house and the  Senate to the Quirinale [president's palace], felt obliged to  reassure Occhetto, explaining to him that he himself was acting  as guarantor of a correct and calm outcome of the election  campaign, with the responsible assistance of all the organs of  state, the judiciary included, evidently."    The memo also includes several statements by Roberto Ronchi,  in charge of the political secretariat, who wonders "why  Scalfaro did not show a similar concern when, during the past  electoral campaigns, other political forces were involved."  "The League genuinely hopes," Ronchi wrote, "that this  election, which is so important for the future of our country,  will not be disturbed by the final thrashings of a style of  politics now in its death throws."</p>

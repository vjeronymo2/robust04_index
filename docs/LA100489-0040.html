			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTINY NOT A U.S. OPERATION, BUSH ASSERTS  </P> <P> President Bush said Tuesday that the failed coup in Panama was not "an American  operation" but that the Administration supported the aims of the insurgents,  and the White House said the United States was informed in advance of the  planned uprising.  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, an unusual alliance of Republicans and Democrats criticized  Bush for failing to order the U.S. military to assist the rebels to overthrow  Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler.  </P> <P> "There were rumors around that this was some American operation, and I can tell  you that is not true," Bush told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with  Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov.  </P> <P> However, moderates such as Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and Sen. Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and conservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and  Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) joined to attack the Administration for doing too  little to help the insurgents.  </P> <P> Mounting frustration in Congress over the nation's narcotics crisis apparently  overcame the usual wariness of military intervention in Latin America. Noriega  is under indictment in Florida on charges of drug trafficking.  </P> <P> "Here you have brave people in Panama trying to rid themselves of a drug dealer  and thug who's taken over their country; and for the United States, with all of  our strength and force and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by just two  miles away as the crow flies and do nothing and allow these people to fail,  personally I think is wrong," said Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence  Committee.  </P> <P> Talking to reporters after receiving a CIA briefing on the failed coup, Boren  said, "Today we had an insurrection of some very courageous people . . . and  the United States did nothing."  </P> <P> Boren, who opposed a Reagan Administration plan for covert action against  Noriega, said Bush should have ordered U.S. military intervention while the  rebels held the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missed Opportunity  </P> <P> Hyde, who is the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said  Bush missed a perfect opportunity to have the kind of success in Panama that  Reagan had in Grenada, where U.S. troops and Caribbean allies unseated a  socialist regime.  </P> <P> "It seemed to be a golden opportunity to resolve the Noriega problem," Hyde  said. "We had a legitimate justification (to move in militarily). We should  have taken advantage of it -- exploited it."  </P> <P> DeConcini, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, "I would hope  that the President would have some plans to use military action, but I know of  none."  </P> <P> Helms startled fellow senators Tuesday night during a session on anti-drug  legislation when he introduced an amendment that would authorize Bush to use  U.S. armed forces to remove Noriega from power and bring him to the United  States to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> Helms said his sources had told him that at a crucial moment during the  abortive coup in Panama, the United States had rejected a request for military  aid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like Keystone Cops'  </P> <P> "We were like a bunch of Keystone cops bumping into each other," Helms said.  </P> <P> The amendment he introduced read:  </P> <P> "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President is authorized to use  the armed forces of the United States to secure the removal of Gen. Manuel  Antonio Noriega from his illegal control of the Republic of Panama in order to  (a) bring Gen. Noriega to trial in the United States under the terms of his  February, 1988, indictments on drug-trafficking charges, (b) protect the Panama  Canal treaties of 1978, (c) protect the people of Panama in their struggle to  rid their nation of the brutal oppression of the Noriega regime and (d) restore  a constitutional government to Panama."  </P> <P> The Senate postponed a vote on Helms' proposal until today at the earliest.  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he is concerned that Helms' amendment  could give the President the power to declare war without congressional  approval. "I am reluctant to give what appears to be a blank check," Biden  said.  </P> <P> At one point, Helms said he was ready for a vote and was not delaying the work  of the Senate. Biden replied: "The senator has not tied up the Senate tonight,  but he clearly has confounded it."  </P> <P> Speaking before it became clear that the coup against Noriega had failed, Bush  appealed directly to Panamanian soldiers to support the uprising. Mindful that  the American Cable News Network is widely watched in Panama, the President  said: "We have no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces. . . . We've had  good relations with the Panamanian Defense Forces, and our argument has been .  . . with Mr. Noriega."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government received  "advanced reports and rumblings" that a coup was imminent, but he said the  United States was not asked for help. A congressional source said the  Administration was informed at least as early as Monday of coup plans.  </P> <P> The congressional source said the Administration "encouraged the Panamanians to  believe that they would have military backup from the United States. . . . They  were led to believe that they'd have military support."  </P> <P> Administration officials refused to answer the question of whether the United  States had encouraged the coup, either explicitly or tacitly.  </P> <P> "We're just going to dodge that issue," one official said.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States has long sought  Noriega's overthrow, although he said Washington did not "instigate" the coup  attempt.  </P> <P> Under the Panama Canal treaties, the United States maintains a garrison of  about 12,000 troops in Panama, far outnumbering the Panamanian military.  However, the Pentagon has been careful not to involve the U.S. forces in  Panama's internal politics, in part to avoid alarming the governments of other  nations that grant base rights to the United States.  </P> <P> Although a bipartisan group on Capitol Hill said the Administration should have  used troops because of the drug charges against Noriega, other lawmakers from  both parties disagreed. For instance, California Rep. Anthony C. Beilensen  (D-Beverly Hills), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he  doubted that the United States could have done anything to assure the victory  of the coup.  </P> <P> "The President doesn't have many options," he said. "He's not doing very much,  but he couldn't do very much."  </P> <P> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who has previously criticized U.S. policy  toward Panama, said he would not have supported intervention by U.S. forces.  "Certainly to say we should have flown into the middle of a fire-fight --  that's not something I think we could do," he said.  </P> <P> Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a frequent critic of the Administration's  Latin American policy, praised Bush for his restraint. Speaking at a press  conference when it appeared that the coup had succeeded, Dodd said: "There were  those who advocated that the United States take unilateral action. President  Bush rejected those suggestions, worked through the Organization of American  States, worked through regional governments and built the kind of support that  isolated Gen. Noriega and that ultimately, it appears, caused his downfall."  </P> <P> Although Fitzwater denied any U.S. military involvement, he said the troops of  the U.S. Southern Command stationed in Panama "took steps to protect U.S.  citizens, property and treaty rights under the Panama Canal treaty."  </P> <P> "We had helicopters that were in the air observing, and we had some troops  around one of the causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth,"  he added.  </P> <P> For months, the Administration has been demanding Noriega's ouster, often  suggesting that the Panamanian military should do the job.  </P> <P> Bush, in an interview with reporters aboard Air Force One on May 13, encouraged  the army to overthrow Noriega, saying: "I would love to see them get him out. .  . . The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of  these Doberman thugs (a reference to the nickname given Panamanian riot-control  troops). That's what I'm saying."  </P> <P> On Monday, after the Administration was informed of coup planning, according to  some sources, Bernard Aronson, the State Department's top Latin American  specialist, hinted at Panamanian military action.  </P> <P> "We are told that opposition within the army is developing, and we hope that  will lead to the restoration of democracy," he told a group of reporters  Monday. "When that set of pressures will reach a critical mass that will have  an effect, I can't tell you."  </P> <P> Despite the failure of the coup, the White House said the United States will  keep the pressure on Noriega and continue to try to bring him to trial on  drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> "Nothing's changed," Fitzwater said. "Everything remains the same. We'll  continue to press for Noriega's removal."  </P> <P> Elliott Abrams, chief Latin American specialist in the Reagan Administration,  said: "I think you can make a good case that we should have pushed and tipped  the balance. I think it was a mistake under the Reagan Administration (not to  use U.S. force), and it's still a mistake today. There has been a great  reluctance to use American power against Noriega. I think that's one of the  reasons Noriega is still there after a year and a half of our jabbering at  him."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Doyle McManus, James Gerstenzang and Stanley Meisler  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

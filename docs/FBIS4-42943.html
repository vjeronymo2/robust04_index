			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman  Demirel on Thursday [9 June] said that Azerbaijan has suffered  great losses from the Armenian invasion, adding responsible  countries should not remain spectators to this situation.    He called it a crime against humanity that the country  should  be left in this situation adding that 1.2 million people have  become refugees and that a very harsh winter has led to heavy  losses.    Demirel said that it is unacceptable that a country seizes  another country's territories by force and in this situation it  is impossible that Turkey establish good relations with the  invading country, Armenia.    He said Turkey will take steps to bring peace in the region  and will continue to voice the injustices done to Azerbaijan,  adding he will take up the issues during his meeting with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said that a number of  agreements have been signed with two friendly countries Turkey  and Azerbaijan and that bilateral high level meetings are also  contributing to the development of relations.</p>

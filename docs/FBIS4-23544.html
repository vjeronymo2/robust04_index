			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Truth Commission -- "The move by Justice Minister Dullah  Omar  to establish a Commission of Truth and Reconciliation is  welcome, with one major reservation. The commission must -- if  it is 'to enable South Africa to come to terms with its past' --  be evenhanded," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 9  June in a page 12 editorial. "A truth commission will fail if  it seeks to extracts confessions from only one side as a  prerequisite for indemnity." "State officials who committed  atrocities against anti-apartheid activists should not be  allowed to apply for and be granted indemnity in secrecy  ....but, by the same token, so must the killers, bombers and  torturers in ANC ranks be fully exposed and forced to  acknowledge their role in the abuse of human rights." "There are  auspicious signs, too, that Omar will reject the sweeping  definition of a political offence in the Further Indemnity Act.  The definition must not allow people motivated by racial  bigotry and blood-lust to escape punishment by labelling their  actions 'political'. Too wide a definition will stain the book."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Truth Commission -- "Proposals to deal with any country's  secret security operations pose major moral, practical and  philosophical problems, particularly to new governments," begins  the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 9 June in a page 8  editorial. Plans to create a truth commission "is sure to be  welcomed but will also raise many questions. It is necessary  for reconciliation for crimes against the people to be made  public, but the problem arises as to the process after these  revelations." "It would seem rather unfortunate that men who  committed the most heinous acts on helpless victims of a  political situation should be allowed to get off so easily."  <H8>  CITIZEN </H8>   Truth Commission -- "As we feared and warned against, the  government is going to set up a Truth and Reconciliation  Commission," states the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 8  June in a page 6 editorial. "We think the Truth Commission will  be an inquisitorial body to 'smell out' those who allegedly  committed atrocities and force them to make public penance for  their deeds (unless, of course they volunteer to disclose their  crimes and seek forgiveness). How this brings about  reconciliation is beyond us. Eighteen months to two years of  this kind of inquisition will keep all the hatreds alive,  instead of helping to reconcile differences and bring about an  end to the bitterness of the past." "It is also clear from Mr.  Omar's remarks that atrocities committed by the ANC during its  armed struggle will not require accounting before the Truth  Commission, but the offences of those who killed ANC members or  subjected them to 'dirty tricks' will be." If the government is  not evenhanded, then the commission will be seen as an ANC  "vendetta."    Government Urged To Trust De Klerk -- "Deputy President De  Klerk must wondering why his major partner in the government has  taken to querying decisions he made while he was State  President," states an editorial on page 6 of the 7 June edition  of THE CITIZEN. The first queried decision was the deal with  Mangosuthu Buthelezi that transferred land to Zulu King  Zwelithini. Most recently, De Klerk's judgment was questioned  when it was disclosed that he granted indemnity to security  force operatives. "What is most disturbing," concludes THE  CITIZEN, "is the fact that Mr De Klerk's bona fides are brought  into question. If the ANC trusts him, why call him to account  for decisions he validly took while State President? Put  another way, how can there be a government of national unity  when there is disunity over such issues?"</p>

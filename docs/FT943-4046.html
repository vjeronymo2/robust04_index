			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Short and sweet Because of recent speculation about possible base rate increases, investors have become wary of buying into long-term, fixed-rate products. Building societies have responded by offering much more attractive short-term investments. Halifax raised its Guaranteed Reserve fixed rates by half a percentage point on average last week. New three-year fixed products were introduced this week by Northern Rock, Dunfermline and Coventry. Dunfermline has launched a three-year Caledonia bond to coincide with its move to a new head office. It pays 8 per cent gross on Pounds 5,000 and above. Northern Rock, which issued its new three-year fixed account earlier in the week at 8.75 per cent from Pounds 2,500, has been leapfrogged by Coventry, which is paying 8.80 per cent on Pounds 5,000 with a monthly option at 8.45 per cent. Escalator bonds continue to flourish. Barclays has launched its own version, with rates starting at 6 per cent for the first year and rising to 12 in the fifth. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. The market leader, however, is the new Step-Up bond from Portman. On a minimum balance of only Pounds 500, it pays yearly interest of 7 per cent in year one, rising to 8 in year two, 9 in year three, 10 in year four and 12 in year five. Halifax International in Jersey has increased all rates on its Fixed Rate International account by up to 1.1 percentage points, making it the offshore market leader in terms of one to five years. The highest rate now available is 8.7 per cent annually for five years on Pounds 50,000.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Upturn in US helps Monsanto lift to record Dollars 194m in quarter Monsanto, the St Louis-based chemical group, yesterday said the cyclical upturn in the US economy and a strong performance by its herbicide business helped lift profits to record levels in the first quarter. Net income in the first three months of 1994 climbed 38 per cent to Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.17, in the year-earlier quarter, when the company realised an after-tax gain of Dollars 22m, or 18 cents. The results exceeded Wall Street's consensus forecast of Dollars 1.53 a share, but the stock made only modest progress on the announcement. In early trading on the New York stock market, the share price added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 76 1/8 . Mr Paul Raman, an analyst with SG Warburg in New York, said Monsanto's improved profitability reflected cost cutting as well as strong growth in sales volume. Consolidated net revenues came in at Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.94 in the first 1993 reporting period. In its agricultural division, the growing popularity of Roundup, an herbicide that allows farmers to clear land without tilling, lifted operating income by 37 per cent. Better-than-expected sales of BST, a controversial new hormone that increases milk production by cows, helped offset lower prices for most products, especially in Europe. Mr Raman said early acceptance of BST suggested it could become 'Monsanto's new home-run product', with the potential to grow into a Dollars 500m business within three or four years. In chemicals, US economic expansion in the second half of last year, and improving conditions in Europe, fed through as a 70 per cent surge in first-quarter operating income. Monsanto benefited from robust demand in automotive and housing sectors, improved productivity and more efficient utilisation of factory capa-city. The Searle pharmaceuticals division returned to profitability with an operating profit of Dollars 12m, after posting a Dollars 27m loss a year ago. But the NutraSweet aspartame business slipped 15 per cent to Dollars 29m, despite efforts to cut costs and boost market share.</p>

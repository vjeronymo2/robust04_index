			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (6): Shift towards bigger units - Small businesses LOWER labour costs and a fall in interest rates are bringing some relief to the small and medium-sized companies which form the backbone of Italian industry. But recession is taxing their stamina, particularly if they depend largely on the domestic market, as in construction. There are also signs of a long-term shift in the ownership pattern towards larger units. The grip of the traditional padre-padrone, the boss of the family firm, may be weakening. Ninety per cent of member companies of Confindustria, the employers' association, have fewer than 100 workers and this patchwork of small enterprises is still acclaimed for its flexibility in adapting swiftly to market changes. However, Mr Alessandro Cassinis of Censis, the leading economic research and social institute, says that over the past five years the growth rate in the number of enterprises has slowed. In the north, the number itself has fallen over the past two years. As an indication of a trend to larger companies, says Mr Cassinis, in the first half of this year in Italy there was a 2.3 per cent rise in a category of company likely to be medium-sized. In contrast there was a 3 per cent fall in a class of small businesses likely to have only 10 to 15 workers. There are several reasons why entrepreneurs should think twice about setting up small enterprises. Cuts in state assistance, the complexity of European Community regulations and heavy business taxes are all factors. The efforts involved in marketing products abroad also weigh heavily on independent operators. There has been uproar, too, over a minimum tax on income introduced in the 1993 budget to clamp down on tax evasion, for which the self-employed and small businesses are considered chiefly responsible. The government imposed an extremely unpopular formula whereby it evolved computer models for assessing minimum declared income in every category. The system will almost certainly be modified but the government will not renounce its aim of bringing people within the tax net. Before the minimum tax was introduced a survey revealed that some small business employers were declaring income lower than that of their employees. There are also pressures, however, favouring a status quo in industrial structure. The current tax regime, for example, is not merger friendly: entrepreneurs run the risk of high added-value tax if a company's value increases. There is also a strong cultural preference still for the family-owned business in many sectors, notably textiles, machine tools, footwear and furniture. But Mr Cassinis believes that even in these areas commercial pressures and problems of succession, where a father has two or more sons, will erode the traditional set-up. The present performance of small and medium-sized enterprises, as recession continues, is a story of those that have and of those that have not - the golden spoon in this case being exports. Confindustria says that in the first half of this year, while there was a sharp contraction in the domestic market, exports grew 10 per cent on a weaker lira. 'Unfortunately only a few small businessmen are exporters,' says Mr Giorgio Fossa, the association's vice-chairman who superintends small and medium-sized companies. 'So we find a small slice of business doing very well while the big majority is tied to the domestic market and suffering a lot.' He adds that small businesses, acting as sub-contractors, have paid a high price on account of the 'Tangentopoli' bribes scandal which has brought public works projects practically to a standstill. The investigations have blocked orders and delayed payments. 'The long delay in payments, which is chronic in our country, has been aggravated by 'Tangentopoli',' says Mr Fossa. In the battle against unemployment, he calls for pay rises to be kept in line with the inflation rate, presently about 4 per cent. He says unemployment must be tackled in terms of new stimuli for industry and is looking for relief in the tax burden on business as the budget deficit is brought under control. The government's fiscal policy with regard to small businesses is certainly going to be crucial in encouraging expansion. Confindustria calculates that the total weight of taxation on business is about 60 per cent. 'Right now we definitely have the highest fiscal rate in Europe,' says Mr Fossa, arguing that a lighter burden would not only encourage more investment but reduce tax evasion. Another deep-seated weakness is that small enterprises have not been able to tap the stock market and other financial markets for financing. Much of the credit is short-term and Mr Fossa is severely critical of the high interest rates charged on bank loans. Many banks maintain a gap of four to five points between the central bank's key lending rate and the rates charged for small businesses. This springs from the banks' inefficiency, he maintains. 'Banks must reorganise themselves and reduce this gap.' An average interest rate for small businesses of about 13 per cent, when inflation is at 4 per cent, does little to improve the business community's generally poor opinion of banks - as articulated by a Milan builder, specialising in house renovation, who has a workforce of 18 and an annual turnover of L2bn. He says his bank only reluctantly raised his overdraft limit from L25m to L60m even though he had no debts and could prove client payments due to him of L700m. 'How can I work with a bank like that?' he says. Mr Roberto Brambilla, deputy general manager of Cariplo, Italy's third-largest bank, is well aware of public criticism but says that support for businesses is not just a question of handing out money: the lender must assess the business and give short-term and long-term assistance in accordance with cashflow and investment needs. Eighty per cent of Cariplo's business loans are to small and medium-sized concerns and Mr Brambilla says the bank's interest rates are about a point below the average charged. He says there is an increase in potential bad debts from small businesses, making 1993 the worst year in a decade. In 1992, Cariplo had debt provision representing 3.7 per cent of total loans, compared with an average of 5.7 per cent for the banking system. But Mr Brambilla adds that small businesses have shown great resilience. 'I don't think that you have to be big to be well placed in the market,' he says. Mr Fossa also sees advantages of flexibility in small companies. 'But this gives us enormous problems from the point of view of capital,' he says. He is looking for companies to increase technological and marketing collaboration with EC counterparts, so that Italian companies become not merely exporters but take on a deeper international presence. He will also press the government for easier access to risk capital. The Bank of Italy has recently ended its ban on banks taking stakes in companies and Cariplo, for one, intends through its merchant banking arm to investigate how to help small businesses approach the stock market. This new freedom would be best used to encourage more venture capital among small companies but it is possible that the lion's share of bank stakes will be taken up in the cause of bigger companies, often using debt-swap deals. The move offers at least a glimmer of hope that a more comprehensive system of credit will emerge, but it is early days. In the meantime, small companies are left hoping that the promised upturn in 1994 will restore their own profitability.</p>

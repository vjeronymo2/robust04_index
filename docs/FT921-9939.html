			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Kravchuk given ten days to recast cabinet THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday gave President Leonid Kravchuk 10 days to form a new cabinet and propose a new government structure for the republic. A parliamentary resolution, which amounts to a vote of no-confidence in the government, could force Mr Kravchuk to sack the communist apparatchiks who dominate the cabinet and replace them with a new generation of reformers. The resolution criticises the government's economic programme as 'unsatisfactory' and accuses 'a number of government officials of professional incompetence and administrative ineffectiveness'. The harsh words reflect growing popular discontent as the newly independent republic has lagged behind Russia's fast paced move towards market reforms. 'Ukraine is severely falling behind in economic reforms', said Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, deputy chairman of parliament a leader of New Ukraine, an opposition party pushing for radical economic change. 'In Ukraine, there is a great danger that we will create a new state but forget about its context.' For weeks, Mr Kravchuk, a former communist ideologue, has promised to sack 75 per cent of the cabinet, but, by nature a coalition builder, he has been hesitant to purge the conservatives of the communist old guard. Parliament's tough stance comes after Prime Minister Vitold Fokin's economic programme, unveiled on Thursday, emphasised subsidies and controls rather than privatisation and a free market. Although he refused to name names, Mr Kravchuk promised to include members of the opposition in a new cabinet of national unity. Parliament tabled for next week Mr Kravchuk's request for expanded presidential powers which he argued are required to implement reforms.</p>

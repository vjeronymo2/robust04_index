			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 28, INA -- A recent report issued by  the Ministry of Culture and Information on the impact of the  embargo imposed on the country four years now said that it had  adversely affected all sectors in Iraq.    Minister of Trade Dr Muhammad Mahdi Salih and experts in  dietetics stressed the fact that the nutritional value of the  commodity actually available is one half of the normal  consumption level required for an average man.    Prior to the sanctions, Iraq used to import annually about 3  billion dollars worth of foodstuffs, of which 300 million  dollars for baby formula alone.    These imports, however, are either disrupted completely or  severely restricted. Baby formula at cheap market prices are  now beyond the reach of the majority of the children.    Before August 1990, the individual's share of the food  basket  distributed by the state was 25 kg per month valued at ID [Iraqi  dinar] 4,50 or 1.50 dollars. The basket included dried, fresh  and canned commodities.    Considering all food items together, the food ration card  provides about 1736.6 calories per person per day, little less  than one half of average calorie intake which stands at 2306  calories and 64.2 g of protein per day.    Food prices have risen quite substantially due to the  general  constraints on imports and of freezing Iraq foreign assets  abroad. Pre-sanctions prices were extremely low compared to  those prevailing in neighbouring countries.    The sharp increase in food price index has led to a  corresponding higher levels of inflation. Current retail prices  are higher by 4231 times for foodstuffs, 2933 times for meat,  fish and eggs, 1463 times for vegetables and 1115 times for  fruits.    Other commodities such as household items and consumer  durable goods, which the Ministry of Trade used to provide  before 1991, have been totally discontinued as a result of the  oppressive resolutions and US continued pressure on the Security  Council Sanctions Committee.    The sanctions imposed also hampered the importation of the  spare parts, equipment, tyres and batteries required to maintain  the internal transport capabilities.    According to the Ministry of Trade sources, foreign  companies  which used to run business with Iraq before 1990, have lost  about US 55 billion since the inception of the economic and  trade embargo.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The air force commanders of the three Baltic states  have agreed on cooperation in air space control and the training  of air force pilots. An agreement signed at the Lithuanian  Meskuiciai air force base confirms the intent to set up a joint  air space control system. Representatives of the Baltic states  note technical and financial advantages of such integration and  the intention to join corresponding NATO structures. It will  probably take 5 to 10 years to create a joint Baltic air space  control system.    The Baltic representatives also decided to set up a joint  training center for air force pilots in Lithuania. Estonian air  force pilots took their first training flights on Lithuanian  planes at Meskuiciai base today.    Lithuania's air force, with four L-39 jet training fighters  of Czech production, two transport L-410 planes donated by  Germany, and several dozen AN-2 planes and helicopters, is the  strongest among the Baltic states and the most experienced.    Two of the four Lithuanian jet planes and one helicopter  will  demonstrate their combat skill on Saturday [28 May] on a  military airfield near Riga during celebrations devoted to the  75th anniversary of the Latvian air force.</p>

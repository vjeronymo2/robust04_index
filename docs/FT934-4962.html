			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: UAP sell-off will test investors' appetites - In theory, the French insurer's sale is likely to be smooth Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), which is to be privatised early next year after the Elf-Aquitaine oil group and Banque Hervet, is not only France's largest insurer but its biggest institutional investor. UAP has a high profile among international investors with 23.5 per cent of its equity in public hands, so - in theory - the stage is set for yet another successful issue. But in practice the flotation could prove the first serious challenge for the architects of the government's privatisation drive. UAP is in good shape. It has just emerged from a bruising period in which its insurance interests were affected by the French recession and Banque Worms, its banking subsidiary, sustained heavy losses in the Paris property crisis. Net profits peaked at FFr4.22bn (Dollars 715.2m) in 1990 only to fall to FFr3.77bn in 1991 and to FFr1.08bn in 1992. It is on the road to recovery. The French insurance market is still intensely competitive. However, UAP, like the other large insurers, has benefited from the trend to raise premiums in the vulnerable damage sector. The life sector has continued to grow, in spite of the recession, although margins are still under strain. Even the sickly Banque Worms is starting to reduce its losses. For the first half of 1993 UAP net profits were 15 per cent ahead at FFr1.09bn, against the same period last year. Mr Simon Rudolph, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects net profits of FFr1.8bn for the full year and FFr2.5bn in 1994. 'There are still lots of pressures on the French market,' he said. 'But the situation has improved.' UAP's management is highly regarded. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was chairman for nearly five years until leaving last month to become head of the troubled Credit Lyonnais banking group, is widely seen as having created an excellent management team. Mr Jacques Friedmann, his successor, is a political appointee with no experience of the insurance industry. However, analysts seem confident that UAP's existing team will be able to cope leaving Mr Friedmann to orchestrate the privatisation and to put his political influence to good use on the investment front. 'The appointment may seem strange from an Anglo-Saxon perspective, but the French insurance industry is riddled with civil servants,' said Mr Derek Elias, insurance analyst at Paribas in London. 'Besides we're not looking at a rescue situation. UAP is well-managed and recovery is already under way.' One of Mr Peyrelevade's last acts at UAP was to solve its strategic problem by clinching a deal with Suez, the French holding company, to take control of Colonia, the second largest German insurer. The Colonia agreement has not only given UAP a long-sought foothold in Germany, but has also ended the embarrassment of its on-off negotiations with Suez. Financially, managerially and strategically UAP looks like a prime contender for a smooth privatisation. The only potential obstacle is the over-heated state of insurance shares on the European stock markets. Insurance shares rose rapidly in the 12 months until October this year on hopes of an improvement in trading and of further falls in interest rates, which should increase the value of the insurers' bond and equity investments. The sector peaked in October but has fallen as investors have grown impatient with the slow progress of rate reduction, particularly in France and Germany. UAP has reflected the market trend. Its shares soared to a peak of FFr673 in October this year, from FFr375 in November 1992 but have since fallen to close yesterday at FFr633. This means that the government will have to fix the price of the state's remaining 53 per cent stake in UAP (worth FFr28bn at the present prices) against an adverse trend. 'Investors have lost their appetite for insurance shares,' said one analyst. 'There's absolutely no doubt that UAP is a suitable candidate for privatisation. But the pricing of the issue could be tricky and not as attractive to the French government as it would have been a few months ago.'</p>

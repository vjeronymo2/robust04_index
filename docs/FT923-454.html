			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): The message from Mercury PHONE WARS: THE STORY OF MERCURYCOMMUNICATIONS by Keith Bradley Century Business Pounds 16.99, 248 pages THE STARTING point for this book is a vision of Mercury as a prototypical company of the 1990s: a service sector business, operating at the forefront of technology with a highly skilled workforce. Thus, as Keith Bradley points out, its experience holds some clear lessons for modern management. By and large his book concentrates on this aspect of Mercury's history. In the process it acquires a focus which tends to underplay the regulatory issues which have been so much at the forefront debate over British telecommunications in recent years. To be sure, the book does go into some detail about how Mercury was conceived by government as a way of making BT more efficient. 'I invented the mouse to make the elephant (BT) dance,' says Lord, formerly Sir Keith, Joseph. The author describes the frustrations Mercury met along the way. Defeat in its attempt to sue the Post Office Engineers Union for obstructing Mercury's inter-connection with the BT network was only avoided when BT almost as an afterthought admitted that its employees had a job security agreement. A public enquiry was needed in Manchester to prove its low-emission microwave antennae were safe. Closer to the author's heart, though, are clearly the management issues which this pioneering company raises. There are many of them. Its no-union policy, for example, was a commercial rather than a political choice decision, he says, even if it was in keeping with the mood of the time. The commercial rationale is rather complicated, however, and rests partly on Mercury's recognition of its need to communicate effectively with its staff. Companies which fail to do so risk losing their best employees, and personnel in high-technology industries are especially mobile. But the drawback with using a union as a means of communication between management and staff is the risk of demarcation disputes. Instead Mercury chose to go for a determined attempt to foster such communications through an elaborate system of team briefings. The hope was that its remuneration policy and emphasis on training would help it retain skilled workers, thus ensuring a service of the highest quality. There is no doubt that these are important issues. One could wish, however, that Mr Bradley would come to more definitive conclusions about their worth. One senses reservations from time to time. He notes that, despite Mercury's purported emphasis on good remuneration, his researches uncovered a considerable dissatisfaction over pay levels. Perhaps he does not want to belittle the fact that Mercury's story is one of success against all the odds. Even so, one could wish he had been a little less polite.</p>

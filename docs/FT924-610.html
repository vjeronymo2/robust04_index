			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Breaking tradition with a new concept - Peggy Hollinger reports on Era Group's move into the home entertainment field LITTLE did Tony Fay know as he wended his weary way home one Friday night last month, that the small hobby and games company of which he is chairman was about to attract some serious attention from the City. In the space of seven days the share price of Era Group, the specialist retailer, jumped 85 per cent - for no apparent reason. After a bit of sleuthing, the board came to the conclusion that pre-Christmas press coverage of the home entertainment sector had sparked interest in the shares. They now stand at 23p, compared with 13p in November. Long-time shareholders in Era Group, owner of Beatties, Tecno and the toy and model distribution business, Kohnstam, are likely to welcome this little bit of Christmas cheer. For almost three years, the shares have languished at significantly less than half a 1988 high of 91p. However, the company's management hopes that the most recent price movements might be the justification they have long sought for their revamped retailing strategy. Era, best known for its traditional model and toys business, Beatties, aims to tap into the potential of the home entertainment market with the recently-launched Virtual Reality brand name. The company hopes to carve out a niche in the sale of the most advanced computer and console games, as well as the latest technology in interactive compact disc and video equipment. Space is being allocated - and appropriately stocked for either young or old customers - in both Beatties and Tecno, the up-market camera and video retailer for the Virtual Reality concept. Mr David Henley, chairman of the retail division, says the brand strategy should put Era in a prime position to sell the actual virtual reality products - interactive computer worlds seen through a helmet - when they come to Britain in 1995. Eventually, the con-cept could even be used to launch a new retail chain. Mr Henley, who has been with Beatties since the 1960s, explains the logic behind the strategy. 'The key is not to lose the thing you are good at, but to develop early enough the things that are coming next,' he says, citing the development of Beatties from second-hand model railway merchant to mass market toy and hobby retailer. For him, and the board, the retail businesses had an obvious link in the potential for domestic electronic games. The strategic switch is the latest chapter in a corporate history which has been anything but calm. In the five years since it was transformed by acquisitions from a shell company to specialist retailer, Era has had three different managements. The most recent board, chaired by Mr Anthony Fay, took over in April 1990 following an acrimonious annual general meeting and the unexpected exit of the controversial Mr Murray Gordon as chairman. There is little love lost between Era's present management and its predecessors. For the past two years, Mr Fay and his team have been struggling to recover from the fiasco of the loss-making Lexterten furniture business, which left the group with a crippling debt and a precarious relationship with its bankers. Lexterten alone had been responsible for the group's sharp drop in profits from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 631,000 in 1989. The sale of Lexterten, for the nominal sum of Pounds 1, in 1990 ended up costing Era Group a grand total of Pounds 7m, according to Mr Fay. However, he maintains the bad times are now largely behind the company. Costs have been cut substantially and Era now operates on a just-in-time basis - ie, without warehouses  - for its 99 retailing outlets. Era has also successfully re-established its relationship with its bankers, Barclays, although average gearing is still high at more than 100 per cent. For the first time since 1990, Mr Fay says, the board has been able to sit back and work on a strategy for its three divisions. Industry observers and analysts are less convinced that the group will be able to make its new strategy work. 'They have got it right,' says Jeremy Allen of Kleinwort Benson, 'but they are still bearing the legacy of the difficult years, in the form of a balance sheet with too much debt.' Others, such as Mr Jim Douglas, editor of GamesMaster magazine, cite the aggressive programme at Dixons, which has devoted space in an estimated 250 stores to computer games, compared with Era's 80 stores with Virtual Reality branding. Dixons and Currys together dominate the Pounds 500m-a-year computer games market, and being far larger, have much greater buying power, he says. Some analysts wonder whether the new strategy is different enough in a highly competitive market. 'Will it attract a sufficient number of people to walk through the door?' asks Mr Richard Hickinbotham of SG Warburgs. Messrs Fay and Henley reject the criticisms. They are horrified by comparisons with their bigger rivals, claiming they do not compete with Dixons or Currys. Era's strength will be a highly-trained staff, they say, and more advanced products. Mr Henley adds that the group is selling a concept which will take time to bear fruit. 'We are trying to sell the concept, not of games for today, but of games for tomorrow,' he says. On one thing the analysts and management agree. Profits are expected to fall further in the current year, which ends on December 31. Forecasts range from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.7m, against Pounds 2.17m a year earlier, but all depends on the crucial Christmas period when Era makes some 30 per cent of its annual sales. The evidence so far points to a patchy performance. Finally, there is the question of just how the company will bring down its debt and fund any expansion. A rights issue alone while the shares are so low - even after the recent rally  - is unlikely, according to Mr Allen of Kleinwort Benson. 'I would have thought they might wait for something more positive to add a rights issue to such as an acquisition.' Mr Fay is suitably coy about tackling a new purchase, although he will not rule out the possibility of a move in the UK. 'There are lots of expansion prospects,' he says. 'But you need cash, location and the management resource.' Era, he adds, to enhance all three 'as we go along'.</p>

Thus said Francisco Duran  Harvey, member of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] national  secretariat, in a speech at a meeting with Granma Province's  main union cadres on the possible measures to be implemented in  order to streamline Cuba's internal finances.    Duran stressed that this is a process of great importance  and  political significance that requires us to close ranks without  first requiring all workers to think the same way; and it is  necessary for union cadres to be prepared with convincing  arguments and views.    [Begin Duran recording] Therefore, this is not just one more  battle. At the National Assembly, Fidel insisted strongly that  we had to get the measures implemented once we got the workers  to understand. He said we could not win that battle without the  workers. He said it clearly, very clearly. Therefore, all of us  have to engage in this battle, and we have to work intelligently  to win it. Because even after applying the measures, we will not  have solved the problems. The measures are just a one path  toward the solution. And it was said very clearly here that the  problems of efficiency and fulfillment of our basic economic  objectives play a decisive role. And, like people say, we must  encourage people to make suggestions, encourage people to make  recommendations.    At the assembly the other day in La Corona, there were  workers who stated that work discipline has deteriorated but  that one cannot speak of a generalized deterioration as there  was no deterioration of discipline in repairing the mills,  because the people made an extraordinary effort. We have a great  tendency to generalize concepts. We must talk about whether  there is deterioration in work discipline, but we cannot talk  about this in a general manner. We must get down to particulars.  And when I am in a work group, I have to speak, express myself  graphically, and then there will be no problems. [end recording]    You have just heard Francisco Duran Harvey, member of the  CTC  national secretariat, who made these statements in the city of  Bayamo regarding the assembly process entitled Parliament in Our  Work Place, which is aimed at having the workers reflect on  implementing measures to streamline our internal finances.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BAA BAA has not quite perfected the art of the free lunch but the ability to touch 80m captive airline passengers for a few quid each year and a lax pricing regime for airport charges represents the next best thing. Though regulated, BAA's return on capital must make many a utility company director's eyes water. Yet the official price cap on BAA will ease further over the next three years before a new regime is negotiated for 1997. BAA will doubtless continue to plead for leniency given the need to spend some Pounds 1bn on Heathrow's fifth terminal. But even if the regulator grows aggressive, BAA could still emerge smiling, since lower fees would only enhance Heathrow's appeal as an international hub. Regulated activities also represent an ever diminishing proportion of revenue, as the company continues its thrust into retailing. By 2000, airport charges may account for as little as 20 per cent of income. With UK passenger traffic growing by 4 per cent a year and expansion opportunities emerging at overseas airports, BAA will remain one of the few genuine growth stocks in the FT-SE 100 index. But regarded as a utility BAA also has defensive appeal, which not even its curious pretensions to develop factory outlet retailing malls can damage significantly.</p>

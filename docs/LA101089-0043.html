			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDERS TO DONATE HELP ON HOMELESS SHELTER FOR 300 PEOPLE DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> The building and development industry announced Monday that it plans to  volunteer time and materials to design and build a 300-person homeless shelter  near downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> The $2-million shelter -- constituting a singular partnership of private,  church and public participation -- will be built across the street from the St.  Vincent de Paul/Joan Kroc Center, which was opened in August, 1987.  </P> <P> The shelter -- to be named after St. Vincent de Paul and the Building Industry  Assn. of San Diego County, which is coordinating the donation -- will be  operated as part of an unusual three-part complex that also includes the Kroc  facility and a residence for homeless single men scheduled to open next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction Expected to Begin in July  </P> <P> Construction of the 60,000-square-foot, three-story shelter is expected to  begin in July, with completion wanted by Christmas. The building will house a  300-person emergency shelter, a medical clinic, social-services offices and a  county-run public school for homeless children who reside in the Kroc center.  </P> <P> Msgr. Joe Carroll, a nationally recognized activist for the homeless who  directs the St. Vincent de Paul operation, said he is "overjoyed" at the  building industry's decision to volunteer its services. He estimated the price  of the new facility at $2 million. He is seeking more donations for completion  costs.  </P> <P> Builders and developers have long been among those approached by Father Carroll  when seeking assistance for the homeless. Those contacts eventually resulted in  the industry's decision to design and construct the new facility, which was  originally expected to be built in 1992 -- a schedule that is now being moved  up by two years.  </P> <P> "It's just a natural affiliation for us to take up and participate in what we  know best," said Robert Morris, executive vice president of the Building  Industry Assn. of San Diego. "Our hope is that this is one way that the  industry can show that we are concerned about the quality of life in San  Diego."  </P> <P> The City of San Diego is expected to kick in $200,000 for the project. The  funds have already been budgeted and will be earmarked for the new shelter once  approved by a city advisory board, said a spokeswoman for Councilman Bob  Filner, who represents the district in which the facilities are being built.  </P> <P> It is estimated that there are about 5,000 homeless people in the county on a  given day; a significant number of them -- perhaps 2,000 -- are in downtown San  Diego.  </P> <P> Critics have long accused the industry of contributing to the homeless problem  by promoting high rents, home prices and the gentrification of poor  neighborhoods. Morris, the housing industry spokesman, said builders have  little control over the market that creates exorbitant housing prices.  </P> <P> Once completed, the three-part project will represent "the most comprehensive  complex for solving the plight of the homeless in any major city in the United  States," said Carroll, who is known for his indefatigable fund-raising efforts  on behalf of the homeless. He envisions a time when the center will contain all  the facilities -- housing, health care, job training, counseling and the like  -- to help the homeless become self-sufficient.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Praise From Homeless  </P> <P> The new center will include emergency overnight space for 300 residents, who  can eventually move into more complete housing elsewhere in the complex. The  structure will also house the elementary school, now in the Kroc center, as  well as expanded medical clinic, which will include dental services. Office  space in the building is to be leased to social-service agencies; the rent is  to be allocated toward shelter operating expenses.  </P> <P> The $11.7-million Joan Kroc Center, which has received praise from homeless  advocates nationwide, was opened in August, 1987. It houses 350 men, women and  children, and provides services to 750 more daily, Carroll said. Among the  services available are meals, showers, medical aid, free clothing, job  counseling and literacy classes.  </P> <P> The $2-million single men's shelter, which is scheduled to be dedicated Nov.  13, is to have beds for 150 residents. Single men constitute the largest single  percentage of the homeless.  </P></p>

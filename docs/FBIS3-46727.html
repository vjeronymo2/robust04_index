Chi Song-yong, a department director of the State External  Economic Affairs Commission, said that in order to adapt foreign  trade to the changed circumstances, they would cultivate new  foreign markets in every possible way and build up an  unquestionable reputation, increase the production of export  goods and improve their qualities, develop processing trade and  thus overfulfill their assignments in foreign trade.    Hwang Se-pyong, director of the production guidance  department of the Ministry of Coal Industry, vowed to  scrupulously organize economic affairs, skillfully direct  production and actively enlist the revolutionary enthusiasm and  creative ingenuity of the masses in compliance with the  requirements of the party's economic strategy so as to  overfulfil the yearly coal production plan.    No Pong-ho, chairman of the management board of the June 3  Cooperative Farm in Onchon county, South Pyongan Province, said  he would work hard to increase per hectare yield of grain  markedly by realizing the comprehensive mechanization of  agriculture on a higher level and successfully meeting the  requirements of the chuche method of farming.</p>

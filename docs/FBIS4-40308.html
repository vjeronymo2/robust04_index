			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [S. Moskvin report over video; from the "As of This Hour" </F> newscast of the "Morning Cruise" program]    [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS], held a news conference with  journalists today at the oblast administration of the  counterintelligence service. During the 30-minute meeting, he  answered a wide variety of questions.    Sergey Stepashin characterized the country's current crime  situation as critical. Soon the Russian Ministry of Internal  Affairs, headed by Viktor Yerin, and the FCS will sign a  cooperation pact in the struggle with corruption and organized  crime. However, the shortcomings of legal and judicial laws  continue to serve as loopholes through which criminal elements  escape from retribution.    [Begin Stepashin recording] What is particularly alarming  today are the shortcomings in the judicial system. I remember  when I was the chief of the St. Petersburg and before that the  Leningrad administration of the (?KGB) and then the Security  Ministry. We had 12 cases involving corruption among the  highest echelons of power, at the level of heads of  administrations, two deputy mayors, the former director of the  Baltic Steamship Company Kharchenko -- you may have heard of  that affair -- and they were all (?thrown out) by the courts.  [end recording]    As far as the establishment of contacts between the Russian  Mafia and their foreign colleagues is concerned, the FCS has  already signed a number of agreements on joint cooperation with  the special services of China, Korea, Egypt, and Japan. The  director of the FBI will visit Moscow at the beginning of July  to bridle the rampant mafiosi together with our  counterintelligence agents.    The activities of North Korean citizens on the territory of  the former Soviet Union also elicit very serious alarm since  they are, under various pretexts, engaged in a search for  components for nuclear weapons.    In conclusion, Sergey Stepashin told the news conference  that  the FCS plans to intensify its activities aimed at strengthening  Russian interests. Tonight he will leave for Vladivostok to  continue his visit to the Far East.</p>

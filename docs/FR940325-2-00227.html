The PREP guidelines outline the applicability, type, frequency, and objectives of the required exercises and will aid the government and industry in meeting the Federal requirements for pollution response exercises. This notice proposes an exercise schedule for 1995, 1996, and 1997; solicits comments on the proposed schedule and the PREP scheduling process outlined here; solicits industry members to lead Area exercises for 1995; and announces a workshop to be held on May 19, 1994, to discuss the proposed schedule and the scheduling process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments relating to the schedule or the scheduling process should be submitted by May 1, 1994, to the address listed below.

The schedule and scheduling process may be revised in view of the comments. Comments will be discussed at the scheduling workshop to be held on May 19, 1994. After the workshop, the final schedule for Area exercises for 1995 and the tentative schedule for 1996 and 1997 Area exercises will be published by a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS developed the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) to provide guidelines for compliance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 pollution response exercise requirements (33 U.S.C. 1321(j)). One section of the PREP focuses on Area exercises, which are designed to evaluate the entire response mechanism in a given Area to ensure adequate pollution response preparedness. Each Area is defined by geographical boundaries, for which, a separate and distinct Area Contingency Plan has been developed. The goal of the PREP is to conduct 20 Area exercises per year, with the intent of exercising most Areas of the country within a three year period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three year period under consideration here for Area exercise scheduling includes calendar years 1995, 1996 and 1997. The schedule consists of 20 Area exercises per year (6 government-led and 14 industry-led). Industry members required to submit response plans are actively solicited to lead the industry-led Area exercises or participate in the government-led Area exercises. Requests to lead or participate in an Area exercise should be made to the NSCC, as described in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

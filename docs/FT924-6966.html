			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / State cover sought against terrorism THE government was urged yesterday to intervene to end the 'state of turmoil' in the British insurance industry which has followed the wave of IRA terrorist activity on the UK mainland. Mr John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale and chairman of the all-party Insurance and Financial Services Group, said insurers faced potential losses far beyond any normally acceptable risk. He has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asking the government to act as a reinsurer to resolve the problem. He said: 'The insurance industry is in a state of turmoil over the problems of providing insurance cover in respect of terrorist activity on the UK mainland.' A preferred option would be to invite the government to act as a reinsurer for the balance of any potential losses which the insurance market is unable to underwrite in the usual way. 'It is the withdrawal of such reinsurance, brought about by the fear of possible losses similar to those experienced following the bomb in the City a few months ago, which is the cause of the current difficulty,' he said. 'It hardly bears thinking about what might have happened had the attempt to bomb Canary Wharf not been thwarted.' Mr Greenway added that 'nervousness within the reinsurance market in the face of such potentially huge losses' was entirely understandable. Observer, Page 19</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Argentinian oil company quintuples net profits YPF, Argentina's national oil company, has reported 1991 net profit of Dollars 245m, more than five times its income the year before, despite a heavy fall in sales revenues. Sales fell to Dollars 4.03bn from Dollars 5.17bn the year before, although the two figures may not be directly comparable. YPF is due to be privatised in 1993. Its sharply-improved performance is due both to a radical downsizing to prepare it for sale and to tighter management. A YPF official said the 1991 accounts had been held up by congressional delay in approving the YPF privatisation bill. The company has shed its marginal oilfields and is selling off lossmaking subsidiaries, ranging from a tanker fleet to part of its refinery capacity. The government also sacked YPF's previous politically-appointed management and handed control over to oil industry professionals. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, has tripled reserves, cut operating costs by a quarter and boosted oil output by 15 per cent. He also halved the workforce at a cost of more than Dollars 600m.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Digging out of a hole While Eurotunnel's impending rights issue will not be the biggest in the history of the London equity market, it promises to be one of the most delicately poised. Barclays and Zeneca have raised more than the Pounds 850m Eurotunnel now looks likely to demand from shareholders. But both companies were members of the FT-SE 100 index and core holdings for the investment institutions which would normally be expected to underwrite the deal. Eurotunnel's share register is dominated by private investors. Most UK funds have little reason to care whether Eurotunnel gets its money or not. That suggests the rights issue will have to be priced at a generous discount to the prevailing share price to attract underwriters. Haggling between the company and fund managers will determine the final terms. Since shareholders have authorised the issue of only 342m new shares, though, Eurotunnel cannot afford to give too much away. A rights price of around 250p - a 30 per cent discount to yesterday's closing share price - is the minimum required to raise Pounds 850m. The company will doubtless hope to persuade underwriting institutions to accept a narrower discount. The shares might also rise once Eurotunnel's banks have finally agreed to provide their portion of the funding. But uncertainty over the terms of the issue makes Eurotunnel's shares harder than ever to value. Buying on the basis of discounted cash flow calculations demands extraordinary faith in long-term assumptions about economic growth and inflation. While that will not trouble true believers, sceptics have no reason to change their minds.</p>

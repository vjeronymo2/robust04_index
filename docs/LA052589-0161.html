			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE BAR INVESTIGATES NOLAN OVER FAKE LETTER  </P> <P> The California State Bar has opened an investigation into possible ethical  violations by Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) in connection with the forgery  of former President Ronald Reagan's signature on campaign letters in 1986.  </P> <P> Rick Harker, the State Bar's assistant chief trial counsel in San Francisco,  said Monday that Nolan, a lawyer, took "an oath and has the duty to obey all  laws . . . and not to do anything deceitful or dishonest. And that's something  we're looking at."  </P> <P> Nolan said he did not have a reaction to the investigation because "they  haven't contacted me. So how could I have a reaction?"  </P> <P> The State Bar licenses and disciplines lawyers. The penalty for ethical  violations ranges from a reprimand to disbarment. But Harker cautioned that he  has no idea if any discipline would be sought against Nolan, whose 41st  Assembly District includes Glendale, part of Pasadena, Eagle Rock and Altadena.  </P> <P> In March, state prosecutors acknowledged that they had sought to indict Nolan  for his role in the phony letters case but decided after presenting the case to  a grand jury that they could not prove that Nolan had committed a crime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forgery Count  </P> <P> Instead, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp obtained an indictment against  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), with a single count of forgery stemming  from the mailing of as many as 480,000 phony endorsements in six Assembly  races, including the campaign of Republican Henry Velasco, who unsuccessfully  challenged Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park). Lewis has pleaded  innocent.  </P> <P> Prosectors told a Sacramento County grand jury that Nolan and Lewis "knew prior  to the letters being distributed that there had been no authorization from the  President or the White House or the Republican National Committee." But no  witness linked Nolan directly to the order to send the letters without White  House authorization.  </P> <P> Harker said his office opened its inquiry in November after receiving a  complaint against Nolan and reviewing news articles on the attorney general's  investigation of Nolan.  </P> <P> Now, he said, investigators are reading copies of the 350-page grand jury  transcript to determine if there is "any substantial evidence of ethical  violations" by Nolan.  </P> <P> Nolan, the former Assembly Republican leader, is one of five elected state  officials targeted in a 3 1/2-year-old federal investigation into political  corruption in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Harker declined to comment on whether his inquiry would focus on Nolan's role  in the federal investigation.  </P></p>

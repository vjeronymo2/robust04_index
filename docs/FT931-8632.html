			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Clinton's state of the Union and will not be the last - elected politician to abandon what he promised during an election campaign. Nor is he the first to give as his excuse the unexpectedly dire state of the public-sector finances. The Republicans hope that voters will blame him for abandoning his 'middle-class tax cut'. Having bought votes on the basis of promises he knows he ought not to keep, Mr Clinton is certainly taking a gamble in the tax increases he now proposes. But what matters most is not whether the president's lips were worth reading during the campaign. It is whether they are worth reading now. Mr Clinton is a Democrat. Unsurprisingly, therefore. his economic plan represents a decisive shift from 12 years of Republican rule. Higher taxes are certain, with the planned increase amounting to well over 1 per cent of US gross domestic product. Meanwhile, the spending cuts are supposed to be greater than the planned increases in spending. This is not so much a case of 'tax and spend' as of 'tax and reallocate spending'. The fact of higher taxation - Dollars 240bn more over four years - is not the decisive indicator of the change. It is the nature of those taxes. Some 70 per cent of the increase in taxation is to be contributed by people earning over Dollars 100,000 a year (Pounds 69,000). But tax increases are not restricted to the 'rich' individuals and corporations. Higher taxes on energy, for example, will fall on virtually all Americans. Deficit reduction Meanwhile, spending is to be cut by Dollars 250bn over four years, with some Dollars 80bn from defence, Dollars 50bn from non-defence discretionary spending and no less than Dollars 90bn from entitlements. But - mark the weasel words - spending reductions are to be phased in over time, while there is to be a Dollars 160bn increase in 'investment'. The bottom line is a reduction in the federal budget deficit from Dollars 332bn (5 per cent of GDP) in the current fiscal year to Dollars 207bn (2 1/2 per cent of GDP) in 1997. Total deficit reduction is to be some Dollars 500bn over four years, with the deficit in 1997 to be at least Dollars 140bn below the Congressional Budget Office's forecast for that year. What makes this reduction in the deficit rather less plausible, however, is the unnecessary stimulus of Dollars 30bn in the first year. Joy comes first; pain later. This plan is plausible only if the president can obtain the tax increases and the control over spending he wants. Plans for higher taxes will confront outraged interest groups, perhaps an outraged public. His voters may feel happy about taxing 'the rich'. They will be less happy about taxes on themselves. As for spending control, the president may propose, but Congress disposes. Right direction Politically, the plan seems brave. Economically, it still falls short of what is needed. At present, the US has the lowest national savings rate of any industrial economy, bar Greece, and a federal deficit that absorbs 30 per cent of private gross savings. A faster rise in the US standard of living demands a marked increase in its rate of capital formation. For that the US needs a balanced budget, perhaps even a surplus. Without one, Mr Clinton will fail to deliver on his promise of a transformed US. The need for a smaller structural deficit must be still greater when higher taxes fall heavily on those who save most. Mr Clinton is in a dilemma. He believes in higher public spending, but he has also decided, rightly, that the structural budget deficit must be cut. So he offers less deficit reduction than required, higher taxes than expected and less additional spending than his supporters desire. Not only is he bound to make more people unhappy than happy, but much political capital will be spent on selling a programme that falls short. The temptation for a Democratic administration that cannot deliver substantial spending increases through the budget is to deliver them off-budget, instead. Costs can be loaded on businesses via higher minimum wages, for example. Costs can also be loaded on consumers, via protection against imports. Such regulatory changes could have dire long term effects on US employment and growth. Though Mr Clinton's budget plan may not be frugal enough. it is broadly in the right direction. But many and dangerous are the temptations that remain.</p>

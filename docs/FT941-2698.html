			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Jump in foreign chip sales to Japan The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market jumped to 20.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, the highest figure since the US began monitoring the share in 1986. The increase has averted a further rise in trade friction between the US and Japan. The closely-watched data are the primary measure used by the US to determine Japan's compliance with a bilateral trade agreement, in which Japan 'recognised the expectations of the US semiconductor industry that foreign market share should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992.' The fourth-quarter figure represents an increase of 1.6 per cent over the previous quarter, the largest jump since the governments began compiling market share data. 'We are pleased to see an increase in foreign market share for the fourth quarter,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'However, we remain concerned that US and other foreign semiconductor suppliers are not achieving improved access to the Japanese market on a sustained basis.' In 1992, US officials noted, the fourth-quarter figure hit a similar high point of 20.2 per cent, only to decline sharply over the next three quarters. 'This year, we sincerely hope that Japan will not become complacent with the fourth quarter's positive results, only to have the market access figure slide backwards in subsequent quarters,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group representing US chipmakers. 'It is essential that effective steps be taken now by the Japanese government and industry to ensure that gradual and steady improvements in foreign market share continue throughout the duration of the arrangement,' which ends in 1996, said Mr Kantor. Sales of foreign-made semiconductors to Japan rose to Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn) in 1993, up from Dollars 3.3bn in 1992, according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. The trade group noted that this represents the seventh year that foreign sales have increased. Almost 90 per cent of foreign sales to Japan come from the US.</p>

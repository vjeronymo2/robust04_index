			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Escondida mine to expand further The go-ahead has been given for a further expansion of the Escondida copper mine in Chile at a cost of USDollars 520m. It will make Escondida the world's biggest copper mine by mid-1996 and also turn Broken Hill Proprietary, which entered the business only five years ago, into the world's leading producer of traded copper. RTZ of the UK, the world's biggest mining company and one of the partners in Escondida, will move ahead of Phelps Dodge, the biggest US copper producer and be not far behind Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group that currently heads the world copper production league. The new expansion will lift Escondida's annual production capacity from 480,000 tonnes of copper to an average of 800,000 tonnes. Construction will start immediately. The increased tonnage will start to build up from the second half of next year and output at the higher level will last to 2000. Escondida will increase supply of copper concentrate (an intermediate material) to local smelters - among them those owned by Enami, Codelco and Refimet. Following expansion, about 30 per cent of the mine's production will be refined in Chile. Production started at the Dollars 824m Escondida open pit mine in 1990, and has been expanded twice - costing Dollars 76m and Dollars 200m respectively. BHP, Australia's biggest company, owns 57.5 per cent; RTZ has 30 per cent; a Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi, 10 per cent; and International Finance Corporation, 2.5 per cent. The news left BHP shares 32 cents higher at ADollars 19.02 in Australia yesterday, in a generally firmer market. RTZ pointed out that Escondida produced about 389,000 tonnes of copper last year and contributed Pounds 36m (Dollars 55.4m) to RTZ's net earnings totalling Pounds 373m.</p>

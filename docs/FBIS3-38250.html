"We will never  resign ourselves to the EU border being the border between  Germany and Poland," Kohl said in Mainz today at a reception for  33 bishops from throughout Europe. Europe was in the process of  taking up the great tradition of coexistence. Everyone should  be grateful about the progress achieved.    Beforehand the chancellor attended a celebration mass in  Mainz Cathedral at the conclusion of the 24th General Assembly  of the Council of Catholic European Bishops' Conferences. At  the service, the bishops called on the warmongers in former  Yugoslavia to stop their merciless actions, and said they hoped  peace would be achieved.    Kohl warned that no one was immune to developments such as  those in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]</p>

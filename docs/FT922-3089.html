			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / 'Vandals' warning after rates decision THE property industry warned yesterday that more office blocks would be vandalised by owners trying to escape rate bills, following a refusal by the Department of the Environment this week to cut the rates levied on empty buildings. Mr Michael Pattison, secretary-general of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said instances where the interiors of office blocks had been stripped out to avoid business rates were 'the tip of a nasty iceberg'. Rates levied on unlet property were 'leading to systematic, wanton destruction', he said. By making a vacant building 'incapable of beneficial occupation', property owners eliminate a rates bill that would otherwise be 50 per cent of the full liability. The government has decided it would be too costly to reduce the rates for empty properties. The half-rate charge, which was introduced with the uniform business rate in 1990, brought in an estimated Pounds 450m last year. On Thursday Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, wrote to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, pointing out that business rates had been cut by Pounds 1.25bn in the Budget. 'Against this background the existing rules on empty rates should remain,' he said. Mr Pattison said the property industry would press for a reversal of that decision. 'We are not likely to accept that this is the last word,' he said. Property owners and tenants have been lobbying the government for several months urging a reduction in rates on empty properties to 15 per cent, which they consider a fair reflection of the costs of servicing an empty building. They also want the grace period before rates are levied on an empty building extended from three months to a year, in line with the longer periods now needed to let a building. Over the past year Wates City of London, a quoted property company, has saved about Pounds 280,000 a year in tax by stripping the ceilings out of 40,000 sq ft of Winchester House in the City, a building it has earmarked for redevelopment. Mr Rod Clutton, development director, said the measures should not be compared to vandalism. 'Vandalism suggests destruction for destruction's sake. We are stripping things out to minimise our tax liability. This tax is penal.'</p>

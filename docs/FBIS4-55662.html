Nenad Stazic  has the report.    [Stazic] The government has displayed a principled and  responsible approach to its duties over the past 14 months. It  is still a factor of stability, so the prime minister and the  government in general will not do anything to destabilize the  situation in Croatia. What fuelled yesterday's rumors about the  government's possible resignation was the decision to drop items  from the agenda of the House of Counties -- which was not the  most ingenious solution -- so the government will not propose  that any items be dropped from the agenda of the Chamber of  Representatives [break in transmission].</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Uncle Sam's super-highway: In a rapidly changing market, the US is dismantling telecommunications regulations The US is laying the foundations of a national information 'super-highway' with a speed which is surprising even the roadbuilders - and which promises to give the country a substantial global competitive edge. The key factors behind it are a rush of new technology and the competitive spirit of American capitalism. But Washington is also playing an important part as it struggles to adapt the country's complex and outmoded regulatory framework to the dawning 'information age'. The speed of change in both the private sector and government policymaking has been underlined by two significant developments in the first few days of 1994. Last week MCI Communications, the innovative long-distance telephone group, announced that it and various unnamed partners would spend Dollars 20bn over the next six years, to improve MCI's existing communications network and to start competing for business traffic against America's local telephone monopolies, especially the seven 'Baby Bells' which dominate the sector. MCI is by far the largest of several companies muscling into this market, and it could present a particularly serious challenge to the local phone businesses: MCI played a key role in an anti-trust court case which 10 years ago forced American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to face competition in the long-distance market and to spin off the Baby Bells as separate companies. On Tuesday, Vice-President Al Gore, the administration's main figure on high-technology issues, gave regulatory change a push forward in a speech which outlined for the first time legislation being prepared by the White House, which would establish a new, competitive framework for the various communications industries. 'This administration,' he said, 'will not let existing regulatory structures impede or distort the evolution of the communications industry.' It was Mr Gore who coined the phrase 'information super-highway' many years ago when he was a member of Congress urging government support for high-speed data networks to link researchers at universities and government laboratories throughout the country. Now the term is used much more broadly, to mean a national system of interlinked high-speed, high-capacity communications networks which can deliver a large array of interactive consumer, business and educational services, from movies-on-demand to medical X-ray images. The US believes that quick deployment of an information super-highway will give it an important competitive edge - for example, by improving industrial efficiency and the quality of education. In his speech Mr Gore challenged industry leaders to begin providing free access to the network for every classroom, library and hospital. The highway could also give a strong boost to America's already significant exports of communications equipment and expertise. In 1992 it exported some Dollars 7bn of telecommunications equipment and had a trade surplus of about Dollars 1.2bn. The government is happy to leave super-highway investment decisions to the private sector. Technology is changing rapidly and no one can predict what services consumers will want most. Fast-moving entrepreneurs will be best able to react to these forces. Nor does the White House wish to pick industrial 'winners' among the seven industries all jostling for a piece of the multi-media pie: telephony, cable television, broadcasting, computing, wireless communications, publishing and even electricity utilities, which are wondering how to capitalise on the power lines they have running into every building. There is a general belief in both the federal government and the private sector that winners and losers in this industrial revolution are best left to marketplace competition, which is also regarded as the greatest spur to network modernisation, and thus the creation of the 'super-highway'. For example, Mr Gore pointed out that AT&amp;T had moved more rapidly to introduce modern digital systems into the long-distance market after this was thrown fully open to competition in 1984. However, Washington does have two important roles. The first is to simplify the complicated regulatory maze which restricts competition. The second is to establish public policy goals to ensure reasonable access to the network for all Americans. The central problem is that the existing US regulatory system reflects a world which is gradually dying: where the Baby Bells (as well as other independent local phone companies) had a monopoly over local telephone traffic. The monopoly was largely natural: in a world of scarce telecommunications resources, there was little room for competing services. It was also very cosy. Local regulators allowed the phone companies to make a decent return on their investments, provided their prices remained reasonable and they fulfilled an obligation to provide a 'universal service'  -that is, enabling anyone to have a telephone service in their home at a reasonable cost. The phone companies have generally achieved this by charging business customers high rates to subsidise artificially low residential rates. At the same time, the immense financial muscle of the Baby Bells prompted fears that they would use their monopoly telephone profits to compete unfairly in other sectors. Because of this, the court settlement which spun them off from AT&amp;T banned them from the long-distance telephone market, telecommunications equipment manufacturing, and information services (though this last ban was lifted by the courts two years ago). Similar concerns mean that a 1984 act which regulates the cable television industry bans all the regional telephone companies from owning and delivering video programming in their local area, reinforcing the local monopolies enjoyed by the cable companies. Now, however, both the telephone and cable monopolies are crumbling. New technology, and in particular the ability to transmit audio, visual and data information in the same digital form, means that the neat distinctions between the industries are blurring. Entrepreneurial companies from each sector are moving into each other's territory, though at every turn they find themselves battering against regulatory barriers. For example, MCI's new local service will initially be aimed only at business customers seeking direct access to the long-distance market. This is mainly because this market offers better profit prospects, but also because all but four US states forbid competition in the local market for normal telephone traffic. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI chief executive, is promising a war to pry open this market. Similarly, Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative of the Baby Bells, had to take court action last year to win the right to compete against the cable industry in its area. It successfully argued that the 1984 cable act was an infringement of its constitutional rights to free speech. Until recently, it looked as if such turf battles would continue for many years, with each industry defending its monopoly rights, and its supporters in Congress blocking efforts at regulatory reform. However, over the past year a consensus has emerged in both the communications industries and Washington that comprehensive legislation is required quickly to cut through the many, often conflicting layers of regulation and encourage competition. The shift stems particularly from a series of takeover bids bringing together cable and telephone companies. The biggest, a Dollars 22bn deal last autumn involving Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications, the largest cable company, was crucial for reducing hostility between the two industries. But the shift has also been helped by the Clinton administration. For while President George Bush adopted a generally laisser-faire approach to communications regulation, the Clinton-Gore team made the creation of an information super-highway an important campaign pledge. That said, the administration has not been quick to develop its own communications policy and the bill it is promising will draw heavily on legislation currently before Congress, the product of delicate compromises between House of Representatives committee members. The so-called Markey/Fields legislation would give new competitors - including cable companies - the right to compete with local telephone companies and use their facilities on a non-discriminatory basis to interconnect with consumers. The legislation would override state laws impeding this. At the same time, the regional telephone companies would be free to set up new video services in competition with cable. They would, however, still be banned from buying local cable companies, so that customers would be able to choose from at least two competing multi-media services. On Tuesday, Mr Gore went a step further with a proposal that multi-media companies be given the opportunity to adopt a special new status, freeing them from many local, state and federal rules, in return for a commitment to 'open access' - that is, allowing all providers of programming to use their networks at reasonable cost. A second piece of legislation before Congress - also endorsed by the White House - addresses long-standing complaints by the Baby Bells that it is unfair for competitors such as MCI to invade their local territory (though the Bells still control all but a tiny fraction of traffic), when they are still barred from the long-distance market and equipment manufacturing. The Brooks/Dingell bill would allow the Bell companies to apply for permission to enter manufacturing after a one-year wait and the long-distance market after five years. But while the basic principles of legislation are now clear, and have been given a powerful impetus by Mr Gore's embrace, some big battles loom as Congress tries to flesh out the fine print. These details will have a significant impact on companies' investment decisions and profits. For example, the local telephone companies are concerned about the rules governing the interconnection between their facilities and those of new rivals. They complain that the Markey legislation goes too far in requiring them to 'unbundle' their services - separating out the various features of the telephone network and offering them for sale to the competition. Complains Mr Ron Stowe, a representative in Washington of the Baby Bell Pacific Telesis: 'It goes far beyond what other competitors have asked for and, as a general rule, what might be described as essential services.' The cable companies, for their part, do not want to be weighed down by the stringent requirements imposed on the telephone companies to provide a universal service. A commitment to universal service is basic both to the Markey bill and the White House's legislation. But two fundamental issues have yet to be resolved. First, how do you do define universal service in a multi-media age? The Clinton administration is stressing the need to prevent the US becoming a nation of 'information haves and have-nots', in which individuals are denied access to essential information because of poverty or remote location. So should universal service consist simply of a telephone line, or include a more expensive basic package of other features - such as access to video information? Second, how do you fund universal service when the local telephone company has lost the monopoly which buttressed its subsidies? There is general agreement that a mechanism needs to be found to ensure that all providers of essential services share equitably in the cost of subsidies. And many industry figures argue that the subsidies should be delivered direct to the customer - for example, through vouchers or credits to their bill - rather than going to the communications company, as now. So the Clinton administration has its work cut out if it is to get legislation through Congress by the end of 1994, as it plans. The players jostling for position in the information revolution have been squabbling over turf for the past 10 years and are not about to stop now - whatever the harmonious new-age noises they and the government are emitting.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          THE ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY GOALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Encourage private-sector creation of the information super-highway Provide open, non-discriminatory access to information Promote and protect competition in communications Avoid a society of communications 'haves' and 'have-nots' Maintain universal service  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

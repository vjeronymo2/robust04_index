			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japan has no knowledge of  a meeting reportedly slated for February of finance ministers  and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized  nations, a senior Finance Ministry [MOF] official said Monday  [17 January].    "I haven't heard of that," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito  told a regular press conference.    He was referring to newspaper reports that Germany has  proposed holding such a G-7 meeting in late February.    Saito, however, confirmed that a meeting of finance  ministers  from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on March  18 and 19 in Hawaii will take place as disclosed earlier Monday  by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.    The meeting will be for "exchanging views informally" on  cooperation in the region and "not for negotiations," Saito said.    Turning to domestic issues, he denied reports of an  agreement  among the coalition parties for the government to compile the  fiscal 1994 budget around February 10, with the Finance Ministry  to announce its budget plan on February 5.    The ministry has not received any instructions on the  timetable, Saito said.    But the ruling parties are to hold a meeting of their  policy-making forum, he said.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party  [of Japan], the largest of the coalition parties, said Saturday  that the parties have agreed on the budget schedule.</p>

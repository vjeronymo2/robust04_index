			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LABOR COSTS RISE FAR FASTER FOR COMPETITORS THAN U.S.  </P> <P> U.S. labor costs rose more slowly last year than in all but one of the 11  countries that are major competitors of the United States, the Labor Department  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The rise in U.S. labor costs -- 0.3% from 1987 to 1988 -- was dwarfed by  increases such as 17% in Taiwan and 11.2% in South Korea.  </P> <P> Of 11 countries for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave figures, only  France recorded a decline, at 0.8%.  </P> <P> While U.S. workers were still earning more than employees in most of the other  countries, the fall in the value of the dollar meant that a Japanese worker was  catching up fast to his U.S. counterparts.  </P> <P> The average Japanese worker earned $13.14 an hour in 1988, a 10.5% increase  over 1987. The average in the United States was $13.90.  </P> <P> In eight Western European countries, the costs were already higher than in the  United States: $19.43 in Norway and $18.07 in West Germany, for example.  </P> <P> In South Korea, however, the cost of an average hour's labor was just $2.45; in  Taiwan, it was $2.71 an hour.  </P> <P> That is, an employer could hire more than five Taiwanese or South Korean  workers for the cost of hiring one American. This helps explain why owners have  moved production lines out of the United States.  </P> <P> Not all labor costs go to workers as wages. The Labor Department figures  include employer contributions to private plans and payroll taxes for social  services, such as pensions and health care, from which workers benefit.  </P> <P> These expenses are generally higher in Western Europe than in the United  States, and higher in the United States than in the countries on the Pacific  Rim.  </P></p>

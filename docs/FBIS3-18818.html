Speaking at the presentation of next July's summit here of  the West's group of seven most industrialised countries (G-7),  Ciampi also paid attention to last week's turbulence on  international markets and observed that it had been "an  excessive reaction" to the American decision to slightly  increase short-term interest rates. The long-time Bank of Italy  governor added how the same criteria for rates did not apply to  both Europe and the United States.    Turning his attention to Italy's trade balance, premier  Ciampi forecast how it will improve this year even over the 13  trillion lire (7.7 billion dollars) assets posted for 1993.    He also down-played the reduced tax revenue reported last  week, stating how the difference between forecast and intake had  been modest and determined by a dip in the gross domestic  product.</p>

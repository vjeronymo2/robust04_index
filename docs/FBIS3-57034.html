			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Smirnov: "Regulating Russian-Georgian </F> Trade. New Georgiyevsk Treaty in Pipeline"]    [Text] To stop Georgia's slide toward economic collapse is  now possible only on condition of restored traditional economic  links with Russia. The first step in this direction was  Georgia's entry into the CIS last fall. In the meeting between  Russian and Georgian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Otar Patsatsiya, KOMMERSANT- DAILY reported yesterday, concrete  mechanics for the republic to join the Commonwealth were  discussed, and a number of bilateral agreements including one to  establish a free-trade regime were approved.    Georgia's desire for close economic relations with Russia  stems from the crisis in the national economy, which is on the  brink of collapse. In the estimate of the International  "Reforma" fund, Georgia's state budget deficit in 1993 came  close to 100 percent. Its debt to Russia tops 50 billion rubles  [R], and the prospects for paying it are rather nebulous because  Georgian exports to Russia were constantly falling, and in 1993  did not exceed R26 billion. This is in parallel with the  devaluation of the Georgian coupon, whose rate against the ruble  has fallen since last August by a factor of more than 100. The  situation is being made even worse by an appreciable decline of  supplies from Russia, primarily of energy. Deliveries of Russian  natural gas were stopped as early as 1992, and after the  Georgian side had been discovered illegally re-exporting Russian  petroleum products (Russian raw material worth $23.1 million was  shipped to France alone in the second part of 1992), the Russian  side sharply cut back its oil and petroleum products supplies.    Georgia hopes to stabilize the economic situation by signing  bilateral agreements with Russia on trade and economic relations  in 1994, and on a free-trade regime. Under these  understandings, Georgia will be guaranteed supplies of Russian  energy in agreed amounts while Georgian goods for Russia will be  exempt from import duties. The latest meeting of the two  countries' premiers in Moscow finalized 3 and 4 February as the  dates of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. The above agreements  will be signed during this trip. Besides, Eduard Shevardnadze is  going to bring Georgia back into the ruble zone. The advantages  for the Georgian side are apparent. As for the ruble, it will  further weaken as a result of such an alliance. On the whole,  Georgia is counting on Russia's financial and economic support  in solving its own national problems.    [Saneblidze]Of course.    [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it  has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and  actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that,  having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do  but sit idly by and wait for the results.    This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes,  we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did  not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of  this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as  well.    There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or  Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people  have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they  do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or  will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality  for their own purposes? No one.    Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the  situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single  moment. [passage omitted]</p>

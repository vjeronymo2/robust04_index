			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Observer: Off your bike Hard to remember the last time a politician resigned for falling off his collapsible bike. However, the bizarre case of Leo McLeay, Australia's parliamentary speaker, is one of those unforeseen incidents which just could tip Australia's forthcoming general election. It was not the over-weight McLeay's fault that he fell off his Government-owned bike after he hit a pothole and broke his arm. But what has upset Australians is the size of the ADollars 65,000 damages he won, and the speed with which they were paid out, especially since he controls the official department which he sued. No one suggests that McLeay has been dishonest. But it took a long time before the compensation payment was revealed and it has incensed Australians who feel they've been less well treated in accidents. McLeay is a close ally of Prime Minister Paul Keating and his embarrassing resignation will only fuel complaints that after a decade in power the government has lost touch with ordinary Australians. Norman Lamont should take note.</p>

Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for  reunification of South Korea, was held in Pyongyang today.    Rev. Mun was a reputed patriotic champion for reunification  who devoted his all to the struggle for the independence and  democratisation of South Korean society and the reunification of  the country.    Seen on the platform of the hall of the memorial service  were  a portrait of the deceased wearing black ribbons and wreaths  from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland, the Korean Christian Federation and other public  organisations.    Present at the memorial service were Yang Hyong-sop,  alternate Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the  Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the Supreme People's  Assembly [SPA] and vice-chairman of the Committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], Chong Chun-ki,  chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign  Countries and vice-chairman of the CPRF, and other officials  concerned.    Memorial addresses were made by Chairman of the North side  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification [Pomminnyon] Paek In-chun, director of the  secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland Paek Nam-chun and member of the C.C., the North  side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students  for the Country's Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] Choe Yong-hui.    They said the life of the late Rev. Mun, the fallen patriot,  was the life of an admirable paoriotic-minded person who devoted  his all to the struggle for independence, democracy and  reunification and the life of a reunification champion who made  a breakthrough on the barrier of national division with the  devotion of his whole body and who kindled a fierce flame of  reunification in the hearts of the compatriots at home and  abroad. His death is a big loss to our nation, they noted.    They recalled that the pastor hailed and supported the  proposal for convening a North-South political consultative  conference to discusy the confederacy formula of reunification  which was put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song  in his New Year address for 1989, visited Pyongyang in March  that year and was received by the great leader, after which he  renewed his patriotic faith and will for reunfication and, back  in South Korea, he did not cease his struggle behind bars.    By refusing a Seoul trip of our mourners' group on the death  of the late Mun, the South Korean authorities stripped  themselves naked to the world, revealing their true color as  fascist dictators and a group of barbarians who have totally  thrown away human morality and the "civilian" mask, they said.    They stressed that, though the Rev. Mun passed away, his  patriotic spirit for reunification will remain in the hearts of  our people and the day of national reunification longed for by  him will come certainly.    A poet Pak Se-ok recited a poem "To the Memory of Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan" and people's actor Yi Tan read a poem written by the  late Rev. Mun at the memorial service.</p>

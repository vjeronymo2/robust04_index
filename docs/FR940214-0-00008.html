Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action will encourage milk production during the months of July and August, which are months of declining milk production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order.

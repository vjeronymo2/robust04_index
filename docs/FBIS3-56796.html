Does the country indeed face financial  collapse in the next few months, as certain foreign observers  and also some Ukrainian politicians claim?    [Kravchuk] The situation is grave, even very grave. There  is inflation, the crisis in industry, the slump in  production.... This is all true, so to speak. I will mention a  few of what I see as the main reasons for our economy's plight.    When Ukraine was part of the USSR, the main emphasis was  placed on the development of heavy industry -- mining,  metallurgy, the chemical industry.... That is, on sectors that  do not directly benefit people but consume the bulk of energy.  And when the prices of energy sources quintupled for us in the  last 18 months, this was naturally bound to affect the entire  national economic system. On top of that there are the problems  with the financial and banking system. After all, it  essentially never existed here. The Ukrainian national bank was  just a subsidiary of the USSR bank.    Another factor has certainly been the cadres problem. Cadres  have proved unprepared to swiftly restructure our entire economy  as an autonomous, independent system. Not with a view to  isolation, but with a view to being able to resolve by our own  efforts the qualitatively new tasks facing us as a sovereign  state.    [Prokopchuk] Isn't this the explanation of the lurches,  uncertainty over the choice of path, and sabotage of the  transformations on the part of the old management apparatus,  which has barely been renewed at all?    [Kravchuk] I would not speak of sabotage as such. That is  an exaggeration. But the inconsistency of our actions on the  road to the market is clear. And the replacement of three  governments is confirmation of that. We are now on our fourth.  All the previous ones quit under pressure of the situation, on  the initiative of the Supreme Council. This rapid replacement  of governments is also not a good thing and has also had an  adverse effect.    The main miscalculation has been the attempt to combine the  principles of the administrative-edict economy and the market  economy. Seeing that the switch to market relations is not  proceeding as rapidly as we would like, our managers have clung  to familiar levers. Nothing sensible has come of this. And  only now, in my view, is the government adopting the correct  course -- an anti-inflationary, market course. But with  mandatory control on the part of the state. Since at present  property largely remains in state hands.    In short, there are shifts. Over 20,000 enterprises --  small, medium, and large -- will be privatized this year.    [Prokopchuk] But Western specialists' forecasts are not so  rosy. It is openly being said that the Ukrainian economy will  inevitably collapse and that Ukraine is doomed as an independent  state. Do you share this view?    [Kravchuk] I want to answer your question with another -- To  whose advantage is it for Ukraine to be independent, who  generally wants this? There had long been balance in the world  and in Europe, and tested and proven ties in the economy and  politics had been established. Then all of a sudden the  geopolitical situation changes sharply. Along with other new  states, Ukraine appears on the map of the world -- a sizable  country possessing nuclear weapons, a country with a decent  industrial potential and fertile soil. Today it is experiencing  difficulties and economic crisis. But it is capable of becoming  rich. Calculations show that if normal agricultural production  and processing are organized, Ukraine can provide not only  itself but also other countries with piles of foodstuffs. Tell  me, who benefits by this? So hundreds of complex questions  arise.    Our neighbors also have political interests -- access to  Europe, access to the sea, access to Crimea.... That is, a  whole system of views emerges which as I see it boil down to the  fact that today a great many people are interested in ensuring  that Ukraine does not make it as an independent state. There is  the foreign policy factor of press from both East and West.    [Prokopchuk] What about domestic political forces?    [Kravchuk] Naturally, there are also domestic forces that do  not want Ukraine to make it as a sovereign state. Some are  angry with the authorities, whom they describe as partyocratic  and communist. There are the national-patriots. They are angry  with Kravchuk and others. But, in opposing the president, they  are essentially opposing their own people. Although they pay a  lot of lipservice to the people's interests.    There are also forces openly oriented toward the interests  of  other states. Admittedly, many people allude only to Russia,  believing that "Ukrainian" interests predominate there.  However, I do not share that view. Russia naturally has more  "Ukrainian" interests than other countries, and there is still a  very great deal of work to be done to harmonize the interests of  Ukraine and Russia. But to claim that Russia alone is an  opponent of our interests, as many people try to make out, is a  mistake. We simply have not yet found the key to resolving  questions with Russia. That is my profound conviction.    In short, both domestic and external factors are extremely  complex, and we will have to make great efforts to avoid  provoking grave confrontations. But I think that thanks to our  consistency and flexibility, thanks to the fact that we have  sought and have found compromises, we have managed to retain  good relations with our neighbors and retain good friends  abroad. Thanks to our considered actions in resolving internal  political problems, in particular interethnic problems, and  thanks to our people's wisdom we have not evoked confrontations  inside our state, although some people badly want this. We live  in peace. And this is the most important point.    [Prokopchuk] Now let us touch on purely economic problems.  How was it possible to repay half the debt to Russia?    [Kravchuk] First, we began to make savings and we reduced  consumption. Second, we began to make real repayments,  realizing that you cannot live in debt. Now, if we manage to  solve the problem of compensation for nuclear weapons and  succeed in resolving other questions, in particular the question  of the Black Sea Fleet, I think we will cope with the problem of  debts to Russia.    Debts are not the most important thing today. Every state  has them. No one makes a tragedy out of this. A debt can  always be repaid, there is the basis and prospect for this. The  most important thing is to learn to work in the new conditions  and to create competitive output and technologies which will  make it possible to integrate intensively with the world economy  and the economy of the Commonwealth countries.    [Prokopchuk] What is the situation regarding payment for the  transit of Russian freight on Ukrainian railroads and Russian  gas and oil? There are rumors that Russia has already been  given all Ukrainian compressor stations and other pipeline  facilities as a contribution toward repaying the debts.    [Kravchuk] Those are just rumors. They play into the hands  of those who are interested in robbing the state. The question  of transit was raised by our acting Prime Minister Y.  Zvyahilskyy during talks in Moscow ahead of the Ashgabat meeting.    Solutions were found. Russia reduced gas prices, and we  reduced transit prices accordingly. The same happened with  Turkmenistan.    [Prokopchuk] Private capital and big investors who would  help fill the empty shelves and remove social tension are not  shunning Ukraine only because of the political instability.  They are deterred by the absence of guarantees regarding the  export of their share of the profits and the absence of a law on  land assigning to the owners of an enterprise the land on which  it stands.... Ukraine, bankers claim, is dying for want of  investment.    [Kravchuk] We adopted foreign economic laws back when I was  chairman of the Supreme Council. At that time we had our laws  assessed by experts in a number of countries with a developed  market economy. But when one of our governments received the  right to issue decrees, it slightly rejigged these laws. A  number of important provisions that were to investors' advantage  were removed.    We are now rectifying this situation. At any rate, today our  foreign economic laws are no worse than those operating in other  countries. They give the right to unimpeded evacuation of  profits, properly defend the investor's capital, and provide him  with guarantees and tax breaks. But our presentation of these  laws is painfully low-key and useless.    Another point. If we had a convertible national currency  and if we managed to curb inflation, investors would be keener  to come here. That is, today the laws are not the problem.    [Prokopchuk] Many people believe that the slump in  production  in Ukraine and therefore the decline in the population's living  standard result from the severing of economic ties with Russia.  But former Vice Premier B. Pinzenik claims that this is not the  cause but the effect of the fact "that we have artificially  blocked the way to the Russian market with quotas, licenses,  duties, and taxes and, now we have lost this market, have  nothing with which to purchase Russian energy sources." What is  your view?    [Kravchuk] What happened happened. But now we have removed  many of the "barriers." But it cannot be said that the  "barriers" were erected only by Ukraine. When Russia first sent  us the list of its goods liable to export duties and the list  ran, I think, to over 2,000 items, I said: What kind of "free  trade" is this? (Incidentally, our list of goods for which  special export procedures were introduced at that time consisted  of only 300 items.) Why did the Russians not lift the ban on  free trade in their oil, gas, and timber?    Moreover, who was the first to start to erect borders  between  Ukraine and Russia, who was the first to adopt that decision?  Russia. But I bear no grudge. Every state has to defend itself  and its interests. I am merely in favor of ensuring that there  is no distortion or lack of objectivity. And that mutual  interests are taken into account and everything is resolved on  businesslike, partner principles.    Why is the European Community prospering? Because there if  citrus fruit prices in Italy and Spain are at a given level,  they are the same in France as well, and if somebody wants to  change something, they assemble for a general council for a  mutually respectful review of quotas, taxes, and duties.    But what happens over here? Russia introduces its own  prices, its own wages without consulting with anybody.... We  cannot do this because we are in different leagues. Russia has  a positive balance, it has colossal natural resources, and it  can permit itself things that neither we nor other CIS countries  can permit ourselves.    The upshot is that, given the low purchasing power of our  population and the low prices compared with those in Russia, a  flood of Ukrainian foodstuffs, anything that can be transported  and carried, poured into Russia. Our stores and depots were  stripped bare. So we were forced at the end of the year to  double or triple food prices in order to halt the plundering of  the country. Today you can buy a ticket to Moscow or other  Russian cities without any problem -- the flood of peddlers  exploiting this "equal, mutually advantageous" cooperation, the  "consideration" of mutual interests, and the operation of the  "unified regulatory system" has dried up.    This mechanism does not exist; there is only talk about it.  Just why do those who shove microphones at Ukrainian citizens at  markets in Bryansk and Smolensk not tell the truth about the  reasons for these pilgrimages but only screen the "unadorned,"  strictly personal (and "correct," of course) viewpoint of their  interviewee?    [Prokopchuk] Leonid Makarovich, why in your view has the  ruble zone not worked out? And what is your prediction for the  future of the CIS?    [Kravchuk] I said from the very beginning that there would  be no ruble zone. Because we have the wrong view of the ruble  zone and how it should be understood. In history there have  been dollar pools, sterling zones.... But then each of the  states belonging to the said zone had its own currency and  aligned it with the main currency. The dollar, for example.  But what did we want from the ruble zone? A single ruble --  the same for all the states? That is not a ruble zone, but a  ruble state.    Russia must not be blamed here; I would have acted the same  way as the Central Bank of Russia. If I print the money (and  this is the greatest asset) I also have to track the money  supply, the correctness of mutual settlements, prices. If this  is not done Russia will die, it will be overtaken by stronger  inflation than we have. To live in different states and set  your own prices, wages, and taxes while all using the same ruble  is unrealistic. I talked about this in Moscow when we were  discussing the problem of the Economic Union. At the time many  people took exception to what I said. But within a month we had  confirmation of what I was asserting. Russia has ultimately  forced out of its zone almost all those who nurtured hopes of  finding a home in this zone. And Russia is right. It is  pursuing primarily its own interests and attending to the  stability of its own monetary system, the prevention of  inflation, and the strengthening of its own economy. And this is  natural. This is how we, and others, would act. Charity begins  at home.    As for the fate of the CIS, we are witnessing, as I have  already said, the improvement of our Commonwealth's structure.  It is hard to predict today what the specific directions of  this improvement will be, but the fact that the Commonwealth is  necessary is beyond doubt. There are two main strands: The  member countries' common problems must be solved within a CIS  framework, while questions of relations between individual  states must be resolved on a bilateral basis. These two strands  were indeed in evidence during the meetings and talks in  Ashgabat.    Can the Commonwealth, in the long term, become the same kind  of association of states as the European Union? Maybe, but it  will take time. The internal complexities in every CIS member  country are a brake on the processes of the broader and more  active improvement of the CIS itself. But in the long term, I  repeat, we can achieve the same kind of union as the EEC.    [Prokopchuk] If it isn't a secret, how are the Massandra  accords on the Black Sea Fleet and other issues being  implemented?    [Kravchuk] There is movement. First and foremost in  understanding the other side. I proceed on the basis that we  have already adopted three documents relating to the Fleet --  the Yalta, Dagomys, and Massandra accords. When we were  adopting them we moved first forward and then backward. In any  event, taking these documents as a whole, they can serve as the  starting point for steps forward. It was this that I suggested  to President B. Yeltsin. But the Russian side is seeking to use  only the Massandra document. And does not wish to take account  of the two previous documents, which nobody has rescinded. On  the one side you have a protocol of intent, on the other --  signed agreements.    You cannot pick and choose only the things which you find  advantageous and convenient to yourself. It is necessary to  examine everything as a package, on the basis of mutual  acceptability, not to exploit the situation and some short-term  advantages; it is necessary to take the long-term view.    If today some people think that a change of borders is  possible, they are deeply mistaken. Agreement on something  specific is indeed possible -- there have been examples of this  in history. But times need to be different for this. It is  necessary to follow only the path of discussion, the path of  accords. To try to resolve something by force means to unleash  conflict. Incidentally, it's not all as simple in the Crimea as  people sometimes like to suggest.    [Prokopchuk] Incidentally, it is 340 years since the  Pereyaslavl Assembly [which voted for Ukrainian union with  Muscovy].    [Kravchuk] Yes, we lived together for 340 years and now we  cannot resolve the problems which have built up and  accumulated.... I believe that we will have closer ties than  before, natural ties, not diktat -- older and younger brothers,  dominant and subordinate peoples. We will cooperate as equal  partners. We must move toward this kind of relationship calmly,  smoothly, handsomely, with the understanding that we are Slav  peoples and are ordained to live together, side by side,  forever. The only thing is that today no stupidities must be  committed. By Russia or Ukraine. People must not state that  Ukraine as such does not exist, and Ukrainian independence is in  general a "historical mistake."    Nor do I share the other side's statements that all the  difficulties which we have come up against today are "Russian  intrigues," that it has been the "dirty Muscovites" ["moskali"]  who have been strangling us all his time.... For some reason  some people are very keen to cause trouble between us. This is  why it is necessary not to commit stupidities or ignore today's  realities.    [Prokopchuk] By ratifying START I and the Lisbon Protocol  with a number of substantial provisos did Ukraine not doom  itself to a further, tighter credit blockade and uncompromising  political pressure from the United States and other nuclear  states?    [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council decree includes provisos  which are perfectly normal and natural, as they say. Yes,  Ukraine is entitled to compensation for its nuclear weapons,  Ukraine must have reliable guarantees of its security, Ukraine  needs assistance to eliminate its nuclear weapons.    But the fact that the Supreme Council did not vote to join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is a major mistake by our  parliament. I have said and will continue to say this, I will  insist that the only correct path for us is to join the treaty.  We cannot change the already adopted course toward nuclear-free  status. You can build any illusions you like, even about  creating our own nuclear industry, but they are only illusions.  It is clear to everyone that we do not need the weapons we  inherited from the USSR. And nobody will ever use them.    Everybody knows that, even if such an insane idea was to  come into somebody's head, it is practically impossible today  for Ukraine to launch the missiles. Any of these 176 missiles  can be launched only on orders from Moscow. This is clear to  everyone, but nevertheless attempts continue to be made to turn  us into a bogeyman.    In signing the trilateral statement and the annex to it in  Moscow on 14 January, Ukraine won a political, economic, and  human victory. The United States, Russia, and the entire world  community shared it with us. Nobody will now say that Ukraine  is standing still on the nuclear disarmament road. The road to  START II and even START III is now open. Mankind has gained  real hope of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.    There is something else I also wish to stress. Most of the  demands formulated in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's provisos  relating to ratification of the START I treaty were met. In the  documents which were signed the United States and Russia stated  that they respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and  independence, that is, they are becoming guarantors of our  security. After acceding to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty  -- and I am confident that our parliament will now adopt such a  decision -- Ukraine will be safeguarded against nuclear attack.  And, equally importantly, we will receive compensation for the  uranium in the strategic missile warheads which will be sent to  Russia, plus financial, scientific, and technical assistance in  eliminating our nuclear weapons.    As for the part of your question relating to a tougher  credit  blockade, in December there was indeed a real threat of  isolation. But now broad political and economic cooperation  prospects are opening up for us.    [Prokopchuk] And a final, purely personal point, Leonid  Makarovich, if you will permit me. Since you also became head  of government there has been an obvious increase in your  workload. Do you manage to carve out time for your family and  grandchildren? And in general what is your life like outside  work?    [Kravchuk] My grandson Andrey is 13 and as tall as me; he's  an early developer. And my granddaughter Mashenka is six.  She's so sweet and interesting. When they are with me it's the  only time I get completely away from all the worries and  problems. You have to answer their endless questions, you see.  When we get involved in their games I myself also become like a  child. I can play hide-and-seek with my eyes blindfolded; when  they crawl around on their knees, I crawl around on my knees;  when they jump, I jump. Those are the times I really relax....</p>

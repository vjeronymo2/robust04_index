			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KENTUCKY FLOODS CLOG HIGHWAYS, FORM SEA OF MUD  </P> <P> Rain-swollen rivers and streams gushed over their banks in Kentucky and  bordering states Wednesday, flooding roads and homes, closing schools and  turning farmland into seas of mud.  </P> <P> The storms, which have drenched parts of Kentucky with up to 10 inches of rain  since Sunday and neighboring Tennessee with almost six inches in some areas,  were blamed for at least five deaths in the two states, officials said.  </P> <P> Flash flood watches and warnings were posted in both states, and some of the  heavy rains spilled over into Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West  Virginia.  </P> <P> Western and central Kentucky were hardest hit by flooding as Rolling Fork River  overflowed and clogged roads near Boston, 50 miles south of Louisville.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said the river was still rising and was expected  to crest at about 51 feet -- 16 feet above flood stage.  </P> <P> Police said highway travel was hazardous because deep water was sitting on  roads.  </P> <P> At least a dozen school systems around the state were closed for a second  straight day Wednesday because of high water. Officials in at least five  counties said some residents evacuated their homes and moved to higher ground.  </P> <P> Agricultural forecasters said rain-soaked farmland had become a virtual sea of  mud in many parts of Kentucky. They warned that flooded fields could cause  damage to some cereal crops.  </P> <P> In West Virginia, up to four inches of rain fell, spreading floods that closed  schools or canceled classes in six counties and blocked roads in five counties,  officials said.  </P></p>

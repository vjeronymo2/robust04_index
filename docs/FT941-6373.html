			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Motivation may mean more than marks - The art of the hunch has the merit of not wasting time Here is one of those probably apocryphal tales that you find impossible to source but which you want to believe is true because it supports a personal belief or prejudice. I heard it last week from a Bank of England official at a discussion on ethical concerns in recruitment and selection held at London Business School. All she provided for verification was an assurance that the person who passed the story to her was in a position to know the truth of it. She recounted the story of some administrators of a college in further education who had interviewed candidates for a course, then sent the acceptance slips to the rejects and the rejection slips to those they had chosen to accept. Instead of owning up to the mistake the administrators decided to let the error go. Four years into the course, when they were able to compare the performance of that year's intake with those in previous years, the would-be rejects were achieving results on a par with their predecessors. It was impossible to tell the difference. The lesson to be drawn, suggested the bank official, was that organisations might be worrying too much about recruitment when a concentration on motivation and training could produce the same results or even better at the end of the day. The story, whether true or not, tends to reinforce the judgment of many small businesses which, according to recent occupational psychology research at Hull University, still rely heavily on the tried and untested indicator of gut reaction when recruiting. Accepting that the hunch is not an exact science it may, nevertheless, waste less time than many recruitment practices, since another often-quoted observation holds that most selections are decided within the first five minutes of an interview, the rest of the time being used to confirm the decision. Even psychologists who might argue for greater objectivity would accept that first impressions should not be underestimated. A friend in the recruitment business recalls a personnel colleague who swore by all the latest psychometric techniques but who was adamant that he would never recruit any man who wore white socks or an earring. Whatever your recruitment techniques, if you are considering taking a look at psychological tests in an attempt to be more sophisticated you should choose carefully. Some specialists have attempted to debunk even the most trusted tests. The field of psychometrics has never fully recovered from the broadside delivered by Steve Blinkhorn and Charles Johnson in Nature magazine a few years ago. The two psychologists, who run a consulting company, Psychometric Research and Development, were severely critical of some of the most respected personality tests on the market. They said: 'We see precious little evidence that even the best personality tests predict job performance and a good deal of evidence of poorly understood statistical methods being pressed into service to buttress shaky claims.' Most pointed of all was a remark condemning the way some tests were applied which, they said, 'bamboozles an unsophisticated public with pseudo science.' The criticism triggered outrage among other occupational psychologists, particularly one of the leading test publishers which pointed out that Blinkhorn and Johnson's company was a competitor. The criticism did give rise to some consideration about whether some testers were making exaggerated claims for their methods. In addition, the plethora of tests on the market, some of them with very doubtful uses, led to the conclusion that some standards were essential. Recognising that the field is plagued by charlatans, the British Psychological Society is preparing a certificate of competence for psychologists administering personality tests. These new Level B certificates, following on from the initial level A certificates that cover ability testing, should be in place by the end of the year. The new certificate is not a form of licensing for occupational psychologists since the field is unregulated. Neither will it make tests foolproof, but it will tell you that the holder has demonstrated some level of competence. Even before going down the testing route, some would advocate that recruiters think carefully about what information they need and whether it can be obtained any other way. Meanwhile the amount of guidance in the area is improving. The society produces a guide which can be obtained from its headquarters at St Andrews House, 48 Princess Road East, Leicester LE1 7DR. In addition, the Institute of Personnel Management publishes a code that also endorses the society's certificates of competence. The code is available from the institute's headquarters at IPM House, Camp Road, Wimbledon, London, SW19 4UX. Executives who lose their jobs have a number of options for finding work if they want to return to similar employment. Drake Beam Morin, the outplacement and career management firm, claims that professional outplacement counselling can markedly improve job prospects. In support of this view, it has compared figures drawn from its own clients with statistics in the Department of Employment's quarterly Labour Force Survey. Some 14 per cent of DBM's clients have been unemployed for more than 12 months compared with 17 per cent a year ago. In contrast, the labour force survey shows that 43 per cent of professionals overall had been out of work for more than a year in 1993 compared with 30 per cent in 1992. One reason for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the top outplacement companies tend to be engaged by large corporations to provide services within their overall redundancy packages. 'The people we help have come from good companies which offer outplacement services for their staff. They are shedding jobs for corporate reasons that have no reflection on the potential of the individuals involved,' says DBM. Some counselling services in what has been a growing and largely uncontrolled industry over the past few years have earned parts of the market a bad name. Unemployed managers should be wary of counselling services that promise to circulate CVs to potential recruiters. When I asked one recruiter about them last week, he said: 'Yes we get these things in a big pile through the post and they go straight in the bin. We don't value that kind of approach.' The IPM published a code of conduct for the industry just over a year ago and has listed 120 companies that fulfilled its requirements. It is now reviewing whether to continue the directory. It said: 'The list goes some way towards setting standards but we cannot enforce them so it does tend to question their value.' Good outplacement servicing offers a tiered approach, ranging from counselling - where you are urged to sit back and think about what you want to do with the rest of your career - to the identification of training needs and practical guidance of how and where to find those hidden jobs that tend to be advertised internally in the big companies. Trade unions are beginning to break into this market in a small way. The Society of Telecom Executives, with 22,000 members in the telecommunications industry, established a career register for its members outside BT, which has plans to shed thousands of managerial jobs over the next three or four years. The STE journal highlighted the success of one member, Mr Graham Rose, who moved to a new telecommunications job in Nice, France, last Easter after leaving his 18-year career in BT, finishing as a transmissions and budgets manager. After failing to find work from 40 job applications, his breakthrough came when he received a mailing from the skills register. He said: 'It pays more than twice what I got in BT, there are free French lessons, help with accommodation and school fees and a great climate.' The union has now decided to put the service on a more professional footing.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Berlusconi proposes special body to prevent conflicts of interest Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday announced the creation of a special commission to distance his business interests in the Fininvest media empire from his role as Italian prime minister. But the decision was taken without direct consultation with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the president's office said last night. It came just after Mr Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, surrendered to anti-corruption magistrates in Milan to answer charges of paying bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. Mr Berlusconi's move, designed to avoid an increasingly damaging conflict of interest that has undermined the credibility of his government, was greeted with cautious relief by the financial markets. The lira strengthened marginally and rose above L1,000 to the D-Mark. Outlining his initiative, a grim-faced Mr Berlusconi implicitly admitted he had underestimated the problems created by his ownership of Fininvest. Supporters and opponents agreed he had bought some breathing space for his embattled government. But President Scalfaro's stance, indicating he would reserve his judgment until he had seen Mr Berlusconi's proposal, created some uncertainty about how the proposal could be made into law. Under Mr Berlusconi's plan, Mr Scalfaro - in conjunction with the speakers of the two houses of parliament - will nominate a five-person special commission. The commission will include the head of the media watchdog body and the chairman of the anti-trust commission. The new authority will monitor all potential conflicts of interest that might affect government business and the affairs of the Fininvest group, Italy's second-largest private holding with turnover of L11,600bn (Pounds 4.8bn) and net debts of L3,800bn in 1993. The commission will supervise the activities of an administrator, appointed by Mr Berlusconi, whose task will be to look after the prime minister's proprietary interests in Fininvest. Last night, Mr Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers were quoted by Ansa, the national news agency, as saying their client had admitted paying L330m to the Guardia di Finanza over inspections of the balance sheets of three Fininvest companies.</p>

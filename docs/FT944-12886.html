			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Volvo to expand truckmaking in Europe and Asia Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is embarking on a far-reaching expansion of its truck operations in Europe and Asia. The ambitious moves, which include the development of a range of trucks to allow it to enter the European light truck market for the first time, result from the group's fundamental review of global strategy made after the collapse of its planned merger with Renault nearly a year ago. Volvo, the world's second-largest heavy truckmaker (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight), behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany, is focusing corporate development on its automotive operations with the divestment of most other activities. As a key part of this strategy, it plans to: Expand the capacity of its heavy truck operations in Europe by up to 20 per cent by mid-1996, with the investment of more than SKr1bn (Pounds 86m). Develop a range of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to allow it to challenge established rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, Iveco, MAN, Renault and Daf in this segment of the European market. Establish a joint venture in China with the aim of adding a production centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck manufacturing operations in Europe and North and South America. It has also launched a feasibility study into establishing production in India. Volvo is leading the European truck industry's emergence from recession, and its share of the west European heavy truck market has jumped to 15.5 per cent in the first eight months of 1994 from 12.1 per cent in the whole of 1993. Mr Karl-Erling Trogen, chief executive of Volvo Truck, said the business was operating at the limit of its capacity in Europe. Production of Volvo-brand trucks, mainly in Europe and in Brazil - Volvo sells under the WhiteGMC brand in North America - was running at an annualised rate of 45,000 a year, a rise of more than 60 per cent from under 28,000 a year in the depth of the recession in mid-1993. The group is already investing SKr390m in order to raise capacity to 50,000 by July next year, but in early December the Volvo board is expected to approve the investment of more than SKr1bn to raise capacity further to between 55,000 and 60,000 trucks a year (excluding North America) by mid-1996. Mr Trogen said that Asia was Volvo's 'number one priority' for geographic expansion. It had launched a feasibility study with China National Heavy Truck and Shandong Automotive for the establishment of joint ventures for the production of both trucks and components in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing.</p>

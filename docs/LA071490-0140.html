			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS SHOW SUPPORT FOR NEA, WARN OF BACKLASH;  </P> <P> ART: SUPPORTERS OF THE NATIONAL AGENCY MEET IN HUNTINGTON BEACH TO CRITICIZE  WHAT THEY CALL A RIGHT-WING MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY TO INHIBIT AND CENSOR THE  ARTS.  </P> <P> In the first major public show of support in Orange County for the National  Endowment for the Arts, about 150 people crowded into City Council chambers  here Thursday night to listen as artists and arts activists spoke out in  defense of the embattled federal agency.  </P> <P> "The political right wing has awakened a sleeping giant, and they're going to  live to regret it," offered Michael Hudson, vice president and general counsel  for the organization People For the American Way, which is actively engaged in  a range of censorship issues (the group is backing choreographer Bella Lewitzky  in her suit against the NEA, filed Thursday).  </P> <P> The formal part of the three-hour program was closed by Tim Miller, one of four  performance artists who had been recommended for NEA fellowship grants by a  peer review panel, but whose grants were turned down by agency Chairman John E.  Frohnmayer, apparently to head off criticism from conservative critics.  </P> <P> "I'm one artist who has fallen prey to the far right wing of this country,"  said Miller, who often tackles gay-rights issues in his work. "I'm extremely  frightened at what is happening."  </P> <P> Miller, now a Santa Monica resident, grew up in Orange County and told the  audience of his youth here, including his first performances at Cal State  Fullerton and Fullerton College. He attributed the denial of his NEA grant to  "a fearful, reactionary impulse" on the part of the "white male power  structure," and said it is part of a larger societal attack on people outside  the mainstream.  </P> <P> Thursday's meeting took place within the district of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R  -- Lomita), who, along with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), has led congressional  attacks on the NEA. The freshman congressman, who representions portions of  Orange and Los Angeles counties, came under frequent attack during the forum.  Jeffrey Chester, a media consultant, announced the formation of a Political  Action Committee that will work specifically to defeat Rohrabacher when he  comes up for reelection in November.  </P> <P> In addition, campaign supporters said they will circulate flyers today that  denounce Rohrabacher's record on a number of issues in several Long Beach and  Orange County shopping malls.  </P> <P> Thursday's lone spoken dissent came from two members of the Bieber family of  Huntington Beach: son James, a national director of the conservative Young  Americans for Freedom, and father Dale, who identified himself as an artists'  agent. Both argued from the Libertarian perspective, saying that artists are  not entitled to public funds and that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for  works that may offend them.  </P> <P> The dispute between conservatives in Congress and the NEA began last year after  protests from conservative groups over federal support of art shows containing  controversial photographs by Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. Last fall,  Congress enacted a provision requiring 1990 grant recipients to sign an oath  vowing not to produce "obscene" works.  </P> <P> In late June, Frohnmayer approved grants for 14 solo performance artists, but  denied grants to Miller, Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and John Fleck, all of whom  deal with political and sexual issues in their work. The action was roundly  condemned by the arts community and has helped to escalate the battle over the  NEA.  </P> <P> Long Beach-based video artist Bill Viola, reading from a 20-page written  statement, offered a detailed defense of the agency, calling it a "shining  example of an arts patronage system" -- one that costs the average individual  about 68 cents a year to support.  </P> <P> In its 25-year history, Viola said, the agency has handed out more than 80,000  grants. "That a few individuals can turn around and, because less than 20 of  these projects have been overtly offensive to some, cry out for the abolition  of the agency is beyond me and beyond any exercise of common sense and  rationality," the artist said.  </P> <P> Thursday's forum was organized by the nascent Orange County Committee of the  Long Beach/Orange County Coalition for Freedom of Expression, with help from  Fullerton-based Poets Reading Inc. The event, which opened with performances by  local musicians and a poet, was billed as a "call to action" for local artists  and other citizens to support a reauthorized NEA.  </P></p>

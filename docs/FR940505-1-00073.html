Regulations for Specific Sources in Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Introduction and rationale for selection of sources. In developing the attainment demonstration, EPA evaluated the possibility of achieving emissions reductions from stationary point sources in the Sacramento area. EPA has identified several major stationary sources of VOC in the Sacramento area which are not subject to reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements. Under section 182(a)(2)(A) and 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act, local air pollution control agencies are responsible for the submittal of RACT rules for all major sources to EPA. Formica Corporation (Placer County), Sierra Pine Limited (Placer County), Michigan California Lumber Company (El Dorado County), and Reynolds Metal's tab lubricant operation (Placer County) are four major VOC sources which are not currently subject to RACT requirements. In order to achieve VOC emissions reductions for the FIP and to provide rule models that will help the local air agencies meet their Clean Air Act requirements, EPA is proposing the following source specific RACT rules for the Sacramento area. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These four sources will also be required to achieve additional VOC emissions reductions required by the Cap Rules discussed in section III.C.5. of today's notice, as well as any NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements that may apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Formica Corporation (Placer County) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p) sets VOC emission limits for resins used at Formica Corporation's Sierra Plant (``Formica'') which manufactures plastic laminate products. Emissions are generated from the lamination process which involves the application of melamine and phenolic resins to several types of paper, followed by oven curing. VOC emissions reductions have been achieved by Formica due to past changes in resin formulations. Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p) represents Formica's current resin formulations and EPA's proposal of a RACT rule for Formica.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Formica has made several changes in resin formulation which have reduced their VOC emissions. In 1987, Formica switched from a phenolic resin with a VOC content of 2.88 lb/gal to one at 1.85 lb/gal. In 1991, Formica reduced their phenolic resin VOC content again from 1.85 lb/gal to 1.13 lb/gal. Also in 1991, the melamine resin was switched so that the VOC content was reduced from 0.2 lb/gal to 0.002 lb/gal. EPA is proposing that 1.13 lbs of VOC per gallon of phenolic resin applied and 0.002 lbs of VOC per gallon of melamine resin applied represent RACT for Formica. Proposed RACT rule 52.289(p) will also allow control equipment with an overall efficiency of 85 percent as an alternative to meeting the above VOC limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the 1990 CARB point source inventory, Formica emitted 211.8 tons per year (tpy) of reactive organic gases (ROG). However, more recent and accurate emissions data indicate that Formica's emissions in 1990 were actually 601.6 tpy of VOC and that with the change in resin formulations in 1991, Formica's emissions were reduced to 461.3 tpy of VOC. Thus, with the resin changes made by Formica since 1990, approximately 140 tpy or 0.38 tons per day (tpd) of VOC emissions reductions have been achieved by Formica.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the resin changes required by the proposed RACT rule have already been implemented, there should be no additional costs for Formica to meet the rule's requirements. However, it appears that the past reformulations were cost effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is aware that Formica is currently in the process of obtaining an Authority to Construct permit from Placer County APCD to install a thermal oxidizer in order to bank emissions reductions credits. EPA also understands that Formica has plans to bank the emissions reductions from the second phenolic reformulation discussed above. In order for Formica to bank the emissions from the second phenolic reformulation, EPA would have to propose a rule which set the phenolic limit at 1.85 lbs/gal., rather than 1.13 lb/gal. The emissions reductions achieved by the second reformulation would then have to be achieved elsewhere by the FIP. Given the stringency of some of the other FIP measures, EPA believes that proposed rule 52.2961(p) should represent RACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) SierraPine Limited (Placer). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(q) controls the emissions from SierraPine Limited, a medium density fiberboard plant in Placer County. Estimated uncontrolled emissions at the facility total approximately 306 tons of VOC per year, with the primary emissions points at three fiber dryers (178 tpy), two press vents (117 tpy), and wood-waste fired boiler (11 tpy). The three wood fiber dryers use steam heat to dry the wood fibers but in the process drive off VOCs in the wood. After the fibers are dried and formed into the desired shape, a resin is applied. A steam heated press is then used to form the fiberboard. As the fiberboard is heated, VOCs (mostly formaldehyde) are driven off. Currently all VOCs are emitted directly to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a review of currently available controls, emissions from the dryers and vents could be reduced significantly through the addition of a control device (e.g., wet electrostatic precipitator/carbon adsorption system or regenerative thermal oxidation). Emissions at the wood-fired boiler could also be reduced by maintaining optimum combustion practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule for this facility would require the reduction of dryer and press vent emissions by 90 percent, which would be achievable through currently available technology at an estimated cost of $2,200 to $3,400 per ton of VOC reduced. The cost per ton may be partially offset by the additional PM10 reductions expected as the result of controls. <FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>  The rule is expected to reduce VOC emissions at the facility by approximately 280 to 290 tpy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SierraPine has applied for permits to construct wet electrostatic precipitators and wet scrubbers to reduce PM10 emissions at the facility. While these controls will have some smalll VOC reduction benefit, EPA has determined that these controls alone will not address the need for RACT level reductions as required under the Clean Air Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Michigan-California Lumber Company (El Dorado) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(r) controls the VOC emissions from Michigan-California Lumber (``Michigan-California'') which is a lumber processing and timber manufacturing facility located in El Dorado County. Various coniferous tree species, including Sugar Pine, Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine, and White Fir, are harvested, transported to the facility, and processed for commercial sale. The main source of VOC emissions from Michigan-California is a spreader-stoker boiler which uses waste bark and wood as fuel. Due to several operational changes to increase the efficiency of the boiler, VOC emissions reductions have also been realized. Proposed 40 C.F.R. 52.2961(r) represents Michigan-California's current operating conditions and EPA's proposal of a RACT rule for Michigan-California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's proposed RACT rule will require Michigan-California to meet an emission limit of 150 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of VOCs in the stack exhaust stream from the spreader-stoker furnace. Since 1988, Michigan-California has made improvements in the combustion process and regulated moisture concentration of the wood fuel for the spreader-stoker furnace which resulted in an average VOC emission rate of approximately 218 ppmv during a 1992 source test. Further changes and improvements made since 1992 have resulted in a VOC emission rate of approximately 127 ppmv during a 1993 source test. Therefore, a maximum VOC limit of 150 ppmv is reasonable for Michigan-California's spreader- stoker furnace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 CARB point source inventory reports Michigan-California emitting 251.7 tpy of VOC which was based on 1988 emissions test estimates. With the changes since 1988, current VOC emissions should be approximately 48.8 tpy. Thus, Michigan-California has achieved approximately 200 tpy or 0.56 tpd of VOC reductions since 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ma Xiaoming and Zou Wenhui, affiliated with the </F> general urban survey team of the State Statistical Bureau:  "Changes in the Situation Regarding the Scissors Difference  Between the Prices of Industrial and Agricultural Products in  China"]    [Text] Compared with the period shortly after the founding  of the state, the scissors difference between the prices of  industrial and agricultural products in China has been greatly  reduced in terms of the general trend; the 1992 situation  represented a decrease of 66.5 percent over 1950. But, amid the  declines, there have been great fluctuations and marked  differences between different stages. In recent years there has  occurred a tendency to grow again, and such a tendency should  arouse sufficient attention.    There have been marked differences between different stages  with regard to changes in the scissors difference between the  prices of industrial and agricultural products:    The first stage: After the founding of the state, the party  and government adopted the policies of stabilizing the rural  retail prices for industrial products, gradually raising the  procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products, and  gradually reducing the exchange price ratio between industrial  and agricultural products. In 1951-1979 the scissors difference  between the prices of industrial and agricultural products was  reduced by 49.6 percent on a cumulative basis, and the reduction  in the scissors difference manifested itself in the form of  "static reduction."    The second stage: After the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, our country began price reform. Price reform  started with reforming prices for agricultural products, and the  focus of price reform in 1979-1988 was the reforming of the  system of prices for agricultural products and the system  governing the management of those prices. The state  substantially raised the procurement prices for 18 major  agricultural and sideline products including grain, cotton, and  oil crops; the average increase was 25.7 percent. The  procurement prices for most agricultural products were  decontrolled. Because of demand, the decontrolled prices for  agricultural products rose rapidly, resulting in an increase in  the general level of procurement prices for agricultural and  sideline products. Consequently the scissors difference between  the prices of industrial and agricultural products decreased  substantially. The general level of procurement prices for  agricultural and sideline products rose by 145 percent in  1979-1988, but the rural retail prices for industrial products  rose by only 38.9 percent in the same period. The scissors  difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural  products decreased markedly, falling by 43.3 percent from 1978  on a cumulative basis. That is, the amount of industrial  products that the peasants were able to exchange a definite  amount of agricultural products for increased by 76 percent. The  scissors difference between the prices of industrial and  agricultural products decreased at an average annual rate of 4.6  percent. Compared with the 28 years before the reform, the  amount of reduction was much larger and the speed of reduction  was much higher. All this gave the peasants a great deal of  benefits, and promoted the development of agricultural  production.    The third stage: In 1989-1991 the state cooled down the  "overheated economy" in a comprehensive way; that is, that there  was a period of improvement and rectification. During this  period, the focus of price reform was shifted onto industry. The  state adopted measures to alleviate the problems in the prices  of industrial products and agricultural production materials  which had been accumulated over a long time; especially, large  steps were taken in the last two years of the Seventh Five-Year  Plan period. At the same time, because the market for  agricultural products was weak, because there were constraints  on demand for agricultural products, and because the procurement  prices for agricultural products were low, the rate of increase  in the rural retail prices for industrial products (27.9  percent) was much higher than the rate of increase in the  procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products (9.8  percent); as a result the scissors difference between the prices  of industrial and agricultural products grew for three years in  a row, leading to a cumulative growth of 16.5 percent; that is,  that the amount of industrial products that a definite amount of  agricultural products could be exchanged for decreased by 14.2  percent from 1989.    The fourth stage: In 1992, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping made  his southern inspection remarks, price reform was accelerated.  The state substantially raised the forward procurement prices  for grain, and many regions decontrolled the procurement and  selling prices for grain. Procurement grain prices left the  fluctuating situation that had existed over the previous two  years, and got out of the trough; the procurement prices for  agricultural products rose by 3.4 percent, while the rural  prices for industrial products rose by only 3.1 percent. The  scissors difference between the prices of industrial and  agricultural products decreased, falling by 0.3 percent from the  year before. This was the first time that the scissors  difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural  products had been reduced after three consecutive years' of  growth in the scissors difference which had started in early  1989.    The fifth stage: Since the middle of 1992, our national  economy has entered the period of rapid growth, and our country  has intensified price reform, focusing on transportation,  energy, and basic raw and other materials. In the first quarter  of 1993 the scissors difference between the prices of industrial  and agricultural products began to grow again. In the first half  of 1993 the scissors difference between the prices of industrial  and agricultural products grew by 1.8 percent, and the rate of  growth is likely to increase gradually. This will inevitably  produce adverse impact on agricultural production, and thus  should arouse attention.    The reasons for the continued growth in the scissors  difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural  products in the first half of 1993:    The first was that agriculture was a backward and risk-rife  industry. Agricultural labor productivity grew slowly and  agriculture's economic returns were not high,    The second was that as the state adopted measures to  alleviate the remaining problems in the prices of industrial  consumer goods and agricultural production materials, carrying  out intensified reform operations, the rate of increase in the  procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products (8.1  percent) was lower than the rate of increase in the prices for  industrial products (10 percent). The structural adjustment of  prices for industrial products was substantial and extensive.  Toward the end of 1992, because of the effects of the state's  decontrolling the prices of over 500 industrial products, the  state's policy-based price adjustments, and the expansion of  investment and consumption demand, prices for industrial  products rose rapidly, In the first half of the year the rural  retail prices for industrial products rose by 10 percent. In  this respect the rural prices for industrial consumer goods rose  by 9.3 percent, and prices for agricultural production materials  rose by 12.3 percent.    The rate of increase in the prices for agricultural products  got ever higher on a quarterly basis. The first quarter saw an  increase of 8.5 percent, while the second quarter saw a  double-digit increase (15 percent). The reasons for the ever  higher rate of increase in the prices for agricultural  production materials: 1) Because of the propelling effects of  the abovementioned reform measures, production costs rose, while  prices continued to be high. 2) The industry producing  agricultural production materials contracted and imports  decreased; demand pushed the prices to rise. Compared with the  same period last year, in the first half of the year the  production of chemical fertilizer declined by 2.6 percent  cumulatively, farm pesticide declined by 10.1 percent, farm-use  films declined by 31.8 percent; and small tractors declined by  42.1 percent. At the same time imports of chemical fertilizer  fell, resulting in a cumulative January-May reduction of 42.3  percent. 3) The state abolished monopoly trading in agricultural  production materials; the operating mechanisms became flexible  and the circulating channel was broadened.    The continued growth in the scissors difference between the  prices of industrial and agricultural products has led to a  decline in the comparative returns on agricultural products as  well as an increase in the hidden burdens on the peasants.  According to calculations, the 8.1 percent increase in the  procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products in the  first half of 1993 led to an increase of 6.86 billion yuan in  the peasants' income. As there was an increase of 8.1 percent in  prices on rural trading markets, the peasants' income from  selling agricultural products to the nonagricultural population  increased by 680 million yuan. The two things resulted in a  combined increase of 7.54 billion yuan in the peasants' income.  The 10 percent increase in the rural retail prices for  industrial products led to an increase of 28.42 billion yuan in  the peasants' expenditures (in this respect: the 9.3 percent  increase in the rural prices for industrial consumer goods led  to an increase of 21.67 billion yuan in the peasants'  expenditures; the 12.3 percent increase in the retail prices for  agricultural production materials led to an increase of 6.75  billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures). Overall  calculations of the above-listed factors, having incomes  compared with expenditures, would show that the growth in the  scissors difference between the prices of industrial and  agricultural products in the first half of 1993 led to an  increase of 20.88 billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures,  that is, 26.1 yuan per person or 6.2 percent of the peasants'  per capita cash income.    The continued growth in the prices of agricultural  production  materials and the resumed expansion of the scissors difference  between the prices of industrial and agricultural products have  led to a decline in peasants' investment in agricultural  production. In terms of physical input, in the first half of  1993, nationwide the total sales of agricultural production  materials, if adjusted for inflation, decreased by around 10  percent in real terms. The ever growing gap between the urban  and rural areas has not only hampered the development of  agricultural production, but also weakened the economically  mutually complementary and mutually promoting relationships  between the urban and rural areas that were established in the  early years of economic reform. This situation is certain to  adversely affect the long-term development of agricultural  production and result in agricultural production being unable to  develop in a sustained manner.    In order to reverse the trend toward resumed expansion of  the  scissors difference between the prices of industrial and  agricultural products, it is necessary to adopt measures  involving many spheres. Particularly important, it is necessary  to vigorously develop high-yield, high-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture, carry out large-scale economic  operations, and accelerate the improvement of agricultural labor  productivity. Clear circulation channels and enhance the  exchanging of materials between urban and rural areas, so as to  facilitate the smooth circulation of goods. Continue to proceed  with the reform of prices for agricultural products. At the same  time it is necessary to enhance the regulation and supervision  of prices for agricultural production materials, and gradually  reduce the scissors difference between the prices of industrial  and agricultural products, so as to enable the peasants to  increase income through increasing output, thereby promoting the  steady development of agricultural production.</p>

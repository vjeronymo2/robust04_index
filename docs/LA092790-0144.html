			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> L.A.'S RAPPERS SHOW SOLIDARITY FOR MAYFIELD  </P> <P> Because old R&amp;B records are the bricks and mortar of hip-hop, rap artists  are both more knowledgeable and more cynical about the roots of their music  than many of their rock 'n' roll peers -- a James Brown or a Rick James stomp  is more useful dead than alive, deconstructed into its various parts and  rebuilt into something new.  </P> <P> So it was a little surprising that the hip-hop community embraced Curtis  Mayfield as wholeheartedly as it did. Ice-T scored big with a brilliant rap  version of his "Pusherman" last year; hints of "Superfly" seemed to pop up in  half of last year's rap albums. Mayfield's score to "Superfly '90" is more or  less an all-star rap compilation.  </P> <P> At the Palace on Tuesday, there was another all-star rap compilation of sorts,  a benefit concert to raise money for Mayfield, who lies paralyzed in an Atlanta  hospital after a freak accident, and the hip-hop community showed its greatest  solidarity in years. (Things were pushed along a little by Capitol Records,  which has the "Superfly '90" album to promote.)  </P> <P> The Soul Sisters and Craze started things off, novelty rappers whose acts  started to drag about 30 seconds into their brief sets. The Uzi ros, a  UTFO-style rap band from the Bay Area, played a too-lengthy set of rock and  hip-hop and funk. C.P.O., a new Compton rap group associated with N.W.A.'s MC  Ren, did a solid five minutes, as did original L.A. gangster rapper King Tee.  </P> <P> There was a Latino-rap summit, with Cuban L.A. rapper Mellow Man Ace and  Chicano L.A. rapper Kid Frost reprising their various hits and coming together  for some Spanish-language freestyle -- the highlight of the show. The D.O.C.,  Eazy-E and Tone Loc -- all featured prominently in the promotion of the show --  poked their heads on stage, smiled shyly and left without rapping a line.  Mayfield's original Impressions, also scheduled to show, never did.  </P> <P> Save a short dedication by Frost, the first artist to talk about Mayfield was  Ice-T, who spoke a short appreciation, and asked the audience to give Mayfield  a moment of noise . . . silence was too gloomy. Ice-T's set -- he seems to have  as many guys on stage as MC Hammer, except Ice-T's drink beer instead of dance  -- was sloppy but heartfelt, more an on-stage party than a show.  </P> <P> Fishbone, expanded to a 10-piece rock band, played an energetic set, and at 2  a.m. an all-star band of sidemen from Santana, Bruce Hornsby and the E Street  Band played subtle, slick versions of Mayfield stuff like "Gypsy Woman" to an  audience of clean-up crews and bartenders.

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Bumble Bee Dolphin Plan: The San Diego-based tuna company has offered to  send representatives of either Greenpeace or the Dolphin Coalition -- an  umbrella group of environmental groups lobbying for a ban on fishing techniques  that harm the marine mammal -- to watch its Thai fish-processing operation.  Earlier this week, Earth Island Institute, in San Francisco, broke ranks with  most conservation groups by calling for a boycott of Bumble Bee products,  saying the company was still buying tuna caught in giant drift nets in  violation of a pledge by Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea and Star-Kist to end  such practices. Bumble Bee denies the charges.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MT. CARMEL GIRLS SUPER AGAINST POWAY  </P> <P> Forgive Mt. Carmel High School's girls' track team members if they walk around  with an "S" emblazoned on their chests today. But the coach, Dennis McClanahan,  said before the most highly anticipated dual meet of the year, against rival  Poway, that it would take a "super human effort" by his team to win.  </P> <P> Thursday, the Sundevils let Clark Kent out of the telephone booth. Mt. Carmel  defeated visiting Poway, 71-56, in a meet between two schools that many  consider the best in the county.  </P> <P> Poway won the boys' meet, 80-56.  </P> <P> "It did take a super human effort to accomplish what we did," said McClanahan,  whose girls are undefeated in five meets.  </P> <P> Consider what McClanahan's girls accomplished:  </P> <P>  -- Sophomore Melanie Williams, who high jumped 5-feet-2, defeated the  defending section champion, Christy Kurras (5-0). Kurras has gone as high as  5-4.  </P> <P>  -- Sophomore Scia Maumausolo (37-7 1/2) defeated Cindy Beers (36-9) in the  shot put, though Beers had been the county leader in the event at 37-1.  </P> <P>  -- Charity Stowell (2:23.1), competing in her first 800 meters of the year,  held off freshman Monica Callan by four-tenths of a second.  </P> <P>  -- Sophomore Allison Dring had two county-best times, in the 200 (25.9) and  400 (58.1), and took second in the 100 (12.7).  </P> <P>  -- Susan Scott overcame a big deficit over the final 125 meters of the 400 and  nipped Poway's Jessica Brey at the finish, by four-hundredths of a second, to  finish third (63.4).  </P> <P>  -- Cara Shiga finished third (12:15.1) in the 3,200, ahead of Poway's Tara  Barnhart, whom she had never beaten.  </P> <P>  -- The Sundevils' 1,600-meter relay team of Scott, Williams, Vicki de Jesus,  and Dring (4:09.6) beat Poway's foursome, which had previously run a 4:04.3.  </P> <P> "You're not going to find a better dual meet," said Poway Coach Dan Schaitel.

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK and Germany resolve clash on Eurofighter BRITAIN and Germany last night patched up their quarrel over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft, enabling work to continue on a revised project. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, agreed that Bonn would take part alongside the UK, Italy and Spain in completing development work. 'I think that taxpayers of all four countries will be delighted,' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary said. The agreement reached during a Nato ministerial meeting brings significant relief to aerospace and electronics manufacturers in the four countries, where tens of thousands of jobs are staked on the Pounds 20bn fighter programme. The project was thrown into doubt after Germany said in June it would not proceed with producing the aircraft as it then stood. Its continued participation in development was also in question. The modified project, renamed Eurofighter 2000, will use the airframe and engines as planned, but will permit each nation to install different standards of equipment. Yesterday's agreement is seen as a climbdown by Mr Ruhe, who previously insisted on a fundamental redesign. Mr Ruhe accepted yesterday that a wholly new aircraft was ruled out because more than half the Pounds 8bn development money had already been spent. The remaining funds could now be directed into a more suitable programme, and development work could be slowed down, Mr Ruhe said. 'I think everybody is happy there's a chance for a cheaper plane,' he added. He also said he wanted the project to be open to other European partners. He ruled out any German decision on production of the new aircraft before 1995 and said the Bundestag would have to vote on it. This timetable poses potentially serious problems for Britain and Italy which want no more than a two year delay in the programme, with first deliveries of aircraft in 2000. Germany and Spain do not want deliveries until 2002. German officials said further studies were now required in order to translate revised military requirements - agreed by the four chiefs of defence staff in Rome last month - into new technical specifications.</p>

It is an unpardonable grave  military challenge [yongho halsu omnun omjunghan kunsajok tojon  haengwi] to scheme to introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea  at a time when DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution  to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is clear to  everyone that the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea  will heat up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increase  the danger of war.    The scheme to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea vividly  shows that the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim  Yong-sam nation-selling traitorous clique to contain [cheap] our  Republic militarily has gone beyond the danger line [omjung  kyeson].    Some conservative forces and bellicose elements in the U.S.  military have recently unhesitatingly made violent, war-frenzied  remarks that international sanctions should be imposed on North  Korea, strict countermeasures should be expressed to North  Korea, the United States should confront North Korea with armed  forces, and so forth. Timed to coincide with this, the United  States is scheming to bring Patriot missiles into South Korea.  This is not an accident at all.    The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean  puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is  to counter the threat of a missile attack from North Korea.  This is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous  introduction of lethal weapons.    A threat of a missile attack from North Korea did not exist  from the outset. It is merely a fabrication of the enemies. The  real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot missiles into  South Korea under the pretext of a nonexistent threat of a  missile attack is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks  for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for nuclear  inspection on us through pressure and threat.    The projected deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea  is motivated by the persistent antisocialist and anti-Republic  campaign of the United States.    Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear  weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the  introduction of lethal Patriot weapons [Patriot sarin mugi] to  harm [haechida] fellow countrymen. By doing so, he revealed once  again his dirty true color as a heinous traitor, flunkeyist, and  civilian traitor outdistancing the preceding military fascist  dictators.    If the United States and its followers think they can subdue  [kulbok] us with pressure and threat, they are mistaken. That  method may lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk], far from  resolving the problems.    The United States should look straight at the reality and  act  with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot  missile deployment to South Korea.</p>

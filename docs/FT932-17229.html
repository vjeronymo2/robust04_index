			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals up again THE PRECIOUS metals price revival continued yesterday and continued to keep market participants in a high state of excitement. Gold at one stage moved above Dollars 340 a troy ounce but the price eased back to close in London at Dollars 337.80, up Dollars 1.70. This caused some dealers to suggest the rally was running out of steam. Silver and platinum once again followed gold's rise. Silver closed in London last night at Dollars 3.895. The American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation, suggested in its latest MetalsFax: 'In my view only a new wave of big sales can keep gold prices down.' In the near term, though, the market might have to absorb more metal from North American producers, some of whom had hedged little gold so far this year. But 'apart from some increased producer selling which so far is of manageable proportions, there no longer appears to be a big influx of metal to the market.' Mr Nichols said he was encouraged by the recent interest of institutional and substantial private investors in the gold share market. 'Retail (gold) investment activity in America and Europe - judging by demand for bullion coins and small bars - is showing renewed signs of life,' he added. Dealers said that there was some producer selling, profit-taking and light selling by Middle East investors when gold approached Dollars 340 an ounce yesterday. One chartist pointed out that gold, silver and platinum all broke through their 200-day averages yesterday. 'In technical terms that is orgasmic,' he added.</p>

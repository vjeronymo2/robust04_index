Speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of People's  Armed Forces said that the policy of modelling the whole Army on  the chuche idea which Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of  the Korean People's Army, put forward by applying the programme  of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea to Army  building is a programme of Army building, the first of its kind  in the history of the building of the revolutionary Armed Forces  of the working class, and a great programme which makes is  possible to successfully accomplish through generations the  chuche cause of Army building pioneered by the respected leader  Comrade Kim Il-song.    Noting that the programme of modelling the whole Army on the  chuche idea is an immortal militant banner that must be  constantly upheld by our People's Army, they said this is  because the programme clearly indicates the general aim of  building the revolutionary Armed Forces of the working class,  the aim of imbuing the revolutionary Army with the revolutionary  idea of the leader, and thus makes it possible to build up the  People's Army into the Army of the leader and the Army of the  party, both nominally and virtually, and the revolutionary Army  flawless in its political and military appearance.    The speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of Public  Security said that Comrade Kim Chong-il has built up the public  security organ into loyal ranks imbued with the chuche idea and  singleheartedly united around the party and the leader, into  invincible ranks with spiritual and moral traits and qualities  as political defenders of the party by successfully applying the  policy of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea to public  security.    The vitality of this great feat performed by the dear leader  is clearly proved in the fact that the public security organ is  smashing all manoeuvres of the enemy at every step and reliably  defending the security of the party, the state and the people in  the practice of the class struggle in our country, under the  rapidly changing world situation today, the speakers noted.</p>

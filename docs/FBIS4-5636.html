			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodian government forces backed by tanks,  artillery and rockets attacked the stronghold of the Khmer Rouge  in the Phnom Malai area yesterday morning in an offensive aimed  at seizing the area, according to an intelligence report.    Heavy fighting between the Khmer Rouge and government troops  sent hundreds of Thai villagers at Ban Nong Ian to seek refuge  in bunkers.    The fighting was concentrated between one and four  kilometres  from the Thai border at Ban Nong Ian, Phaum Koob, Phoum Na  Kaxai, Phoum Takuangklao and Phoum Dongaran.    Cambodian government forces yesterday sent 200 troops with  T-54 tanks and armoured personal carriers under the command of  Lt-Gen Man Vichit to support the 12th Division.    Cambodian soldiers yesterday released five Thais who crossed  into the Cambodian town of Poipet on Sunday.</p>

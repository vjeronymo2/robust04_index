			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> IRVINE CO. MAY SHIFT DISPUTED PROJECT  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. said it will consider moving its controversial Laguna Laurel  residential project out of Laguna Canyon, marking a possible breakthrough in  the long-running dispute over development in the environmentally sensitive  canyon area. The company's new proposal, which calls for the Laguna Beach  project to be relocated to the city of Irvine if a number of conditions are  met, was greeted with optimism by some officials who have long sought to derail  the 2,000-acre residential development. Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, a  leading opponent, called the proposal a "breakthrough." "Even if this proposal  itself doesn't work, it can be the basis for other alternatives or  modifications."  </P></p>

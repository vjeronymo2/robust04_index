			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: Some serious questions of taste - Television Why do we like - no, love - the operas of Verdi and Puccini? Because they convey romantic and engrossing stories at a high emotional pitch, expressed in a succession of glorious, often unforgettable, tunes; tunes that allow opera singers to display their talents in a way that we not only admire but find heart-stoppingly beautiful. What makes anybody imagine that new operas can reject all this and still be attractive to opera lovers? Or is it not Channel 4's purpose with its series of new 60-minute operas, specially commissioned for television, to attract opera lovers? In which case, who do they want to attract? The first of these new works on Sunday, The Empress, looked a bit like a pop video so perhaps the idea was to attract the children who watch the satellite pop channel, MTV. But even pop songs tend to have memorable melodies. The colours were of the primary, paintbox, sort that we used to see on Play-school and the costumes, er, striking. The story, 'based on a little known 1890 work, The Empress Of Newfoundland, by the German playwright Frank Wedekind', was pretty weird: a princess gets her rocks off by watching a Schwarzenegger type lift increasingly heavy weights; he gets tired of this, steals from her, and flees to a lowlife bar; she pursues him and then cuts her throat with a meat cleaver. What was there here to entertain? No tunes, no humour, nobody with whom to sympathise, nothing even to like, let alone love. It seems from the promotion that we are supposed to be terrifically impressed with a television channel that commissions original opera (gosh how highbrow) but if this is the result, the money might as well be spent on mindless game shows. ***** It must be nearly time for this column to take another look at the general condition of television comedy. Judging from BBC2's sequence of pilots, Comic Asides, things are in a pretty poor state. Perhaps the creators of The High Life about stewards on a Scottish airline, Woodcock about life in Nelson's Royal Navy, The Last Word about an arrogant journalist, and The Honeymoon's Over about a chronically argumentative couple, all slaved night and day to polish their scripts and hone their jokes. That is not the way they seemed, however. Most of them, most of the time, looked like ideas scribbled down on the back of an envelope in a lunch break and submitted on the off-chance that somebody would be desperate enough to commission a whole series. ***** The comedy that was much admired here and swept the board at last year's award ceremonies, Absolutely Fabulous, has returned for a second series. Could it be that because of the huge success and the decision to transfer from BBC2 to BBC1, the creator of the series, Jennifer Saunders, has been given bigger budgets, and could that explain the appearance of crowds of guest 'personalities' in the opening episode of Series 2? The first series had not led us to expect Helena Bonham Carter, Mandy Rice-Davies and Suzi Quatro all in one dream sequence. Fashion slave Edi (Saunders herself) and the gorgeous lush Patsy (Joanna Lumley) are still two of the strongest characters anywhere in current television comedy, and Lumley's hobbling walk when welcoming the reporter from Hello] magazine was the funniest sight of the week. But this episode did seem glossier, less like a self-contained mad world than before. Perhaps it is just a question of familiarity. ***** Even a television critic can hardly spend his wife's birthday stuck on the old green sofa in front of the box, but what is there in the London theatre that would make a suitable outing? An Absolute Turkey sounds likely: Feydeau farce directed by Peter Hall, starring Felicity Kendal and Griff Rhys Jones, recently opened to rave reviews. Sure enough Kendal is simply splendid, and you can feel the entire male section of the audience falling in love with her. Moreover, although this is an 18-strong cast (enormous in the West End these days) there is not a single weak link. The art nouveau sets by Gerald Scarfe are far more impressive than his cartoons. We enjoy ourselves. But so we should: our two seats at the back of the stalls cost Pounds 44, which would pay the television licence fee for more than six months. The price of two glasses of wine and a programme take the total above Pounds 50. Furthermore, although there is of course the matchless atmosphere of live theatre, to habitual viewers of modern television comedy the plotting here does seem remarkably primitive and the comedy very basic knockabout stuff. True, this was written 98 years ago, but we should acknowledge that style and pace have moved on. The gag rate in Drop The Dead Donkey or Fawlty Towers is much higher than in An Absolute Turkey. ***** One of television's most entertaining new series for a long time is not a situation comedy but an American import on Channel 4 called The Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller. Some viewers will loathe this gaff-blowing conjuring programme: live rats caged over a man's face (a trick known as 'Room 101') and a white rabbit seemingly being fed through an agricultural shredding machine are not everybody's cup of tea. But if you enjoy American showbiz chutzpah, and find traditional magic series a bit ponderous, you may enjoy the almost contemptuous way in which these two men send up their predecessors and competitors. Last week they showed us how to use a miniature carton of coffee whitener for an 'exploding eyeball' trick - and then had the studio audience do it en masse: ghastly, but hilarious. ***** The trend towards 'infotainment' continues with the launch on BBC1 of How Do They Do That?, a 45-minute programme on Tuesdays that combines the 'Just Fancy That]' element of the old tabloid press with the educational instincts of Victorian boys' books. The opening programme showed us how stunt arrangers achieved the effect of Desmond Lynam, the main presenter, leaping out of a helicopter and crashing through the roof of Television Centre into the studio, how doctors sewed back a policeman's hand after it had been severed with a sword, and how Australians spent Dollars 7m on an American lottery to win Dollars 27m. The programme has been greeted with some scorn, but it is well enough done (though I was more baffled at the end of the lottery item than at the beginning). Lynam is a pleasant and highly professional presenter, and - provided the BBC continues to make Newsnight, Horizon, Assignment and other serious current affairs programmes - it is difficult to see why they should not do this sort of thing if viewers want it. Just don't look for any more reviews on this page. The grammar in television news trailers, especially the way in which tenses are used, becomes increasingly absurd. Recently Alastair Stewart announced: 'In 50 minutes on London Tonight two children are killed by their mother. We ask . . .'</p>

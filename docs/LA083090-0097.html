			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVS CHASE ALBANIANS WAITING FOR U.S. SENATORS  </P> <P> Riot policemen swinging batons and firing tear gas on Wednesday dispersed  thousands of ethnic Albanians awaiting a U.S. congressional delegation so that  they could complain about what they call human rights abuses.  </P> <P> About 10,000 people chanting, "Freedom! Freedom!" and "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"  gathered in front of a downtown hotel where the delegation of seven senators  was expected to hold talks with leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in the  southern Kosovo province.  </P> <P> A radio report said six people were injured and six arrested.  </P> <P> The delegation, headed by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), arrived in Pristina three  hours after the clash and was driven under heavy police escort to a hotel for a  meeting with leaders of dissident Albanian groups. Another meeting with the  leaders of the rival Serbian community also was planned.  </P> <P> "We will talk to the senators about the unbearable conditions for Albanians in  Kosovo and about the fact that our political parties are still illegal," said  Ibrahim Rugova, head of the 500,000-member Democratic Union, the largest ethnic  Albanian political party in the region.  </P> <P> "The senators will see for themselves what kind of police repression we live  under," Rugova said.  </P> <P> Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90% of Kosovo's 1.9-million people, are  protesting last month's decision by the Communist authorities of Serbia to  reduce Kosovo's autonomy. Kosovo is an administrative district of Serbia,  Yugoslavia's largest republic.  </P> <P> Kosovo has been the site of tension between ethnic Albanians and Slavs since  Serbia began to restrict the province's self-government last year.  </P> <P> The crowd waiting for the Dole delegation thinned when speakers announced that  it would not arrive until early afternoon. But a group of several thousand  people refused to disperse and continued to chant until the police officers  charged.  </P> <P> Within a few minutes, the entire downtown area was cleared of protesters, who  had pelted policemen with stones and bottles. Officers patrolled the streets in  armored vehicles after the clash and ordered groups of more than five people to  disperse.  </P></p>

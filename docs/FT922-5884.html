			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness falls after warning A GLOOMY annual statement from Guinness sent the shares reeling. The chairman, Mr Anthony Tennant, said growth would not match that 'of a few years back' and added that there was little sign of recovery in many of the company's markets. The shares, down 19 at one stage, partially recovered to finish 9 off at 576p after turnover of 5.6m. In spite of this despondent tone, Mr Christopher Wickham at Lehman Brothers remained bullish of the stock, pointing out that the US and UK are not Guinness's only markets. He suggested there was nothing particularly new in Mr Tennant's remarks, but noted that the company could expect very good growth in the expanding drinks markets of Asia and South America. Life insurer United Friendly was heavily traded as the group's pension fund sold 12.9m 'B' shares. The sale was prompted by legislation that came into force in January and demands that investment by a pension fund in its own company is limited to 5 per cent of the fund's assets. The majority of the shares were placed with institutions by County NatWest at 365p apiece and the remaining 1.8m were sold to trustees of the group's share option scheme. County said the placing was anticipated and well received and United shares jumped 12 to 372p. The move followed a similar placing two weeks ago in Britannic, which yesterday gained 2 to 930p. Utilities may move under the spotlight today as Scottish Power and two water companies publish their results. The Scottish generator gained 2 to 183p on high turnover of 4.1m shares, in expectation of a big rise in profits, but sector analyst Ms Liz Christie at Goldman Sachs said the upside potential is not there. It was pointed out in the market that because of earlier criticism about underpriced utilities the government had set the yield for the Scottish companies much lower, and that Scottish Power's price/earnings ratio is a good deal higher than the sector average. South of the border generators National Power and PowerGen put on 5 to 231p and 3 1/2 to 239p respectively as the power companies proved a firm feature in a generally depressed equity market. Volume of 4.6m shares in National Power and 3m in PowerGen was also very strong. BZW was bullish of South West Water, which improved 8 to 446p, but North West Water was steady at 438p, with today's figures from the two companies the first in the reporting season. Ms Angela Whelan at BZW said South West was favoured on expectation of good dividend growth after a sensitive regulatory period, moving the yield nearer to the sector average. Oils stood out in a dull market as the price of Brent crude held above Dollars 20 a barrel and securities house Kleinwort Benson predicted that it would reach Dollars 22 to Dollars 23 in the second half of the year. Opec's decision to roll over its current oil output limits into the third quarter of the year will upset the supply-demand balance and tighten the market, Kleinwort added. Shell rose 5 to 525p, while BP firmed 2 to 274p on 23m shares traded. Among the exploration companies, Lasmo was the strongest performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, advancing 6 to 213p. It was further helped by appreciation that it intends to offload its downstream assets purely by way of an initial public offering. Enterprise moved ahead 9 to 439p. Second-line oil companies also performed well, with Ranger prominent after announcing successful tests at an exploration well off Aberdeen. The stock forged ahead 19 to 418p. Midland Bank gained 5 to 409p, reflecting the rising price of shares in interested bidders HSBC Holdings and Lloyds Bank (up 5 at 432p). TSB eased 2 to 142p in heavy turnover of 6.2m shares on rumours of a broker downgrade. Property worries continued to overhang Barclays, which fell 9 to 374p. A sell recommendation on Prudential issued by Robert Fleming contributed to weakness in the stock, which ended 5 off at 254p. Warnings from Blue Circle that its cement business was down 10 per cent for the first four months of the year prompted some analysts to downgrade the building materials group. BZW shaved Pounds 10m from both its current year and following year forecasts to Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m respectively. The shares shed 8 to 256p. Positive sentiment continued in Vodafone Group, which last week gained ground after underperforming the sector, and as fears receded about a possible price war with BT over cellular phones. Yesterday, the shares added 6 at 394p in heavy volume of 8m. Cable and Wireless was also firm, up 5 at 588p, in anticipation of Hong Kong Telecom's results today. Television and film production company Carlton moved up 19 to 667p, reflecting half-year results slightly ahead of expectations. Profits for the six months ending in March rose to Pounds 49.4m from Pounds 46.3m previously and against forecasts of Pounds 46m to Pounds 48.8m. Carlton also raised its interim dividend to 6.7p from 6.1p. Retailer Body Shop slipped 7 to 318p in spite of profits rising, in line with market expectations, to Pounds 25.2m from Pounds 20m. Mr Andy Hughes, retail analyst at Nomura, changed his recommendation to hold from sell, on expectations of a slightly better performance in the UK this year and a possible doubling of profits in the US. BOC Group fell 12 to 680p, with talk of a share overhang, and scattered selling in the chemicals sector, hitting the stock. Courtaulds also suffered, retreating 11 to 571p. Worries over fuel costs dented British Airways, off 7 at 300p. Negative talk from one contractor in the TML Channel tunnel consortium continued to hang over Eurotunnel, which weakened 10 to 360p. P &amp; O tumbled 13 to 529p on property worries. Reckitt &amp; Colman slipped initially on comments by the chairman that the group saw no sign of an upturn in its main markets. The shares were off 12 at one stage but recovered to close only a penny down at 637p. Fisons bounced 8 to 357p, with optimism about reapproval for its Opticrom eye treatment in the US gaining ground. Fairline Boats fell sharply after the company reported a Pounds 613,000 half-time loss, versus a previous profit of Pounds 2.1m, and a halved interim dividend. The shares plummeted 103 to 325p. An agency cross boosted turnover in business services group Hays. A line of 3.6m was crossed at 204p a share and the stock closed firmer at 204 1/2p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (109).

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Accor Asia Pacific puts trust float plans on hold Accor Asia Pacific, in which the French Accor hotels group is a shareholder but which is quoted separately on the Australian stock market, yesterday put plans to float a 'tourism trust' on hold, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Accor Asia Pacific, which operates more than 60 hotels in the Asia-Pacific region, blamed poor stock market conditions for the move. The Australian All-Ordinaries Index yesterday closed 31.8 points lower at 1,877.7, a 15-month low. The 'tourism trust' plan was unveiled in September, when Accor said it would issue units to institutional investors, with a view to listing the trust - likely to be valued at around ADollars 200m (USDollars 151.5m) - on the stock market shortly afterwards. The trust was to have held three- and four-star properties in Australia and New Zealand, and would have been managed by a group including AAPC. Initially, the trust was expected to include about 21 properties, mainly operating under the Ibis and Novotel brand names. Units in the trust were to be marketed to institutions in Europe, Australia and the US.</p>

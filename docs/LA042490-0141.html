			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA HOUSING COSTS HIT POOR HARD, REPORT FINDS;  </P> <P> SHELTER: EXPENSE LEAVES THEM WITH LITTLE FOR OTHER NEEDS. THOUSANDS MORE ARE  'WORKING POOR' AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS.  </P> <P> The San Francisco-Oakland area may be the worst place in the nation for poor  people to live because of its high housing costs, according to a report  released Monday.  </P> <P> The high costs are forcing poor households to spend excessive amounts of their  limited incomes for shelter, the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities said. This forces the poor to divert money from other  pressing needs, such as food, clothing and health care.  </P> <P> "For poor households, affordable housing has become nearly non-existent in the  San Francisco-Oakland area," said Ed Lazere, a housing analyst who wrote the  report. "Extremely high housing costs have left poor renters and homeowners  with little income for other basic needs."  </P> <P> San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Richmond already have large homeless  populations on the streets or in temporary shelters.  </P> <P> But the report said there also are many poor Bay Area residents who are "near  homeless" or at risk of being homeless. These are the "working poor" -- people  who have part-time or entry-level jobs that allow them to barely make ends  meet.  </P> <P> "If you are a poor family that spends nearly all of your money on housing and  there is a disruption (in income) such as a layoff or a medical problem, you  are at risk of becoming homeless," Lazere said.  </P> <P> Bay Area public officials welcomed the release of the report, but said its  conclusions were not surprising.  </P> <P> "I've been dealing with these problems for 15 years," said Brad Paul, San  Francisco's deputy mayor of housing. "I think this (report) puts a new  perspective on the housing issue. Most people don't realize that if you have an  entry-level job in a fast-food place, you may only be able to afford to live in  your car."  </P> <P> Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata said the problem has "been pretty obvious  to a lot of people for a long time. It accounts for our high rate of  homelessness."  </P> <P> Although affordable housing is needed in the urban core areas of Oakland,  Berkeley and Alameda, most new housing is built in the suburbs far from job  centers, Perata said. Also, most construction in the inner cities has merely  "gentrified" low-income neighborhoods and chased out longtime residents, he  said.  </P> <P> The report, based on 1985 government statistics -- the most recent available --  concludes:  </P> <P> 61% of all poor renter households -- or 39,900 households -- spent at least 70%  of income on housing costs.  </P> <P> 82% of poor homeowners spent at least 30% of their income on housing, which is  the federal maximum for affordability, while nearly 50% of them spent at least  70% of their incomes on housing.  </P> <P> About half of the area's 101,700 poor households are either in San Francisco or  Oakland, with the remainder in other parts of Alameda County and Contra Costa,  San Mateo or Marin counties.  </P> <P> Latino and black communities, on average, paid a higher percentage of their  income for housing than white residents.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's 1990 "fair market rent"  for a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and San Mateo and Marin counties  was $887 a month, the highest in the nation, the report noted.  </P> <P> The "fair market rent" in Alameda and Contra Costa counties was $736 a month,  the 10th highest for U.S. metropolitan areas.  </P> <P> Government assistance through subsidized housing programs is not available for  most eligible people, with some 56,000 households on waiting lists as of last  November, the report stated.  </P> <P> Last fall's Loma Prieta earthquake exacerbated the problem, destroying or  damaging at least 5,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing and leaving  8,000 people in the area without homes. In Oakland and Berkeley, many  residential hotels have not been reopened. In San Francisco, officials said the  city has made substantial progress keeping residential hotels open.  </P> <P> Monday's report did not include the San Jose area or Santa Clara County, which  were addressed in an earlier report by the same group. That report, released in  1988, said the housing woes of low-income people in San Jose were nearly as bad  as in the San Francisco -- Oakland area.  </P> <P> "While the housing crisis is national in scope, it is particularly bad in the  Bay Area," Lazere said.  </P></p>

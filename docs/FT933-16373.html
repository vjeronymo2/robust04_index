			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Motoring: A bigger embrace for diesels MORE diesel cars are bought in France than anywhere else. They account for nearly 50 per cent of new registrations. More diesel is now sold at filling stations than petrol. Britain's diesel car market is the world's fastest-growing although still well short of France. Even so, one car in five sold in Britain this year is likely to be a diesel. As recently as the mid-1980s, though, they were comparative rarities. Most British motorists still thought of them as noisy and gutless oddities run by economy freaks. No company has done more to change the British view of diesel cars than PSA (Peugeot-Citroen). Its Peugeot 205 and 405 and Citroen BX and ZX have for years been consistent best-sellers in the UK. Now, the new Peugeot 306 (made, like the 405, at Ryton, Coventry) and, in a few weeks, the new Citroen Xantia, will boost diesel sales higher still. The Peugeot 306 rides and handles exceptionally well (like the Citroen ZX, with which it shares mechanical bits and pieces). Since its UK launch in the spring, it has been sold only with petrol engines but, last week, I tried its left-hand drive, 1.9-litre 306 diesels in France. The non-turbo, 70 hp version impressed me but I was enchanted by the whispering, 92 hp, turbo-charged and inter-cooled model. It drove with a vigour that would have done credit to a petrol-engined car and was so refined that I simply forgot (as one does with BMW's six-cylinder turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in Britain) that it was a diesel at all. It pulled so strongly from 2,000 rpm upwards that it felt as much a 'one-gear' car as a massive American V8. (Yes, there are still a few with manual boxes). Prices of 306 turbo-diesels start at Pounds 11,475 and non-turbo models, with less luxurious trim, from Pounds 9,345. Coming to Britain in the autumn is a 1.8-litre, petrol-engined automatic. It has the same smooth-changing, ZF transmission as the 405 and is likely to cost about Pounds 750 more than the equivalent manual-gearbox 306. Other 306s in the pipeline include a sporty two-litre, three-door due late in the autumn and, eventually, cabriolets. Sadly, Peugeot has no plans to market a 306 diesel with automatic transmission although Citroen offers a two-pedal ZX diesel without a turbo-charger at Pounds 11,595. An automatic turbo-diesel Peugeot 306 - or, for that matter, Citroen ZX - could be a delightful and easy-to-drive car, very lively yet still capable of 40 mpg-plus (7.06 l/100 km) economy. But the combined extra cost of turbo-charging and automatic transmission - roughly Pounds 1,300 - might price it out of the market. Automatic transmission has not caught on as widely on mainland Europe as it has in the UK. About 10 per cent of all new cars in Britain and 20 per cent in Switzerland are automatics, but only 2 per cent in France and Italy. It is all to do with the Latin temperament and machismo. Latins love shifting gear. Indeed, Italians are said to feel that two-pedal cars are only for the handicapped or people who hate driving. 'They just don't realise our automatics are so enjoyable,' mourned a man from Peugeot. FILLING a car gives many people the same feeling as paying for a supermarket trolley full of groceries. How on earth could it possibly cost so much? So, it might come as a surprise to learn that British pump prices for petrol are among Europe's lowest. According to the Automobile Association, UK motorists in mid-June paid an average 50.61p a litre for unleaded. Leaded super was 54.37p and diesel 50.14p (although all prices were about 3.5p a litre lower at supermarkets). Compare Britain's 50.61p for unleaded with 74.29p in Norway, 71.74p (Sweden), 70.43 (Italy) and 67.53p (Holland). It should make you feel better. Britain's average 50.14p diesel is fairly expensive, though. Diesel is cheaper everywhere except Denmark and Sweden, Italy (once renowned for cheap diesel but where it now costs 56.43p) and Switzerland (where it has always cost more than petrol and is now 57.41p). French diesel at 44.07p a litre (say, Pounds 2 a gallon) compares with unleaded petrol (61.6p a litre or Pounds 2.80 a gallon) and leaded premium (65.68p or almost Pounds 3 a gallon). You can see why the French prefer diesels to petrol cars and avoid cars that are heavy drinkers. Western Europe's cheapest petrol is in Luxembourg: 43.76p a litre unleaded and 51.09p leaded. Diesel is also a good buy in Luxembourg at 37.43p, but is cheaper in Norway at 31.65p, much less than half the price of unleaded petrol. Greece favours diesel car drivers (29.12p a litre against 58.54p for unleaded petrol, 61.89p for leaded) but the best European country in which to tank-up with any fuel has to be Turkey. Diesel at 24.79p a litre is half the British price, while Turkish leaded premium (34.92p) is even cheaper than unleaded (39.22p). If you are thinking of driving a newish car with a catalyser to eastern Europe, the AA warns that unleaded pumps are few and far between in Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovakian republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania. It would be wise to carry a spare can or two of unleaded in the boot. Make sure, though, that the containers are empty until you are over the Channel. Only the contents of a car's tank are allowed by the ferry operators.</p>

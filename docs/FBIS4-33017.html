			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Chilean Senator Andres  Zaldivar of the Christian Democratic Party, who returned  yesterday from a trip to Havana, advocates the resumption of  diplomatic relations with Cuba and the lifting of the economic  embargo on the island. Zaldivar, whose comments were released  today, said he was really impressed with the dramatic situation  affecting the Cuban people, who "are starving because rationing  is brutally strict."    Zaldicar, who belongs to the most important party in the  coalition governing Chile, said cooperation must be sought to  find a political solution that would allow Cuba to evolve toward  democracy.    According to Zaldivar, the way to reach a political opening  must be discussed with Cuban President Fidel Castro. He said:  "Fidel Castro is maintaining his leadership. I saw that. The  people are with Fidel Castro. And we should take note of that."    Zaldivar has the impression that Cuba is a besieged region  in  the medieval sense, which even creates the fear that the crisis  may evolve into a collective sacrifice, which he believes would  be inadmissible. He added: "We should follow a path toward  opening up relations, not with the objective of validating a  regime with which I disagree, but in order to help Cuba in a  transition toward democracy."    During his stay in Havana, Zaldivar met with the Cuban  ministers of finance and agriculture, but he did not have any  contact with the opposition. Christian Democratic Party  President Gutemberg Martinez, however, will meet with all Cuban  political sectors during the visit he will make to Cuba in the  next few days.    Zaldivar went to Cuba as president of the Spanish foundation  Ibero-American-European Research and Promotion Center, which he  created when he was living in exile in Madrid.    Diplomatic relations between Havana and Santiago were broken  in 1973 after the military coup that overthrew the Chilean  Socialist government headed by Salvador Allende. Relations were  resumed at the consular level in 1990 after the return of  democracy in Chile. Various Chilean Socialist and Social  Democratic sectors of the government Coalition of Parties for  Democracy have expressed support for the full reestablishment of  relations with Cuba, which is expected to be achieved in the  next few weeks.</p>

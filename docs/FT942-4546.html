			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television It would be an insult to most reporters to describe their programmes as a 'meander' around their subjects, yet it seems quite reasonable and not the least damaging when it is Wooldridge On Whisky. Wooldridge is so laid back and such a natural raconteur that virtually any subject he covers is sure to be entertaining without any of that straining for drama which you usually get on television. Sure enough, the opening episode was funny and seemingly effortless; invariably the mark of hard work (8.00 BBC2). At 9.30 Channel 4 repeats the remarkable interview with the late Dennis Potter first shown on Without Walls in April. At that point Potter was staying alive on vitamins, cigarettes, and the liquid morphine which he swigged from a flask as he talked to Melvyn Bragg. I suspect that you get the truth about Potter's beliefs from his dramas, but this interview reveals as much about Potter the man as any programme ever achieved. The colour film shot by George Stevens as he advanced from Normandy to Berlin in 1944/45 provides a unique record which BBC2 repeats in D-Day To Berlin (9.45).</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Flynn has hard act to follow at EC IRISH justice minister Padraig Flynn, appointed this week to succeed Mr Ray MacSharry on the European Commission from January 5, will have a tough act to follow. He has neither the tough ministerial reputation of Mr MacSharry, whose no-nonsense approach to cutting the Irish fiscal deficit in the late 1980s earned him the sobriquet of 'Mac the Knife', nor the urbane financial skills of Mr Peter Sutherland, current chairman of Allied Irish Banks, who preceded Mr MacSharry on the Commission and held the EC competition portfolio. A former schoolteacher and publican, Mr Flynn earned his political colours as a dedicated representative of his rural Mayo West constituency in the west of Ireland, and as a supporter of Prime Minister Charles Haughey during his rise to power in the late 1970s and the turbulence of the latter's leadership of the Fianna Fail party for more than a decade. An arch conservative and devout Catholic, who has been prominent in opposing liberalisation of Ireland's divorce and abortion laws, Mr Flynn is popular in his constituency but has not built a reputation as a strong minister able to fight his corner in cabinet. He entered cabinet as trade minister in the short-lived Fianna Fail government of 1982, when Mr Haughey was Taoiseach (prime minister). When Fianna Fail returned to power in 1987, he became minister at the high-spending Environment Department, responsible for funding the road network and overseeing the work and organisation of local authorities. A large part of EC structural funds to Ireland was administered through his department. He has been criticised for his department's apparent piecemeal approach to road network improvement. His ministerial record is that of a bureaucrat rather than a pioneering advocate of change. Proposals to establish an environmental protection agency languished in his department for more than two years, while much of the new environmental legislation in Ireland during his period of office was EC-driven. He held the environment portfolio until 1991, when he was sacked, along with Mr Albert Reynolds, then finance minister, by Mr Haughey for having led a backbench rebellion. After Mr Haughey's defeat last February, Mr Flynn returned to cabinet as justice minister under Mr Reynolds as the new leader.</p>

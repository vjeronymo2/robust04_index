			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Weir expands with Pounds 16m of acquisitions WEIR GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering company, is paying about Pounds 16m for a package of UK, US and Australian businesses. The companies being acquired are owned by Darchem, the wholly owned subsidiary of William Baird, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers. The deal is Weir's second biggest acquisition to date after the Pounds 30m it paid in 1990 for Strachan &amp; Henshaw, the mechanical handling specialist. It continues the group's strategy of focusing on specialist engineering products and services worldwide. For William Baird, also based in Glasgow, the sale is its second in eight months of non-core businesses. The company said yesterday it planned to make further disposals to concentrate on clothing, textiles and distribution. Weir has bought Darchem Engineering, Hoyt Darchem, Expert Heat Treatments, The Hoyt Metal Company of Australia and Darchem Engineering of California. These make a range of products including insulation systems, fabricated components, specialist anti-friction alloys and white metal bearings, as well as providing heat treatment services. The companies have annual sales of about Pounds 28m and made pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 2.9m. Mr Ron Garrick, Weir's managing director and chief executive, said the Darchem businesses would complement and broaden Weir's product range and offer new business opportunities. Weir, best known for its pumps, has spent about Pounds 120m on 23 acquisitions in the past six years, and sold nine businesses worth nearly Pounds 40m in the same period. The Pounds 16m price tag compares with Pounds 8m of adjusted end-1992 net assets for the businesses Weir is buying. Mr John Dean, analyst at Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, said: 'It is not like Weir to pay significantly over net assets, and this reflects well on the profitability of the Darchem businesses.' Weir said the acquisitions would make a positive contribution to earnings. The group earned 35.5p per share last year on turnover of Pounds 424.8m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 39.2m. William Baird's Darchem subsidiary is its umbrella company for non-textiles and clothing businesses. Last December, William Baird sold most of Darchem's contracting side to Cape, the industrial services and building products group controlled by Charter. It still owns the building services division of Darchem as well as several small companies in motor components that it was unable to sell to Weir or Cape. The Pounds 16m from the Weir deal will initially add to the company's cash pile, which stood at Pounds 2m at the end of the last financial year. 'The cash released from the disposal of these businesses will be invested in the group's principal activity in clothing and textiles,' said Mr Donald Parr, chairman.</p>

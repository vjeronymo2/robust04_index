			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Bank of China Preparing Big </F> Bond Issue in Japan"]    [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign  exchange bank, is seeking to pool more capital from the  international monetary market to support the country's economic  growth.    The bank is preparing to issue 15 billion to 30 billion  Japanese yen worth of bonds in Tokyo, said Huo Tuanjie, deputy  general manager of the bank's foreign exchange department.    The money raised by the bond issue will be used to finance  Chinese energy and transportation development, she said.    Huo said the Bank of China has been in contact with  well-known Japanese securities companies and banks about  underwriting the bonds.    She said the bank will decide whether to issue the bonds at  fixed or floating rates according to market conditions.    "We will select the best time to enter the market," she  said.  "It will probably be done in the first half of this year."    The interest rate for bonds issued in Japan has remained  quite low, which will reduce the bank's costs. The rate for  one-year Libor (London inter-bank offered rate) bonds in Japan  is about 2 percentage points lower than in the United States.  And, Huo said, the rate is expected to bounce up in the second  half of the year.    Although the low rate will save money for the bank, it will  also bring some disadvantages.    Investors are usually reluctant to invest in low-rated bonds  since the yields are less, so the bonds' issuer must rely on its  good reputation with investors.    Huo said the Bank of China is quite experienced in the  Japanese market, having issued bonds there 14 times in the past  decade.    Japanese investors are familiar with the Bank of China and  have been enthusiastic buyers of its bonds.    Japan has played an important role in the bank's long-term  strategy for pooling capital internationally.    It was the first market the bank entered and served as a  springboard for entering Europe and the United States. Earlier  this year, the bank issued $500 million in Yankee bonds, its  first flotation in the United States.    But Huo cautioned, "While making efforts to tap new markets,  we should also pay great attention to strengthening our foothold  in our traditional market."    Besides Japan, she said, the Bank of China will look for the  proper time to go back to the European market.    So far, the bank has issued 21 batches of bonds in London,  Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore and the United States with a  combined face value of $4 billion.    Issuing bonds not only raises foreign capital, but promotes  the reputation of the Bank of China.    "We are trying to make the Bank of China a globally-known  name in financial circles," Huo said.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |BOC's Overseas Bonds                                                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Time              |Place             |Amount            |Term              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |                  |(Billions)        |(years)           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1984              |Tokyo             |JY20              |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1985              |Tokyo             |JY20              |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1985              |Frankfurt         |Dm0.15            |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1985              |Tokyo             |JY30              |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1985              |Tokyo             |USD0.15           |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1986              |Tokyo             |JY20              |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1986              |Tokyo             |JY50              |12                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1986              |Frankfurt         |USD0.2            |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1987              |Singapore         |USD0.2            |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1987              |Tokyo             |JY15              |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1987              |London            |USD0.2            |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988              |Luxembourg        |JY15              |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988              |Frankfurt         |DM0.2             |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989              |Tokyo             |JY20              |10                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |Tokyo             |JY20              |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |Tokyo             |JY15              |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |Singapore         |USD0.15           |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |Tokyo             |JY15              |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |Tokyo             |JY15              |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |London            |USD0.2            |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1994              |New York          |USD0.5            |5, 20             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      [Text](Note: DM stands for Deutsche marks, JY stands for  Japanese yen,  USD stands for U.S. dollars)</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (3): Fortunes begin to improve - European suppliers are building a global presence The recession has left a heavy imprint on the financial performance of leading European automotive components suppliers, although companies believe that the industry's fortunes have begun to improve this year. Some groups such as Valeo of France and T &amp; N of the UK have improved profitability in the past two years, but few have been spared the painful task of drastic restructuring to cut costs and improve competitiveness. Despite the challenge of dealing with widespread losses the front-rank European automotive components producers are also having to move aggressively to build a global presence and are expanding into new markets in particular in Asia and eastern Europe. For the first time in the post-war period the Bosch group of Germany, the largest European components producer, suffered a substantial operating loss of more than DM500m last year. Under intense pressure from a 23 per cent fall in German vehicle production, its turnover also declined for the first time since 1967. Bosch has accepted that its costs, along with those of much of German industry have been too high. 'Because of global competition we can no longer cover our costs in some products,' says Hermann Scholl, Bosch chief executive. 'The situation is being exacerbated by the strong pressure, in particular from the car makers, to reduce prices significantly every year.' Structural weaknesses, which had been covered up by the surge in economic activity triggered by German unification, have been exposed by the recession, says Mr Scholl, and 'drastic cuts' have had to be made to turn the company round. The Bosch group eliminated 13,200 jobs last year to reduce its workforce to 156,600, and Mr Scholl expects the workforce to be reduced again to 152,500 by 1995. Magneti Marelli, the leading Italian automotive components producer and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, has been loss-making for four years but plunged to its deepest loss of the period last year of L211bn (Dollars 132m) from a loss (before minority interests) of L53.3bn a year earlier. Michelin of France, the world's largest manufacturer of tyres, was hit by a net loss of FFr3.67bn (Dollars 625m) last year, under the impact of depressed European markets and the costs of an ambitious restructuring programme. Sales fell by 5.3 per cent to FFr63.29bn. Michelin is seeking to make savings of FFr3.5bn in its operations by 1995 through a package of job cuts and productivity measures. Elsewhere in the European tyre industry Pirelli, the Italian tyre and cables group, managed to reduce its net losses last year to L96bn (Dollars 57m), compared with a loss of L154bn in 1992. Pirelli has suffered three years of net losses, and more than two years of painful restructuring. In the two years 1992 and 1993 Pirelli has had to set aside L550bn to pay for rationalisation, including 10,000 redundancies and the shedding of one of its three divisions. Continental, the German tyre maker, avoided red ink last year but its pre-tax profit was more than halved to DM74m (Dollars 43.5m) in 1993 as a result of the decline in the world automotive industry. It is responding to the continuing downward pressure on prices by reducing fixed costs. A further 2,000 jobs are being cut this year, following a reduction of 4,900 in 1993. In the UK, BBA suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.8m and is cutting 2,000 jobs as part of a rationalisation programme. It was burdened by restructuring costs of Pounds 76.8m last year mainly for redundancies and plant closures. Many of the job cuts are being made in the automotive components division, where operating profits fell by 43 per cent last year. By contrast Valeo, the leading French automotive components group, which specialises in areas such as lighting, clutches, air conditioning, heaters, radiators and electrical systems, managed to achieve marginal increases in operating and net income with the latter rising to FFr705m from FFr700m a year earlier. Valeo's group turnover also declined by 2 per cent to FFr20.2bn against the background of deep recession in Europe and recovery in North and South America. It is benefiting from its policy of globalisation, it gained market share in Europe, and has been successful in significantly reducing its debt and its financial costs with net debt falling to FFr1.16bn by the end of 1993, from FFr2.15bn a year earlier. T &amp; N, one of the leading UK automotive components makers, which specialises in bearings, friction materials, and engine components such as pistons and piston rings, increased its pre-tax profits last year by 12 per cent to Pounds 70m helped by cost-cutting and winning increased market share. Prospects are improving significantly for Europe's components makers this year, as the recovery from recession becomes more firmly established. Mr Scholl maintains that Bosch will return to operating profit this year, and Michelin says that it is also well positioned to return to profit this year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales of automotive components in western Europe (m units)1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Actual  Estimate  Forecast  Forecast                           1992      1993      1995      1997  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Batteries                 44.5      43.4      45.8      48.0 Brakes (inc parts)       315.0     307.0     337.0     360.0 Clutches                  31.6      30.1      31.0      31.3 Exhausts                  73.7      73.4      77.3      81.2 Fan belts                 77.1      72.7      81.2      88.4 Filters (air &amp; oil)      199.6     200.4     211.2     221.9 Gaskets                   33.7      31.2      26.7      22.9 Lighting                  30.4      26.8      28.3      29.5 Shock absorbers           69.6      62.6      66.2      69.0 Sparking plugs           577.8     554.7     527.7     501.7 Tyres                    191.4     187.0     190.5     193.9 Wipers blades &amp; arms     137.9     137.1     144.6     151.7  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Original equipment and aftermarket combined Source: EIU  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

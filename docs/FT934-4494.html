			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Treatment for shaky growth: The health of US drugs group Merck For seven years, Merck, the world's largest drugs group, has been voted Fortune magazine's most admired US company. Its reputation has been based on a talent for discovering and developing new medicines, innovative and successful joint ventures, and an apparently remorseless ability to achieve double-digit earnings growth. But Merck's global standing, and the judgment of Dr Roy Vagelos, its charismatic chairman, are now being questioned. Sales growth is faltering, battered by an increasingly competitive environment; the launch of Proscar, a treatment for enlarged prostate, has been disappointing; and Merck has few exciting new drugs in the pipeline. In addition, the direction of the company remains unclear after Dr Vagelos's retirement next year. His heir apparent and chief operating officer, Mr Richard Markham, resigned unexpectedly in July. No obvious successor has emerged. Concerns among shareholders that Merck had lost its way were heightened soon after Mr Markham's departure, when the group announced its intention to acquire Medco Containment, a drugs mail order company, for Dollars 6bn. Medco has an annual turnover of Dollars 2.5bn and net income of Dollars 138m. The deal, which has been given the go-ahead by regulatory authorities, is a radical departure for Merck, and signals a shift from research and development to distribution. The acquisition has been described as a watershed in the drug industry. Dr Vagelos says: 'We're not just trying to remodel Merck, we're trying to remodel the entire industry. The rest of the sector normally follows what we do.' However, industry executives and the investment community remain divided over the move. Some view it as visionary and inspired. Others believe the acquisition was overpriced and will offer no lasting competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals marketing. The Medco acquisition is Merck's response to the rapid changes overtaking US pharmaceuticals. In the world's largest market, hospitals and doctors are banding together to negotiate bulk discounts. Merck estimates that in 1991 only 33 per cent of health provision was supplied through bulk buyers, known as managed care organisations. Within two years, it forecasts the figure will be 67 per cent. Merck believes the implications of this consolidation are momentous. It is particularly being hit by discounts in the highly competitive markets of cholesterol-lowering treatments and medicines for hypertension. Bulk buying has been accompanied by greater prescribing of generic drugs, which are less expensive than their patented counterparts. Kline, the New-York based industry analyst, believes the generics sector could double to Dollars 10bn between 1992 and 1996. The growth of generics will accelerate as patents expire over the next two years, including that of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten, a heart drug with worldwide sales of Dollars 1.6bn. 'Competition has already lowered prices of drugs,' says Dr Vagelos. 'Annualised price increases to the third quarter of 1993 averaged only 3.5 per cent. That compares with 9.9 per cent in 1990. We see price increases as a thing of the past.' The healthcare reforms being prepared by the Clinton administration will exacerbate the industry's plight, he adds. As a result, the growth of the US market is slowing, from 18 per cent in 1992 to 4 per cent this year, according to observers. In this sluggish environment, market share is increasingly important. Such a consideration was an impetus behind the acquisition of Medco, which supplies medicines to about 33m Americans. The crucial factor is whether Merck can expand that number. If Dr Vagelos succeeds, the deal should pay for itself within three years, as Merck promises. Dr Vagelos says there are other benefits. 'We will acquire the ability to capture all the information when a person has a mail order prescription or goes to a pharmacy. This will allow us to capture more and more data on the individual, the diagnosis, and the doctor,' he explains. He believes Medco's large databases will give Merck valuable information about the cost-effectiveness of its treatments. In a scheme known as capitation, Merck intends to use this information to provide large US companies with medical cover for employees for an annual set fee per head. 'We will share the risk. One of our drugs is Proscar, which is fantastic for stopping the growth of benign prostate enlargement. We are talking to customers about putting their males who have enlargement on our drug and then guaranteeing they will get relief. If not, we will pay for the operation needed to deal with it.' Not all are convinced by Dr Vagelos's vision of integrated pharmaceutical care. Mr Ronald Nordmann, pharmaceuticals analyst at PaineWebber, the New York broker, says: 'I've recommended Merck as a buy every day since 1985. But when it announced its intention to buy Medco, I stopped.' One criticism of the Medco deal is that Merck, with its bureaucratic organisation, will be unable to manage the entrepreneurial mail order group. To counter this perception Merck could install Mr Martin Wygod, Medco's free-wheeling chairman, as its chairman when Dr Vagelos retires. Mr Wygod is already due to join the board. Other criticisms centre on the possible antagonism of Medco's suppliers and customers. The suppliers, for the most part Merck's competitors, could prove unwilling to supply drugs that boost Merck's profits. Managed care customers may be concerned they will increasingly be offered only Merck's drugs, which may not be the best or cheapest options. Finally, it is not clear whether the advantage offered by Medco is sustainable. Merck's competitors could form similar ventures, or gain access to more comprehensive databases at less cost from insurance companies - an idea they are now contemplating. If Medco's growth slows and fails to generate significant increases in volume for Merck, the deal could prove a drain on profits. Medco's Dollars 6bn price tag could be an expensive entry fee into distribution. 'It could prove to be the most brilliant deal in the history of the pharmaceuticals industry, offering vertical integration and allowing Merck to get closer to its customers. The logic is good. But the price looks too high and the future growth of Medco is questionable,' says Mr Nordmann. Merck should be given credit for trying to stay ahead of the game, forcing change rather than having it forced upon it. But by moving fast, the world's largest drugs group could be moving in the wrong direction.</p>

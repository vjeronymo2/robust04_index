			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Mozer charged after plea bargain fails MR PAUL MOZER, former head bond trader at Wall Street brokerage house Salomon Brothers and the central figure in the 1991 Treasury auction scandal, was indicted by federal prosecutors last night on a variety of criminal charges. This follows a judge's decision to reject a plea agreement drawn up by Mr Mozer's lawyers and the government on the grounds that there were still too many issues outstanding for a guilty plea to be accepted. After the rejection, prosecutors drew up the new indictment, which charges Mr Mozer with securities fraud, two counts of making false statements to Treasury officials, and one of preparing false books and records.</p>

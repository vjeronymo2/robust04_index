			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments relating to the Mexican elections  scheduled for 21 August 1994. Luis Donaldo Colosio,  presidential candidate for the PRI, Institutional Revolutionary  Party, visited Villa Hermoza on 22 February, capital of Tabasco  State. Peasants briefed him on the agriculture and  cattle-raising sectors. He said: "We must first admit what has  not worked in order to make corrections. One of things that has  not worked, and we have to correct it, is the federal  government's relationship with Tabasco State." Colosio gathered  a record crowd of 30,000 people. (Mexico City Radio ACIR  Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 23 Feb 94)    PRI candidate Colosio ended his Tabasco State campaign and  began touring Campeche where he visited the Cuatro Caminos  neighborhood, one of the poorest, and noted the peoples'  demands. During a meeting with the Cambio 21 Foundation, he  pledged to work for federalism to strengthen states and  municipalities.    On the subject of Campeche oil, he said: "Out of every $100  of crude exported, $65 originate from Campeche. We must do our  best to ensure that this oil exploitation brings more benefit to  the people of Campeche."    Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential  candidate for the PAN, National Action Party, received a call in  Mexicali from Manuel Camacho Solis, Peace and Reconciliation  Commission representative in Chiapas. Camacho Solis said talks  with the Zapatist National Liberation Army are going well.  Cevallos said: "I took the call while I was here at the  University, and he said the talks are progressing well and that  he hopes to have news for us soon...." Cevallos met with law  students at the University of Baja California. He said the  country's problems are political and already solved, others,  like the economy and social problems will be solved gradually.    In another report, Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate  for the PPS, Popular Socialist Party, campaigned in Mexico City  and met with the Worldwide Association of Women Journalists and  Writers. There, she spoke of her party's development project  proposal and said in part: "...with regional planning, to take  advantage of all the resources from each of the country's  resources."    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for  the  PRD, Party of the Democratic Revolution, campaigned in Guerrero  State and spoke out against political bosses, authoritarianism,  abandoning the Indians, and in favor of democracy. He said:  "Right now, we are proposing changes to the electoral law and  open elections."    Lastly, the PT, Workers Party of Mexico, registered its  political platform with Federal Electoral Institute, IFE,  authorities. Presidential candidate Cecilia Soto headed the  delegation and she handed the document to IFE General Director  Arturo Nunez. She then held a news conference where she said in  part: "...our proposals do not include constitutional reforms.  It would be very difficult to reach an agreement on this."  (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 24 Feb)    On 24 February, PRI and PARM, Authentic Party of the Mexican  Revolution, parties delivered their political platforms to IFE  authorities. IFE General Director Arturo Nunez said: "The  electoral platforms highlight several ways to understand Mexico,  to see its problems, and offer solutions from each party's view  point." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in  Spanish 1300 GMT 25 Feb 94)    PRI candidate Colosio ended his political tour to Merida  and continued on to Quintana Roo State where he said the August  elections must be exemplary to inspire confidence and added: "I  want to be the president of Mexico to democratically change our  country."    PAN candidate Fernandez de Cevallos visited Sinaloa State  and told businessmen his party had not made political agreements  in the electoral processes. He said the PRD had received more  benefits than his party in the preelectoral conflicts. He  responded to Confederation of Mexican Workers, CTM, leader Fidel  Velasquez' charges against him by saying: "The union sector is a  progovernment, boss-controlled game preserve which does not  accept democracy. This cannot continue."    During her visit to Tlaxcala State, PPS candidate Lombardo  Otero summoned interested parties and candidates to a meeting to  discuss a different economic program that will satisfy the needs  of the Mexicans and create more jobs.    PRD candidate Cardenas initiated a three-day tour to  Michoacan state to outline his political platform.    Rafael Aguilar Talamante, Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party, PFCERN, presidential candidate, attended a  political rally in Mexico City and said: "To prompt the changes  the country requires, it is imperative we use the power of the  vote instead of the destructive power of weapons, intolerance,  or violence." He called for the reasoned vote to prevail over  the retaliation vote.    PPS and PRD parties registered their political platforms at  IFE for the 21 August federal elections today. Counting these  two parties, eight political parties have registered their  platforms at IFE, only the PFCERN has not presented the  corresponding document. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in  Spanish 0430 GMT 26 Feb 94)    At a meeting with the IFE General Council today, "the nine  registered political parties approved important agreements to  ensure clean and honest elections in August." The main  agreements were: "1) To request the Criminal Law be revised so  it clearly stipulates what electoral crimes are and increases  the punishments." 2) Approval of electoral observers. They,  however, "have to be Mexican citizens who agree to take a  training course, are not registered in any political party, and  have not run for any public office in the past three years. 3)  Pending approval of the Attorney General's Office, a special  Electoral Crimes Prosecutor's Office will be created." 4) The  function of auditing the electoral register will be publicly  auctioned. "5) The Federal Government will give political  parties an additional 10 percent for political training,  socioeconomic investigations, and expenses for editorial tasks.  The parties will receive more than 19 million new pesos for  those activities."    Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate of the National  Opposition Union, UNO, campaigned in Nayarit State. He met with  students and invited "all Mexicans to use their electoral card  because it will allow them to make changes in the country."    Jorge Gonzalez, presidential candidate of the Mexican Green  Ecologist Party, toured Mexico State. He said "alternate  technology is an ecological answer to resolving the lack of  basic services such as drinking water." (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 1 Mar 94    Manuel Camacho Solis, Commissioner for Peace and  Reconciliation in Chiapas, has tried to stop persistent rumors  about his aspirations to the Mexican presidency, and he told  reporters: "I have nothing to add regarding personal issues.  Right now, I am dedicated to my work. Once the peace  agreements are signed, I will comment on what I expect to do  next."    Political and media speculations have noted that Camacho's  political perspectives will increase if the conflict in Chiapas  is resolved prior to 15 March, the deadline for political  parties to register their candidates for the 21 August  presidential elections. PRI has announced that its candidate,  Luis Donaldo Colosio, will register on 4 March. (Madrid EFE in  Spanish 0649 GMT 3 Mar 94)    PPS candidate Lombardo campaigned in Yucatan and spoke out  against foreign electoral observers at the August elections. She  said "the political parties themselves have to guard the  elections."    PRD candidate Cardenas visited Mexico City Ibero-American  University and spoke about the Chiapas agreements. He said: "It  seems the government has started to respond to the demands."  Cardenas was interrupted several times by students who protested  because he had not attended a previous meeting.    A Mexico City voters registration office official reported  more than five million people in Mexico City already have the  corresponding voter's card.

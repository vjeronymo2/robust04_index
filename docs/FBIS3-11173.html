Opposition to the  controversial points in the program, such as the legalization of  abortion and marriage between homosexuals -- namely from  deputies Benedita da Silva (Rio de Janeiro) who belongs to the  Evangelical Church, and Irma Passoni (Sao Paulo), who is  Catholic -- forced Lula to review these subjects.    Deputy Irma Passoni said: "You cannot support these ideas  before discussing them within the bloc."    Benedita commented: "This cannot be included in the  government program, because it is a mistake. We are going to  discuss it with the Church."    Lula answered: "We must look at abortion as a public health  issue. Wealthy women go to posh clinics to have an abortion  with little suffering. Poor women risk their lives at home,  where abortions are performed under inadequate conditions."    Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-Sao Paulo) upheld the need to draft  a  new program for Lula's government.    Genoino said: "The PT has one program, while Lula has  another. One cannot mix government politics with social issues."    The alliance parties -- the PPS [Peoples' Socialist Party]  and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] -- also demand changes.  The PPS, for example, does not accept a moratorium on the  foreign debt.    In Sao Paulo, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  President Tasso Jereissati asserted that the PT proposals make  the possibility of an alliance between the two parties even more  remote.    "The PT has become more and more distant from the PSDB.  These PT proposals are an example of that."    Paulo Maluf, virtual PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]  candidate, also criticized the PT.    Maluf commented: "The program has reached a deadlock, and  Lula has contributed to this."    Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party], chose to criticize the program,  which he labeled "Jurassic," in general terms. According to  Fleury, the PT proposals regarding the debt and privatization  subjects are "obsolete, and harmful" to the country.</p>

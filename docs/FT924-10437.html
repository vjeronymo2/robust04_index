			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: JAL turns in Y4.4bn interim loss  -Corporate Japan feels the impact of the deepening recession JAPAN AIR LINES, the leading Japanese international carrier, is facing deepening losses after reporting a pre-tax loss of Y4.4bn (Dollars 35m) in the first half of the financial year. JAL has been hit by a combination of rising investment costs, falling business demand for international travel, a low growth in general tourist demand and a domestic market which has been flattened by the downturn in the Japanese economy. The loss in the six months to September compares with a Y10.26bn pre-tax profit in the same period last year. The airline made a pre-tax loss of Y6.4bn last year, its first since 1985 when its business slumped after a major accident in Japan. JAL made a profit of Y24bn in 1990. JAL said its net after-tax loss was Y3.6bn, or Y2.02 per share, against a net profit of Y2.66bn, or Y1.57bn a share, last year. Sales fell by 4.7 per cent to Y549.59bn, with the fall in consumer demand amplified by a slump in cargo traffic reflecting the economic slowdown in Japan and the US. The airline in June unveiled a restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and raising revenues particularly through increasing its share of the Japanese market from about 24 per cent to close to a third. This strategy appears to be bearing some fruit with the number of passengers carried rising by 2.4 per cent to 7.94m. However revenues from domestic services were unchanged at Y140bn. JAL is cutting back on recruitment to slow employment growth and considering cuts among its least profitable international services, a move which would be a significant reverse for the airline which has expanded aggressively over the past decade.</p>

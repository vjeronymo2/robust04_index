			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA HEIGHTS GIVEN HISTORIC DISTRICT STATUS  </P> <P> California Heights, a 1920s-era neighborhood of Long Beach dominated by classic  Spanish houses and California bungalows, has been designated a historic  district by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission.  </P> <P> The status helps protect the neighborhood from extensive remodeling, making  major renovations subject to the approval of the commission.  </P> <P> Demolition could be delayed for up to one year, although it ultimately cannot  be stopped.  </P> <P> The neighborhood was developed in the 1920s during a burst of economic growth  in the city. It was built of predominantly Spanish Colonial Revival homes mixed  with English Tudors. California bungalow-style houses were moved into the area  from other neighborhoods undergoing substantial redevelopment.  </P> <P> " . . . The neighborhood has an unusual coherence and period charm," the  commission said in its decision.  </P> <P> The boundaries of the new historic district are Walnut Avenue, Bixby Road,  Wardlow Road and the alley east of Atlantic Avenue.  </P></p>

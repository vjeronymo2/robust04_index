			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito appointed  Tsutomu Hata prime minister of Japan in a Thursday [28 April]  morning ceremony at the imperial palace, government officials  said. The appointment formally made Hata prime minister of  Japan.    Hata was named prime minister in elections in both houses of  the Diet on Monday.    His appointment as prime minister was delayed, however, by  political unrest sparked by the establishment of a large  parliamentary coalition grouping that excluded the Social  Democratic Party, which had been the biggest single party in the  coalition. The SDP declared early Tuesday it had left the  coalition.    Hata, head of the coalition's core party, Shinseito, will  form his cabinet later Thursday, the officials said.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Making an appeal to all sides - Why Mining (Scotland) wants part of British Coal If political acceptability is to count for anything in the government's selection of the winning bids for the assets of British Coal then a company named Mining (Scotland) is ideal. The consortium has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland, and Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, sits on its board. But its co-chairman is Professor Ross Harper, a former president of the Scottish Conservative party, and his co-chairman is Mr George McAlpine, a former British Coal area director for Scotland. The formation of Mining (Scotland) last summer was both an example of the Scottish preference for consensus rather than confrontation, and of Scottish pragmatism in pursuit of an objective. The moderate Scottish branch of the NUM has swallowed any ideological objections to privatisation in the interests of getting a share of the assets. Those assets are among the most attractive the government is offering. They consist of one deep mine, Longannet, and nine opencast sites, with a number of prospective opencast sites for future development. Last autumn Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric agreed to buy 2.5m tonnes of coal in 1994-95, rising to 2.8m tonnes each year until 1997-98. The low sulphur content of much of Scotland's coal makes it relatively friendly in environmental terms, and demand is set to rise from 5.3m tonnes this year to 7.5m in 1998. This is because of the increase in the capacity of the interconnecting power lines to England and the tailing off of supplies of gas from the Miller field in the North Sea to Hydro-Electric's power station at Peterhead, Grampian. The government is also offering as a separate lot the Frances colliery near Kirkcaldy in Fife, which has been mothballed for several years but which possesses reserves of low sulphur coal. Mining (Scotland) is interested in that too, though realises that it could require a substantial investment. The attractions of the Scottish coalfield have been appreciated by other bidders. Last month Ryan Group, the coal producer, announced a joint venture with Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company. Between them they already mine 40 per cent of Scottish coal under contract to British Coal. Scotcoal, as it is called, also has a top Scottish Tory on its board: the chairman is Lord Sanderson who until last May was chairman of the party. Other companies are thought to have pre-qualified, if only to see the details of what British Coal is putting on sale. Mr Brian MacDonald, the Glasgow businessman whom Mining (Scotland) appointed chief executive last autumn, says that part of the eventual deal should be structured as a management-employee buy-out through an employee share ownership plan. The mining unions would invest separately. Other shareholders are likely to be involved. Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial director who has formed a company called Coal Investments, is on the board and would take a stake. Intriguingly, Mr MacDonald says Mining (Scotland) is negotiating a partnership with another British coal mining company, but refuses to name it. He envisages the founding shareholders' equity being supplemented by loans and venture capital funding, though he says 'high gearing is not desirable.' Royal Bank of Scotland has told the company it would consider lending to it and Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow investment house, should offer venture capital. If all goes well, Mining (Scotland) would expect to float on the Stock Exchange in five to seven years time. However, these are early days. First Mining (Scotland) wants to know exactly what British Coal is offering and what liabilities such as subsidence, flooding, pollution and miners' health the government expects the purchaser to take on. The government has indicated that it is prepared to address some of the potential bidders' concerns on these costs but has yet to decide where to draw the line. 'The liabilities are a big problem,' Mr MacDonald says. 'If they are not capped by the government in some way I don't believe anyone will want to buy the assets.'</p>

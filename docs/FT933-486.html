			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo diners spawn Malaysia eel industry - A Taiwanese enterprise feeding off Asian tastes and talents THERE are few things Japanese enjoy more than sinking their teeth into a succulent chunk of eel. Grilled eel, or edomae unagi, is regarded as a great delicacy, especially during the summer months when a good lashing of eel is believed to cool down the body, exercise the digestion and improve sexual performance. On average Japan consumes about 110,000 tonnes of eel a year. With scarce land resources and expensive labour, Japan relies mainly on imports to meet its seemingly insatiable eel appetite. That is where Malaysia comes in. On the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia the world's biggest eel farm has been built, covering a total of 5,000 acres. At any one time between 30m and 40m eels are swimming about in the farm's 400 ponds. When a second phase of work is completed on the project, the eel population will double. All production is cooked and packaged on site and exported to Japan, ready for the restaurant table. 'Eels are sensitive creatures and they have to be looked after very carefully,' says Mr Felix Lo, director of the eel farm in rural Pahang state. 'That's why they are so expensive. In a Tokyo restaurant you can quite easily pay Y3,000 (Pounds 18) for a good piece of eel.' The Malaysia farm is run by Song Cheng Enterprises, a private Taiwanese company. The Taiwanese, taught originally by the Japanese, have become the world's premier eel farmers. Eel production at the Malaysian farm started three years ago after the failure of a prawn farming project. Mr Lo says about 4,000 tonnes of eel - worth nearly Dollars 70m (Pounds 45.4m) - will be exported this year, rising to about 10,000 tonnes by 1995. 'There are between three and six eels, each about 15 inches long, in every kilo,' says Mr Lo. 'Each kilo sells for between Dollars 15 and Dollars 20. It can be a very lucrative business but if you're not careful things can go badly wrong.' Despite exhaustive research, scientists have so far failed to hatch eel eggs under laboratory conditions. The species favoured by the Japanese - the 'Japonica' eel - is found in fresh water in Taiwan, Korea, China and Japan. At a certain stage the eel swims to sea to lay its eggs. When hatched, the eel fries make their way to fresh water. Song Cheng buys its eel fries from farmers who gather them in river mouths round the coast of north-east Asia. The eels, fed a mainly fishmeal diet, take up to two years to mature ready for processing and export. Every part of the eel is used. The head is chopped off and recycled into fishmeal. The backbone is crushed to extract oil which is processed into tablets. 'Many people say eel tablets improve the condition of the skin,' says Mr Lo. 'We sell them as the 'cosmetic you can eat'.' The Song Cheng farm employs 1,500 people in an area where jobs are scarce. Nearly Dollars 100m has been invested in the project so far. A similar amount, much of it borrowed from local banks, is to be invested in the next phase of the farm's expansion. Not everyone is happy with the project. The farm has been treated generously by the Malaysian government with handsome tax concessions, including a tax holiday for at least the first five years of operation. While Song Cheng pays an undisclosed amount to the local government in return for a 90-year lease on its vast land holding, critics say Malaysia sees little financial return on the project. Nor does Malaysia gain much in the way of technology transfer: most of the important tasks at the farm are carried out by Taiwanese, Japanese and Koreans. But the main criticism of the eel farm is on environmental grounds. Eels need a constant supply of fresh water and environmentalists say important coastal swamplands are being dried out by excessive pumping. They say the Taiwanese are carrying out activities in Malaysia which are no longer allowed in Taiwan. The Malaysian government allowed Song Cheng to dredge up tons of sand from the seashore to build dikes for the eel ponds. Locals say salt water is killing off nearby grasslands and worry what will happen to the area when the eel farm eventually closes. Song Cheng insists that it, and its eels, are in Malaysia to stay and says the criticisms of the environmentalists are not justified. 'We have the most to lose if we damage the environment because it means our eels will no longer be able to survive,' says Mr Lo. 'Anyway, we have created hundreds of jobs - that's a very important factor.' Song Cheng says it cannot fatten up its eels fast enough. 'The supply of eels to Japan still falls well short of demand,' says Mr Lo. 'People wonder whether Japanese tastes are changing. But expecting the Japanese to give up eating eels is like saying the Chinese will stop eating rice.'</p>

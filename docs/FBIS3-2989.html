			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Boeing  Company said here today it fully supports the continuation of  most favored nation (MFN) trading status for China.    Lawrence Clarkson, vice president of Boeing, made these  remarks at a symposium on U.S.-China relations held by the  Council on Foreign Relations.    Clarkson said that "the American people would be better  served if the divisive annual debate on MFN was avoided."    "Bilateral issues between our countries should be addressed  as they would be normally between two countries who share  significant mutual interests," he noted.    China is now the United States' 8th largest trading partner,  and U.S. exports to China grew 17.36 percent in 1993 to 8.7  billion U.S. dollars.    "U.S. exports to China in 1993 supported more than 167,000  U.S. jobs," Clarkson said. "China trade also creates thousands  of jobs for U.S. retailers, wholesalers, and importers."    He also said that during the next 15 years, China will need  800 commercial planes worth 40 billion dollars, making it the  world's third largest aviation market.    "Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are currently well positioned  in the Chinese market," he pointed out. "But Airbus, Fokker and  the Russians are waiting to quickly take advantage if the  relationship between the United States and China deteriorates."    Clarkson said the Boeing Company believes strongly that U.S.  President Bill Clinton should extend MFN status for China and  that Congress should support such a decision.</p>

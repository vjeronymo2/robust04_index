			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--Ambassador Nayif Sa'ud al-Qadi,  Jordan's permanent representative to the Arab League and  chairman of the current Arab League Council emergency session on  the Yemeni crisis, has denied media reports of differences  between the Yemeni leadership and the Arab League Council  regarding the convening of the emergency session to discuss an  end to the recent fighting there.    He told MENA that in a telephone conversation with Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the Yemeni  foreign minister welcomed the Arab League Council decision to  continue its efforts and contacts to stop the fighting between  the sons of the homeland. The Yemeni foreign minister's  statement that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair, as cited  by news media, does not mean a rejection of the Arab League's  help in ending the fighting, he said.    The ambassador said the Arab League is continuing its  contacts with the Yemeni and Arab leaders in an attempt to stop  the bloodshed. He said Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah has agreed to receive a delegation from the Arab  League Secretariat headed by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, the  assistant Arab League secretary general for military affairs.    Asked about reports that Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid had requested Jordanian mediation to stop the fighting,  al-Qadi said he has no information about this. He noted that  Jordan has continued to call on the Yemeni leaders to begin  negotiations and renounce force as a means to solve differences.  He pointed to Jordan's role in signing the Pledge and Accord  Document, which he described as the best option of the Yemeni  people to solve differences and preserve a unified Yemen.    The Jordanian ambassador hoped the brothers in Yemen will  come to their senses and stop battles as soon as possible so  that differences can be solved through dialogue and  understanding.</p>

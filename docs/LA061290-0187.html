			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 SECOND-HALF GOALS GIVE BELGIUM OPENING VICTORY OVER SOUTH KOREA;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP: TIGHT DEFENSE MEANT THAT SOUTH KOREANS DIDN'T GET A SHOT ON GOAL FOR  MORE THAN AN HOUR.  </P> <P> Spectacular second-half goals by Marc Degryse and Michel De Wolf earned Belgium  a 2-0 victory today over South Korea in the opening games for both countries in  the World Cup.  </P> <P> Striker Degryse scored the first in the 52nd minute when he collected a long  pass from Enzo Scifo 30 yards out and lobbed the ball high over goalkeeper Choi  In Young, who had advanced well out of his goal area.  </P> <P> Twelve minutes later, left back De Wolf added the second, finishing a solo run  with a scorching drive from outside the area for one of the best goals of the  tournament so far.  </P> <P> Belgian's experienced defense kept the South Koreans in check.  </P> <P> It took well over an hour before South Korea could even get its first shot on  goal.  </P> <P> The Belgians found it hard to break down the packed Korean defense in the first  half, although they came close several times, and midfielder Bruno Versavel hit  the post in the seventh minute.  </P> <P> South Korea, outsiders in probably the toughest group of the tournament, which  also includes Spain and Uruguay, made occasional breaks, with Choi Soon Ho  looking most threatening on a field made slippery by rain.  </P> <P> Belgium, surprise semifinalists in the 1986 Mexico tournament, put South Korea  under early pressure through Marc Emmers, who broke down the right wing several  times.  </P> <P> Acrobatic goalkeeper Choi was the outstanding member of the team, saving his  side from a much greater defeat as the Belgians rained shots on goal.  </P> <P> Belgium slowed the pace after their second goal, but South Korea, which failed  to survive the first round in two previous World Cup appearances, had its best  chance when Hwang Seon Hong's header was snatched away by goalkeeper Michel  Preud'homme.  </P> <P> "The most important thing is the two points," Guy Thys, Belgium's veteran  coach, said.  </P> <P> "I think it was a well-deserved, routine victory, although I would have liked  to have seen two more goals," he added.  </P> <P> "I told them to start the second half as they had the first, and this time we  managed to score."  </P></p>

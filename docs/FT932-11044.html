			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Job-creation ideas flow in HUNDREDS of ways to reduce unemployment, including re-skilling up to 400 workers to decommission Soviet nuclear submarines, have been submitted to the government by Training and Enterprise Councils. Tecs, which administer state-funded training schemes for the jobless, were invited by the government to compete for an extra Pounds 21m to run projects to cut unemployment in the present financial year. The deadline for appli-cations was yesterday. Tecs have taken a variety of approaches. Birmingham Tec has looked for a closer working relationship between itself and the Employment Service, which runs non-training options such as Jobclubs. It wants to offer employers a single 'gateway' for recruitment. Aztec in south-west London proposes an allowance of up to Pounds 75 a week to help jobless people with the transition from benefits to a work pattern involving a number of part-time jobs. It also suggests training grants for employers to support recruitment of thelong-term unemployed. Cumbria Tec is submitting a project whereby former VSEL shipyard workers, employed by a newly created marine technology transfer company, would be trained to decommission Soviet submarines. Ideas had to be new, they had to be capable of being set up by September and of making a significant contribution to reducing unemployment. The government expects to fund between 12 and 24 projects. Many Tecs, while applying for the extra funding, have been critical of the scheme, known as Tec Challenge. One critic said worthwhile schemes take more than a few months to set up and 'Tecs are not interested in short-term wheezes that are intended to massage the government's unemployment register'. The government yesterday placed more small companies outside the scope of the industry training levy. In future companies with combined payroll and payments to labour-only sub-contractors of less than Pounds 61,000 a year will not be subject to the levy. The previous ceiling was Pounds 45,000.</p>

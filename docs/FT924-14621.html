			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Heinz to buy NZ foods group HJ HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday completed the deal to buy Wattie Foods, New Zealand's biggest canned and frozen foods group, from Goodman Fielder Wattie (GFW) for NZDollars 566m (USDollars 308m). GFW, Australia's biggest foods group, had planned to sell the Wattie division through a public share flotation next month, which had been expected to raise NZDollars 490m. GFW is to use the money from the Wattie sale to buy Uncle Toby's, a leading Australian cereals company, as part of its strategy to concentrate on baked foods and cereals. It is retaining a some baking and related businesses in New Zealand which operate under the Goodman name. Heinz executives received approvals for the takeover from both the New Zealand Overseas Investment Commission and the New Zealand Commerce Commission earlier this month. Petersville Sleigh, a division of the diversified Australian industrial company Pacific Dunlop, had also expressed an interest in buying a stake in Wattie Foods. Some analysts believed this was due to Petersville's concerns over the inroads Wattie Foods was making in Australia with a range of baked beans and spaghetti. Wattie Foods has taken 15 per cent of the market, which has been dominated by Petersville and Heinz, in the past six months. Heinz said yesterday it would allow Wattie Foods to compete aggressively against Heinz products in Australia. Both companies would be controlled directly from Heinz' Pittsburg headquarters in the US, but under the existing local management. Wattie Foods has annual sales of approximately NZDollars 750m, which compares with Heinz' global sales of USDollars 6.58bn. Heinz plans to 'grow' Wattie Foods and use its production facilities. This forms part of the Heinz plan to become a greater force in Japan and other parts of Asia. The Wattie name will continue to be used in Australia, Japan and other markets, with new products, including Weightwatchers, to be added to the existing varieties. Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, said Wattie Foods would provide the US group with an 'exciting opportunity' to expand its presence significantly in the Asian region using Heinz's expertise in marketing, product development and global distribution. Mr O'Reilly said Wattie Foods was one of New Zealand's most respected companies. One of the main attractions for Heinz in buying the company was the New Zealand economy which had 'benefited greatly from government policies which had encouraged free trade and becoming a low cost producer in recent years.</p>

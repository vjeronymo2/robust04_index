			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Viliam </F> Buchert in Ho Chi Minh City on 19 April: "Minister Zieleniec:  We Have a Good Chance in Vietnam"]    [Text] Ho Chi Minh City--According to Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec, the Czech Republic is well on the way toward  emulating other countries and orienting itself more toward  Vietnam. The head of our diplomatic corps does not see this as  a major problem. For this reason, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked him  for an interview at the end of his visit to this country.    [Buchert] Was it not a political mistake to reduce contacts  drastically with Vietnam at the beginning of the 1990's and thus  also affect economic relations?    [Zieleniec] There was no political decision. Vietnam was  simply pushed aside by our interest in other countries,  especially Western ones. There was a certain easing off, but  now, on the other hand, there are far greater opportunities  because this state only reached the stage of more rapid reforms  in the past two years.    [Buchert] So, this was not a mistake by our side?    [Zieleniec] It was determined by developments. I repeat,  there was no political decision, and, therefore, there could not  have been a mistake.    [Buchert] In the wake of their recent visits to Hanoi, for  example, Philippine President Ramos, Swedish Prime Minister  Bildt, and Australian Prime Minister Keating all left with  specific agreements. Why did this not happen in our case?    [Zieleniec] You are not looking at the issue correctly.  Agreements are only an element of overall relations.  Incidentally, agreements will be signed soon.    [Buchert] So, neither the Vietnamese nor the Czech side is  disappointed by the outcome of the visit?    [Zieleniec] On the contrary, the two sides were satisfied.  In my opinion, it is better to carry an issue through  thoroughly, right to the end.    [Buchert] Officials from the Hanoi government spoke with you  about the possibility of trading in arms. Were they successful?    [Zieleniec] Their military hardware is compatible with ours.  This issue, however, was a marginal one, and they came up with  it. Therefore, they did not receive an answer, and our response  will be a matter for political consideration.    [Buchert] The former Federal Government released 400 million  korunas as compensation for the Vietnamese working in the CSFR  who had to return home early. The money was supposed to be used  to aid projects for these people. Apparently, this did not  happen. Has anyone been monitoring the flow of these finances?    [Zieleniec] This was an agreement between governments and  not between the former federal cabinet and individual  Vietnamese. We provided the money. According to agreement,  however, its fate was in the hands of the Hanoi government.    [Buchert] According to polls in the Czech Republic, the  Vietnamese are not exactly popular among our citizens. Does  this not harm mutual relations?    [Zieleniec] If the Czech Republic's citizens could see what  the Vietnamese are really like, I think they would change their  views. This will in no way harm relations.</p>

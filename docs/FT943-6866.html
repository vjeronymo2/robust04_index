			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates It is a sure sign of confidence returning to the property market that Slough Estates is cranking up its development programme. Slough can hardly be counted among the sector's high-rollers. Its decision to increase the pace of development rests on the first hints of increased interest from potential tenants, at least in better quality buildings. While headline rents show no sign of rising - and are still falling for lesser quality space - there is evidence that fewer incentives are required to persuade tenants to sign on the dotted line. If that trend continues investors will breathe a sigh of relief. The rise in property values since the bottom in 1991 has relied on falling bond yields. Yet recent survey evidence suggests that this year's turbulent bond markets are starting to drag property values down. Sure signs of rental growth will be required if property is to be anything other than a hostage to gilts. Property companies also need higher occupation rates and modest rental growth to keep profits moving ahead. Much of the improvement in Slough's half year profits arose from lower interest costs as a result of its rights issue. There will be additional benefits to come as the rights money is used to expand the portfolio. But, like the other property companies which asked shareholders for funds last year, that momentum will only carry Slough so far. The green shoots of rental growth cannot come soon enough.</p>

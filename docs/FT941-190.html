			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Channel 4 challenges ruling on complaints Channel 4 is to seek a judicial review of a decision by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission after complaints by two former chancellors. The commission found that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were treated unfairly in a Channel 4 programme on monetary policy, A Brief Economic History of Our Times, made by Fulcrum Productions. The commission came to its conclusion in spite of deciding that the programme was not inaccurate in any way. It decided that the co-operation of the two Tory peers was secured on a misleading basis. The programme consisted, the commission found, of unrelieved criticism of the handling of the economy by Lord Howe and Lord Lawson. Had they known the programme makers' intentions, neither would have taken part, it said. Channel 4 has been told it has a case for judicial review on the grounds that the commission exceeded its powers. Lord Howe also complained to Fulcrum about 'negative' clips in the programme of the main news events of the years. He said these included: ' . . . the Piper Alpha disaster, the unexplained cripple in a wheelchair - even the fall of the Berlin wall is made to look like an ugly riot'. The 'unexplained cripple' was Professor Stephen Hawking, the physicist and author of A Brief History of Time.</p>

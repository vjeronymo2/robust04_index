			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> TUCKER SAYS HE EARNED DOUGLAS VICTORY  </P> <P> Tony Tucker, the last man to beat Buster Douglas, says he wasn't surprised that  Douglas beat Mike Tyson in Tokyo last month.  </P> <P> Tucker, who stopped Douglas in the 10th round of a 1987 International Boxing  Federation championship fight in Las Vegas, also said he is irritated by media  descriptions of that fight in the aftermath of Douglas-Tyson.  </P> <P> "The media has been writing that Buster 'just ran out of gas suddenly' against  me and blew it," Tucker said.  </P> <P> "That's not how it happened. I hurt Buster early in the ninth round with a long  right hand, and after that he started backing up. I caught him on the ropes  with four good shots in the 10th and finished him. He was in great shape that  night, I just wore him down and beat him."  </P> <P> After Tucker beat Douglas, he lost his title to Tyson on a 12-round decision,  his only defeat in 37 fights. Tucker, still the last man to go the distance  against Tyson, dropped out of sight after that bout. He battled substance abuse  and other personal problems for more than two years and is 2-0 since a  comeback.  </P> <P> He will fight Mike Evans at the Forum Thursday night.  </P> <P> Tyson remains the hardest hitter Tucker has faced.  </P> <P> "Tyson hit me harder than anyone, certainly harder than Buster," Tucker said.  "But Eddie Lopez hit me harder than Buster, too. Tyson was ready for a fall.  Buster was the right guy at the right time. All it took was a guy who could  stand up to him and fight him. I'm the one who showed he wasn't invincible, not  Buster."  </P> <P> Tucker, who stunned Tyson with a left uppercut in the first minute of their  fight, was never in serious difficulty but still lost a clear decision. Later,  he said he had fought Tyson with a broken bone in his right hand.  </P> <P> If Steve Wynn's proposed deal to match Douglas and Evander Holyfield in  September survives the courts, Tucker won't pick a winner. Not yet, anyway.  </P> <P> "That's a tough one to pick, because it won't be for seven months," he said.  "It depends a lot on whether or not Buster stays in shape -- you know Holyfield  will show up in shape.  </P> <P> "Remember, Buster was fighting every other month going into the Tyson fight.  Now he's going to have a long layoff. And Holyfield took a lot of shots in his  last two, against (Michael) Dokes and (Alex) Stewart. Holyfield takes a great  shot, but Buster hits pretty good. If Buster can hit Holyfield as steadily as  those two guys did, he'll knock Holyfield out."  </P> <P> And what of Tyson?  </P> <P> "He's young, it's hard to say. Maybe he can pick himself up after that loss, I  don't know. You don't know what his mind is like. Psychologically, the loss by  itself has to change him, knowing he's not invincible like he thought he was.  </P> <P> "I knew Mike would take Buster lightly, so I wasn't surprised at what happened.  Buster did it perfectly, kept that big jab on him, put pressure on him and  didn't let Mike back him up. Buster's got a really good jab, but it can be  countered. Buster's at his best when he's got both feet planted, throwing  shots."  </P> <P> But please, Tucker said, no more "Buster-ran-out-of-gas-against-Tucker"  stories.  </P> <P> "I hurt Buster and then finished him, he didn't run out of gas," he reiterated.  </P> <P> J.D. McCauley, Buster Douglas' uncle/trainer, says he is convinced his man beat  Tyson at his best.  </P> <P> "I've watched it a half-dozen times and I've watched Mike carefully," he said.  "I don't see Mike breathing hard at any time up to the later rounds. To me, he  looks like he was in great shape."  </P> <P> McCauley, who has insisted that he never doubted Douglas would defeat Tyson,  said his confidence reached a peak after a morning run that Douglas took five  days before the fight.  </P> <P> "Buster ran five miles that morning in 37 minutes and felt so good when it was  over, he ran another 2 1/2 miles," McCauley said. "We knew then Buster was in  the best shape of his life, that if he lost, it wouldn't be because he wasn't  in shape.  </P> <P> "After the run that morning, he said to us: 'I got it, I'm gonna kill him.'  </P> <P> "So he had it from both directions, heart and conditioning. Heart is directly  related to conditioning. If you're not in shape, it won't matter if you have  the heart."  </P> <P> Douglas hasn't been near a gym since the fight, but not to worry, his trainer  said.  </P> <P> "As long as Buster doesn't go over 240-242, I'm not worried. He can take that  off easily. But he knows if he goes up to 250-255, that's trouble."  </P> <P> You wonder what kind of calls the trainer of a 42-1 shot gets after his guy  wins the world heavyweight championship.  </P> <P> "I haven't heard from any name fighters, but I heard from four amateur kids,"  he said. "They wanted to go into training right away, but none of them had any  idea how hard it is to box. So I sent them to an amateur coach."  </P> <P> The name jumps out from the long roster of entrants in Sunday's Los Angeles  Marathon: Palomino, Carlos.  </P> <P> "It's my seventh marathon and my third L.A. Marathon," the former welterweight  champion said. Palomino, 40 but still at his fighting weight of 147 pounds,  said running a marathon is a lot more painful than going the distance with  Roberto Duran or Armando Muniz.  </P> <P> "The first time I ran a marathon, I thought the first 15 miles were a breeze,"  he said. "But after 18 miles, every step felt like a body shot from George  Foreman. After my fights with Duran and Muniz, I hurt from the waist up for  several days. After a marathon, I hurt from the waist down for two weeks. And I  can't walk without making faces."  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson visited the scene of one of his  early victories this week, the old brick arena in Helsinki, Finland, where he  won the Olympic middleweight gold medal in 1952. Patterson and his pro rival,  Ingemar Johansson, were guests at the recent Finnish amateur boxing  championships. . . . One of the best of a good current crop of  light-heavyweights, Australian Jeff Harding (15-0) will defend his WBC  championship against Nestor Giovanni (28-4-2) of Argentina March 18 on ESPN.  </P> <P> According to an Amateur Athletic Foundation study, Sugar Ray Leonard was easily  the best-paid athlete in 1989, at $29.5 million. Mike Tyson was a distant  second with $14 million, followed by Thomas Hearns with $11 million and Roberto  Duran with $8.165 million. The first non-boxer on the list: Auto race driver  Ayrton Senna with $8 million. . . . The Dunes in Las Vegas will stage its first  boxing show since 1983 on March 12, featuring a lightweight bout between Greg  Haugen (23-2-1) and Memo Cruz (17-3).  </P> <P> NBC boxing coordinator Kevin Monaghan said the network will no longer recognize  the World Boxing Assn., after the WBA's featherweight champion, Antonio  Esparragoza, pulled out of an April 1 bout against Steve Cruz, which was to  have been televised by NBC. Monaghan, angry because he lost the date to a  figure skating show, claimed that the pullout was payback for a long-running  NBC-WBA beef. . . . Mike Evans, who will be Tony Tucker's Forum opponent  Thursday night, is a part-time actor and former amateur wrestler who lost to  Olympic champion Tyrell Biggs in Biggs' first pro bout in 1984.  </P></p>

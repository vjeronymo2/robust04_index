			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / US acts to halve cost of international phone calls MEASURES to halve the price of US international telephone calls were unveiled by communications authorities in Washington yesterday, in a move which would save the country's consumers about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2bn) a year. The action by the Federal Communications Commission, the industry regulator, could have a strong impact on the income foreign telecoms utilities receive from the US and is likely to press them to cut their own prices for outgoing international calls. The FCC's main target is the complex accounting rate system determining how phone companies share international call revenue. An accounting rate is the amount US phone companies pay their foreign counterparts for delivering calls to their destinations. The current system penalises any country which cuts its international prices. The Financial Times last year showed that consumers across the world were being overcharged by more than Dollars 10bn a year for international calls. The FCC yesterday directed US telephone companies such as AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint to negotiate lower accounting rates with their foreign counterparts. It wants the companies to focus on Europe and Asia, where it believes rates could be cut by half. The FCC also proposed further regulatory action if there has been insufficient progress towards lowering accounting rates by the beginning of 1993. This could include the US cutting accounting rates unilaterally. Mr Alfred Sikes, chairman of the FCC, said: 'International communications should be a means of strengthening mutual responsibility and understanding and furthering important goals including expanded liberalised world trade. 'It should not be a process through which American international callers are, in effect, burdened with involuntary excessive costs.' The commission's action follows similar moves by the UK's Office of Telecommunications and the launch of a European Commission inquiry. International charges are to be addressed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris next week. Although FCC officials argued that the action was tough, some commentators doubted whether it would be sufficient to achieve the commission's objectives. One pointed out that foreign telephone companies could simply refuse to re-negotiate lower accounting rates. However, the FCC officals believe that the threat of unilateral action will strengthen the negotiating position of US telephone companies. They argue that foreign telephone companies are likely to lower rates rather than force the issue to a conflict. Technology, Page 11</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: The recovery is still on time FT-SE Index: 2,486.2 (-12.0) George Bush is not due to face the US electorate until November 1992, over four months after the latest date that the UK government can go to the polls. You would not think so from the public frenzy with which the US authorities are tackling their recession - most obviously in the G7 arm-twisting that preceded yesterday's discount rate cut. The UK government's relative sang-froid is all the more striking given that some forecasters are starting to use 4m as the likely unemployment figure next year and that one manufacturing job in 20 has gone in the past 12 months. The chancellor can find some comfort in yesterday's Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey. The survey suggests that while the turning point in the economic cycle may yet be a few months away, the turning point in business optimism is already with us. That might be enough to leave the government's - and the market's - expectation of a second-half economic recovery broadly on schedule. But the nagging question for the market is whether the upturn will prove quite as profitable as it has been expecting. Worryingly, the CBI survey reports a collapse of margins earlier this year as rapidly rising unit costs slammed into prices which appear to have been slowed much more sharply than official indicators have suggested. Looking ahead to the summer, manufacturers' expectations of domestic price rises are the lowest for 23 years. Those sectors most exposed to international competition are predicting actual price cuts. The rise in the dollar may have left industry feeling better about its ability to compete in export markets; but if the domestic market is to be undermined by lower cost ERM-based competitors, some, at least, of the currently discounted recovery in corporate profitability is at risk.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA) -- The newspaper AL-THAWRAH  says that any observer of political developments can easily see  that the countdown for the removal of some aspects of the  embargo has begun due to several national constants, as well as  a host of significant Arab and international changes.    In an article contributed by Dr. Safa' Salih al-'Umar,  member  of the National Assembly and chairman of the Arab and  International Relations Committee of the Assembly, the paper  adds that this has been manifested in the political and economic  positions of several states that are currently attempting to  clearly reformulate their positions toward several hot issues on  the international scene.    AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  notes that the Iraqi people's harsh daily sufferings under the  sanctions, as well as the immense sacrifices they have made  during the 30-state aggression, along with the intense efforts  made by Iraqis and some Arab and international parties, have all  contributed toward explaining this suffering and mobilizing  opposition to the continued enforcement of the sanctions within  popular and official quarters.    The paper argues that the financial losses several states  and  peoples have sustained due to the political and economic  instability in the region, which is directly linked to the  stability of Iraq and its regional economic, political, and  security role, were also instrumental in effecting this change  on the international scene.    AL-THAWRAH notes that the Iraqi people's suffering has been  accompanied by heroic steadfastness in the face of all aspects  of the aggression, be they political, military, informational,  or psychological. The Iraqi people have persisted in this  steadfastness in extremely harsh circumstances, something which  prompted several Western political policymakers to reconsider  the usefulness of this unfair position toward the Iraqi people,  as well as its potential harm for the region and their  countries' interests.    The paper goes on to say: The Western political policymakers  have continued their efforts to maintain and foster the state of  imbalance in the Arab region-- as state of insecurity and  instability. Sometimes, the West uses this tactic to quietly  create footholds in the region. At other times, it enters the  region militarily through exaggerated publicity to maintain this  imbalance by various means, such as the fuelling of local or  regional wars.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying that the objective that lies  before us at present should not be confined to lifting the  sanctions. We should also be able to define our positions in  the post-sanctions era toward a host of national and  humanitarian issues related to our progressive policy in line  with the factors that we have mentioned, and in the context of  the network of Arab and international relations created by  changes on the Arab and international scene, changes that Iraq  and its people have been experiencing over the past 10 years.</p>

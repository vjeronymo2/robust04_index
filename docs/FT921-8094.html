			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Fed eases pressure on banks' profits THE US Federal Reserve Board yesterday moved to boost bank profitability by announcing an unexpected reduction in banks' reserve requirements. With effect from April, the Fed is reducing from 12 to 10 per cent the proportion of current accounts that must be held as non-interest bearing reserves with the central bank. This will reduce US bank reserves by nearly Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn). On Wall Street, the announcement was greeted by sharp falls in both bond and share prices. The cut in reserve requirements was seen as offering some relief to hard-pressed banks but not as a substitute for a cut in interest rates. Today, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is due to present his six-monthly report to Congress on monetary policy. He had been expected to come under pressure from some members of Congress to ease further the Fed's monetary policy, on the grounds that December's cut of a full percentage point in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent was not sufficient to prod the sluggish economy out of recession. The cut in reserve requirements is of largely symbolic importance but gives the impression that the Fed is taking steps to boost the economy. 'This will make it easier for Mr Greenspan to defend not cutting interest rates again,' said Mr Bill Dudley, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, the New York investment house. The move would raise bank earnings by a few per cent but did not represent easing monetary policy because the target for the federal funds rate - the key short-term interest rate - was unchanged. The Fed said after a board meeting yesterday: 'The reduction from 12 per cent to 10 per cent in the reserve ratio on net transaction accounts (current accounts) will reduce funding costs for depositories and strengthen their balance sheets. Over time it is expected that most of these cost savings will be passed on to depositors and borrowers. 'The reduction should strengthen the financial condition of banks and thereby promote their access to capital markets, putting them in a better position to extend credit.' Just over a year ago the Fed cut reserve requirements on some deposit accounts in a parallel move to ease the US credit crunch. The Bush administration has been pressing for further monetary easing. Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, yesterday repeated his view that the current low rate of inflation and the slack in the economy left the Fed room for manoeuvre. The Fed, however, is reluctant to cut interest rates further because it believes the economy is likely to begin to recover by the spring.</p>

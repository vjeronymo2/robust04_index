			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Leaders of Brazil and Bolivia fail to clinch gas pipeline deal Presidents Itamar Franco of Brazil and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia yesterday failed to agree details of a Dollars 1.8bn gas pipeline, to be built from Bolivia's extensive fields of natural gas to Brazil's industrial south, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. The pipeline is expected to go ahead eventually but agreement on the shareholdings in the project has been delayed by negotiations over the price Brazil should pay for Bolivian gas and over the quantities it should take. The project, which has been under discussion for 18 months, was advanced at the weekend when Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil and gas company, announced it had chosen the BTB consortium as the main partner for its share of the project. BTB is a joint venture of BHP, Tenneco and British Gas. The Brazilian constitution obliges Petrobras to retain control of oil and gas ventures in the country, so the company is guaranteed a 51 per cent shareholding in the Brazilian part of the project. Petrobras wants to divide the remaining 49 per cent among BTB, a consortium of Brazilian private companies, and Bolivia's state oil company YPFB. However, Bolivia maintains that Petrobras made its weekend announcment to frustrate YPFB's wish to own all the remaining shares. Petrobras says YPFB was to hold only 4 per cent of the shares, a claim Bolivia strongly denies. President Sanchez de Lozada said last night that Bolivia wanted 49 per cent and that the project was a 'parity relationship'. Petrobras and BTB say a significant third-country shareholding will help raise finance for the project. Bolivia is also thought to want to renegotiate the price accord, signed in February last year. The Andean country now wants either a higher price for the gas or more consumption by Brazil. The original contract is to expire today, but is expected to be extended.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;We have added a new paragraph &sect;441.303(f)(10) to require States to continue to compute separately the costs and utilization of the component services that compose a HCFA-approved bundled service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Waiver of Comparability Requirement and Certain Income and Resource Eligibility Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Waiver of Comparability Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9411(c) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to limit the Medicaid State plan requirements under section 1902(a)(10) of the Act that may be waived under section 1915(c) to ``comparability'' of covered services under section 1902(a)(10)(B); that is, that covered services be equal in amount, duration, and scope for certain Medicaid recipients. Previously, all of section 1902(a)(10) of the Act could be waived by the Secretary if requested by States. By indicating that only section 1902(a)(10)(B) of the Act may be waived, the Congress narrowed the scope of this particular waiver option. Specifically, section 1902(a)(10)(B) of the Act requires that the medical assistance made available to any eligible categorically needy individual may not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other categorically needy individual, and may not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance made available to medically needy individuals. Consequently, a waiver of comparability affords the State an opportunity to target waivers to certain specific groups without providing those services to other groups. The amendment made by section 9411(c) is effective for waivers and renewals of waivers approved on or after October 21, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations implementing section 1902(a)(10)(B) are located at &sect;440.240.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we revised &sect;441.301(a)(2) to provide that, when applicable, a request for waiver of Medicaid requirements could include a waiver of sections 1902(a)(1) and (a)(10)(B) of the Act which concern ``statewide'' application of Medicaid and ``comparability of services.'' Prior to enactment of section 9411 of OBRA '86, a State could request and receive waivers of section 1902(a)(1) and 1902(a)(10) of the Act. A waiver of 1902(a)(10) included waiver of comparability as well as all other subsections in that section of the statute. Section 9411(c) of OBRA '86 limited the waiver authority to section 1902(a)(10)(B) or ``comparability of services''. Because of this limitation, a State could no longer apply rules for deeming of income and resources for institutionalized medically needy recipients to determine Medicaid eligibility of the waiver population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Medicaid Eligibility Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4118(a)(1) of OBRA '87 amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to allow States to waive section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) which contains rules for determining income and resource eligibility for the medically needy. This option allows States to use income and resource methods and standards, other than those that would ordinarily be used for medically needy individuals living in the community, provided that such rules do not conflict with other provisions of the Medicaid statute which States may not waive. That is, the option permits waiver of rules, such as deeming of income and resources, that are applied differently in the community than in an institution and are barriers to participation in a waiver program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When this provision was enacted, deeming was the primary barrier. Over time, this has changed. There are now other eligibility policies applied in an institutional setting that a State may wish to use instead of policies that would normally be used in the community. For example, under its waiver, a State may wish to apply to a home and community-based waiver recipient living with a spouse, the spousal impoverishment protection rules of section 1924 of the Act which would have applied to this recipient had the recipient been living in a medical institution. As a second example, for its home and community-based recipients, a State might use more liberal income or resource methods that the State has approved under section 1902(r)(2) of the Act for institutionalized individuals who are eligible under a special income level under &sect;435.231.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a State elects to use more liberal income rules under this waiver authority, it is still subject to the FFP limits on Medicaid expenditures for the medically needy under section 1903(f) of the Act, as interpreted under &sect;435.1007. These limits may not be waived. The FFP limit for the medically needy is 133 and 1/3 percent of the highest State's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) money payment for a family of the same size which has no income or resources. Because the legislative history explicitly states that the Congress intended that this waiver option permit States to use institutional deeming rules, we are interpreting the FFP limits at &sect;435.1007 to mean that the income used for purposes of determining if the FFP limits are met is income that would be used in the institutional setting. That is, only the waiver recipient's income would be used in calculating the FFP limits since spousal and parental income is not deemed to be available in an institution. This interpretation will be reflected in a revision to &sect;435.1007 in a separate rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

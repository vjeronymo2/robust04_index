			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Kuchma issues two decrees President Leonid Kuchma issued two decrees yesterday putting himself directly in charge of government and subordinating all local councils to the presidency, state television said, Reuter reports from Kiev. Under the first decree the president will define the government's basic direction and priorities and appoint and sack the heads of powerful state committees. Mr Vitaly Mosol will remain as prime minister. The move was explained in the decree as necessary to 'put into effect economic reforms and develop market relations'. The second decree subordinates the heads of Ukraine's 27 regional councils directly to the president. Lesser councils must then report to the regional councils. Earlier, Mr Kuchma issued the first of a planned series of decrees aimed at reforming the economy. Under it financial assistance to state enterprises, mostly in the form of loans, will be given only after they provide a business plan or restructuring programme.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Signal workers' chance to speak out: As RMT delegates meet this weekend, Robert Taylor looks at the executive's hardline stance Delegates representing the signal-worker members of the RMT transport union meet this weekend in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk - the first opportunity in the nearly three months of their dispute for rank-and-file signal workers to express a view. The annual conference will be held behind closed doors and has an advisory rather than decision-making role, but both RMT leaders and Railtrack management are anxiously awaiting its outcome. A union official said yesterday: 'It should give us a good idea of the mood among the men.' Railtrack was taking a cautious view. For many weeks the state-owned company responsible for administering the network's infrastructure has been running a 'hearts and minds' campaign among the signal workers urging them to persuade their leaders to return to the negotiating table. The company believes many signal workers agree with the results of a MORI poll published yesterday. The poll showed that 75 per cent of the public think the union should hold another ballot on strike action. It also believes, however, that few signal workers are willing to speak out openly at union branches or elsewhere for a return to negotiations. Behind the RMT leadership's show of unity attitudes are by no means so clear-cut. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, cannot dictate the tactics or strategy of the dispute. He is accountable for all his actions to the RMT executive council, which he attends but at which he has no vote. Mr Knapp is 'subject to suspension' by the executive if he is ever 'absent from duty' or responsible for 'gross neglect or incompetency'. His full-time officials are also responsible to the executive council. Day-to-day power in the union rests with the 21-strong executive council - which is to be reduced to 13 from January as the union contracts to save money in the face of dwindling membership and tight finances. The balance of political power on the executive is held by the left, although its majority changes. The executive is unique in the trade union movement in that it is full-time  -elected RMT members are seconded from their jobs to work in the union's London headquarters and are paid an annual allowance by the union, usually about Pounds 28,000. The signal workers have traditionally been a rather isolated section of the union with no substantial influence over policymaking. Only two members of the present executive are from signalling grades, although Mr Knapp has a signalling background. One of them - Mr John Tilley - heads the specially created six-strong strike committee that reports to the executive. The main internal differences on the RMT executive in the signal dispute have been over tactics and not strategy. The most decisive evidence of division came on July 14 when the executive defeated by 12 votes to six a proposal to concentrate on weekly one-day stoppages. The move was proposed by most of the strike committee, backed by Mr Knapp and Mr Vernon Hince, the union's chief negotiator. The eventual decision to widen the action - passed unanimously by the executive - was very close to the left's demands and both Mr Knapp and Mr Hince refused to approve it. Suggestions that the two have been overruled at least once by the executive's majority on the proposal of a compromise settlement to the dispute have been denied strongly. But RMT headquarters is an unhappy place. This weekend's conference may put pressure on the executive to change tack or at least reappraise its strategy. It is not wholly without importance. After all, last year it passed a motion calling for a strike ballot of signal workers if their long-standing grievances had not been resolved within six months.</p>

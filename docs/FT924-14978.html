			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Manufacturers see continued fall in west European car sales LEADING western carmakers warned yesterday that west European new car sales would fall in 1993 for the second successive year. German and French manufacturers are also moving quickly to raise prices in the Italian market in the wake of the heavy devaluation of the lira, despite concern over weakening demand. Volkswagen of Germany has raised its prices by around 5.5 per cent in Italy, while Renault is raising its by about 4 per cent. French and German carmakers appear to be delaying any immediate price increases in the UK despite the heavy fall in the value of the pound. With official car prices in the UK already heavily discounted, real price rises would be difficult to implement. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen, said yesterday that European exports would be complicated by the 'combination of unstable EC exchange rates, a weak dollar and the deliberately undervalued yen. As a result, unemployment is on the rise.' Political and economic factors were generating greater gloom in Europe. 'Looming elections, triumphant monetarism, structural problems in the UK and the determination to correct certain economic and financial imbalances in Spain and Italy are causing consumer spending and investment either to stagnate or decline,' Mr Calvet said. Mr Louis Hughes, president of General Motors Europe, forecast that west European new car sales would drop to 13.3m this year from 13.43m in 1991 and would be 'clearly under 13m' in 1993 'if present consumer uncertainty in some markets continues'. Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's automotive operations, warned that 'recent currency and interest rate fluctuations throughout Europe have created uncertainty and reduced consumer confidence.'</p>

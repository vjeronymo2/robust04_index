			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Brazilian states agree over debt ELEVEN of Brazil's 27 states signed an accord yesterday to restart repayment of up to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.3bn) owed to federal government agencies, in the first concrete step towards improving the Treasury's cashflow and balancing public accounts, writes Christina Lamb in Braslia. Under the accord, whose signatories include the biggest debtor states such as Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, the federal government has the right to suspend revenue transfers to the states if they miss debt repayments. The debt is to be restructured over 20 years with 240 monthly instalments. On signing, the states made a symbolic Dollars 38m payment to the National Savings Bank, to which they owe Dollars 9bn. However, for the accord to come into effect, Congress must approve enabling legislation in a vote due next week and the Senate must decide on the level of payments for each state. The federal government wants the states to pledge 11 per cent of receipts for debt payments. However, state governors insist they cannot commit more than 7 per cent. To get the accord the government had to give in to various demands by the states. It will assume much of the debt Rio state built up over its ill-fated metro project and discount money owed to the state power distribution companies by Eletrobras, the state holding company. The final amount to be repaid to the federal government may be nearer Dollars 11bn than the Dollars 20bn originally hoped for. Following the government victory on wage legislation, the signing of the debt accord is the second piece of good news in a week for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Azeri leader Geydar Aliyev is considering tough  measures little short of dissolving parliament and imposing  presidential rule to try to overcome the current political  crisis, presidential sources told INTERFAX.    INTERFAX Note: There has been a string of publications and  radio and television broadcasts in which calls were made, mainly  on behalf of Azeri refugees, for dissolving parliament and  clamping presidential rule in the country.    However, administration officials deny such a scenario of  events. Presidential spokesman Salakhaddin Guliyev told INTERFAX  that Aliyev had no intention of resorting to any drastic  decisions concerning parliament or the internal situation as a  whole in the near future.    Many say Aliyev seems to be favoring a more measured  approach  based on recommendations from government adviser Arif Ragimzade  for the time being. Ragimzade proposes that mandates be  withdrawn from radical opponents of the ruling regime including  former foreign minister Tofig Gasymov and one of the leaders of  the National Front Ibragim Ibragimli. Both of them were behind  a recent protest against the government decision to sign an  agreement on cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh during a meeting in  Bishkek. Opposition members say Speaker of Parliament Rasul  Giliyev's signature does in fact put a seal on recognizing the  enclave as a party in the conflict.    Gasymov and Ibragimli were both expelled from parliament by  a  majority vote late on Tuesday [31 May].    In a statement afterwards, Gasymov accused the government of  wanting to get rid of the opposition in parliament and the  society.    For his part, Ibragimli said that Azerbaijan was firmly on  course towards "dictatorship and a military-police regime"  predicting hard times ahead and inevitable social unrest.    Opposition experts predict the onset of authoritarian trends  in Aliyev's rule following the expulsion of his staunch  opponents from parliament. This view was also echoed by leader  of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov who described  the parliament's decision as destabilizing. He said "the  parliament's actions indicate that there are forces who want to  derail oil contracts with the West and help introduce Russian  troops into Azerbaijan."</p>

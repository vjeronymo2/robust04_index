			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (1): Survival of the fittest - Helped by a good mix of industry and commerce and by public sector investment, Leeds has weathered recession better than most large cities in Britain. Now the economy is stirring and recovery may have begun IT IS not quite true that Leeds is the English city the recession forgot, but at first glance it almost looks that way. There are tower cranes on the skyline, unemployment is 9 per cent and lower than the national average and house prices have slipped by less than 5 per cent. 'Of course recession has not passed us by,' says Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, chief executive of Leeds chamber of commerce and industry. 'We know from our resignations last year - 12 per cent of the membership - that more people than usual ceased trading. Normal turnover is about 6 to 8 per cent. 'Life is hard at the moment, but the good news is that so many have survived. We have a broad spread of industry, with many small and medium-sized businesses. That's been our saving grace. Long-term, things look extremely good.' Leeds certainly seems to have got off lightly. There has been more of a knock-on effect from a distressed outside world than internal pain. The reasons appear to be: the city's optimum size of about 700,000 people; population stability - unlike other northern cities, it is not struggling with declining local tax and spending bases; a heterogeneous industrial and commercial mix that allows different sectors to function counter-cyclically to each other or out of phase with the national economic cycle; its role as the financial and professional services capital of the east Pennines; flexibility of labour - for decades Leeds' sectoral spread has made it normal for people to switch between industries and learn new skills, establishing a change-accepting culture; its location on the M62 at the end of the M1, a pivotal point in northern England; the proximity of the Humber ports, the north's fast-growing gateway to European markets; the Leeds Initiative, a partnership of private and public sectors, has concentrated on improving stations, roads into the centre and corridors through it - fundamental developments which affect the look and feel of a city; a large injection of public spending in the form of inward investment. This last factor has been significant during the recession. In 1989 the government decided to relocate most of the departments of health and social security to Leeds. Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the Labour-controlled city council, puts the direct value of this at Pounds 60m of construction work to house the departments and 2,000 jobs. Indirect benefits include a growing demand for supporting services, from the highly professional to the mundane. All local markets - from office space to sandwich bars - will be boosted. Another area of large public sector spending is education. The city's two universities - Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan, the former polytechnic - are growing towards 17,000 students each and combined budgets of more than Pounds 200m. Prof Alan Wilson, vice-chancellor of Leeds University, is a geographer, so he can speak with authority on the impact. He puts the economic multiplier at between 2 and 2.5. This includes another major impact on the construction sector: the university has 6,000 units of student accommodation and needs to add 500 a year to cope with growth, a Pounds 5m annual capital commitment. Private sector arrivals in Leeds include British Telecom's mobile communications division, which is expanding to 767 full-time equivalent staff in the city this year. It moved north from Euston Tower two years ago, eliminating London weighting from salaries and reducing rents from Pounds 53 to Pounds 11 a sq ft. Mr Paul Pagliari, head of personnel, says the ease of access from Leeds to other parts of the country was another deciding factor, coupled with good labour markets and prospects - since realised - of lower staff turnover. Location was also considered crucial by Mr Ken Rigby, one of five general managers of Midland Bank, who last year moved out of London as part of Midland's campaign to devolve power and so rebuild relationships with customers. He now oversees all of the bank's northern operations from Leeds, which he chose in preference to Manchester, because 'it is right in the middle of my patch'. Seasoned observers find the relationships between banks and their business customers less strained than elsewhere - another indicator of lower levels of economic distress. 'Leeds has a wide commercial and industrial base and has withstood recession a lot better than the south of England,' says Mr Alastair Thompson of Barclays. 'We do have customers with problems, but by and large there are many well-managed businesses and we are happy with each other.' Yorkshire Bank, which is now Australian-owned but continues to enjoy a long tradition of local loyalty, claims 20 per cent of the market among small and medium-sized businesses. 'There will be casualties in the recovery,' says Mr David Knight, chief executive. 'Some companies which have got through the recession will have been too weakened by it to take advantage of any upturn, but we will try to help. But there are still a lot of good businesses around.' Nonetheless, London-based banking decisions have been seen as damaging by some Leeds companies. Bank of Scotland, which moved to Leeds in 1985 looking only for corporate business, has picked up several companies that have fallen out with their bankers. 'We had to be in Leeds because of the expansion of its professional community,' says Mr Austin Reilly, Bank of Scotland's regional director. 'Small or medium-sized owner- managed businesses are our target. Leeds has so many of them.' Mrs Andrea Ingham, of Leeds training and enterprise council, says there are more than 30,000 businesses in the city, of which 17,500 are VAT-registered. Of the latter, 47 per cent employ fewer than five people, but only 14 per cent more than 25. This provides a stable overall structure, but with many opportunities for local mergers and acquisitions. Deals did, however, slow almost to a stop in the recession. 'It became almost impossible to get senior debt,' says Mr David Buckley, who heads Ernst &amp; Young's corporate advisory services in Leeds. 'Some banks went out of the market. They won't admit it; but they did. They just turned everything down.' He says there is renewed activity now, with companies looking for acquisitions and willing to make decisions. 'We expect to see some companies cutting costs and declaring redundancies in the spring. But another tier have done a business plan for the next 12 months and are taking the first steps to doing something. 'We don't know when the recession is going to end but a lot of uncertainty has now gone away,' Mr Buckley adds. Some Leeds companies, such as Waddingtons, the high technology and security printers, have done particularly well despite recession, investing Pounds 96m in the last five years, while turnover has topped Pounds 200m a year. Its product range now runs from stamps to ultra-thin plastic margarine tubs. Another printer, Opax, a recent management buy-out from Norton Opax, expects to do well out of printing Britain's new lottery tickets. Mr Ian Bainbridge, managing director of Computer Services for Industry, says markets are now harder because companies will only buy products which add value or improve productivity. The 'nice-to-have-even- though-we-don't-really-need-it' extra sales of the late 1980s have evaporated. But export opportunities - accounting for a quarter of his output - are better after devaluation. Mr Richard France, of the surveyors Erdman Lewis, says there is a cautious optimism that was absent before Christmas. 'Confidence fell so low after Black Wednesday, it could not go lower. The only way after that was up. 'We might all have looked like tortoises to the hares in the south in the 1980s, but we now have a stability they do not and can plan for the future,' he adds.</p>

Juri Pihl, the director general of the Defense Police  Department, added that Estonia still needed "to keep an eye on  such people." He said this was necessary despite the fact that  the country's authorities knew of nothing Rozhok or his fellow  Russian Liberal Democratic Party supporters had done against  Estonia's national interests.    Rozhok a few days earlier told the press a branch of  Zhirinovsky's party existed in Estonia.    Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama has called the party's  alleged activity in Estonia illegal, because the branch  organization has not been formally registered with the country's  authorities. Kama said the activity of the Zhirinosky group in  Estonia should be investigated by the defense police.    Also President Lennart Meri in a speech recently said the  country's security police had to pay attention to the activity  of "some foreign political parties in Estonia."    Rozhok, a resident of the northeastern town of Narva, claims  his telephone is being tapped, but says he has had no direct  contacts with Estonian defense police officials so far.</p>

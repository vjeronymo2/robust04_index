			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER STUDENTS SPARK TO 'JUMP-START'  </P> <P> After years of desultory and limited remedial offerings that failed to turn on  students and teachers, new excitement is stirring in summer schools across San  Diego.  </P> <P> The 15 sixth- and seventh-graders in Donna Somerville's enrichment class at  Memorial Junior High School have talked with a space-station designer, went  behind the scenes at the zoo, used microscopes to explore the structure of  cells, and written dialogue for a play on Macintosh computers.  </P> <P> Somerville's students are among 350 scattered throughout nine elementary and  secondary schools in Southeast San Diego who are participating in a new magnet  enrichment program. The program is made possible through a federal, multi-year  grant awarded to the city school district.  </P> <P> The 33 or so first-graders assigned to Lois Jacobs' class at Field Elementary  in Clairemont for extra reading help don't know that they're part of a new  district effort to try to make remediation -- long the staple of summer school  instruction -- pay off better when the students return to classes this fall.  </P> <P> Jacobs and her aide, Kathy Tronerud, both from Fremont Elementary, are using  new literature books, "magic circle" groupings of children working with other  children, storyboard drawings and a host of other new curriculum offerings to  "jump-start" the academic performance of these students, all of whom have been  judged to be at risk of falling behind their peers even at their early age.  </P> <P> No longer are the several thousand elementary students who need more work in  basic skills being asked to use the same textbooks and teaching style that  proved lacking in getting them adequately prepared the first time.  </P> <P> To be sure, the innovations in the skills classes are happening largely at the  elementary level.  </P> <P> Junior- and senior-high students needing to repeat a course to make up a  failing grade still receive the same material during a concentrated four-hour,  six-week period that leaves creativity and changes in teaching styles up to the  individual teacher.  </P> <P> District educators believe that the changes already made -- as well as others  anticipated in the future -- can only improve long-term academics.  </P> <P> Duane Stevens, who oversees the regular summer school program for the San Diego  Unified School District, says that making summer school "fun" will increase  learning.  </P> <P> The element of fun is central to the enrichment classes, which are being  offered for the first time in almost a decade. Until this summer, parents  interested in having their children receive such instruction had only the  private Gateways program in University City as an option.  </P> <P> Program coordinator Carolanne Buguey said there are 350 students, about the  maximum allowed under the funding, about equally divided between elementary and  secondary levels. Any student at a magnet city school -- a school with special  curriculum designed to promote integration by attracting students from outside  the immediate neighborhood -- was eligible to apply. Most of the secondary  students who are participating signed up for a course to prepare for college  entrance examinations.  </P> <P> At Oak Park Elementary, teacher Peggy Araiza has organized her six-week program  around an "animal kingdom" theme, drawing in elements of science, literature,  writing and fine arts as a way to expose her 20 students to new ideas and  experiences, as well as strengthening their writing, reading and math skills.  </P> <P> Her aide, Monica Pernell, a Serra High School senior who is part of a  future-teachers program, said that the enrichment class is "a real eye opener.  These kids have so much going on that they don't have time to sit around and  talk."  </P> <P> Indeed, each day the students launch enthusiastically into a 10-minute chorus  of poems and songs, ranging from "Little Orphan Annie" by James Whitcomb Riley,  to the Gettysburg Address of Abraham Lincoln, and the "I Have a Dream" speech  of Martin Luther King Jr., as soon as they finish the morning Pledge of  Allegiance.  </P> <P> "All the students have varied interests and you have to stay on top of each  individual child" to get the maximum result, Araiza said. "For some, you have  to prepare them for enrichment, dangle a lot of carrots in front of them, like  the chance to do calligraphy, to pick out a special book, and by doing so,  boost their attitudes so that they'll then sit down with their times  (multiplication) tables and work on that as well.  </P> <P> "It's very important (at this age) because many are getting ready for middle  school . . . I want to have as much impact on their lives as possible, to give  them as many tools for leaning as possible."  </P> <P> Memorial's Somerville had her students preparing reports on animals last week  in anticipation of their visit to the zoo. Each read their report orally in  front of a video camera as preparation for performing a play in front of an  audience later in the course.  </P> <P> "I want them to bond, to have better self-esteem, to have positive peer  pressure for achievement, to make this summer count so that it will make a  difference in their lives," said Somerville, a resource teacher during the  regular year at Memorial, an oasis of learning in the midst of one of the  toughest barrios in San Diego.  </P> <P> Somerville worries that some of the students could eventually succumb to the  barrio pressure to not do well in school, especially as they move into the  secondary years.  </P> <P> But for the moment, she is exhilarated about the summer class.  </P> <P> In general, while the enrichment classes have no more than 20 students, the  regular summer classes can range from 25 students to almost 40, making the  "jump start" effort of teachers even more difficult because it limits the  personal attention they can give students.  </P> <P> But Stevens hopes that the new literature-based curriculum written especially  for summer-school use and which emphasizes hands-on learning, will address more  of the problem.  </P> <P> "We thought that if we did something different to promote fun, not fun and  games, but excitement about learning, we might short-circuit some of the  failure syndrome that these kids otherwise get into," said Pat Meredith, a  resource teacher who helped write some of the summer-school literature lessons.  </P> <P> "It's not easy. We realize that there are skills these children need and they  haven't learned them well enough the first time."  </P> <P> Jacobs would readily agree.  </P> <P> Considered one of the district's stellar teachers, Jacobs sometimes feels she  has moved mountains at the end of the four-hour summer instructional day.  </P> <P> Many of the students still struggle to read basic sentences, and their previous  lack of success leads quickly into short attention spans and horseplay as  Jacobs cajoles them to think about "Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile," the book they are  reading together.  </P> <P> She has the students talk together about crocodiles, to write a word or two  about their own feelings toward the animal, to play around with paper strips of  sentences to try to arrange them in the order of a story.  </P> <P> "It's sad because for some of these kids, learning has no meaning and school is  anything but fun," said Tronerud, Jacobs' aide. "Some of these kids already  feel they are failures, but they don't have to be."  </P> <P> To help turn around their attitudes, Jacobs cooks for the students each Friday,  showing them how to use their arithmetic to measure weights and liquids in  making brownies or fruit cocktails or homemade ice cream.  </P> <P> "I think that they are picking up some vocabulary," Jacobs said. "The new  (literature) curriculum has made a difference" compared to controlled-word  reading texts traditionally used in the district.  </P> <P> The new curriculum, which emphasizes writing and literature discussions  especially at the upper elementary grades, has made Sheila Barron's task much  easier with her fourth- and fifth-graders at Lee Elementary in Paradise Hills.  </P> <P> "We have a big library, we have bought a lot of new books, we are working to  get kids to see reading not as a task but as a joy," Barron said. To that end,  she constantly throws out ideas and observations to the students, asking them  to think about how they might change the plot, encouraging them to write a  letter to one of the story's characters, to speculate on where the next  chapters of the novel might take the plot.  </P> <P> "I think the student seem to be more interested" than they are in the  traditional textbooks, Barron said. "There actually does seem to be a lot of  thinking and listening going on."  </P></p>

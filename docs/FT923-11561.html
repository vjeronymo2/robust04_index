			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Perot sees US on edge of depression MR ROSS PEROT is warning that the US 'is on the edge of a severe recession or depression', avoidable only by adoption of tough measures as soon as possible. In his first newspaper interview, with the Los Angeles Times, since dropping his undeclared presidential candidacy a week ago, the Texas billionaire promised to keep speaking out, trying to make those seeking public office face up to economic realities. His own economic revitalisation proposals would be published perhaps next week. These are known to include a five-year plan to balance the budget by combining sharp rises in consumption taxes and steep cuts in federal subsidies and entitlements, including social security. Mr Perot painted a dire picture of prospects for the US, unless decisive action were taken. 'If we have an economic catastrophe, tens of millions of ordinary people, of the type that signed petitions (to get his name on the election ballot) will be devastated. It will probably take us 20 years to recover.' He foresaw the complete collapse of the financial establishment, with banks and mortgage finance companies all going under. 'Then, if huge numbers of people are out of work, huge numbers will lose their homes and all the federally guaranteed home mortgages will kick in and that will have to be paid for, when people don't have work and the tax base is deteriorating.' Mr Perot has been criticised for abruptly withdrawing from the presidential race, though given credit for speaking out, albeit without supplying details, on economic policy. He had found the political process 'brutal, brutal, brutal and intrusive'. He sympathised with the ordeal already faced by Governor Bill Clinton, his wife and daughter. 'Are we so involved in a game that we've lost sight of what's good for our country?'</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Money supply cap raised in Brazil Brazil has been forced to increase its money supply limits, imposed in July as part of the launch of the country's new currency, the Real. The limits, designed to stem inflation by curbing the government's ability to print money, are being lifted to a total of RDollars 9bn (Pounds 6.5bn) by the end of next month, instead of RDollars 7.5bn. Mr Rubens Ricupero, finance minister, denied money supply was growing too quickly or that the increase threatened to stoke inflation. Instead, he and private sector analysts pointed out it was difficult to estimate money supply growth following a new currency's launch. Before the Real, when inflation reached 50 per cent a month, people invested or spent money rather than hold cash, which lost purchasing power daily. With the new currency, inflation has fallen to under 5 per cent a month and consumers seem to be holding more wealth as cash, leading to demand for bank notes and coins. 'The basic reasons (for the increased limits) are to do with the demand on the part of people for more money,' said Mr Ricupero. 'This reflects confidence in the new currency.' The government originally planned to reach the RDollars 9bn figure for the total money stock in April. Some analysts caution that any further increase in the money supply limits could lead to doubts about the Real's longer term stability.</p>

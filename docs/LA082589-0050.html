			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Billionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley had trouble differentiating between the tax  status of her husband's real estate empire and the couple's $11-million estate,  her defense lawyer said in closing arguments in Manhattan federal court.  Helmsley, 69, is accused of billing $4 million worth of renovations at the  couple's mansion in Connecticut as business expenses in order to evade $1  million in taxes. Harry Helmsley, her 80-year old real estate magnate husband,  also was charged but was severed from the trial after a series of strokes left  him with a loss of memory.  </P></p>

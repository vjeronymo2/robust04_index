			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Citicorp launches Dollars 1.33bn, five-year floating rate note issue CITICORP yesterday joined the ranks of borrowers offering floating rate notes in the international bond market, launching a Dollars 1.33bn issue backed by credit card debt. However, in contrast to the Dollars 6bn 'collared' floating rate notes issued in recent weeks, yesterday's deal carries no upper limit on the interest rate paid to investors. The issue, lead-manged by Goldman Sachs, was the first floating rate note deal by Citicorp under its global bond programme. The notes were issued by Standard Credit Card Master Trust 1, a special-purpose vehicle used to fund the bank's extensive credit card operation. The five-year paper pays 30 basis points more than three-month dollar London interbank offered rate (Libor) and was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.865. At this level the discounted margin is 33 basis points over Libor. Participants said the majority of the deal was sold to US institutional investors. But the lead manager said around Dollars 300m bonds were bought by European institutions. Elsewhere, the market struggled to absorb the latest batch of collared FRN issues. Dealers said that future issues may have to offer improved terms. Floating rate note issues by top-rated borrowers such as Austria and Rabobank this week have capped the interest rate payable to investors at 8 1/4 per cent. Until this month, caps of 9 per cent or more were common for borrowers of similar credit quality. However, with European bond markets in turmoil and US interest rates close to cyclical trough, borrowers hungry for funding have few alternatives but to tap the dollar floating rate sector. Yesterday, Bank Austria, the triple-A rated financial institution, launched a Dollars 150m fixed-rate issue lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation. The lead manager said the four-year bonds, priced to yield 40 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, appealed to continental European investors, including many private individuals, unwilling to buy floating rate instruments. But the small size of the deal underlined that appetite for fixed rate dollar paper remains limited. In addition, the decision by Spain to raise the yield on its Dollars 1.5bn fixed rate issue on Tuesday, in response to turbulent market conditions, has made underwriting firms wary of bringing substantial fixed-rate issues. Earlier fixed rate deals from the European Investment Bank and AB Spintab were postponed.</p>

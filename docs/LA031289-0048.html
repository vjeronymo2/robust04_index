			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: A GROWING THREAT FROM PEER PRESSURE  </P> <P> It is with great pride I tell you that I can still be shocked. It's not easy in  today's world, where guns are shot and no one flinches, and children are fought  over and no one cries.  </P> <P> I was shocked the other day by a survey that said by the age of 13, boys who  had never had a sexual experience were in the minority, and sexually  inexperienced girls were in the minority by age 15. By the time children  entered high school, 55% of them had engaged in sex. I'm not going to pull the  old chestnut, "In my day, at that age, I still had a doll on my bed and was  picking broccoli out of my braces." This is not "my day,' and times have  changed. But peer pressure hasn't changed in 200 years.  </P> <P> Peer pressure is a force to be dealt with. It's bigger than we are -- stronger  than we are. It supersedes the love of our mothers, the threats of our fathers,  the wisdom of our grandparents and even the strength of our own convictions. It  makes a knee hanging out of a rip in your jeans all right. It makes skipping  school cool. It makes drinking, taking drugs and sleeping around acceptable.  It's not important what you do . . . just so long as everyone else is doing it  with you.  </P> <P> What's unique about peer pressure is that every generation believes they  invented it. It's brand-new, and they are the first ones to deal with it.  </P> <P> Kids have been dealing with it since "The Scarlet Letter," when I suspect  Hester's mother told her daughter, "You fool around and you'll end up wearing a  piece of costume jewelry that does not stand for Academic Achievement."  </P> <P> My parents fought peer pressure with dire predictions. If you had sex before  you were married, you went blind, your skin broke out and you glowed in the  dark. If you broke the curfew or wrecked the car, you were a dead person. If  you smoked a cigarette, you couldn't come out of your room until your wedding  day.  </P> <P> My generation of parents spawned yet another approach: the Compromise Two-Step.  All the other parents were dancing to it, so we too gave in to some peer  pressure. We were relieved to know our kids were smoking only cigarettes, not  pot. Our son was living with someone . . . thank God it was a girl. Our  children were engaging in sex, but at least they were prepared. They weren't  studying, but at least they were still living at home.  </P> <P> We are in the throes of a new approach to peer pressure -- "Just Say No!"  Putting those three little words up against peer pressure is like Pee-wee  Herman facing off with Ted Koppel. How can kids say no when parents can barely  say it?  </P> <P> How about, "Be Prepared to Live With Yes!"? Drugs will personally screw up your  present and your future genetically. Sex in high school is what fills out a  graduation gown, if you're lucky enough to graduate or escape disease. If you  begin to "prove" your masculinity/femininity, love, loyalty and independence,  when does it stop?  </P> <P> Peer pressure carries one of the highest price tags around. Parents and kids  alike must ask themselves, "Can we afford it?"  </P></p>

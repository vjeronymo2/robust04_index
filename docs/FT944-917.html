			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International airport for Moi's home town: Project draws criticism over priorities Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi's home town - Eldoret, population 112,000 - is to get an international airport, built by a Canadian company at a cost of KS3.7bn (Dollars 84m). Eldoret, a sleepy market town surrounded by maize fields in the Rift Valley, already boasts a university (named after Mr Moi). Its international airport will be the third largest in Kenya, after Nairobi and Mombasa. SNC-Lavalin-Group of Montreal says it expects to begin work on the two-year project on January 5. 'The work includes construction of a 3.5km runway suitable for aircraft such as the Airbus A-310, a 2,400 sq m terminal and a 33 metre-high control tower,' the company says. 'SNC-Lavalin will also construct ancillary buildings and a freight warehouse with a refrigerated section.' Eldoret does not figure on Kenya's tourist circuit, nor is it well known as a hub of economic activity. But the town has been blessed with good communications and some of the best roads in the country, because it lies at the heart of Kalenjin country, President Moi's tribal homeland. News of Eldoret's new airport has caused an outcry in Kenya. Its cost is equal to about half the health ministry's annual budget, and some Kenyans question the government's spending priorities at a time of fiscal austerity demanded by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 'The airport does not make a shred of economic sense,' Mr Robert Shaw, a private Kenyan economist and critic of the government, said yesterday. He believes the money would be better spent on improving Mombasa's primitive airport, which handles tens of thousands of tourists each year, or on rebuilding the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, the country's most important economic artery. Traffic on the road ground to a halt this week after heavy rains washed out an entire section of the route. Ms Christine Wong, of the Canadian High Commission, said yesterday the project would not be funded with Canadian aid. 'The contract was negotiated between a private Canadian company and the Kenyan government. The Canadian government was not involved,' she added.</p>

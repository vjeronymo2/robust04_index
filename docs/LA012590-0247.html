			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: SHE'LL TAKE A MAN WHO DOES THOSE NICE LITTLE THINGS  </P> <P> Question: Some time ago you asked women to write in and tell you why they need  men. A woman had written that she could have orgasms alone, simply by  fantasizing, so who needs men? Well, I do, and for a lot of reasons unrelated  to sex or orgasms.  </P> <P> I need a man who does all the little caring things like making the bed when I  have a deadline to make, watering the plants when I forget, having a fire ready  on the hearth every winter night, buying groceries, helping with dinner, doing  dishes, taking me out for dinner and dancing, enjoying movies and TV with me --  and all this done not because it is expected but just because he wants to,  expecting nothing in return.  </P> <P> I am a great cook and we do the big number in the king-size bed together, too.  But all those other unasked-for things are what you get from a real, solid,  real-life man. Fantasy men never do those little things that mean so much. Why  do women need men? To love and be loved by.  </P> <P> Answer: Thank you for writing, and congratulations.  </P> <P> Let me say, I do know men like that, and they are not just something women  yearn for. Also, I have known men who learned to act like that and didn't start  out that way -- and their improved act was really appreciated.  </P> <P> Q: Am I the only living human being who does not feel any need for  self-gratification?  </P> <P> A: No. I have encountered lots of people who never think of it. You go on in  your letter to say that you have had 20 lovers and that you have no trouble  with orgasms. Also that you can go a long time without sex and not feel  deprived. In the course of my practice as a sex therapist, I have had a number  of clients with experiences like yours, and I do not consider them to be  anywhere but in the sexual mainstream. However, in the present era, anyone who  has had 20 lovers would be wise to be tested for sexually transmitted disease,  including AIDS. And avoid promiscuity in the future.  </P> <P> I have to tell you this because it obviously is not on your mind. And in this  era it has to be.  </P> <P> I don't say no one can have sex anymore, or no one can have terrific sex  anymore. I say you can be wise and have a wonderful life.  </P></p>

Trade  and economic ties between Vietnam and ASEAN countries have  rapidly increased. In 1992, two-way trade between Vietnam and  the Indonesia reached $220 million. It was $158 million with  Thailand, $100 million with Malaysia, $1.2 billion with  Singapore, and $50 million with the Philippines.    By the end of 1993, about 100 projects for ASEAN countries  with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were  licensed in Vietnam. ASEAN investment in Vietnam has increased  10 times as against 1990, now accounting for 10 percent of the  total foreign investment in Vietnam. More than 30 agreements on  economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit,  aviation, and navigation have been signed between ASEAN  countries and Vietnam.    In late July last year, the State Committee for Foreign  Investment of Vietnam signed an agreement of cooperation with a  prime company of Brunei which will see the latter invests in  major projects in Vietnam. In late 1991 and early 1992, the  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN  member countries. This helped the region to have a better  understanding about the current reform in this country.    In visiting Vietnam, all leaders of ASEAN member countries  demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties Vietnam  has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the  Vietnamese in national development.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai of Thailand is committed to  create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation  between Vietnam and his country. President Fidel Ramos of the  Philippines has assured Vietnamese National Assembly chairman  Nong Duc Manh that the Philippines has always been Vietnam's  friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further  developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of  ASEAN member countries.    Most recently, during his visit to Vietnam, the ASEAN  secretary general, Mr. Ajit Singh, informed Vietnam of the  decision by ASEAN Secretariat to allow Vietnam to participate  and observe in various programs in science, technology,  environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and  development sources. Mr. Ajit Singh said the secretariat will  send senior officials to Vietnam to exchange views on concrete  issues of ASEAN's concern.    These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided  cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries has been  increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held  in Singapore by ASEAN, ASEAN countries appreciated Vietnam's  achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed Vietnam's  participation in a forum on regional security. Relations  between Vietnam and ASEAN has created a new atmosphere in  Southeast Asia.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed once declared that  he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and  economic development in Indochina, with the confidence that  Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia would be stable and developed. It  would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the  region.</p>

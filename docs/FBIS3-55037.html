			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Belykh report: "Four Hundred Years in Jail for </F> Defrauding `Rosugol'"]    [Text] A federal court in Oklahoma has found the American  lawyer David Branson guilty of defrauding the Russian Government  to the tune of $1.3 million. The fraudster, convicted on 50  counts, faces a 400-year jail sentence.  <H5>  The Bricklayer Lawyer </H5>   In our country the best of intentions usually end in major  scandals, court cases, and monstrous losses. But the "Ugol  Rossii" Corporation (successor to the "Rosugol" state company)  could hardly have imagined in its worst nightmare that its quite  innocent desire to have two brick plants in Moscow Oblast's  Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon would suddenly be transformed into a  court case in what was, for it, the hitherto unknown Oklahoma  City and that it would have to appear as the injured party.    The idea was indeed to build these ill-starred plants to  help  miners in the Arctic who had been pensioned off. Arriving in  warm Serebryanyye Prudy from the cold north, they would get a  job at these plants and then receive housing built from bricks  made with their own hands. It was decided to buy all the  necessary equipment abroad. The tenders from major European and  American firms were rejected at the outset as too expensive.  Then the Oklahoma lawyer David Branson popped up from out of  the blue.    It is still a mystery as to who put the fraudster lawyer in  touch with the "Ugol Rossii" leadership and how he was able to  captivate the management. After all, until that time Branson  had, by all accounts, only a rather vague idea about the brick  manufacturing process, and his firm -- Consolidated Service  Corporation, which, according to him, had received the  prestigious "E" award from the U.S. Department of Commerce --  was only registered after signing the contract with our Russian  businessmen.    On the other hand, the lawyer promised to build the two  brick  plants in Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon for just $4.395 billion [as  published]. In order to appear more convincing, he organized  several trips for "Rosugol" representatives to the United States  and South Africa, where, in an atmosphere of easygoing service,  he took the tourists to visit other firms' plants producing  brickmaking equipment, and passed them off as his own. The  Russian officials' hearts melted, the contract was signed, and  Branson was paid $1.3 million as an advance against future  deliveries. The owner of Consolidated Service Corporation did  not need any particular creativity to spend of the money. He  vacationed in Hawaii and bought a fully furnished house and nine  collector's-item automobiles. Another $100,000 went on  dispatching several tie rods to the Moscow region....    Admittedly, "Rosugol" suspected that something was amiss  but,  fearing a scandal, preferred to extend the dubious contract in  the hope of at least getting something more out of America.  Unfortunately, it hoped in vain. Who knows how long all this  would have gone on had the scandal not broken in the United  States.  <H5>  Overdoing Things By 400 Years </H5>   Initially local businessmen asked questions. In fobbing off  our naive compatriots, Branson had overdone things somewhat. He  produced exclusively for the Russian market an advertising  brochure on his firm with beautiful photographs of other plants,  calling them the property of Consolidated Service Corporation.  The amazement of the real owners, when they found out about  this document, knew no bounds. And the U.S. Internal Revenue  Service also took an interest in the lawyer's spending. As a  result, David Branson was arrested, and the U.S. Justice  Department appealed through the Russian General Prosecutor's  Office to the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] Investigations Committee for help in investigating the  case, which in principle affected us more than the Americans.    Nikolay Psyrkov, an investigator with the Administration  for the Investigation of Particularly Important Cases, did all  that his U.S. colleagues needed -- he questioned witnesses and  participants in the events and visited the empty site in  Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon which had been carefully prepared for  the construction of the plants promised by the lawyer. Then,  taking with him as the main victim Valeriy Zaydenvark, deputy  general director of "Rosugol," traveled to Oklahoma to take part  in the trial. The Russian investigator's professional job and  the deputy general director's sorry story made an indelible  impression on the Oklahoma jury. David Branson was found guilty  on 50 counts. In January he faces a total of 400 years'  imprisonment. Following the confiscation and sale of the  brickmaker lawyer's property, Russia should get back around  $400,000 of the $1.3 million it lost in advance payments.    The Americans will be getting something too -- help from the  Russian Federation MVD's Investigations Committee in  investigating an affair that has cost the U.S. medical insurance  system $1 billion....  <H5>  Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, or a Personal Magnet </H5>   It would be naive to imagine that our emergent homegrown  version of capitalism would suffer from intrigues by foreign  adventurists without retaliating. Former Soviet citizens who  now have the world as their oyster have been making money in the  most unexpected situations with an inventiveness hard for  Westerners to grasp. One such situation perpetrated a cynical  and outrageous crime against the much-vaunted U.S. medical  insurance system.    The leaders of the sinister operation were three natives of  the former Soviet Union. The leader was Mikhail Smushkevichus  -- aka Moss, aka Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, aka Ivan Pavlov  Sanchez -- and his two henchmen Michael (Mikhail Grigoryevich)  Fayman and Feliks Kolgovskiy. In their former homeland they  were known as the organizers of a firm to provide Soviet  citizens with jobs abroad. Attractive employers' "contracts"  were sold all over at the time. As a result, none of the  500,000 people who took the tempting bait actually went abroad  -- but Jacobo Martinez Greenberg did, along with his "comrades"  and the startup capital for his next business.    Basing themselves in Los Angeles, they set up a network of  mobile diagnostic centers and around 300 bogus companies, and  opened a huge number of accounts. This entire armada was  targeted against the U.S. medical insurance system. The actual  ins and outs of the affair are relatively complicated, and we  will not go into them. But the results were stunning. The  swindlers earned more than $50 million in pure profit, and the  damage they have done is estimated at $1 billion.    Today they are all under investigation, and each faces a  total of up to 1,500 years in jail. Nobody knows where the  stolen millions are, but the Americans believe them to be in  Russia or Lithuania.  <H5>  No Money Without a Treaty </H5>   Nikolay Psyrkov, the investigator with the Russian MVD  Investigations Committee's Administration for the Investigation  of Particularly Important Cases, to whom we spoke on his return  from the United States, pointed to his office safe:    "There are several files in there, files on the embezzlement  of $33 million, $10 million, and one for $50 million. There is  a pretty standard operating procedure. Someone does the job,  the money is put in foreign banks, and they leave the country.  And in each case it is virtually impossible to get the stolen  money back to Russia or to bring the fraudster himself to  trial...."    Unfortunately, the success in investigating the Branson and  Smushkevichus-Greenberg affairs was possible only thanks to the  personal ties between Russian and American investigators and  so-called cooperation by agreement -- under the "you scratch our  back" principle. In a number of other cases this simply does  not apply. Strangely enough, we have concluded treaties on  legal help in investigating criminal cases with just 17  countries, mainly in the former socialist camp. No documents  have yet been signed with the main countries where our economic  refugees usually hide and where our criminal structures keep  their capital -- the United States, Austria, and Britain. In  this situation it is impossible to track movements of stolen  money through bank accounts, spending, or the sources of  criminal financial operations; consequently, it is also  impossible to prove that crimes have been committed....    Today all requests for help on specific criminal cases in  the United States, for instance, have a long, hard route to  travel -- from the MVD Investigations Committee to the General  Prosecutor's Office to the Foreign Ministry to the embassy to  the U.S. Justice Department; three or four months are quite  enough for criminals to hide money and go into hiding  themselves. The same thing happens in reverse too. Suffice it  to say that our investigators received the request for help on  the Branson case directly. The official request only arrived  through the usual channels when Nikolay Psyrkov, having done  everything necessary, was setting off for the trial in Oklahoma.    But even personal contacts will not save us. The gaps in  criminal legislation are too big. How can we explain to Western  colleagues that someone is under investigation for suspicion of  what is still called "embezzlement of socialist property?" Or  that he has been charged under Article 147 of the Russian  Criminal Code with "fraud," which the Americans break down into  20 separate crimes? Nor are things clear regarding the return  of stolen property from abroad. When it is simply a matter of  money, everything is more or less understandable, but when that  money has been invested in shares, land, or real estate the  waters are much muddier.    I was told at the Investigations Committee that they  themselves had tried to clarify why treaties on legal assistance  in criminal cases are taking so long to conclude. They had  found themselves in a Bermuda Triangle among the Foreign  Ministry, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Justice  Department. Nobody in these three departments was able to say  anything convincing -- they just sent you on to the next one.  And that was the end of the matter. Yet, while officials are  thrashing things out, the land of democratic reforms is simply a  paradise for both Russian and foreign fraudsters. The main  thing is to get out of the country with your loot in time. Once  out, you can take things easy.</p>

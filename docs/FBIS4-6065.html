			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- A fourth straight gain by  Japan's trade surplus in March boosted the politically sensitive  figure 10.0 percent for fiscal 1993 to a record 121.99 billion  dollars, the Finance Ministry said Monday [18 April].    The strong yen boosted the value of exports in closely  watched dollar terms, widening the surplus even as the imbalance  narrowed in terms of yen for the month and the fiscal year, a  ministry official said in explaining the preliminary report.    For March, the merchandise trade surplus expanded 4.2  percent  on a customs-cleared basis from the same month a year before to  13,952 million dollars.    The black ink with the United States swelled 21.1 percent in  March to 4.96 billion dollars, after a decline in February from  the year-earlier level. For the fiscal year ended March 31, the  surplus rose for the third year in a row, up 11.8 percent to  51.14 billion dollars.    But that regional surplus was exceeded for the first time by  the fiscal year surplus with Asia, where booming regional  economies sucked up a markedly bigger chunk of Japan's exports,  the official said.    Overall, both imports and exports of semiconductors surged  in  the month. Exports of audio equipment declined and auto  exports, although up sharply to the U.S., fell overall.    Imports of crude oil and petroleum products sank in dollar  and yen terms as prices fell, even though volume edged higher.  Imports of computers and other office equipment rose, however.    The Japanese currency was up 12.2 percent in March from a  year before to an average 105.07 yen to the dollar and up 15.7  percent for the fiscal year to 108.17 yen, the official said.    The higher yen continues to inflate Japan's surplus in  dollar  terms, although theoretically it eventually curbs the surplus by  hiking Japanese export prices in foreign currencies while making  imports cheaper in yen.    In yen terms, the trade surplus fell 7.0 percent in March  from a year before to 1,467 billion yen and declined 4.7 percent  for the fiscal year to 13,175 billion yen.    Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito noted that the yen-based  surplus fell for a third straight fiscal year.    In volume terms, Japan's surplus "is clearly declining," he  told a regular news conference after the report was issued. The  rise in the dollar-denominated surplus was mainly caused by the  "price factor" -- the effect of the high yen -- Saito said.    He indicated he sees no reason for new measures to boost  Japan's domestic demand, a key request from Washington,  expressing hope that the fiscal 1994 budget and recent fiscal  stimulus packages will spur domestic demand. But he  acknowledged that budget debate, hamstrung by political turmoil,  has not begun.    Japan's March surplus with the U.S. rose as exports climbed  12.6 percent in dollar terms from a year before, outstripping a  6.1 percent rise in imports.    Exports of autos to the recovering U.S. economy were up 14  percent while semiconductor exports jumped 34 percent, the  report said. But exports of audio equipment sank 22 percent.    Japan's U.S. imports included a 65 percent jump for meat and  a 33 percent rise in alcoholic beverages. Even among  high-value-added products, imports of U.S. autos soared 43  percent and those of semiconductors climbed 14 percent.    Such figures show "a significant change in the structure of  trade" between the world's two biggest economies, said Mineko  Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. But  the dollar-denominated surplus will remain high for some time,  she said.    Japan's surplus with Asia rose 11.3 percent in March from a  year before in the 23rd straight gain to 6.53 billion dollars.  That helped send the fiscal year surplus up a thumping 25.1  percent to 55.95 billion dollars to exceed the imbalance with  the U.S. for the first time ever, the Finance Ministry's  official told reporters.    The surplus to the region's newly industrializing economies  has exceeded that with the U.S. since fiscal 1991, but rising  exports to such other Asian nations as Pakistan and India sent  the regional total markedly higher, he said.    Japan's trade gap with the European Union, however, slimmed  21.0 percent in March to 2.27 billion dollars in the third  straight monthly drop. For the fiscal year, the surplus slumped  21.8 percent to 24.25 billion dollars.</p>

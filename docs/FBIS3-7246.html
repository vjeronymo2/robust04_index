			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Information has circulated among people familiar  with Japanese-North Korean relations that "a promising oil  field" has been discovered in the eastern sea, east of the  Korean peninsula. However, the Japanese Government and  industries concerned are uncertain whether it is true. Also,  details, such as the exact location of the oil field and the  amount of oil deposits, are unknown.    A government source said that in light of the facts that the  world has increased its suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear  development program and that relations between the DPRK and the  international community remain strained, "this could be a part  of North Korea's information manipulation aimed at dispelling  domestic concern over possible economic sanctions by the United  Nations."    An influential source, who met with North Korean officials  between last yearend and early this year, said he was told that  the DPRK "discovered an oil field" and that Pyongyang planned to  designate the area as a "special economic zone" and would  welcome Western nations' cooperation in developing the oil  field. Another source said the information on the discovery of  the oil field has circulated in various parts of the DPRK.    It is said that the DPRK began oil exploitation in Hungnam  district in the eastern sea around 1986. It is thought that  because Russia has discontinued its aid to the DPRK, and because  China, which is DPRK's most friendly nation, has called on  Pyongyang to buy oil at internationally traded prices, Pyongyang  has keenly felt the need to develop energy sources on its own.    About a year ago, information circulated that the evidence  of  an oil field was discovered in the waters off the east of the  Korean peninsula. It is said that a Japanese company was asked  to cooperate in digging out the oil field. However, the matter  reportedly ended in smoke later on.    Sources concerned pointed out that the recent information on  the "discovery of an oil field" could be "propaganda to uplift  the spirit of the North Korean people" in view of the fact that  it has circulated when suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear  development program is increasing.    The Japanese Government has taken a cautious attitude on  this  issue. The Natural Resources and Energy Agency said: "We have  not confirmed that the information is true." Also, on  cooperation by Japanese firms in developing the oil field, a  Foreign Ministry source said: "It is impossible at present for  the government to join in such cooperation."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Ministry of Interior in Sanaa; date not </F> given]    [Text] A security source at the Ministry of Interior has  explained that the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 20 for  1994 on declaring a state of emergency in the country have  nothing to do with banning the manifestations of normal daily  life in the capital and other cities in the Republic. Various  daily activities as well as commercial and production activities  are taking place normally.    The source said a state of emergency was declared in the  country in view of the need to entrench security and stability  and to safeguard citizens' security and safety in this crucial  phase the country is passing through. Thus, the Ministry of  Interior appeals to the brother citizens to observe the  following:    1. Not to carry weapons throughout the Republic's  governorates, even if their carriage is licensed, and also not  to open fire regardless of justification.    2. Not to hold any meetings, gatherings, crowds,  demonstrations, or similar things.    3. Not to carry out any acts aimed at looting or  encroaching on public and private properties.    4. To refrain from moving inside the capitals of the  governorates from 2100 to 0500.    The ministry hopes all brother citizens will abide by what  is  mentioned above and cooperate with the security organizations to  achieve the public interest and entrench the homeland's security  and stability in general.</p>

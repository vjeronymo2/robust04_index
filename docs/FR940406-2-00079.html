Program Beneficiaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects proposed for funding under this Announcement must result in direct benefits targeted toward low-income people as defined in the most recent Annual Update of Poverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS. Attachment A to this Announcement is an excerpt from the most recently published guidelines. Annual revisions of these guidelines are normally published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in February or early March of each year and are applicable to projects being implemented at the time of publication. Grantees will be required to apply the most recent guidelines throughout the project period. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may be obtained from public libraries, Congressional offices, or by writing the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. No other government agency or privately defined poverty guidelines are applicable to the determination of low-income eligibility for this OCS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Number of Projects in Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application may contain only one project and this project must address the basic criteria found in Part C. Applications which are not in compliance with these requirements will be ineligible for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Multiple Submittals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted as long as each application contains a proposal for a different project. However, no applicant can receive more than one grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Sub-Contracting or Delegating Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCS will not fund any project where the role of the eligible applicant is primarily to serve as a conduit for funds to other organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part C_Program Priority Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General Projects_FN  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application should include a description of the target area and population to be served as well as a discussion of the nature and extent of the problem to be solved. The application must contain a detailed and specific work program that is both sound and feasible. Projects funded under this Announcement must produce permanent and measurable results that fulfill the purposes of this program as described in the above. The OCS grant funds, in combination with private and/or other public resources, must be targeted to low-income individuals and communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will certify in their submission that projects will only serve the low-income population as stipulated in the DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines (Attachment A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to comply with the cited Act may result in the application being ineligible for consideration for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, it must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it has complied with the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as to whether the property is listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, applicant should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. The applicant should contact OCS early in the development of its application for instructions regarding compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services. In the case of projects proposed for funding which mobilize or improve the coordination of existing public and private food assistance resources, the guidelines governing those resources apply. However, in the case of projects providing direct assistance to beneficiaries through grants funded under this program, beneficiaries must fall within the official DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines as set forth in Attachment A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications which propose the use of grant funds for the development of any printed or visual materials must contain convincing evidence that these materials are not available from other sources. OCS will not provide funding for such items if justification is not sufficient. Approval of any films or visual presentations proposed by applicants approved for funding will be made part of the grant award. In cases where material outlays for equipment (audio and visual) are requested, specific evidence must be presented that there is a definite programmatic connection between the equipment (audio and visual) usage and the outreach requirements described in Part A.1.b of this Announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCS also is interested in projects that address the needs of homeless families, welfare families, low-income and minority health initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCS welcomes project proposals which seek to develop innovative approaches to promote health, particularly among low-income and minority populations. These proposals should have as their goals the reduction of incidences of premature death and chronic disease among the targeted populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

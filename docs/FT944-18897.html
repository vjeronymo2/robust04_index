			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / ITV to increase programmes budget to Pounds 550m The ITV companies have agreed an unprecedented network programme budget of Pounds 550m for next year - a rise that is double the rate of inflation. The figure, hammered out in talks between all the ITV companies, compares with Pounds 527m for this year. The increase indicates that ITV is prepared to keep investing to retain its ratings lead over the BBC, particularly in popular drama. The budget, excluding the cost of the news provided by Independent Television News, might also include a further Pounds 2m as a contingency fund. Mr Marcus Plantin, director of the ITV Network Centre, which commissions the national ITV schedule, said yesterday that Pounds 210m has been spent on UK-produced drama. He announced the ITV peak-time schedule for 12 months ahead - the first time a UK broadcaster has committed itself for a year. Mr Plantin - speaking at an industry presentation to advertisers and agencies - stepped up ITV efforts to expose what he called the myth of the demise of terrestrial television. 'We have maintained our peak-time audience share for the past three years now and have been hardly affected by cable and satellite television penetration, which has happened much more slowly than predicted,' he said. Mr Plantin said that ITV has maintained 'both its peak-time (audience) share of around 44 per cent over the last three years and its 11 per cent lead over BBC1'. ITV has commissioned 20 new drama projects for next year - 10 of them single dramas which are pilots for possible new series. The new series range from John Thaw as a London barrister in Kavanagh QC to an adaption of Mary Wesley's book The Vacillations of Poppy Carew. The Network Centre has established a rolling three-year budget, enabling it to enter exclusive long-term deals with Hollywood studios. Mr Plantin claimed that the loss of Premier League football to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, was a blessing in disguise as it enabled the network to spend more on drama, entertainment and factual programmes.</p>

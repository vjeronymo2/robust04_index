			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (3): Capital flow expectations surpassed - The market for public bond issues may have reached a watershed THE international market for public bond issues by Latin American borrowers, which re-opened in 1989, has outstripped expectations in terms of volume and performance. Last year, capital flows to Latin America from bonds, private placements and medium-term notes reached Dollars 8.5bn, according to research from Salomon Brothers. Meanwhile, the yield differential between Eurodollar bonds for Latin American issuers and US Treasuries has narrowed dramatically, as the perception of Latin American credits improved. But the market may now have reached a watershed. Deals for sovereign borrowers such as Mexico and Venezuela, and for state-owned borrowers such as Pemex (Petroleos Mexicanos), the state-owned oil company, which set the market on its feet, have tightened substantially, and that trend may well have run its course. Five-year Mexican bonds are yielding 220 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury, the same level as other improving sovereign credits such as Turkey and Hungary. Such spreads mean that these bonds can no longer be bracketed as high-yielding debt. US investors, for example, can buy the lowest investment grade corporate bonds at spreads of around 150 basis points. The tightening of Mexican sovereign debt is 'close to over', according to Mr Peter Bernard, managing director in charge of Latin American finance at J P Morgan. 'I think Mexico will need a rating increase in order to tighten too much further.' Mexico is rated Ba2 by Moody's, and is widely expected to be in line for an upgrade this year. Venezuela, currently rated Ba1, could also be due for an upgrade, in spite of fears of political instability stirred up by the recent failed coup. The performance of Mexico and Venezuela, the first Latin American countries to return to the market, was helped by their outstanding commercial debt having been restructured through the Brady plan. Although Brazil and Argentina, the two other countries to have gained access to the international markets, have so far failed to reach an agreement on the rescheduling of their debt, their public bond issues have also performed well. In fact, when Brazil's secondary market debt prices slid on disappointment that no rescheduling agreement had been reached last autumn, Brazil's access to the international bond market was not affected. Spreads of Brazilian bonds have also tightened. When Brazil returned to the international capital markets last July, with a two-year issue for Petrobras (Petroleo Brasileiro), the state-owned oil company, the deal was priced to yield 650 basis points above the comparable Treasury. The launch spread for two-year public sector bonds is now between 350 basis points and 400 basis points, and banks are trying to push spreads even tighter. As in other sectors, borrowers, at first able to raise only one- or two-year funds, can now borrow over increasingly long maturities. Telebras (Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras), the telecommunications group, last month launched a Dollars 90m deal maturing in 1997, with a put option after three years priced to yield 450 basis points over the three-year Treasury yield. Although there could be room for some further improvement in Brazilian bond spreads, likely to be triggered by a debt rescheduling agreement which is again believed to be close, the dramatic spread tightening of the last nine months is not likely to be repeated, according to traders. The next stage of the market's development will be to grant access to a broader range of private sector companies. Already, an increasing number of Mexican and Brazilian companies are looking at it. 'Once Latin American sovereign borrowers are no longer breaking the ground, there will be more visible differentiation between corporate credits, especially in the private sector,' said Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director in charge of emerging markets at Chase Manhattan. 'The market will require more careful credit analysis.' The market, so far limited to Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, is also likely to open to other countries. Uruguay is expected to return to the capital markets shortly with a Dollars 75m deal via J P Morgan. However, the deal is not likely to pave the way for corporate issues from Uruguay, due to the small size of the country's economy Some bankers say Chile is also likely to tap the international capital markets, and would be well received. Although Chile does not need to borrow, and there is an active domestic market for Chilean companies, some borrowers may wish to diversify their sources of funds. The tightening of spreads of Latin American Eurobonds has not simply been the result of improving credit. The market has managed to attract an increasingly broad range of investors. 'The Eurobond investor base originally consisted of mainly offshore flight capital held in centres like Luxembourg and Switzerland,' said Mr Miles Protter, director of emerging markets at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'But we have had considerable success in bringing institutional investors and fund managers into the market.' Recently, large companies with spare liquidity have also invested in the market, he added. Most Latin American Eurobonds have incorporated a '144a option', which allows the bonds to be placed with US institutional investors through the private placement market, under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a. The response from US investors has ranged 'from good to disappointing', according to Mr Protter. While around 15 per cent of some deals was placed in the US, in other cases, US institutional investors have found yields too aggressive, compared with paper available in the US high yield corporate, or junk, bond market. To achieve a more diverse investor base, Mexico, in particular, has led the way in tapping other sectors of the market, as well as extending maturity. Banamex (Banco Nacional de Mexico) launched a Pta10bn five-year deal in the Spanish 'matador' bond market earlier this year, while Nafinsa (Nacional Financiera) raised Ecu100m of five-year bonds in February. The trend towards increasing diversity - of credit, of country, of currency and of maturity - is likely to fuel continued interest in the sector over the next few years.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS BILLED FOR WATER CLEANUP;  </P> <P> EPA TELLS 27 COMPANIES TO PROVIDE $71.2 MILLION  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, acting under the federal Superfund  toxic cleanup program, has told 27 Burbank-area companies to pay for a  $70-million ground water treatment system to purge Burbank water supply wells  of chemical solvents.  </P> <P> The agency wrote letters to the firms that it said should be considered a  "formal demand for reimbursement of costs that have been incurred and that are  expected to be incurred" in the ground water cleanup.  </P> <P> The five-page letters, mailed Tuesday, gave the companies 120 days to negotiate  with the EPA to determine their share of the cleanup bill. The companies were  invited to a May 18 meeting at Burbank City Hall to discuss the Superfund  cleanup.  </P> <P> The EPA did not cite any evidence linking the companies to ground water  contamination, which is sure to be an issue in the negotiations. While many of  the companies are thought to have used and perhaps leaked the offending  chemicals at some time in the past, only one is a confirmed polluter of ground  water, according to state water quality records that are the EPA's main source  of data.  </P> <P> That company is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. of Burbank, whose huge  production complex is just uphill from Burbank municipal water supply wells  that are contaminated by trichloroethylene, known as TCE, and  perchloroethylene, called PCE, suspected cancer-causing solvents.  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman Ross Hopkins said Wednesday that the company had not  received the letter but has been expecting it.  </P> <P> Hopkins said Lockheed "will be participating" in the cleanup work but doesn't  know yet what share the firm is willing to pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Denying Responsibility'  </P> <P> "Our position is a delicate one, because a lot of these people are denying  responsibility and pointing the finger at us," Hopkins said, referring to the  other companies.  </P> <P> Lockheed has already spent $4 million on a system to treat water pumped from  beneath its own plant, but the system treats only a fraction of the area's  tainted ground water supply.  </P> <P> The EPA has tentatively approved a $70-million treatment system in the vicinity  of Burbank's municipal water supply wells. The system would include a series of  extraction wells and aeration towers to remove the chemicals as vapor. It would  handle 12,000 gallons of water a minute, producing enough drinking water to  supply 100,000 people.  </P> <P> According to the letters, the EPA also wants the companies to pay $1.2 million  it said it has spent on studies and investigation, in addition to the cost of  the cleanup system.  </P> <P> A vast area of the San Fernando Valley ground water basin, from North Hollywood  east into the Verdugo Mountains, is contaminated by TCE and PCE after decades  of widespread use of the chemicals in metal degreasing and dry-cleaning  operations.  </P> <P> The pollution has shut down some wells operated by the Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power and other utilities. The worst contamination is in Burbank,  which has temporarily abandoned its ground water supply and increased its  reliance on more expensive water from the Metropolitan Water District.  </P> <P> Paula Bisson, Superfund state programs chief for the EPA in San Francisco, said  the agency would like the companies "as a whole to come forward and do the  cleanup." If they don't, she said, the EPA could do the work and go to court to  recover the cost, or issue a formal order requiring the work and ask a judge to  enforce it.  </P></p>

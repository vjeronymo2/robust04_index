The same court  acquitted Hani Marzuq, a 36 year-old stateless man, who was  charged with collaborating with the troops of the Iraqi regime  during their occupation of Kuwait.    The court, which held its session today under the  chairmanship of Counsellor Salah al-Fahd, had first sentenced  Jabir Sughayir Farhan, a 34-year-old stateless man, to 10 years  hard labor. The defendant had claimed that he had been forced  to join the so-called Iraqi People's Army, alleging that he had  been threatened with execution if he refused to do so.    The same court has postponed the case of defendant Khalid  Sahir al-Khaldi, a 42-year-old Kuwaiti national, who is accused  of joining the so-called Iraqi People's Army during Kuwait's  occupation by the Iraqi regime, until 12 February 1994 when it  will listen to the speech for the defense.    The aforementioned defendant has claimed that he was taking  out identity cards for members of his tribe, from the province  of al-Jahran, to enable them to travel in Kuwait during the  occupation of the latter by the troops of the Iraqi regime. He  added: "I did not knock on anyone's door; it was they who came  to my house asking for my protection out of fear of the Iraqi  People's Army and anyone who says otherwise is ungrateful."    The same court has also postponed the case of defendant  Mufidah Salih al-Haj 'Amr, a Jordanian woman who is on the run  and who is accused of passing information to the enemy.</p>

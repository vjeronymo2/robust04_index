The lion's share of the earnings came from the Shanghai  Volkswagen Corp., a main producer of "Santana" sedans, and its  related manufacturers.    The total output of Santanas jumped to 100,000 last year  from  65,000 in 1992.    The production of the same make for the new year is targeted  at 115,000, and a brand new model of Santana will appear on the  market toward the end of the year.    At the same time, work has been stepped up on the second  phase of the "Volkswagen" technical transformation project, and  the year 1994 will see a new major auto-maker with a production  capacity of 200,000 Santanas.    It was reported that the sales slump of Santana cars has  been  arrested thanks to new measures taken to promote sales. In  addition, the auto's cost has been reduced as more than 80  percent of the parts are produced locally and import duties have  been lowered on some parts.    All these have gone a long way to increase the  competitiveness of Shanghai's automobiles.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Clinton's least worst option: Invading Haiti could deepen White House isolation It was good,' the crusty Washington veteran said of President Bill Clinton's nationally televised address on Haiti on Thursday evening. 'But, of course, it was not good enough.' It probably never could have been. Forceful as his arguments were during his sombre 16-minute speech from the Oval Office, the president was, as R W Apple put it in yesterday's New York Times, speaking 'into the teeth of a howling political gale'. The impact of his case was diluted by the instantaneous reaction from Port-au-Prince. CBS television immediately switched to an interview with Lt Gen Raoul Cedras. Mumbling in French, the leader of Haiti's military junta said he was ready to die, as any soldier would, in defence of his country. But the junta was not Mr Clinton's prime target. His task was to convince his own public and politicians that he had not painted himself into such a corner that he had no alternative but to send US forces overseas on a combat mission for the first time in his presidency - and to a country of such insignificance that its relevance to the US national interest is but dimly understood and, if grasped, is perceived as not worth the expenditure of American lives. All week Congress and most of the media have been inveighing against intervention. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, managed to avoid the Senate voting against US action this week, but he could not prevent a floor debate in which Democrats, including some of Mr Clinton's most loyal troops, urged him to pull back. Absent an actual invasion, votes in both houses may be unavoidable next week. Divisions were even apparent in the congressional black caucus, the strongest advocates of restoring Haiti's elected government by force if necessary. Partisan criticism was predictably vicious. Both Dan Quayle, the former vice-president, and Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate in 1992, said Mr Clinton was only acting to restore his sagging popularity in advance of November's mid-term congressional elections. Mr Perot added the twist that not serving in the Vietnam War rendered Mr Clinton morally unqualified to send US troops into danger. But the balance of opinion from both sides of the political aisle was definitely that Mr Clinton should secure the authorisation of Congress for any intervention. That has also been the thrust of much editorial comment. The New York Times wrote yesterday that it was 'Congress's solemn duty to decide on issues of war and peace'. USA Today warned that 'getting in is easy; getting out is hard'. The Los Angeles Times thought that only the flight of the junta could justify the president's sabre-rat-tling. Almost alone in offering a contrary view among the pundits was Michael Elliott in Newsweek, who argued the US did have legitimate national interests in Haiti and concluded 'the foreign affairs gurus can be wrong.' Mr Clinton showed himself sensitive to guru opinion by recalling in his speech the public statements of President George Bush and James Baker, his secretary of state, that the 1991 coup in Haiti 'cannot stand'. But members of the former administration, including Messrs Bush and Baker, have been in the vanguard of those urging Mr Clinton not to go to the wall for Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president. A statement issued on Thursday by Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser, was typical. Its headline ran: 'Haiti revisited: is this trip necessary?' At least Mr Clinton was able to assure them that Fr Aristide had agreed not to seek another term, once restored to power. Still, the weight of opposition to Mr Clinton's policies should not be interpreted as meaning the US stands on the brink of its own constitutional crisis over the limits of presidential authority. As Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, conceded, the mere act of an invasion will dissuade Congress from doing anything that could be construed as undermining the US military mission or suggesting to the junta that US resolve is anything but absolute. Public opinion also is not set in concrete, with two overnight polls of those who had watched the president speak finding he had won over some hearts and minds. This improvement might hold up if, as expected, the Haitian military crumbles quickly and if the operation resembles the short, sharp incursions into Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989. But the experience of the Gulf war, popular, congressionally approved and successfully accomplished, shows how fickle public opinion can be. Waving the flag is unlikely to have much influence on the mid-term elect-ions. To this end, Mr Clinton sought to make much of the fact that most US troops would be out of Haiti 'in months not years', to be replaced by an international peacekeeping force, drawn from over 20 countries. But even this commitment was greeted with scepticism by those noting, like Mr Scowcroft, that the last US invasion of Haiti in 1915 led to a 19-year occupation and by others pointing out that international support had been extracted only with extreme difficulty. Mr Clinton's other justifications for action mixed the highly moral - the need to end gross human rights abuses and the proclamation of hemispheric democratic values - with the domestically political. The cost of caring for refugees and illegal immigrants is already a big issue in Florida (and, for different reasons, California), and the president painted a somewhat lurid picture of the threats posed by another wave of Haitian boat people washing up on the Florida shores. These arguments were also given short shrift. Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican from Georgia, found it 'disgusting' that the president should compare George Washington with Fr Aristide, while Congressman Porter Goss, the Florida Republican, thought the refugee rationale 'disingenuous and frankly unhelpful'. A M Rosenthal, in the New York Times, wondered what had happened to a country which once welcomed immigrants with open arms. But, beyond the particular, there is the general sense that Mr Clinton is about to do something - invade a foreign country - which he entered his presidency determined to avoid at all reasonable cost. More even than his countless Haitian policy twists and turns, it is the often public agony of his decision-making processes, also evident in the domestic arena, that sometimes seems positively unpresidential. On Thursday night, he came over as stern and tough, perhaps another manifestation of this quicksilver man. But, by the time he spoke, he was damned if he did invade and damned if he did not. Not backing down had become, arguably, the lesser of the two evils.</p>

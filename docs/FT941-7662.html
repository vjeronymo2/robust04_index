			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Pensions reform plan unveiled A plan to create a French system of private capitalised pension funds, which draws from the British and German systems, was unveiled by Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance committee, yesterday. The plan proposes that new pension funds should be managed independently but be allowed to invest part of their capital in contributing companies. Mr Barrot's proposals will form a basis for negotiations in the government's plan to reform its creaking pension system. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, has said he plans to introduce a bill on pension reform in the spring. The government is seeking to ease pressure on the existing 'pay as you go' state system, which has a deficit of almost FFr20bn (Dollars 3.34bn) as a result of France's ageing population and rising unemployment. By creating a system of powerful private pension funds, the French government hopes to promote the development of France's financial markets. In the UK and the US, pension funds are some of the largest investors on the stock market. Mr Barrot recommends pension funds should invest at least 30 per cent of employer contributions into the company which employs them. He said funds should also pay out pensions solely in life annuities rather than in capital and they should invest at least half of their assets in shares. According to Mr Barrot, this system strikes a balance between the UK system, in which pension funds are run independently, and the German system, where companies make provisions for pensions in their balance sheets. Under the proposals, contributions to pension funds should receive tax exemptions. Industry analysts estimated this could entail costs of FFr15bn-FFr20bn to establish a system of capitalised pension funds.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Guerrilla chiefs head for Kabul AFGHANISTAN'S new ruling council last night prepared to fly to Kabul, the capital, today amid signs that guerrillas backing it had gained the upper hand in fighting against mujahideen rivals. Mr Sibghatullah Mojadidi, who has been charged with taking office at the head of the 51-strong council, finally decided yesterday after a weekend of fierce clashes that it was safe to head for Kabul from Peshawar, in Pakistan. But by the time his party had arrived at the airport, in failing light and deteriorating weather, it was too late to depart. Mujahideen officials said Mr Mojadidi would leave this morning if the situation in Kabul remained relatively calm. Throughout yesterday Kabul echoed to the sound of automatic weapons and artillery fire. Clashes erupted between forces loyal to Ahmed Shah Masood, the Jamiat-i-Islami commander - who backs the new council  - and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islam forces after Kabul fell to mujahideen fighters on Saturday. A Jamiat commander in the area of the Bala Hissar (old fort) said between 20 and 30 people had been killed there. The overall death toll was expected to be much higher. There was no telling last night whether Afghanistan would be plunged into a fresh civil war after the end of the 13-year conflict between the Islamic guerrillas and the communist regime. Celebrations over a mujahideen victory turned to bloodshed as Pushtun nationalists and Hezb guerrillas showed their determination to resist domination of Kabul by non-Pushtun forces loyal to Mr Masood. Mr Masood was appointed head of a six-man security committee by mujahideen leaders in Peshawar on Saturday and given orders to secure the city. Three of the other members were from his Jamiat party while two prominent Pushtuns were also included. Pakistan yesterday supported the committee and new ruling council. Support by an overwhelming majority of the guerrilla groups as well as the United Nations had given legitimacy to the council, Pakistan's foreign ministry said. Mr Mojadidi condemned the assault on Kabul by Mr Hekmatyar who ordered his men into the city on Saturday after rejecting the council and the plan for the transfer of power. Last night Hezb forces controlled key pockets of Kabul, including the Ministry of the Interior. Jamiat vehicles manned by heavily armed guerrillas patrolled the deserted streets of the capital. General Nabi Azimi, former head of the Kabul garrison who has been co-operating with Mr Masood, called on the security forces to obey him. But two other Pushtun nationalist generals - General Mohammad Rafi and General Watangarn, the former minister of defence - were siding with the Hekmatyar forces. Reports and analysis, Page 3</p>

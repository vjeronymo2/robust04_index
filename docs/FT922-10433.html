			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Strong man Masood enters Kabul in triumph THE GUERRILLA commander Mr Ahmad Shah Masood yesterday assumed his position as Afghanistan's strongest figure, inspecting the capital Kabul from a black Mercedes limousine as his troops took up posts around the city in scores of armoured vehicles. Late on Wednesday, Mr Masood had ridden triumphantly into Kabul in a three-mile-long armoured column that reached the capital after skirting a final attempt by his rival, the radical Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to block his way to power. As Mr Masood's column rode south from Bagram air base it was fired on by fighters of Mr Hekmatyar. The column made a quick detour to another road, and the convoy - carrying thousands of Mr Masood's fighters and his ethnic Uzbek allies - proceeded to Kabul. Mr Masood, who is the new defence minister, appeared to be gearing up for a new offensive against Mr Hekmatyar. With the backing of his fighters, Mr Masood can wield considerable sway over the new President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, and the prime minister designate, Mr Ustad Fareed. Both are seen as comparitively weak figures. 'Every group which is fighting the government, which is not acceptable to the majority of the people, is a rebel and subversive,' Mr Masood said. It was clear that Mr Hekmatyar - who according to mujahideen and diplomats attempted to take power for himself in a joint coup attempt with ethnic Pushtouns in the left-wing government last week - was heading toward isolation. Members of the ruling 51-member ruling council met Mr Masood for the first time yesterday to discuss, among other topics, Mr Hekmatyar's future. Before the meeting a spokesman for Mr Mojaddedi said: 'It is up to the council to decide. But in my opinion, there is no more chance for Hekmatyar to enter the council. He was given the chance to be prime minister of Afghanistan. Instead he decided to fight his fellow mujahideen.' Mr Hekmatyar was said to be with his forces some 20 miles south of Kabul at Chorosyab. Mr Noor ul-Haq Ulomi, a Warning, Overset column general of the deposed regime who has appeared to establish himself in the early stages of the new government as a prime military figure, said an offensive was planned against Mr Hekmatyar today or tomorrow. Another general, who asked not to be identified, said the offensive would involve a combined force of former army soldiers, mujahideen and ethnic militia. After almost a week of violence, only a few shells and small arms fire were heard in the capital. Meanwhile, signs emerged of the new Islamic government taking hold. In the luxury Chicken Street district, merchants stopped selling hard liquor, saying they feared trouble from mujahideen guerrillas running the city of 2m people. Women who had strolled unveiled in short skirts next to other women in full burkha, were carefully covering their faces. Mr Najibullah, the former Moscow-back president, has not resurfaced since his attempt to flee the country two weeks ago.</p>

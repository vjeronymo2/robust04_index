			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Hladkiy report on news conference by Supreme Soviet </F> Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, National Bank Chairman Stanislav  Bogdankevich, and CIS Affairs Secretary Uladzimir Zalomay at the  Supreme Soviet press center in Minsk on 13 January; from the  "Postfactum Radio" feature--passages with quotation marks are  recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] You know that Belarusian Supreme Soviet  Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich has just concluded a visit to  Moscow where he met and spoke with Boris Yeltsin. This meeting  will likely be recorded as a turning point in history and its  results are interesting to everybody. We are subconsciously  waiting for a miracle to happen; we are expecting our lives to  get better. Therefore, a great many journalists gathered at a  news conference held at the Supreme Soviet press center. My  colleague Ivan Hladkiy was also invited. So, I am turning the  microphone over to him.    [Hladkiy] Interest in this news conference was enormous. It  was manifested in the great number of journalists who took part  in it. Their interest is quite understandable. Currently,  everyone is speaking about the unification of two monetary  systems -- Russian and Belarusian; about the upcoming visit of  U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk, and about other urgent  issues. The entire audience was eager to know what issues our  Belarusian delegation settled in Moscow. This is how Belarusian  Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich characterized the  results of the Moscow talks.    [Shushkevich] "I am going to read the joint communique. It  includes the following ideas: First of all, we have discussed  the issues of the economic situation and other issues of  bilateral relations. The most important thing is that we have  arrived at a unanimous decision and I am pleased to mark that  the treaty on cooperation, signed in December 1990, when the two  states were parts of the former USSR, does not suit new  realities. It is high time to immediately draft a new  full-fledged treaty on friendship and cooperation. We have also  discussed the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Moscow and  Minsk and reached an understanding on this issue, as well as on  the issue of the unification of the Belarusian and Russian  monetary systems; the merging of our monetary systems. It is  very difficult to declare and then unite our monetary systems.  Therefore, work on the adjustment of the positions of the two  countries is being continued. In my mind, this work will be  done in January, that is, [words indistinct]. Boris Yeltsin has  authorized Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to visit Minsk in  January, where he will hold additional talks with the Belarusian  Government. If by that time work on the rapprochement of mutual  positions is concluded [words indistinct] and a legal footing  for this unification [word indistinct]. I personally consider  the issue of equal prices to be the key issue. I am satisfied  with the fact that we could explain to the Russian leadership  [words indistinct] about Chernobyl. [Words indistinct] some 15  percent of our state expenditures are represented by Chernobyl  costs. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to stand on our  own feet when Russia is pursuing its own pricing policy. I hope  that we will [words indistinct] with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin resolve this issue this month."    [Hladkiy] The CIS Executive Secretary Vladimir Zalomay,  Belarusian vice prime minister, said:    [Zalomay] "Actually, the key issue on the agenda is the  unification of the two monetary systems. Currently, the mass  media are carrying various reports as to which stage this  process has reached. I would like to note that this process is  in the penultimate stage of being concluded. However, the work  has not yet reached its final stage. The final step will be  made in January in Minsk. We have completed all the preparatory  work, which puts the unification of the monetary systems on a  legal footing."    [Hladkiy] There were many questions and they were very  different. However, the prevailing majority of questions  concerned the monetary union: What will be the exchange rate of  Belarusian hares [nickname for Belarusian currency]? Will  Belarus lose its state independence? What advantages will this  monetary union provide Belarus? Belarusian National Bank  Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich addressed all of these questions.    [Bogdankevich] "Answering the question on the exchange rate  of Belarusian rubles, I can say the following: At the moment,  we have no written agreement on the exchange rate. We  understand that we can begin using an exchange rate of 10:1, in  favor of the Russian ruble."    [Hladkiy] "So, what was the reaction of international  financial organizations to the possible unification of the  Belarusian and Russian monetary systems?"    [Bogdankevich] "The IMF has somehow expressed its concern  with the fact that we do not properly inform it on the course of  negotiations on the issue. I met with an IMF representative and  explained to him the current state of affairs. Later, we  received another IMF statement recommending that we think hard  and adopt decisions carefully."    [Hladkiy] "What can you say about the circulation of Russian  rubles and Belarusian hares when our states unite their monetary  systems?"    [Bogdankevich] "The concern is that if the decision on the  establishment of a 1:1 exchange rate of Belarusian hares and  Russian rubles is adopted, then it will not be necessary to  immediately withdraw our Belarusian payment notes from  circulation. We should put into circulation that amount of  Russian money that our population requires for [words  indistinct]. I am emphasizing that we are approaching the  signing of an agreement on this exchange rate, but it has not  yet been signed. As for the unification itself, I think that if  we unite our financial systems on a sound basis, on the basis of  using and distributing Russian primary raw materials, primarily  energy resources, on Belarusian territory, it will be easier to  stabilize the Belarusian economy and to preserve markets in  Russia and Belarus. In this aspect, the key issue is to agree  and unite on the basis of using domestic Russian prices at the  moment we begin using the Russian currency. Not later, but  instantly."    [Hladkiy] These are their opinions and prospects. However,  my dear listeners, we can do nothing but wait. Let us hope for  the best.</p>

The decision will serve as the government's policy in  positioning itself in relation to Hong Kong and Macao after they  become special administrative zones of mainland China in 1997  and 1999, respectively.    The MAC made the decision when screening the draft statute  governing Taipei's future ties with Hong Kong and Macao. The  statute was newly worked out by domestic scholars.    Under the statute, the MAC will authorize relevant  government  units to work out concrete and detailed measures for countering  whatever possible changes in the political and economic climates  of the two colonies after 1997 and 1999, MAC officials said.    Basically, the officials said, the statute for governing  people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait can't be applied  to regulate ties between Taiwan and Hong Kong or Macao.    Informed sources said that the government here hopes to  maintain direct trade and aviation ties with Hong Kong after  1997 on a reciprocal basis. But there exist some variables that  might cause the hope to evaporate. These include whether the  National Unification Guidelines are still at their initial  implementation stage, and whether direct trade, transportation  and mail are allowed.    The statute for governing ties with Hong Kong and Macao is  expected to be fully enacted by the end of 1996.</p>

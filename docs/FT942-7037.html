			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / West country holds key for Lib Dems: A vital election battleground Mr Tim Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat campaign director, makes no bones about it. The name of the game for his party in next month's European elections is to topple Tory incumbents in the west country and southern England. The Liberal Democrats have never won a European seat, but local Liberal Democrat campaigners say openly it would be a 'disaster' if the party failed to win at least two - the best bets being Cornwall and West Plymouth, and Somerset and Devon North. But the party knows the potential is there for a much bigger haul. Last year, the party captured Cornwall County Council, previously run by independents, and took Somerset and Dorset county councils from the Tories. It also became the largest party on Devon County Council. To build on this, it must secure the votes of as many disaffected Conservatives as possible in its key areas, squeeze the Labour vote and secure the support of as many as possible of the people - between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the electorate - who voted Green in 1989. 'We are campaigning as much on the government's record as on Europe,' says Mr Clement-Jones. If there are emotive local issues - as with water in the west country - the party will change the emphasis of its message. Mr Clement-Jones says environmental sustainability is one of the 'strands' in all key Liberal Democrat policies. 'We are a fairly natural repository for the Green vote,' he says. 'An awful lot of former Greens have joined the party, including former councillors.' The strategy for winning Labour supporters combines demonstrating that the Liberal Democrats are an effective critic of government policy, and highlighting figures in particular constituencies that encourage tactical voting. Mr Clement-Jones thinks the party's strong performance in recent local elections will help. 'You have to be the local champion,' says Mr Clement Jones. 'All across the south we are in control of county councils or the largest party.' The Liberal Democrats will pour the largest chunk of their Pounds 260,000 national election budget into their target areas. 'The key thing about any targeting strategy is to take nothing for granted,' says Mr Clement-Jones. 'We do have discipline about targeting. I get very little complaint from candidates because we are used to doing it on a local level.' The upshot is that the party has framed its national campaign around the south-west. Mr Paddy Ashdown plans four visits to each of Devon and Cornwall before polling. The Liberal Democrat leader played the starring role this week in the first campaign rally in the Somerset market town of Taunton. The aim is for a Liberal Democrat MP to visit these seats 'at least two days out of three'. Local party strategies follow the same blueprint. The party's election literature for Cornwall says the election is 'your opportunity to send a message to the government'. It also seeks to encourage tactical voting, claiming that only the Liberal Democrat or the Conservative can win - 'no other result is possible'. But the biggest issue of the campaign so far is the exclusively regional concern of water charges. South West Water, responsible for cleaning up the area's long coastline, levies the highest charges in the country amid bitter local resentment. Local Conservatives ruefully agree with the Liberal Democrat assessment that water charges are 'the south-west's poll tax'. Anger at European Union policies on agriculture, fisheries and tourism give the campaign a further distinctly regional flavour. This tends to back Tory claims that the region is unusual, and that success there could not be repeated elsewhere in England. But will the breakthrough happen? Figures produced by the polling organisation MORI for The Times from surveys carried out in March and April suggest that the Liberal Democrats should win eight seats - all but one of them in the south-west. Of those questioned in the south-west 38 per cent backed the Liberal Democrats, 32 per cent the Tories and 28 per cent Labour  -mostly concentrated in the Bristol seat, which Labour holds and expects to retain. Apart from their two strongest seats, on these figures the Liberal Democrats should also take Devon and East Plymouth, Dorset and East Devon, Wiltshire and Bath, Wight and Hampshire South, Hampshire North and Oxford, and East Sussex and Kent South. Another element has been boundary changes, in particular the split of Plymouth where the city council is controlled by Labour. The city has been divided into two Euro seats. The Liberal Democrat Euro-candidates in both sides of the city can now tell Labour voters that they have been grouped with a large rural area - so the Lib Dems offer the only chance to oust the Tories. One said to a Labour waverer: 'Just loan us your vote for the day to kick the Tories out.'</p>

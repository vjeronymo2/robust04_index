			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Ukraine renounces debt deal RELATIONS between Russia and Ukraine sharply deteriorated yesterday, as the Ukrainians announced they would not continue with a deal concluded with Russia in November on sharing debt repayments. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, also said he would not sign the charter of the Commonwealth of Independent States, of which Russia is the keystone. Mr Ihor Yukhnovsky, the first deputy prime minister of Ukraine, said in Kiev that Ukraine would assume all of its own obligations to repay its debts and 'must receive its share of (former Soviet) assets'. The declaration ends a provisional agreement between Russia and Ukraine for Russia to take over Ukraine's share of the former Soviet debt - set at 16.37 per cent of an estimated debt of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 52.6bn). Ukraine's move will alarm foreign governments and banks, struggling to secure ex-Soviet debt repayments.</p>

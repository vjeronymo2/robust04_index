			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING SOUTH AFRICA PARTY OKS RACIAL REFORM PLAN  </P> <P> A congress of South Africa's ruling National Party endorsed a five-year plan of  racial reform Thursday that zealously guards white-minority interests but also  is intended to serve as the framework for power-sharing negotiations with the  black majority.  </P> <P> The program was under attack even before the end of the daylong congress. A  spokeswoman for the outlawed African National Congress said a power-sharing  proposal giving whites power of veto "doesn't meet our demands," while the  right-wing Conservative Party called it a "sellout of whites in South Africa."  </P> <P> "To the white electorate I want to give you this assurance," National Party  leader and presidential heir apparent Frederik W. de Klerk told 1,700  delegates. "The National Party will never leave you in the lurch."  </P> <P> With a standing ovation, the delegates approved the seven-point "Plan of  Action" that will guide the party through parliamentary elections in September  against the Conservative Party and the liberally inclined Democratic Party.  </P> <P> While stressing that the agenda is wide open for talks with the country's 28  million blacks, the program is firmly rooted in a commitment to "group rights"  -- a consistent policy under 41 years of apartheid rule by the party.  </P> <P> The concept is that blacks, whites, Indians and South Africans of mixed race,  or Coloreds, have the right to govern their own affairs, including segregated  residential areas and educational facilities.  </P> <P> At the same time, the plan calls for the abolition of all racial  discrimination. It envisions creation of a new constitution that brings blacks  into a legislature for the first time and a Security Council-type body as the  supreme arbiter of disputes in which each group has veto power.  </P> <P> "We do not want to follow the typical Westminster type of voting by just  counting heads and throwing all the votes into one hat," De Klerk told a news  conference.  </P> <P> "We need consensus, and concurrent majorities is the foundation of consensus."  </P> <P> The congress also swiftly put the presidency of Pieter W. Botha into the  archives though he remains in office until September, unanimously endorsing a  resolution recognizing his "inestimable contribution" during nearly 11 years in  power.  </P> <P> Botha was conspicuously absent. He refused to attend, and a dinner scheduled to  have been held in his honor Wednesday night was canceled without explanation.  </P></p>

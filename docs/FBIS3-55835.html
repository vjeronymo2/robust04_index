This was reported to Interfax on Tuesday [11  January] by the head of the Russian delegation to a Riga  conference of Russian and Latvian officials Sergey Zotov. He  said the Latvian side was offered a new Russian draft agreement  on the temporary status of the strategic facility. He stressed  that the indicates Russia is trying to meet the Latvian side  halfway.    As we have reported one of Russia's conditions for the  withdrawal of its remaining 13,000 troops by August 31 is the  right to control the radar station in Skrunda for several years.  Latvia has agreed to that in principle, but finds it necessary  to reduce the length of this period.    The conference in Riga is expected to continue on Wednesday  and the discussion of the draft agreement on the radar station  to continue during the coming round of talks in Moscow later  this month.    Sergey Zotov described the Monday incident involving the  Russian military and Russian army facilities as a crude  provocation of extremist and nationalist forces aimed at  torpedoing bilateral talks as well as a test of Russia's force,  its ability to protect its facilities.    Zotov thinks the incident should prompt the West to conclude  that Latvia is an unreliable partner.    Before the meeting Sergey Zotov protested against the  incident to the head of the Latvian delegation Martins Virsis  and demanded a full investigation of thee incident and  punishment for those responsible.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins Much is made of Tomkins' similarity to Hanson given that is where Mr Greg Hutchings cut his business teeth. But Hanson seems increasingly interested in resource-based industries. Perhaps the more apt comparison is with BTR, which has a canny ability to manage a rag-bag of mature low-technology businesses. In fact, so resilient has been Tomkins' organic growth that one wonders where the share price would now stand without Ranks Hovis McDougall. With 75 per cent of sales in the US and operating companies highly-geared to economic uplift, an RHM-less Tomkins would surely have topped many investors' lists of recovery plays. It thus remains perplexing that Tomkins should sink Pounds 925m into a seeming quagmire of a non-cyclical UK foods business. One clue lies in BTR's recent treatment of its Hawker Siddeley acquisition, where rationalisation provisions now amount to about a quarter of the purchase price. Tomkins promises its reserves will be on a far lesser scale. Nevertheless, Tomkins should still be able to reap all the profits gains from rationalisation without taking any pain above the line. The market may thus have been wrong to view RHM as a fallible food business rather than a flabby chunk of Pounds 1.4bn of costs. Tomkins can enhance profits without selling even one more Mr Kipling cake. When this becomes apparent, it may recoup its premium rating, notwithstanding growing grumbles about its quality of earnings.</p>

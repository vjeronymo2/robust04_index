			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (8): Visionary who goes by bus - Profile: Julio Anguita MR Julio Anguita would have supporters in Moscow's Congress. 'I don't follow the latest fad, I belong to the revolutionary impulse of 1917 and I don't have the slightest intention of changing,' he recently told an interviewer. It looks as if domestic support is growing for the 52-year-old secretary-general of Spain's Communist party. Polls suggest that in the general elections later this year Izquierda Unida (IU), the leftwing coalition which he leads, will increase its representation in the Madrid congress from 17 to 28 seats and become the third largest party in the new legislature. Spaniards are not, of course, suddenly enthused about manning the Bolshevik barricades. But Mr Anguita is set to be a main beneficiary of growing unemployment and of the governing socialist party's record on corruption. As Euroscepticism begins to make inroads on Spain, IU may, in addition, reap some reward from having abstained in the parliamentary vote to ratify Maastricht's European Union treaty while every other party voted in favour. The abstention vote was, in fact, a compromise between Mr Anguita's rejection of Maas- tricht and the support for the treaty voiced by a number of leading IU parliamentarians. It is not surprising that disillusioned Socialist voters should turn to Mr Anguita. IU has been a consistent critic of the government's monetarist policy and Mr Anguita himself, who habitually travels on public transport, is widely admired for his austere lifestyle. Opponents may loathe his politics but they do not question his personal integrity. IU has also been adept at championing minority causes such as abortion and conscientious objection to military service and it has a good record on ecology and racism. If the general elections bear out the voting trends indicated by the polls and leave Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, well short of an overall majority, IU will on paper be poised, as are the minority nationalist parties, to make up the socialist shortfall by joining a coalition government as the junior partner. Such a development would be attractive to the left wing of the Socialist party but it would not appeal to Mr Gonzalez who is a staunch anti-communist. Among Spain's centre right it would inevitably conjure up memories of the 1936 Popular Front government in the run-up to the Spanish Civil War. Were IU to form a coalition government, exchange controls would probably have to be reintroduced to stem the likely flight of domestic capital. Mr Anguita would certainly demand a steep trade-off in return for propping up a minority socialist government. For a start, he would seek a boost in public spending at the expense of worsening the budget deficit, a reduction of the privatisation programme and halt to deregulation measures and, especially, to any attempt to alter Spain's rigid hiring and firing rules. IU's coalition shopping list is a frontal attack on every- thing that Mr Gonzalez's present economic team stands by. It is a very pricey one and Mr Anguita knows it. He is also unlikely to change it. Mr Anguita, who is the sort of visionary who believes that history is on his side, has in fact everything to gain from letting Mr Gonzalez fend for himself. Nothing could suit him more than a weak socialist government that is forced into compromises with the middle-of-the-road and self-seeking nationalists.</p>

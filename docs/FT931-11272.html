			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Foods delays announcement of interims NORTHUMBRIAN Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks group, set the stock market a puzzle last night. It was to have announced interim results yesterday but during the day made last minute cancellations of meetings set up with analysts and the press. After the stock market closed yesterday, with the shares unchanged on the USM at 19p, the company announced it was 'involved in discussions in respect of a reorganisation of the group'. These talks 'are to be concluded shortly. 'They are expected to have a material effect on the group's interim results for the six months to September 30.' No further explanation was forthcoming from the group, although the mystery may be solved today. The group's shares have fallen from 43p last June when Mr Richard Adams, the then chairman and chief executive, resigned. A new chief executive, Mr Henry Roberts, was appointed in October. Analysts suggested that the talks might be with the group's bankers and the new man may be trying to raise some cash, although a rights issue is said to be out of the question. They speculated that the group was trying to sell part of the business or that the interim figures might be affected by provisions relating to a reorganisation. The group had an exceptional charge of Pounds 550,000 in the 1991-92 accounts, and also made adjustments to the balance sheet relating to the acquisition in 1991 of John J Lees, a confectionery maker, for Pounds 4.8m.</p>

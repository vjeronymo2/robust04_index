			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Nickel up in strong trading - Market report Technical and speculative buying saw nickel's price rise strongly on the London Metal Exchange, and by the close traders were suggesting that the metal was 'seriously overbought'. Successive waves of buy-stops were triggered when the price moved through Dollars 6,500 and Dollars 6,600 a tonne, putting prices on course for a run-up to the year's highs above Dollars 6,900 again, traders said. Nickel ended at Dollars 6,635 a tonne, up Dollars 215 from Friday's kerb (after hours) trading. Coffee futures ended a thin session firmer as the market kept a nervous eye on the weather in Brazil. The November position was up Dollars 29 at Dollars 3,984 after peaking at Dollars 4,010 in the morning. Weather Services Corporation said dry weather would lead to more losses.

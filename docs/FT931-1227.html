			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch alters top management structure MERRILL LYNCH, the largest US securities firm, has shuffled its top management structure, creating an office of the chairman, to focus on developing client relationships, and an office of the chief executive, to run the company on a day-to-day basis, writes Martin Dickson in New York. However, the shake-up has left unclear the answer to one of the more intriguing personnel questions on Wall Street - who is likely to succeed Mr Daniel Tully as president and chief executive of the group? Mr Tully is due to become Merrill's chairman in June on the retirement of Mr William Schreyer, chairman since 1985. The office of the chairman includes Messrs Schreyer and Tully along with Mr Stephen Hammerman, vice-chairman, and Mr John Heimann, chairman of global financial institutions. It involves two other men who have been given new titles: Mr Barry Friedberg, head of the investment banking group since 1985, becomes chairman, investment banking. Mr Thomas Patrick, previously executive vice-president, equity markets group, becomes chairman, special advisory services.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark remains weak THE D-Mark continued to weaken against most European currencies, although it managed to recoup some of its losses in late trade yesterday, writes Conner Middelmann. The German currency's slippage was triggered by Tuesday's 9 basis-point drop in the Bundesbank's rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements which spurred talk that the Bundesbank has embarked on a more aggressive easing course. 'With the recession deepening, M3 headed back towards the target range and inflation set to fall below 3 per cent in the first half of next year, the economic fundamentals point to an acceleration of the easing course,' said Mr Michael Burke, an economist with Citibank in London. Still, most analysts said they did not expect to see a cut in Germany's leading discount and Lombard rates at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council. The Belgian and French francs posted significant gains against the D-Mark, the Belgian currency receiving an extra boost from a sharp cut in key money market rates that was seen as injecting new life into the flagging Belgian economy. The Belgian franc firmed to around its previous European exchange rate mechanism floor of BFr21.0950 per D-Mark. It hit an intraday high of BFr21.090 but closed slightly lower at BFr21.25. The French franc reached its highest level against the D-Mark since the summer ERM crisis, hitting FFr3.4560, compared to its floor of FFr3.4305 before the ERM trading bands were widened on August 2. In late London trading it was quoted at FFr3.4615. In spite of the franc's strength against the D-Mark, 'we did not see any intervention by the Bank of France on the cross,' a Paris-based analyst reported. The French central bank could have profited from the franc's strength to replenish its foreign currency reserves, which were depleted during the last ERM crisis and are slowly being rebuilt. However, 'they may have done something via the US dollar,' he suggested. This could involve selling French francs for dollars and then selling those dollars for D-Marks - a less visible way for a central bank to operate in the foreign exchange market. Sterling largely shrugged off rate cut speculation following lower than expected retail price and sales data, and shed only a pfennig to DM2.5175. Against the US dollar, it finished at Dollars 1.4770, compared with Dollars 1.4855 at Tuesday's close. The dollar rose early in London on hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement would be approved by the US congress, and received an additional boost from strong housing starts data. However, it slipped on late profit-taking to finish at DM1.7050, only modestly above Tuesday's DM1.7020. Against the yen, it ended at Y107, up from a previous Y106.55. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7030 and Y106.87.</p>

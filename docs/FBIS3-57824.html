Jean-Pierre  Jacquemin has just interviewed Yildirim Keskin, the Turkish  ambassador in Belgium. He has confirmed Ankara's accusations  against the Belgian authorities:    [Keskin] My ministry believes that the Belgian authorities  should not allow the PKK [Kurdistan Workers Party] to hold a  meeting in the Turkish district.    [Jacquemin] When [Interior] Minister Tobback says that the  violent demonstrations by young Turks are not spontaneous, what  do you say?    [Keskin] I say that he is misinformed, because I have spoken  with the people who witnessed these incidents: Everything  happened very quickly and spontaneously.    [Jacquemin] Does this mean that, according to you, there are  no Grey Wolves, these members....    [Keskin, interrupting] I do not know about that. It may be  the case. But according to me, nothing was planned in advance.    [Jacquemin] This morning you met Belgian Foreign Affairs  Minister Willy Claes.    [Keskin] Yes. This is only a hitch, we agreed on the fact  that violence could not settle anything and that the heat should  come off all this.    [Jacquemin] According to you, will things quiete down over  the next few hours?    [Keskin] But things have already calmed down, I think.    [Jacquemin] Yes, that is also what we thought yesterday, but  there were more riots....    [Keskin, interrupting] No. I believe that the PKK group  which came from Bonn is to leave Belgium this evening or  tomorrow morning, and that is it. [passage omitted]</p>

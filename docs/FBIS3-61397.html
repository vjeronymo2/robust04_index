			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of the Seimas, </F> Seimas member from Ignalina-Svencioniai Electoral District No.  53, under the rubric "Topics of the Week. Their Ramifications  for the Future of Lithuania": "Ceslovas Jursenas: 'We May and  Must Work Well for the Good of Lithuania'"]    [Text] Naturally, the last week of the year could not go by  without an analysis and discussion of the operation of the  Seimas. We did this both at a meeting of the leadership of the  Seimas and among our associates. To my mind, the best result is  that, if we were to compartmentalize the work of the Seimas by  session and month, it has become more intensive, organized, and  fruitful. As the leader of the Seimas, I certainly find this  gratifying. Of course, we argue at plenary sessions, and  sometimes quarrel. However, our productivity is obvious. What  has been required of the Seimas under the Constitution has  mostly been completed. We will discuss and adopt at our session  the things we have not completed after all, the draft legal acts  we have not managed to translate into the form of laws; this is  why the session was extended. What remains is to pass several  articles of the law on Seimas controllers or ombudsmen, and to  vote on this law, which establishes a new and very important  constitutional institution. In the future people will be able to  turn to it with complaints about bureaucratic, unlawful actions  of officials and employees of government and self-government  structures. That is, along with state control which monitors how  state property is used, how the budget is implemented, and so  on, we will have an office which is called upon to analyze  specific actions of officials and defend the legitimate  interests of citizens.    The adoption of the 1994 state budget on time certainly is a  favorable aspect of what the Seimas has accomplished. This is of  special note because the budget was adopted as the Constitution  requires for the first time in the years of independence, i.e.  the full four years. Is this a good or a bad budget? I would say  it is mediocre because we did not succeed in meeting all needs;  the situation of the state is still quite difficult, but we do  already have a budget, and certain prospects together with it.  If we consider that in 1993 Lithuania hit the bottom in its  socioeconomic development and achieved a certain stabilization,  albeit at a low level, this means that in 1994 we should have an  opportunity to elevate ourselves and climb out of the hole of  the crisis. I believe that the Seimas has facilitated this by  way of its legislative proceedings, its cadre decisions, and its  activity.    As far as the budget specifically is concerned, as I see it,  it is primarily called upon to meet social needs. This budget is  intended for the people to a greater degree than those we have  had so far. I believe that everything possible has been done to  meet their needs, and that the government, in keeping with its  policy, will help retirees, the handicapped, and other  low-income strata of the population if new funds become  available.    Agriculture, for which 400 million lits were appropriated,  was the second concern of the budget. Although agrarian deputies  counted on greater funds, judging from their criticism, things  that were done for the rural areas exceeded our potential to  begin with. It was also important that Seimas commissions  analyzed and revealed shortcomings in relations between  producers of agricultural products and representatives of  processing enterprises and mutual complaints were clarified; we  now have an extra opportunity to regulate mutual settlements.    There was no dearth of criticism concerning expenditures  from  the budget for state government. I would say that these were  largely populist statements; there are people who like to rail  at the authorities and demand that wages and other expenditures  of the government staff be cut. However, when I read letters  from the people, of which a great many are addressed to me, I  find out that complaints from the people are mainly due to a  failure to sort things out, a lack of potential to do so, and so  on rather than the desire to harm someone or gain advantage. If  we keep cutting wages or outlays on the government staff, it  will hardly retain good specialists. Competent and businesslike  people will leave for some kind of commercial structures. If we  were to look at it seriously, this would be an antistate  decision because both the Seimas and the government structures  need skilled workers no less than any other organization. Having  increased expenditures, we have the legal and moral right to  demand high-quality and effective work and the performance of  their duty from the people.    We already have a preliminary plan for the future spring  session. A comprehensive plan of sorts for all our laws and  envisioned draft laws, amendments, and additions to the laws has  been compiled in order to see graphically how the system of  state government and state structures will be transformed in  keeping with the Constitution. If in addition to that we refine  certain articles of the Seimas Statute, I believe that the  spring session will be held in a still better organized format.  The draft laws on retirement benefits, taxes, land use,  antialcohol control, and so on are among the most important  draft laws.    It is natural that heated debates are now taking place at  Seimas meetings. The truth is born from disputes. To be sure, it  is possible to call into doubt the constructive nature of  particular pronouncements and proposals of Seimas members.  However, if different opinions exist, all of them must be heard  and discussed. I know that many people are concerned about the  prospects for relations between the position [as published] and  the opposition. Some interpret the activity of the Fatherland  Union party, such as was recently displayed at its congress, as  well as at the Sajudis congress, as a threat to domestic  political relations in the country. I think that political  attacks of this kind are not viable and are transient. The  consent of almost the entire Seimas is needed in order to hold  early elections to the Seimas, as they proclaimed at these  events; this case is clearly defined in the Constitution. This  is resolved either by the Seimas itself or by the president  dissolving the Seimas in a certain situation. The president's  opportunities also depend on our considered or not considered  actions. I believe that this composition of the Seimas works in  a quite organized and effective manner; the members of the  Seimas have improved perceptibly with regard to parliamentary  work. Given the experience we now have, we may work calmly and  work well for the good of Lithuania. I see no formidable grounds  for early elections; if anyone does see them, let them make  demands--it is their right. They wish to aggravate and inflame  the situation. What can we do? However, we will have enough  energy and patience to engage in our positive endeavor. It is  precisely through such positive actions in both the legislative  and executive areas that we will ensure that Lithuania moves  ahead. As far as our interaction, for example, cooperation  within the framework of the Seimas, it existed and must exist in  the future. Of course, we cannot accept proposals of the  right-wing opposition that would run counter to our electoral  program or our principles. After all, we won elections, and are  pursuing our own policy; the government and the president do  this. However, we accept all constructive proposals, and many  such proposals from the right-wing opposition have already been  accepted. We are in favor of a constructive approach to  work--this is our principled position, my personal position,  that of the DPTL [Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania] in the  Seimas, and finally, such is the position of the president. I  repeat that we may and should work well to benefit Lithuania.    I would like to wish all people of Lithuania a quiet year of  work. I am convinced that this year will be better than the  last, and life will gradually become easier if we work in a  quiet environment to benefit ourselves and advance the country.</p>

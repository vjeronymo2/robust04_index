			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Observer: Hush hush Guido Rossi, the former stock market watchdog and left-wing politician parachuted in by anxious creditor banks to chair Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group, has been showing his teeth. His patience sorely tested during a mammoth seven-hour annual meeting this week, Rossi finally lashed out at one of the small 'shareholders', whose interminable interventions have become a feature of many such Italian meetings. For years, observers have scratched their heads as to why a number of important companies managed to escape entirely the attentions of these persistent questioners. Could Rossi have revealed the answer? Even the most long-suffering chairmen have been known to wilt when the infamous Marco Bava raises his hand to request the floor. The new broom at Ferruzzi, however, proved more than a match for him. Traditionally silent at the meetings of Italy's second biggest private company, Bava had this time engaged the audience for a full two hours. But no sooner had he sat down than Rossi drew out a pile of records his accountants had helpfully unearthed detailing 'consultancy' fees paid by Ferruzzi to Bava in years gone by.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'IF YOU WERE IN TROUBLE, PEOPLE GOING BY WOULD STOP AND HELP YOU  OUT.'  </P> <P> During a 35-year-career as an aeronautical engineer, Andrew (A.J.) Kubica  worked on everything from the X-1 to the space shuttle. He received an award  from NASA for work on reaction controls for the Mercury program. At home he's  best known as mechanic for the family cars and rescuer of motorists in  distress. Kubica and his wife, Betty, live in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> The other day I'm going down to get some gas for my wagon, and just as I pulled  down the freeway off-ramp, I saw this car with a hood up. It was in a place  where it was a little dangerous because people come off the freeway pretty  fast. You could have had an accident.  </P> <P> Then I saw this woman trying to go across the street and I just hollered out,  "Hey, is that your car?" And she said, "Yes." I says, "What's the problem?" And  she said, "It got awful hot."  </P> <P> I was thinking about pushing her. But then I says the heck with that, I got the  rope in there, I'll just pull her out of there. All I wanted to do was get her  out of that predicament and take it down to this neighborhood garage. She said,  "I can't drive that thing without power steering."  </P> <P> I says, "You just drive mine, and I'll drive yours." She says, "But I don't  know how to tow a car." "Honey," I says, "you're gonna learn real fast. I've  raised five daughters, and if they can tow, you can tow. Just back it up a  little bit, and I'll hook on to you." Then I says, "Whatever you do, just drive  carefully. If you come to that red light, make sure we slow down so you go  through it on the green." She did that perfectly, and she just pulled right  into the garage, just like a pro, and I pulled right up behind her.  </P> <P> I always have a tow rope in the back end of my car, and chains and shovel and  water. And I have a couple cans of oil, some transmission fluid, some hose  clamps and belts and some tools.  </P> <P> If somebody's broken down, I'll try to stop. They're awful thankful, just like  when they help me I'm thankful.  </P> <P> Back in '53, we had just gotten married, and we're going through high country,  Montana or Wyoming. I was pulling a small trailer with our wedding gifts and  things. I was up around 10,000 feet, and the doggone car quit on me. This guy  driving a Volkswagen bug sees me there in trouble. He just whips that little  Volkswagen right around and the next thing I know, he was hooked to me. He  snaked me up over the top of that mountain. I didn't think he could do anything  with that little bug, but he did. I was going to pay him, but he wouldn't hear  of that.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, because of the freeways, whenever I see somebody in trouble,  usually all I'm able to do is call up the CHP and say there's somebody  disabled, would you send a tow truck.  </P> <P> One of the first times that I ever stopped to help anyone, I had my cousin from  New York City with me. She was up visiting us on the farm in the Adirondacks.  We were driving along, and I looked over and there was this car off the road.  The young fellow was obviously stuck in some soft sand. I just pulled over and  threw a rope out and yanked him out. It took me all of about a minute to pull  him out of that sand, and he was grateful for it. My cousin couldn't understand  why I had stopped. She was from New York City.  </P> <P> That wasn't unusual where I came from. If you were born and raised in that  country, it didn't matter who the party was. If you were in trouble, people  going by would stop and help you out. It was their way of life. I owe an awful  lot to my parents for having brought me up in that frame of mind.  </P> <P> I remember going to Mexico one time, and this lady pulled off on the side of  the road, and her car was hot. I walked back there with a couple gallons of  water and put it in her car after it cooled down. That's all she needed. Never  saw her before, never see her again, but that's all right. I've had them do the  same thing for me, see. Life is a precious thing, and people are very  interesting. I find most of the people, they're fantastic people. They're just  trying to get along. Sometimes they run into trouble.  </P></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Greece forced to put back telecoms float Greece yesterday postponed the partial flotation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, because conditions on international capital markets were considered unfavourable. It would have been one of the largest privatisations in the European Union this year. Although the government said postponement of the 25 per cent flotation, set for early December and expected to raise about Dr320bn (Pounds 847m), was temporary, Greek analysts believe it could be delayed indefinitely. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said: 'The situation in world stock markets would not guarantee a satisfactory price for OTE shares.' He said the flotation would go ahead early next year but analysts doubted whether it would take place, because of rising opposition to privatisation within the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement. The postponement was announced only a few days before CS First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg, global co-ordinators and lead underwriters for the offering, were to begin three weeks of soliciting bids. Ten other international investment banks are in the underwriting syndicate for the issue's international tranche, amounting to 18 per cent of the company. National Bank of Greece, the other joint co-ordinator for the issue, is lead manager for the domestic tranche of 7 per cent. OTE is one of only a few profitable Greek state enterprises. It reported pre-tax profits of Dr77.8bn on sales of Dr210.8bn in the first half of 1994. However, the issue has not attracted much interest in Athens, where investors were invited to pre-register for shares last week. A stockbroker said OTE's growth 'would be limited because the government insists it should remain under state management'. The postponement came amid growing political tension, with Mr Papantoniou, who leads the pro-European reformist faction in the cabinet, under attack by radical Socialists intent on maintaining government control over industry. A failed attempt last year by the then conservative (New Democracy) government to privatise OTE was revived in a modified form by the Socialists after they returned to power last October.

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Hurd sounds warning on protectionism Japan yesterday heard a robust attack on protectionism from Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, on the final day of a four-country Asian tour. The danger of blatant protectionism had receded thanks to the recent Gatt agreement, but the worry now came from subtle pressures to curb the advance of free trade, he warned. 'Now is not the time to sit back on trade liberalisation,' Mr Hurd said, after a meeting with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, and other senior cabinet members. New ground needed to be broken, in multilateral liberalisation of telecommunications, shipping, financial services, aerospace and steel. Gatt members should ensure that the new World Trade Organisation enforced multilateral rules, rather than sought to manage trade. Mr Hurd was critical of pressures to use the WTO to tackle the impact of free trade on environmental and social problems. Labour market rigidities were the main cause of unemployment and free trade the only solution to it, he argued. On UK-Japan trade, he welcomed recent Japanese government attempts to cut economic regulation and open the market to foreign competition but said more progress was needed. Mr Hurd hoped that Tokyo would broaden its military procurement beyond the US, which accounts for almost all the foreign portion of Japan's Y1,000bn (Dollars 10.1bn) annual defence equipment budget. In official contacts, Mr Hurd made the case for British participation in four large non-defence contracts, including a personal phone system to be introduced by NTT next year. On long-standing trade disputes with Japan, Mr Hurd said he was disappointed by remaining restrictions on foreign lawyers and high taxes on Scotch whisky, which had kept market share at a small fraction of lightly taxed shochu, a local spirit made of sweet potatoes. He also called for greater foreign access to pension fund management and insurance.</p>

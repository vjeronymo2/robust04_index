This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.84, ``Design and Fabrication code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III,'' and Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.85, ``materials Code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III, Division 1,'' list those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation in the licensing of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. Revision 11 of Regulatory Guide 1.147, ``Inservice Inspection code Case Acceptability, ASME Section XI, Division 1,'' lists those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation in the inserve inspection of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. These three guides are periodically revised to update the listings of acceptable code cases and to include the results of public comment and additional staff review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and suggestions with items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time.

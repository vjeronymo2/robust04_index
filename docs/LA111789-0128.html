			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONLY COUNTY-BASED AIRLINE PREPARES BANKRUPTCY FILING  </P> <P> Resort Commuter airline, which operated as Pan Am Commuter, has suspended  service and is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors, its  president said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Chapter 11 filing "is imminent," said Robert O'Keefe, president and chief  executive of Resort Commuter Inc.  </P> <P> O'Keefe said that Resort officials are talking to several potential buyers,  including another airline, but added that he "would not call any of the  discussions serious at this point."  </P> <P> He said the carrier has been losing about $100,000 a month.  </P> <P> Resort's financial problems stem from an ill-fated attempt last year to operate  daily service from Southern California to the Baja California resort towns of  Cabo San Lucas, La Paz and Loreto.  </P> <P> That service ended in May, limiting the airline's routes to seven daily round  trips between John Wayne Airport and Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> The decision to stop all service Wednesday placed most of Resort's 30 employees  on unpaid leaves.  </P> <P> Resort, which started in 1983 as Catalina Commuter, has been the county's only  locally based airline since AirCal was acquired by American Airlines in 1987.  </P> <P> It has operated as Pan Am Commuter for the last two years under contract to  serve Pan Am's Los Angeles fleet as a feeder carrier. It was one of five  commuter lines operating from Orange County.  </P> <P> Airport officials last month awarded Resort a 60% increase in its annual  passenger allotment because its business had been picking up and it was in  danger of exceeding the earlier annual limit of 15,500 passengers.  </P> <P> But the additional business has not been enough to staunch the hemorrhaging  caused by the Baja misadventure, O'Keefe said.  </P> <P> The carrier, owned by Beverly Newport Aviation -- of which Newport Beach auto  dealer Jim Slemons is a major shareholder -- agreed with creditors in July to  reorganize in return for a moratorium on debt collection and a debt-for-equity  swap, O'Keefe said.  </P> <P> Resort said at the time that it had $525,000 in assets and $17 million in debt,  including nearly $12 million owed to Jim Slemons Leasing, which leases three  18-seat deHavilland Twin Otter turboprop planes to Resort.  </P> <P> But efforts to find more capital -- through operating economies or new  investors -- so far have failed.  </P></p>

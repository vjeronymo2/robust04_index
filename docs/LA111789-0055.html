			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: VENICE  </P> <P> British painter Tony Bevan looks back in anger at the socioeconomic underside  of the Thatcher era in a strong series of stylized, linear portraits and  self-portraits. An aura of tense submission to unseen, brutal forces pervades  many of these works. In several images, the artist's head is turned to one side  to reveal an array of red and black markings. They read variously as strands of  hair, arteries or wounds -- mementos of the everyday violence of the streets.  </P> <P> In portraits of line-ups of twitching, slack-jawed young men, Bevan carries on  the anecdotal strain of the British figurative tradition with streamlined  vigor. At his telegraphic best he obsessively deconstructs portions of the  human anatomy -- feet, hands, heads -- to reveal the damages and depravities of  contemporary society.  </P> <P> In "Head, Leg and Red Table," an extended bare leg gashed by a long stroke of  red paint shares a table with a man's head, flung back to reveal its  ritualistic pattern of red arteries. Such images are presented on coolly  stylized, non-descriptive grounds of bright powdered pigment that collects in  little ripples, as if washed up by an invisible tide.  </P> <P> Most devastating is the large painting called "Fork," in which a hand holding a  fork emerges out of the spare geometry of a maroon-and-red field. One is  conscious of the way the fingers are tucked in, the slabs of fingernail and the  awful meat-like hunk of forearm squashed against the table edge. This is man as  consumer and devourer, greedy flesh disconnected from mind and soul. Even the  fork throws a bizarrely menacing shadow. (L.A. Louver, 55 N. Venice Blvd. and  77 Market St., Venice, to Nov. 25) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

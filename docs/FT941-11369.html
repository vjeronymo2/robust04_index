			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Vietnam market opens for US as Clinton ends trade embargo President Bill Clinton last night announced the lifting of the US embargo on trade with Vietnam, marking a big step towards normal relations between the two countries. The move opens the way for billions of dollars of US exports to the burgeoning Vietnamese market. Mr Clinton said Vietnam had provided 'significant and tangible results' in the US's search to account for more than 2,000 servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA) during the war. 'I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure co-operation with Vietnam . . . is to end the embargo on trade,' he said. While the US also plans to set up a liaison office, Mr Clinton insisted that full return to diplomatic relations would require further progress on the MIA issue. He said he had no idea how big the trade opportunities might be in Vietnam, as he had refused all briefings on this subject in order 'to make sure that the trade question did not enter into this decision'. But US businesses, 34 of which already have offices in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, have been keen to develop interests in Vietnam, as their French, Japanese, South Korean and Australian competitors have moved into its rapidly emerging economy. Last night Vietnam's mission to the United Nations welcomed the decision, saying it opened a new era. However, in the US, some veterans' groups, former prisoners of war and conservative Republicans attacked it. Mr Robert Dole, Senate minority leader, said the time for such a move had not yet arrived. Economic sanctions were begun against North Vietnam in 1964, shortly after US military advisers became involved, and were extended to the whole country after the Saigon fell in 1975. Some US businessmen had feared a partial lifting of the embargo which could have proved a severe competitive handicap. Companies such as Mobil, Chevron, Boeing, Caterpillar and Digital have shown particular interest in Vietnam. Over the last six years Vietnam has authorised 863 foreign ventures with total approved capital of around Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 5bn), and a state committee said last week that it expected Dollars 14bn of foreign investment in the next 10 years. The issue of the MIAs is highly sensitive in the US.  Former president George Bush was strongly criticised when he addressed MIA families in 1992 and Mr Clinton, who evaded military Vietnam service, was jeered during a ceremony at Washington's war memorial.

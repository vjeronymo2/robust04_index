			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Spurt in house sales raises hope of revival HOUSE SALES have risen sharply in the past two months, according to estate agents, builders and mortgage lenders, indicating that a revival may have begun in the UK housing market. December is normally a poor month for sales, which have continued to increase in the first few weeks of this year. Prices, which have fallen steeply since 1988, may also have begun to stabilise, according to a survey of more than 150 estate agents published yesterday. More than 40 per cent of agents questioned by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said prices had remained static during the three months to the end of December. This compared with only 25 per cent reporting stable prices in October and November. It added: 'There are positive signals that the four-year decline in prices may be coming to an end. Agents in all regions have reported marked increases in levels of confidence and activity.' The recent improvement was confirmed by Halifax, the country's biggest building society, which said that mortgage applications since mid-November had risen by about 10 per cent compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. 'This is a step in the right direction but we have been in this position before only to see demand slip back as economic conditions have worsened,' said the society. It added that buyers were being encouraged by house prices, which were the lowest for more than a decade compared with average earnings. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said reservations by would-be purchasers had 'risen noticeably during the first few weeks of the year'. Wimpey said January sales were more than a fifth higher than at the beginning of last year. The improvement, although from a very low base, was encouraging, the company said. It was premature, however, to talk about a sustained recovery.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Belgian Government Concerned -- </F> Bujumbura Shutdown"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels/Bujumbura, 31 Jan (BELGA) -- The Belgian  Government is "concerned" by the present political situation in  Burundi and declares that "everything must be done to allow the  Burundian Government to restore order and peace and for the  political deadlock to be relieved," a communique from the  Belgian Foreign Ministry announced on Monday [31 January].    The expression of this Belgian concern comes after the  announcement on Saturday of the "resignation" of the  Constitutional Court following an earlier announcement -- ten  days ago -- of the cancellation "until a later date" of the  investiture ceremony for the new Burundian President Cyprien  Ntaryamira, observers report.    Problems continue to beset Burundi where a "ghost town day"  action was observed in the capital Bujumbura on Monday with all  shops and offices remaining closed, a number of concordant  sources confirmed. Three members of the Tutsi ethnic group were  also apparently killed on Monday by other civilians when a coach  was attacked on the road between Mware (in the center of the  country) and Bujumbura, the same sources report.    Five members of the now resigned Constitutional Court --  including its president Mr. Gerard Nyungeko -- also protested on  Monday in a joint communique signed by the parties concerned and  received in Brussels, in which they condemn the "illegal nature  of this measure" which they consider to be "null and void."  They claim this is due to "abnormalities of form" and  "pretexts."    The communique signatories state that the joint dismissal of  certain members of the Court was solely motivated by the desire  to "avoid at all costs the remaining danger of the Court  declaring the presidential election of 13 January last as  invalid."    In any event, the Belgian Government has restated its  support  for the government of the prime minister, Sylvie Kinigi, and  elected President Ntaryamira, and calls upon "all forces in the  Burundian nation to cooperate in the national reconciliation."    Belgium had supported the process of democratization which  resulted in free elections and the founding of democratic  institutions, recalls the communique from the Belgian Foreign  Ministry.</p>

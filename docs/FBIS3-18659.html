			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and EU  [European Union] Commissioner on Foreign Affairs Hans van den  Broek will have a series of discussions on the issue of Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] during their  current joint tour of the Middle East.    These discussions will take place based on Wednesday's [2  March] instruction from the EU commission to Van den Broek to  continue his efforts to solve the dispute between Athens and  Skopje.    The Greek Government spokesman described the EU's stance as  "undoubtedly positive," and added that the Commission's stance  gives weight to the political aspects of the issue, something  the Greek Government has insisted on since the beginning.    However, a problem appeared yesterday in Prague during a  high  level CSCE meeting on the Skopje issue.    According to reports, the U.S. delegation, seconded by  Britain and Turkey, insisted on describing the Greek measures  against Skopje as a violation of human rights. In this way,  they are seeking to invalidate the Greek veto of Skopje's CSCE  membership.    As is known, the Greek Government has already made its  intentions to retract the CSCE veto, provided Skopje meets the  three Greek conditions for a resumption of the dialogue.  [passage omitted]</p>

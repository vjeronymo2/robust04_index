			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Hurd urges united Tory stand on Europe Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday issued a clear warning to the Conservative party to avoid re-fighting last year's battles over the Maastricht treaty and concentrate instead on a common platform in the forthcoming European elections. In a speech in London before his departure last night for Moscow, Mr Hurd set out the central planks of a manifesto which he hopes will avoid renewed splits in the party in the run-up to the June poll. Mr Hurd, who is drafting the manifesto, proposed a carefully balanced series of commitments to re-affirm the Conservatives as 'the party of Europe' while disavowing the centralist ambitions of some of its partners. He told a conference of Tory candidates for the Strasbourg parliament that the manifesto would offer 'a positive vision of a strong Britain in a strong Europe, thriving, decentralised, free-trading and open to the wider world'. It would have at its core the goal of renewed economic prosperity in Europe through deregulated and competitive markets, low inflation and smaller budget deficits, encouragement for productive investment and improved skills. Mr Hurd said that this British 'action plan' for Europe was becoming the orthodoxy. Alongside the Conservatives' other goals of free trade and enlargement of the EU to include the states of central and eastern Europe, it offered the opportunity to build 'a less remote, more decentralised Europe, which moves with the grain of popular opinion'. In a move to reassure the pro-European wing of his party that the government would not compromise its fundamental commitment to Europe, Mr Hurd said there was nothing 'narrow or xenophobic about such ideas'. The EU was a pioneer: 'We are safer and more prosperous because it exists'. But in a careful acknowledgement of the sensitivities of the Tory right he stressed that the Conservative message was 'the nation state is here to stay'. Enhanced co-operation on foreign policy would be based on collaboration between governments acting on the basis of unanimity. There would be no European straitjacket. Similarly the development of a European defence identity would be within and alongside the wider Nato alliance. Mr Hurd contrasted that approach with what he termed a 'Lib-Lab pact on Europe' which accepted the integrationist agenda of the Brussels bureaucrats. The enthusiasm of the opposition parties for a 'single centralised state of Europe' was one 'locked in the past', he said.</p>

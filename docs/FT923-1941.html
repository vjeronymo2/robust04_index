			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (11): The battle continues  -A look at post-unification problems / Germany AFTER two years bucking the trend of international stagnation, thanks to the extraordinary economic boost of unification, the German economy is suddenly facing a grimmer reality. The optimists had been looking for a significant recovery in exports in the second half of the year to take up the slack, after the production boom for east Germany ran out of steam. Instead, east German recovery is proving elusive, the west German economy is labouring under the huge cost of public spending transfers (running at a good DM150bn a year), and relief from the world economy is not in sight. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, went so far as to warn of a 'vicious circle' in his September budget speech. He saw a failure to spark self-sustaining growth in east Germany placing an excessive burden on the west, and in turn undermining recovery there. And yet there are hopeful signs. Only two months ago, the principal domestic and foreign pundits agreed Germany was set to recover from its 'pause' and return to a moderate, steady growth path of 3 per cent a year. The upward trend would be firmly established in 1994, most reckoned. The question is how long the pause will last. Germany needs a return to growth among its European partners to boost its own exports. But the other European economies in turn are held back by the high interest rates set by the Bundesbank, because of its fears over excessive monetary expansion, caused by the huge cash flows to east Germany. All is interconnected, and the Bundesbank is the link. The rates remain too high for the rest of Europe, in spite of the bank cutting its Lombard rate by 0.25 percentage points. Working independently of the Bonn government, the central bank irritated EC partners and angered Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, when it cranked up its discount rate in July. No matter that the main impact was to dampen domestic demand for credit, it further underlined the Bundesbank's determination to hold its rigorous anti-inflation line. The stability of the D-Mark was of paramount importance for Germany and the EC at large, the bank said. the Bundesbank felt it had to act because it had been denied support by Bonn's finance policy-makers and the social partners responsible for pay policy. Mr Waigel, who had recently unveiled his new 'hard as nails' finance policy and pledged to cap federal spending increases with a 2.5 per cent nominal increase each year until 1995, was miffed to say the least. The latest Bundesbank move to cut its interest rates, as part of the realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism was greeted by Mr Waigel as a helpful signal, opening the way for improved economic growth. At the same time, the prospect of a 'solidarity pact' to be negotiated by government, opposition, industry, trade unions and local government by 1993 has raised hopes of much more effective wage control, and public expenditure control, next year. The signals remain confusing, however. There are hopes for a compromise agreement to save some DM11bn from the bloated health service. IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering union, is the source of another encouraging indicator. As part of its 1992 pay deal, it accepted a 3 per cent rise for 1993. Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, wants no part of the joint European Fighter Aircraft project, judging it to be no longer appropriate. And in the macroeconomic battlefield, German inflation is on the retreat. Given no external shocks, it should stabilise at around 3.5 per cent next year. By then, pan-German gross domestic product growth (GDP) should be steady at around 2.5 per cent a year, with the expected recovery abroad bolstering the GNP measure to a good 3 per cent. Taking the shorter-term view, the recent Germany survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reckoned inflation could be down at around 2.75 per cent by the end of next year and GNP up to 2.8 per cent. The organisation shared deep concerns, however, about the longer-term prospects in the east. There are 340,000 workers officially listed as on short-time, but effectively producing nothing in return for wages paid out of the DM180bn Bonn will transfer during 1991. A further 390,000 are kept off the unemployment register by 'work creation' schemes, also funded by Bonn. Eastern unit labour costs, burdened by agreements made during the post-unification euphoria which promised full wage parity with the west by the end of 1995, are almost double those in the west. The former GDR, meanwhile, contributes only a meagre 7 per cent of pan-German GDP. The effects of those short-sighted pay deals are now apparent. While private capital investment in the east is hampered by high interest rates, it is still expected to increase by DM20bn next year to DM120bn. It is now universally accepted that economic convergence is going to take far longer than was expected in 1990. However, what the OECD calls 'unrealistic expectations' persist on the pay front. That is where Mr Waigel and others, jointly committed to squeezing inflation and building a sound economic base in the east, face their toughest battle next year. Persuading western trade unionists that the IG Metall's notional 3 per cent rise for 1993 should be the target for all will be hard enough. Convincing the increasingly disenchanted people in the east that they must wait even longer for pay parity may prove impossible.</p>

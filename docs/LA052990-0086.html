			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BODIES OF 5 KOREA WAR VICTIMS RETURNED TO U.S.  </P> <P> The bodies of five American servicemen killed nearly 40 years ago in the Korean  War were returned to their countrymen Monday in an emotional Memorial Day  ceremony marking them as heroes.  </P> <P> It was the first return of U.S. Korean War dead from Communist North Korea  since 1954. More than 8,000 Americans from the 1950-53 conflict are still  unaccounted for.  </P> <P> Five brown caskets and five small boxes containing buttons, dog tags, boots and  pieces of uniforms were turned over to eight U.S. congressmen by North Korea,  the enemy in the war.  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) peered down at one of the caskets  as it was opened ceremoniously to be checked and saw a skeleton beneath a white  silk cloth.  </P> <P> "All I could think was that one or two of these unidentified might have been  one or two of my friends," said Campbell, who served 13 months in Korea in the  Air Force.  </P> <P> The return of the remains is widely seen as a North Korean gesture to improve  relations with the United States. The countries do not have diplomatic  relations.  </P> <P> U.S. military officials said the remains will be flown to Hickam Air Base in  Hawaii today for a hero's welcome and the painstaking process of  identification, which could take several months.  </P> <P> Pallbearers in suits and ties, wearing white gloves and lapel pins of North  Korean leader Kim Il Sung, handed the caskets over to the congressional  delegation in the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone  separating the two Koreas.  </P> <P> The caskets were draped with blue flags of the United Nations, the flag under  which American forces fought in Korea.  </P> <P> The transfer came after Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), chairman of  the House Veterans Affairs Committee, signed a document with North Korea  confirming that he had received the remains.  </P> <P> Americans discounted speculation that there might be American prisoners still  alive in North Korea, saying both Soviet and North Korean diplomats have  assured them that is not the case.  </P> <P> "I feel happiness, sadness, bitterness," said Lt. Col. Don Byers, the only  active duty serviceman now stationed in Korea who fought in the war. "I want to  know where the rest are. Why five? Why not 500?"  </P> <P> The remains of the five returned Monday were unearthed in 1987. and are those  of two U.S. All five were believed to have been prisoners of war and died in  Hwanghae Pukto province south of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.  </P> <P> The U.S. Defense Department tentatively has identified two of the dead as Army  1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah, and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton,  20, of Chester, Pa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The Pentagon lists 33,629 Americans killed during the Korean War. There are  8,172 others missing in action and 389 prisoners of war unaccounted for. The  two sides exchanged remains through Panmunjom until 1954, with the north  returning the remains of 1,869 Americans, 607 South Koreans and 1,636 others  unidentifiable. By way of comparison: 58,156 Americans lost their lives in the  Vietnam War, with over 2,300 missing.  </P></p>

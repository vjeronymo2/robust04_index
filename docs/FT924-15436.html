			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Moves to scrap Soviet debt plan UKRAINE and Russia announced plans at the weekend to scrap the system of collective responsibility for the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union. But the two Slavic heavyweights advanced conflicting proposals for a new system. At a meeting in Kiev, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, agreed that the system, which the former Soviet republic established under intense pressure from western creditors, was flawed. Under the fierce scrutiny of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised countries, eight of the former Soviet republics, including Russia and Ukraine, assumed at the end of last year 'joint and several' responsibility for the former Soviet Union's Dollars 82bn (Pounds 46bn) foreign debt. Western creditors, fearing some of the poorer republics might default, pushed for collective assumption of the debt over the objections of independent-minded republics like Ukraine. The agreement on collective responsibility for the debt could be severely strained by the joint attack from Ukraine and Russia, which have together pledged to pay back 77.47 per cent of the total. 'We have agreed that the old system of joint and several responsibility for the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union is going nowhere and does not work,' Mr Gaidar said. However, Ukraine and Russia differed on alternatives. Ukrainian negotiators said that Russia proposed a 'zero option' to Ukraine. The idea was that Russia should assume sole responsibility for the debt with regard to western creditors and, in exchange, be granted exclusive control over the former Soviet Union's foreign assets. According to this proposal, Ukraine's share of 16.37 per cent of the debt would become Ukrainian debt to Russia. As Kiev paid off the money to Moscow, it would receive a corresponding share of the assets. Ukrainian officials objected on the grounds that it would give de jure status to Russia's de facto control over the former Soviet Union's foreign assets. Obtaining a share of these assets has been a central plank of Ukrainian foreign policy for the past year.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Crisis in French press may see more casualties There is one conspicuous absentee from the French newsstands this morning - Le Quotidien, the Paris-based daily that yesterday suspended publication after months of struggling to solve its mounting financial problems. Mr Philippe Tesson, founder and director of Le Quotidien, explained to his readers in a mournful editorial splashed across yesterday's front page that the paper was to cease publication until an emergency meeting on July 18 at which its shareholders would decide if it had a future. Le Quotidien is the latest casualty of the crisis in the French press, which has come under intense financial pressure during the economic recession. It has disappeared from the newsstands at a critical time. The future of many of France's most famous newspapers is clouded by uncertainty. Liberation, the liberal-left daily, is searching for an additional FFr80m (Pounds 9.5m) to conclude a FFr260m recapitalisation package to finance a relaunch this autumn. Le Monde, the venerable political paper, is trying to adjust to life under a new senior management team appointed several months ago. Meanwhile, Mr Robert Hersant, the enigmatic industrialist who is the most powerful figure in the French press, is under pressure from Credit Lyonnais, his bank, to repay his debts by selling France-Soir, his loss-making evening title, and even Le Figaro, the conservative daily which is France's biggest-selling national newspaper. The Havas media group and Mr Claud Bebear, chairman of the Axa insurance empire, are mooted as possible purchasers. The immediate cause of the industry's problems is the recession, which has taken a toll on advertising revenue (particularly on recruitment and property advertising) and on circulation. These difficulties have affected the entire French press, but national newspapers have suffered most of all due to competition from the historically strong regional press and television, which has expanded significantly since deregulation in the 1980s. The nationals saw their advertising revenue decline by 27 per cent last year, according to industry estimates, and are braced for a further 10 per cent fall this year against respective reductions of 14 per cent and 6 per cent for the regionals. They have also borne the brunt of the decline in circulation. Le Figaro is still the largest national, but its circulation has slipped from 432,000 to 380,000 over the past five years and is well below those of three regional dailies: Ouest France, Le Progres in Lyon and Le Parisien. These problems have been aggravated by a stream of new launches - including Aujourd'hui, the national version of Le Parisien, and InfoMatin, backed by Le Monde. The new launches have also adopted tactically low cover prices of FFr3.00 or FFr3.50, against FFr6.00 for Liberation and FFr7.00 for Le Monde. Some established titles have retaliated by slashing their prices in a desperate attempt to boost sales. Yet price cutting has proved to be a dangerous tactic as Le Quotidien discovered. It dropped its price from FFr6.00 to FFr4.00 but only increased circulation from 30,000 to 40,000. Le Quotidien's gamble has failed. It is hoping shareholders will rally round at the July 18 meeting - or that a white knight rides to its rescue.</p>

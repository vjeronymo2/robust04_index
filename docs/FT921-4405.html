			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Spotlight shines on Rhone-Poulenc - The state may dispose of its majority holding Rhone-Poulenc's announcement that the French state would probably reduce its majority shareholding and might even sell its entire 56.9 per cent stake, has cast an unaccustomed spotlight over the performance of the world's seventh largest chemicals company. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, group chairman, believes ownership is no longer an issue in France and that the difference between the political parties on the subject is minimal. The discussion, he argues, is whether the state should hold a minority interest or nothing at all. 'Whatever the conclusion, the situation will change. It could even change before the legislative elections next year,' he said. He believed there were plenty of people wanting to invest in the company. Mr Fourtou will need to convince potential investors about the group's ability to grow organically. Although the company's operating income rose 37.5 per cent to FFr6.27bn (Dollars 1.11bn) last year, most of that growth was dependent upon the additional income from the acquisition of a 68 per cent stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group. The rest of the group performed poorly. Trading profits at the non-healthcare operations actually fell FFr400m last year to FFr2.2bn on a turnover of FFr56.2bn. Moreover, the ability of the healthcare division to expand is also open to question. Only 13 per cent of growth in the health division, which generated trading profits of FFr4.2bn, came from the non-Rorer operations. In spite of the recession, Mr Fourtou is nevertheless predicting the group's operating income will increase by at least 20 per cent in both 1992 and 1993  -an achievement that should make the company highly attractive in the run-up to the government's sale. Mr Fourtou expects the health division to continue to produce growth, though not as great as last year when the Rorer acquisition helped boost sales by 23 per cent and trading profits by 210 per cent. One of the objectives of the Rorer acquisition was to reduce the dependency on the French market which is coming under increasing pressure from government pricing constraints. Before the Rorer deal, about 75 per cent of the health division's turnover was in France. Now it is about 33 per cent, said Mr Fourtou. 'The highest increase proportionally will come from the specialities operations which last year reported trading profits of only FFr100m on a turnover of FFr14.8bn. This year it should make FFr700m, not because of an upturn in the market, but rather because of synergies and productivity improvements,' said Mr Fourtou. Over the last 12 months, Rhone-Poulenc has sold some non-profitable speciality businesses and closed about seven plants in the US. There have also been widespread management changes in an effort to shake up the division. Mr Fourtou believes the group has enormous potential to generate profits over the next two to three years. The remaining growth should come from an improvement in the fibres business in Brazil, said Mr Fourtou. With a stronger US dollar and some growth in the world economy, Mr Fourtou believes his target can be achieved. Meanwhile, he plans to continue with his disposal programme and cost-cutting. He admits the programme has not been as quick as he had hoped, but he hopes to raise as much as FFr3bn this year and between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn in 1993. There has been a shortage of buyers, but he said he is willing to spend time to ensure he achieves a good price. He refused to detail which operations might be for sale. This disposal programme should help achieve one of Mr Fourtou's main priorities - to reduce the company's debts. Net debt has fallen from FFr34bn in 1990 to FFr33.1bn at the end of last year. He plans to cut the debt to equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to close to 0.5 in 1993. Mr Fourtou also expects to spend considerable time achieving synergies from the acquisition binge at the end of the 1980s. He believes it could take between three and five years. While he may not have much difficulty in convincing the government to sell its stake over the next few years, he may well find he has his work cut out convincing private investors to buy it.</p>

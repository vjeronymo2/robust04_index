To quote Mailian, the strong point of the talks was the  participation of the CSCE's Minsk Group, which helped coordinate  Russia's and CSCE's peace efforts.    He announced that Karabakh had amended the draft agreement  on  the termination of the armed conflict and gradual elimination of  its repercussions, presented by the Russian Foreign Ministry.    He expressed regret that Azerbaijan's position was non-  constructive and did not reflect the current situation.    He reiterated Karabakh's readiness to cooperate with neutral  mediators.</p>

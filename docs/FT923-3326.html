			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Doing it the Swedish way - London Markets 'A fixed exchange rate is the cornerstone of our low-inflation policy. Interest rates will remain high as long as necessary which, I hope, is not too long.' NO, THIS was not John Major's latest attempt to defend the pound with nothing stronger than an after-dinner speech. These are the words of Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister. And she is not one to wobble. When the Swedish currency looked under threat this week, overnight interest rates went up to the annual equivalent of 75 per cent. The effect on long-term rates is much smaller - mortgage rates have risen a mere 5 percentage points to 22 1/2 per cent. UK mortgage payers, take note. There is a lesson for the UK in the Swedish move. If a government has to put rates up to defend its currency, a half-hearted increase will not do the trick. Indeed, too small a rise will only make matters worse as currency speculators take it as a sign of weakness, not strength, and keep on pushing for more. If rates have to go up at all, what is needed is an increase large enough to leap-frog the currency traders' expectations and show a determined face to the world. If the UK government really has decided not to devalue sterling - and that remains in doubt, since the history of devaluations is that governments always say they will not until they do - what options are left to Major and chancellor Norman Lamont? There are three. First, Major can try to talk his way out of it, as he did on Thursday night at the Scottish CBI dinner. The prime minister's readiness to stake his career on the government's handling of sterling's problems - and, at the same time, stake your job, my mortgage and the entire British economy - is not likely to prove a terribly effective signal to the foreign exchange markets in all but the short term. Indeed, the pound barely perked up yesterday. The next thing is to dream up some more whizzy schemes, like last week's deal to borrow D-marks in order to buy sterling. That did little more than buy some time for the pound. That, and a rather weedy promise not to increase interest rates - unless circumstances change - extracted from the Germans last weekend, kept sterling above DM 2.80 until about Monday lunchtime. The third option is a sudden interest rate rise, although perhaps not quite of the magnitude of the Swedish increase. A bold enough move would keep the pound in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). It seems that the government's strategy is to try to cling on without raising interest rates until the result of the French referendum on Maastricht is clear. Voting takes place next Sunday. As the week closed, it was looking likely that the pound could hold out that long, helped in part by news of another decline in the inflation rate; that the French were inclining towards Yes; and that the stock market was recovering. But the market is once again fixing on a moment and not looking beyond it. While many have asked what would happen if the French voted No - and assumed it would be bad news for sterling and, indeed, the entire ERM - few have considered what would happen after a Yes vote beyond thinking that everything would be hunky dory again. In fact, a Yes vote could still be bad for sterling. It could be compared with the excuse of the dollar. This said that the pound's weakness against the D-mark was not sterling's fault but the dollar's. Then, the dollar recovered yesterday and sterling did not. Sterling's problems go beyond those of most of the ERM currencies, barring Italy, and a Yes vote will not drive them away. Expect a bout of euphoria followed fairly swiftly by a reassessment of the outlook for the pound. That might be the moment when interest rates have to go higher. It would, however, be about the worst news the UK economy could have, even after being described this week by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR and a veritable captain of industry, as a desert. Real interest rates have, in any case, been rising ever since sterling joined the ERM in October 1990, as the chart shows, even though actual rates have fallen. Higher nominal interest rates, as well, would probably turn recession to slump and certainly drive the stock market lower. This week's stream of company news has not of itself been wholly bad. The likes of Glaxo, Prudential, Cadbury Schweppes, Rugby and RTZ managed to increase profits. But the message is in the statements of many company chairmen. Summarised, these say: the economy is not getting better, there is no sign when it will get better and, if anything, it is getting worse. Consensus forecasts for gross domestic product, the simplest measure of the economy's health, have been revised down once more and now centre on an 0.8 per cent fall this year. Consumer confidence has fallen again and indications of retail sales in August were dismal. Yesterday Tarmac, the building materials group, announced closures and redundancies in its bricks and blocks business as it tries to sort out overcapacity in the industry. This is capacity which could be lost permanently to the British economy. The building sector and the food industry have provided much of the depressing news this week. Dividend cuts from Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Amec, with the first two announcing losses as well, suggest those companies can see no end in sight to the gloom. In food, Hillsdown, Booker and United Biscuits showed that this sector could disappoint, too. All this in pursuit of low inflation. Yesterday's inflation figure, showing an annual 3.6 per cent increase in prices, gave shares a boost. Compare that with Swedish inflation of 2.2 per cent. But, one asks, where is the victory in cutting inflation if the result is an economic desert? And what are the chances of keeping inflation down when, or if, economic growth eventually returns?</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3 JEWELRY STORES PLACED OFF-LIMITS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THREE STORES, INCLUDING DOWNTOWN GIANT JEWELRY, ARE PUT OFF-LIMITS  BECAUSE OF ALLEGED HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND INFLATED PRICES.  </P> <P> Three San Diego County jewelry stores have been placed off-limits to military  personnel after more than 90 sailors and Marines complained of high-pressure  sales tactics and inflated prices, Navy officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Young recruits, many awaiting orders for Operation Desert Shield, told the  legal affairs office that they were pressured into buying overpriced jewelry --  including 14-carat gold crosses decorated with diamonds and sapphires -- for  their parents, said Cmdr. Steve Epstein, judge advocate general for San Diego  Naval Base headquarters.  </P> <P> Epstein identified the San Diego stores as Giant Jewelry Co., 308 W. Broadway,  San Diego; S &amp; S Enterprises, 2702 Lytton St., San Diego, and Sound  Stations, 213-B N. Hill St., Oceanside.  </P> <P> The store manager at Giant Jewelry declined comment, referring calls to the  store's attorney, who was not available. No one answered calls at the other two  locations. Epstein said, however, that the stores have denied using  high-pressure sales techniques.  </P> <P> Epstein said his office has passed the information to the district attorney's  office and to the Better Business Bureau.  </P> <P> Epstein said sales people would target raw recruits. He said sales people would  go out on the street in front of the stores and entice the recruits inside with  offers of free pizza, coupons to area restaurants or offers to play pool and  watch television inside.  </P> <P> "The common practice was to lean on these kids and prey on their immaturity,"  he said. Many are young and away from home for the first time.  </P> <P> Sales people would ask who was the most important woman in their lives and when  they said their mother, sales people would give them a mom-and-apple-pie pitch,  Epstein continued. They would ask recruits when was the last time they had  written to their moms and urge them to do something nice for her.  </P> <P> Sales people would also physically block the door to keep the recruits from  leaving, he said. "It was not an isolated thing. It was a common thread  throughout the cases."  </P> <P> Epstein said some of recruits told him they had bought pieces for as much as  $699 and had them appraised for as little as $100.  </P> <P> "We understand merchants have to turn a profit," Epstein said. "But, if these  folks were selling the same merchandise at a mall, would they be selling it at  $700 a pop? My belief is they would not."  </P> <P> Epstein said his legal affairs office has complained to the stores for three  years without success. He said the three stores were all owned by Giant Jewelry  when contacted in July, but two of the stores have since been sold.  </P> <P> Putting an establishment off-limits is a last resort, Epstein said. But,  because complaints have continued, Navy and Marine personnel have been ordered  not to frequent the stores.  </P> <P> "We can't tell the stores what to do, but we can tell Navy and Marine Corps  personnel they cannot go into those stores," Epstein said.  </P> <P> The order was issued by the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board, which  considers reports and takes action against establishments that are determined  to be detrimental to the health and well-being of military personnel.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Profit-pay benefits on tax 'abused' Profit-related pay has become part of the tax avoidance industry and its tax benefits have been abused, says a report by the Institute of Employment Rights, Richard Donkin writes. The study joins a growing chorus of disillusionment with PRP as a means of rewarding employees. Its author Ms Hazel McLean, a Cambridge University law lecturer, says that PRP has failed to motivate employees or make labour costs more flexible by varying with levels of profitability as its proponents had claimed. Ms McLean says recent legislation on PRP and employee share option schemes has done nothing to encourage economic or industrial democracy. She says she has found little evidence that it has either encouraged identification of employees with their companies or provided incentives for employees to increase company profits - two of the main principles behind its origin. Companies are becoming more open in their accounts about how they pay their directors and what directors' share options are worth, says Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly accounts monitor. The May issue says that the growing mood among companies to be open about links between directors' pay and future performance, shows that pressure from institutional investors and the Cadbury committee, which last year made recommendations for complete information on directors' remuneration, is paying off.</p>

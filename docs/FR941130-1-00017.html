			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC recently completed a survey to update the economic profile of its materials licensees. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the continued efficacy of NRC's current size standards and to obtain the information that is necessary to determine the necessity and effect of a separate standard for manufacturers within the context of the nuclear industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the licensees who responded to the survey request, approximately 20 percent (1131 of 5704) indicated that manufacturing was a primary line of their business. This indicates that a number of licensees would benefit from the establishment of a separate standard for businesses engaged in manufacturing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NRC is proposing to adopt a size standard for business concerns that are manufacturing entities. The NRC proposes to use a standard of 500 or fewer employees. This standard is the most commonly used SBA employee standard and would be the standard applicable to the types of industries that would hold an NRC license. Under this standard, approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 48 percent of the licensees who indicated that they were manufacturers would qualify as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 2, 1993 (58 FR 46573), SBA published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that would have streamlined its size standards by reducing the number of its fixed size standard levels from 30 to 9. As part of this proposed rule, the SBA proposed to adjust most of its receipts-based size standard levels to mitigate the effects of inflation from 1984 to the present. In a final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16513), the SBA adopted only that portion of its proposed rule that increased its receipts-based size standards as a result of inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC is proposing to adjust its receipts-based size standard to accommodate inflation and to conform to the SBA final rule. The NRC proposes to raise its receipts-based small business size standard from $3.5 million to $5 million. After analyzing the data received in response to the survey and the revised SBA size standards, the NRC also is proposing to eliminate the separate $1 million size standard for private practice physicians and apply the revised receipts-based size standard of $5 million to this class of licensees. This would mirror the revised SBA standard of $5 million for medical practitioners. The survey of materials licensees indicates that 26 percent qualify as small entities under current NRC standards. If the NRC adopts the proposed revisions to its size standards presented in this document, 35 percent of these licensees would qualify as small entities, an increase of 9 percent. When NRC adopted its size standards in 1985, the NRC staff estimated that approximately 35 percent of the materials licensees would qualify as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) amended the Small Business Act concerning the establishment of agency specific small business size standards. The proposed NRC size standards have been developed so as to meet the criteria specified in Pub. L. 102&hyph;366. The NRC has submitted these proposed size standards for the review and approval of the Administrator, SBA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule also would codify NRC's size standards in Part 2 of the Commission's regulations. Previously, NRC's size standards had been published in the notices section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this proposed rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0136.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

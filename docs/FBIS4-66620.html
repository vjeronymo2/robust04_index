			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khadidja Zeghloul, Samir Knayaz, and Ryad </F> Kramdi: "First Truth Gathered From the Director of the Prison:  `Warning Signals Were Not Taken Seriously'"]    [Text] He is still clearly in shock and his drawn face and  eyes reddened by a week of insomnia convey the man's total  confusion and stupefaction. No, he can tell the press nothing.  "You have to see the interministerial commission in charge of  the inquiry."    Nevertheless the director of the Tazoult prison confirmed  for  us that he had sent several reports to the justice minister in  which he alerted the agency that he reported to about the  urgency of improving security at the Lambese prison. The first  of his letters was dated two years ago and thus coincides with  the emergence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Faced with  this phenomenon, which was becoming greater and greater, and  even attacking several prisons, it was necessary, he wrote, to  step up security measures. Despite the precedents of Sidi-Ghiles  and the Batna prison from which Islamic fundamentalist prisoners  were reported to have escaped in 1983, according to the local  newspaper EL- ATLAS, and despite the revolts and attacks on  prisoner convoys, the director of the Tazoult prison got no  response. None.    All the same, that silence was disturbing when you consider  that that prison housed hardened terrorists while maintaining an  absolutely ordinary security force. Recently the cries for help  from Tazoult's director had become urgent. He frankly feared  what finally happened: a full-fledged attack on the prison. What  in particular had added urgency to his alarm?    Besides the general security situation, persistent rumors  had  reached him describing imminent attacks on the prison in which  Islamic fundamentalist prisoners serve their sentences. These  rumors even specified the date of the "release" operations: they  were scheduled initially for 27 December, in commemoration of  the so-called clean and honest elections.    Why, given current political and security conditions, were  these things not taken seriously? "I do not understand," the  director says simply. Returning to the circumstances of the  attack and breakout, he told us that he was with his family in  their home at the prison when the first gunshots were fired. "I  had just broken the fast when armed men, whose number I cannot  give precisely, began their assault." The vehicles used (light  ones or trucks), he would continue, remained outside, whereas  the police station and gendarme brigade were under siege and the  village surrounded. "They had taken up their positions all  around in the various neighborhoods and were letting off rounds  of gunfire as a diversion at the time we were attacked."    Outside reinforcements, coming basically from Batna, he  added, "only arrived on the scene at around 2100. Over 3 or 4  km, the road was torn up in places and strewn with nails in  others. Vehicles left on the pavement also blocked the road."  But this, in his eyes, does not justify such a delay, all the  more so, he went on to tell us, because in the city of Batna  there are air forces. "The two helicopters they have there could  easily get to the village in the space of two or three minutes  and step in, but that did not happen."    In his reports to the Justice Ministry, the director of the  prison mentioned his suspicions with regard to certain guards.  These suspicions turned out to be well founded: five of the  guards took the key to the grounds with the attackers and the  terrorist prisoners. Tazoult's director is sure of it: these  five guards were accomplices; they took part in the attack. So  they are not hostages, as the laconic communique from the  Justice Ministry stated. Yes, everything seems highly unusual,  beginning with the huge delay the security forces took before  stepping in. Returning to the breakout, only the prison's two  small gates had been opened by staff who were accomplices. It  was at that moment that certain guards and the prison director  himself, from his home, tried to resist, but the attackers  outnumbered them: "one of my men would die in the scuffle and  three others were wounded."    The gunshots of the attackers were interspersed, according  to  our informant, by shouts of "Allahu Akbar, We will live or we  will die."    "I don't understand a thing," the director repeats. No one  understands how this announced attack on a prison that was  supposed to be impregnable, and in which the most dangerous  terrorists, those from Guemmar and Bechar, were incarcerated,  could have been carried off with such alarming ease. Yes, highly  unusual.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NCAA COUNCIL FAILS TO DECIDE MILLS ELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> The NCAA Council has informed the University of Arizona that it has not reached  a decision regarding the eligibility of Chris Mills, who transferred from  Kentucky, the school said today.  </P> <P> The council, meeting in San Diego, told the university that it is referring the  matter to the infractions committee for review later this month.  </P> <P> Arizona officials sent the NCAA an appeal in late July asking that Mills, a  6-foot-7 swing man from Fairfax High in Los Angeles, be declared eligible for  the 1989-90 season.  </P> <P> Mills, the center figure during the NCAA's investigation of Kentucky, was  declared ineligible at Kentucky earlier this summer after the NCAA levied  sanctions against the Kentucky program.  </P> <P> The NCAA alleged that former Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent $1,000  by courier to Mills' father, Claud, during the recruitment of Mills.  </P></p>

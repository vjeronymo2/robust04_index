			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Metropolitan Police Commissioner launches policing charter MR PAUL CONDON, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, yesterday launched a policing charter setting out service targets for London's police service, John Willman writes. The charter's launch was overshadowed by allegations of police corruption broadcast by BBC TV's Panorama programme on Monday. Three police officers have been arrested and an inquiry is under way into the allegations. Among the targets in the charter is a promise that the police will arrive at urgent incidents within 12 minutes. The performance of each police station against the targets will be published every three months. Mr Condon said the charter reflected what Londoners had told the service they wanted.</p>

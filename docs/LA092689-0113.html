			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T Trims Some Rates: AT&amp;T said it is cutting long-distance charges  slightly within California for competitive purposes, the second time this year  that it has reduced such rates. The cut, which applies to all rate periods  effective Sunday, means that a five-minute daytime call between Los Angeles and  San Francisco will drop to $1.20 from $1.23; a call between San Diego and Los  Angeles will drop to $1.02 from $1.07. AT&amp;T also will put into effect  Sunday previously announced cuts for WATS lines and 800 service. The three cuts  total $37.9 million in annual income for AT&amp;T.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Natural Law springs a surprise in the poster war THE BIG surprise of the poster war has been the sudden late emergence of the Natural Law party, which since last Thursday has booked more than 6,500 poster sites across the UK at a cost of some Pounds 250,000. Mr Alan Simmons, managing director of Concord Posterlink, the UK's largest specialist outdoor buying agency, was 'fully contemplating red-hot news at the end of the campaign but it's just not there' - the main parties have not increased their weight of posters from one week ago. Mr Simmons' company completed its latest intelligence gathering yesterday. It revealed that the Conservatives were occupying 4,500 48-sheet sites, Labour 2,200 and the Liberal Democrats 500 - the same figures as at the end of March. The Natural Law party has spent its money on buying much smaller 32-sheet, 16-sheet and four-sheet poster sites. A further surprise for Mr Simmons has been the failure so far of leading brewers to step in and hand over pre-booked sites to the Conservatives - 'the first time for many decades that has not happened'. Concord Posterlink's research indicates the Conservatives have spent most on posters, about Pounds 1 1/2 m throughout the campaign, with Labour (Pounds 750,000) and the Liberal Democrats (Pounds 175,000) trailing. Mr Simmons described the Conservative poster campaign as 'saturation coverage'; a typical large consumer product might occupy some 2,000 48-sheet sites for a month, or at most 3,500 for one week. According to Mr Simmons 'it is getting a bit too late for any of the parties to organise a late blitz on the poster front'. He expected no dramatic changes in the advertising campaign in the last few days. The Conservative party yesterday launched a new poster which attempts a positive image. It features a beaming John Major next to smiling schoolchildren. However, by yesterday afternoon the graffiti artists in north London had already been out in force, adding a neat, small black moustache to Mr Major's face.</p>

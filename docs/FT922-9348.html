			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Processed shark fin on the menu No gourmet Chinese dinner is complete without a dish of shark's fin. But preparing the delicacy is a long, tedious and labour-intensive task. Traditional preparation takes many hours and involves soaking the shark's fin several times before removing the scales and sand with a knife. After that the shark's fin is deboned and the prized stringy ligaments are removed ready for cooking. Neils Elvig, a technical service manager with Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and enzymes group, stumbled across the problem a year ago during his chats with local businessmen and began to experiment in the company's laboratory. He discovered that shark's fin could be scaled in a shorter time with less effort if it was soaked in a proteolytic enzyme called Neutrase. The procedure is simple, effective and hygienic. Despite initial hesitancy, processed shark's fin has found growing acceptance from top chefs in Malaysia. Novo Nordisk: Kuala Lumpur, 603 230 3267.</p>

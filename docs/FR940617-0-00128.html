			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not incorporating HC, CO, and PM into the averaging, banking and trading option. The flexibility provided by this option is desirable for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  compliance, where there are quantifiable environmental benefits to be gained. However, because HC, CO and PM standards have been promulgated solely for harmonization with California and Europe (neither of which allow ABT), and because the benefits for HC, CO, and PM are not similarly quantifiable, ABT is not appropriate for HC, CO, and PM. Moreover, the burden to the Agency and to industry of tracking and enforcing ABT for HC, CO, and PM would defeat the Agency's intent to minimize such burdens to the degree that the Agency would reconsider its decision to adopt those standards at all, an option the Agency is not willing to choose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Smoke Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned EPA's authority to regulate smoke emissions, stating that EPA did not demonstrate as required in CAA section 213(a)(4) that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. EPA made a finding in the NPRM that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution, based on smoke's impact on visibility. As evidence of smoke's significant contribution to air pollution, EPA specifically cited in its draft Regulatory Support Document the agreement to reduce smoke from the Navajo Generating Station to improve visibility in the Grand Canyon. EPA discussed in the NPRM why smoke may reasonably be anticipated to endanger both public health and welfare. EPA stated that ``there are indications that visible smoke may have an adverse effect on health'' (58 FR 28809, 28845). The particles that make up smoke, about 2.5 microns in diameter, are of a size that reflects and refracts light. These particles are sufficiently small to be inhaled into the lower lung cavities, thus posing a potential health threat to the inhaler. See, for example, volume 329 of the New England Journal of Medicine (December 9, 1993, p. 1753) for a discussion of the association between particulate air pollution and mortality rates. EPA also cited damage through soiling of urban buildings, homes, cars and other property. EPA has met the statutory mandate of CAA section 213(a)(4) for smoke, and stands by its assessments presented in the NPRM and RSD for this rulemaking. Hence, EPA is retaining the smoke standards as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Lower Emission Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmentalists and states requested that EPA commit to a second phase of emission standards for new large nonroad CI engines on an ``aggressive'' timeline. They are satisfied with the level of the standard only on an interim basis and want to quickly move to a more stringent standard. One commenter expressed concern that, without specifying a deadline for promulgating a second phase of emission standards in this rule, manufacturers will be slow to cooperate with EPA in developing the new test procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engine manufacturers have asked for assurances that they will have from five to eight years of ``regulatory stability'' before more stringent standards are promulgated, in order to amortize their investment in the current standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that more stringent emission standards should not be promulgated until the existing test cycle has been verified to be representative, or until a more representative test cycle has been developed. EPA is currently working with engine manufacturers to evaluate actual in-use operating conditions and the test procedures adopted in this rule. These data will be used to determine the necessary modifications to the test procedures to ensure that more stringent emission standards in the future result in actual in-use emission reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has every intention of moving forward to determine the most appropriate test procedures to use in future regulation of the engines covered in this rule. EPA has found that coordination with industry on clearly technical projects such as this is most beneficial since it allows the Agency to receive early input as procedures are being developed. Such early feedback creates an atmosphere of consensus-building and allows the Agency to promulgate rules that are more equitable, efficient and effective. At this point, however, EPA cannot make assurances that it will provide engine manufacturers ``five to eight years of regulatory stability,'' and neither can it commit to promulgating more stringent standards on an ``aggressive'' timeline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Exemptions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Mining Congress and other commenters in the mining industry requested that surface mining equipment be exempted from regulation since, according to the commenters, mining equipment operates well outside nonattainment areas. One commenter within the mining industry suggested that regulation of mining equipment should be on a case-by-case basis. In other words, if the mining equipment at a site is shown to contribute to ozone or CO nonattainment, the equipment at that site should be subject to regulation. As an alternative, these commenters suggested horsepower cutoffs ranging from 500 to 750 horsepower, above which nonroad equipment would be exempted from compliance. These commenters also took exception to EPA's inclusion of mining equipment in the construction equipment category, stating that mining equipment is larger and more specialized than construction equipment. Further, they stated that while construction equipment may be used at a mine site, mining equipment is never used on a typical urban construction site. These commenters also questioned EPA's application of the proposed regulations to mining equipment since emissions from such equipment were not included in the analysis contained in the Nonroad Study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency sees no justifiable reason for exempting from regulation all mining equipment or mining equipment above certain horsepower cutoffs. The Agency is obliged to regulate all classes or categories of new nonroad engines that cause or contribute (without reference to significance) to ozone or CO pollution in more than one nonattainment area. The Agency believes that such equipment, even if operating outside nonattainment areas, is capable of contributing to ozone nonattainment and, therefore, the Agency cannot justify an exemption of mining equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> I Hear a Symphony: Paul McCartney has gone classical. The former Beatle will  return to his hometown of Liverpool, England, in June for the premiere of his  first classical composition, "Liverpool Oratorio."  </P> <P> The work is the semi-autobiographical tale of the life of a Liverpool war baby  and was written with conductor Carl Davis. McCartney won't be part of the  performance, which will feature Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and about 200 musicians and  singers when it's performed in Liverpool Cathedral. McCartney says writing the  piece was challenging because he had no experience in classical music as a  child. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

During a meeting with local businessmen and former ITESM  [Monterrey Institute of Higher Technology] students, the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate  promised to consolidate economic stabilization and  modernization, as well as to promote capital investment as a  core goal of his economic program.    "The goal is to offer investors sufficient competitive  conditions on an international level -- conditions that include  favorable capital expenses, fiscal incentives, government  regulations, infrastructure, and support in attracting human  resources and technology."    In an address lasting more than 35 minutes, which was  interrupted on nine separate occasions, Colosio Murrieta  asserted that to achieve growth it is first necessary to  consolidate macroeconomic stability while encouraging  competition and microeconomic efficiency.    "I am deeply convinced we are at the dawn of a new phase of  economic growth," Colosio Murrieta said.    According to the PRI presidential candidate, his program is  designed to steer the economy in a steady, clear, and planned  manner to achieve the fundamental economic development the  country expects.    "I am determined to consolidate economic stabilization and  modernization, and this will benefit every Mexican household,  guarantee low inflation, preserve fiscal responsibility, and  encourage structural changes."    He said his social program will face some of the most  significant hurdles, because he is seeking to create more  health, education, housing, and nutritional programs for the  people, especially for Mexico's children and younger generation.    He called for sustained, shared, and balanced growth that  will take into account environmental concerns before opening  investment opportunities in Mexico. He also endorsed the  promotion of domestic and foreign savings to spur investments.    Colosio also said he believes it is important to confront  inequalities: "I have witnessed financial irresponsibility while  millions of Mexicans were searching for productive employment.  Financial irresponsibility is gone forever, never to return."    Participants in the event, which began at 1445, included Mr.  Eugenio Garza Laguera, president of the ITESM Teaching and  Higher Research Board of Directors, and his wife Eva Gonda de  Garza Laguera. Also present were businessmen Alberto Santos de  Hoyos, Eugenio Clariond Reyes, Javier Garza Sepulveda, Enrique  Regules, and Alfonso Ramos, all of whom welcomed the PRI  candidate.    At the start of his address, Colosio Murrieta stated that  during his arrival in Monterrey he was reminded of his  university years, and he fondly recalled Mr. Eugenio Garza Sada.  He noted it was in Monterrey that he first seriously reflected  on the economy. Nearly three decades later, he said, he can  honestly say it was a privilege to study at ITESM.    Alfonso Ramos, one of the organizers of the event, said all  of the participants pledged support for the PRI candidate. At  the conclusion of the event, the PRI candidate received a small  statue of a lamb -- the ITESM symbol.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Mu Ni (4476 1441): "The </F> Phantom Refuses to Leave"]    [Text] At the beginning of the New Year, Sudan President  al-Bashir announced the deportation of the British ambassador on  National Day, celebrating the 38th anniversary of shaking off  the British colonial rule. This has taught "a lesson" to the  British Government, which interfered in its internal affairs.    The deportation of the ambassador of a foreign country is  not  a minor matter on which the decision can be easily made in  diplomatic affairs. The Sudanese Government showed the British  ambassador the door only after it had conclusive evidence  proving he had "interfered in something which had nothing to do  with him." The British Foreign Ministry afterward asked the  Sudanese Government to reconsider the decision and has now  announced the deporting of the Sudanese ambassador from London.  However, this unreasonable move cannot change the fact that  Britain has interfered in the internal affairs of another  country and it only shows the phantom of the former British  Empire refuses to leave.    Here, we might as well look back at an event which occurred  over 100 years ago. If the British Government is not forgetful,  it should remember better than others how Gordon died in the  Sudan. As a colonial governor, Gordon was insufferably arrogant  and acted like a tyrant. He was, of course, more imposing than  the present British ambassador to Sudan. However, when the  Sudan national hero Mahdi started an uprising, the vigorous and  heroic struggle against the British colonial rule immediately  swept across Sudan and the people captured Khartoum. The  feeling of the fighters in the uprising was high and they  pierced Gordon's body with a sharp spear. This butcher, whose  hands had once been stained with the blood of the Chinese  people, finally died on the staircase of the British governor's  residence. This was a punishment meted out by history for the  colonialist.    What is surprising is that today, when the world has  developed to the end of the 20th century and every shred of the  "prestige" of the British Empire has been swept away, some  people in the British Government are still following the example  of their ancestors and are engaged in activities which interfere  in the internal affairs of other countries. They really show no  understanding of the times.</p>

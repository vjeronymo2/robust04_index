			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall sharply on Colosio assassination US Treasury bonds plunged yesterday as news of the assassination of the leading Mexican presidential candidate sent a chill through an already jittery market. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 25/32 at 91 1/8 , with the yield rising to 6.957 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 100 1/32 , to yield 5.092 per cent. The sharp downturn came in the wake of the turmoil which hit the Brady bond market following the shooting of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio at a campaign stop in Tijuana the previous evening. Treasury bonds were suffering, along with US share prices, as investors juggled their portfolios in anticipation of further declines in Brady bonds and other emerging-market debt instruments. It also became apparent that nervousness over the upward direction of interest rates had not subsided with the Federal Reserve's lifting of the Fed Funds target two days earlier. Surging gold prices and the decision by some US commercial banks to increase their prime lending rate contributed to the dismal mood. In yet another concern, President Clinton was scheduled to hold a press conference later in the evening. Traders were nervous about further revelations on the Whitewater affair which could damage the president's political standing. Amid the whirlwind of developments competing for attention, the day's economic news passed with little notice. The Labor Deparment said claims for unemployment benefit last week dipped by 5,000, against expectations of a 2,000 fall. A sharp fall in US Treasuries at the opening and deteriorating expectations of a further cut in UK interest rates sent long-dated UK government bonds tumbling by more than two points yesterday afternoon. Fears that international investors would further lighten their holdings of European government bonds to offset losses on their investments in Latin American debt also contributed to the sell-off, analysts said. Traders said the sheer pace of the fall prompted the Bank of England to try to stabilise prices by offering to buy back cash gilts from a number of gilt-edged market-makers. They said the Bank was seen intervening between the levels of 107 1/8 and 107 5/16 on the June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe. The amount of the intervention was thought to be less than Pounds 50m. There was no comment from the Bank. Some analysts said the gilts market appeared to have lost touch with its fundamentals but they feared that the market still had further to fall. 'The market has been spooked. . . but the fall is not justified by the UK's inflation prospects,' said Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers. Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg, agreed that Wednesday's inflation data did not warrant such a severe drop in prices. But he said there had been some significant selling of short-dated maturities which indicated that hopes of further rate cuts were fading fast. 'If the economic recovery is as solid as it appears to be . . . we are going to experience upward pressures on inflation in 1995,' he said. He also noted that the December 1995 short sterling contract reflected market expectations of a base rate of 7 per cent by the end of 1995. Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the fall in the June contract below 108 7/32 , the low for the year, unleashed a rush of stop-loss selling in the futures market. This in turn dragged down the cash market where the yields on short-dated paper rose by 17 basis points and by as much as 24 basis points on 10-year gilts. By the late afternoon, the June contract traded at 106 13/16 , down 2 1/4 points, in active volume of 134,626 contracts. German government bonds initially held firm, supported by better-than-expected M3 data for February. But by mid-afternoon, bunds succumbed to the uncertainty which was dragging down other markets. The June contract of bund future on Liffe stood 0.77 point lower at 95.47 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.55. Nevertheless, analysts said the M3 results, combined with the strength of the D-Mark, held out some promise for bunds since those factors should enable the Bundesbank to continue to ease monetary policy. The Bundesbank said February M3 rose 17.6 per cent, which was broadly in line with market expectations and well below Wednesday's rumours of 30 per cent. Yesterday's 10 basis point cut in the Bank of France's intervention rate to 6 per cent was in line with market expectations and failed to protect French government bonds completely from the weakness in other markets. But they fell less than their European counterparts, with the June contract of the 10-year notional French government bond on the Matif giving up 0.42 point to 122.60 in the late afternoon.</p>

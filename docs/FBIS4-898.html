			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Maputo this morning saw the opening of the first  national meeting of structures connected with the electoral  process. [passage omitted]    Speaking at the opening of that meeting this morning, Dr.  Brazao Mazula, National Elections Commission [CNE] chairman,  said that the government and the Mozambique National Resistance,  Renamo, had accelerated the [words indistinct] of territorial  administration. Dr. Mazula said that all people are invited to  take part in the process.    In his speech, CNE Chairman Dr. Mazula noted that it was  crucial that the media help provide civic education to the  people and disseminate information concerning electoral  mechanisms. He added that the Electoral Law and the General  Peace Accord are the working tools for the holding of elections.    In turn, UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello said that the  international community hopes the democratization process will  be a success in this country. Ajello also told those present  that the UN Security Council will meet soon to approve an  extension of the UN Operations in Mozambique's mandate until  October. The UN special representative also noted that delays  in the implementation of the General Peace Accord should not be  seen as time wasted but, rather, quote, as time that helped  consolidate those things that had been approved, unquote.

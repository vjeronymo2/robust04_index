			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Japan expressed its support  Monday for air strikes by two NATO aircraft Sunday on Bosnian  Serb forces advancing on the Moslem town of Gorazde in Bosnia.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference, "we understand it was an unavoidable action taken in  line with UN resolutions."    Japan hopes that the Serbs take the air raids as a message  from the international community and that the dispute be settled  through talks, the top government spokesman said.</p>

Can you tell us more about the arrangements reached in  Cairo last night?    [Peres] No, I prefer reporting about things that have been  finalized, and that has not yet been finalized. Important  progress has been made though.    [Zissowitz] What points are still left open?    [Peres] There is unfinished business on both issues  discussed.    [Zissowitz] Including the issue of the Palestinian police  force?    [Peres] Yes, there are problems of numbers and powers, but I  do not want to go into that because it only increases the gaps  while negotiations are still in progress. But the very fact  that the negotiations are back on track and progress can be made  on them is the most important thing that took place in Cairo.    [Raz] Mr. Peres, I would like to ask you about the  Palestinian police. Although things have not yet been  finalized, how will it be possible to maintain security there  since so many elements are involved?    [Peres] There might be many elements, but there will be one  element responsible for all decisions dealing with opening fire.  There will be no negotiations during an operation.    [Raz] What will happen for instance if the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] has an operation against a Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] squad, as was the case this week, and the  Palestinian police force is deployed between the IDF and the  structure in which the terrorists are holed up?    [Peres] We continue to have overall responsibility for  security in the territories. We will not and cannot free  ourselves of that responsibility. The State of Israel will  continue to be responsible for the lives of all the people and  will act against those who endanger lives, whether of Jews or  Arabs.    [Zissowitz] Is it clear to whom the armed Palestinian police  will be subordinate?    [Peres] I do not want to go into that, but it is clear that  they will be subordinate to a single authority.    [Zissowitz] On which issue has Israel given in to the  Palestinians in the talks?    [Peres] The problem is not of giving in. Israel faced a new  situation. Let us discuss the real problem. A monster  surrounded by wild weeds appeared among us, something that does  not have easy solutions. We must find solutions to situations  we did not ask for and we are also dealing with the  sensitivities of the residents. It is not a symmetric situation  whereby there is a Arab state facing an Israeli state and a  Palestinian police force facing an Israeli police force. There  is a single state responsible for security, and an issue which  starts with peoples' sensitivities. Before you see a knife you  have to consider what is motivating it, before you look at a  rifle you have to consider what causes somebody to pull the  trigger. We must deal with all that in a responsible way. We  are not in some circus where you check the trapeze every day to  see how far you are jumping. We are a very responsible and  determined government.    [Raz] Mr. Peres, will the Palestinian police in Hebron  impose its powers on the Jewish settlers?    [Peres] It will not deal with that at all. We are not in  favor of mixing powers, but I do not want to go in to all those  details; it is too early. Only when the negotiations are  completed will we be able to make public all the details. We  are aware of the subjects you have raised. We do not want to  bring about friction and clashes; on the contrary, we want to  reduce friction and prevent clashes, we want to assure security.    [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinians withdrawn their demand to  evacuate the Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron?    [Peres] They never presented it as an ultimatum. When they  raised the issue, even though not as an ultimatum, we told them  unequivocally that the issue of settlers, settlements, and  population dispersal are Israel's sole responsibility and we  will not agree to any change because of pressures or  negotiations. In the negotiations themselves we agreed that all  the settlements can remain intact.    [Zissowitz] At least for the time being, will the Jewish  settlers remain where they are?    [Peres] I do not know what for the time being means. It is  hard to constantly operate with a stopwatch and count the hours.    [Zissowitz] I would like to know whether the demand to  evacuate the settlers has been removed from the agenda?    [Peres] It does not depend on the Palestinians at all, it is  a decision Israel must make in a responsible way and on its own.  I have nothing to say about proposals or intentions. A  government does not have to make public proposals and intentions  on a daily basis. When it decides to make a decision it does so.    [Raz] Mr. Peres, on Tuesday the Gaza-Jericho talks resume  and that is in fact the main issue in the negotiations.    [Peres] That is correct.    [Raz] How long will that phase take and when will the new  deployment on the ground -- the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho  -- start?    [Peres] There is no doubt that there will be speedy  negotiations. All the committees, including the economic  committee, will convene in Cairo in order to coordinate and  speed up the negotiations. There are differences of opinion.  There are those who say it will take two weeks and there are  those who say it will take three weeks. What I can say with  certainty is that all the sides, definitely our side, will  contribute everything needed to speed up the process.    [Zissowitz] The talks with the Palestinians will continue in  Cairo and not Washington?    [Peres] Two different things have to be made clear. The  Gaza-Jericho negotiations will be held in Cairo. The  negotiations on the autonomy will continue in Washington, as has  been the case up to now. We are, in fact, talking about two  different processes.</p>

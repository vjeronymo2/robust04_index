			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN IS NAMED NEW ANNOUNCER AT HOLLYPARK  </P> <P> Unsuccessful in its attempts to land Trevor Denman, Hollywood Park circled the  globe to find its new track announcer.  </P> <P> Don Alexander, who replaced Milo Perrins -- who took over from Bine Masters,  who replaced Jim Byers -- is out and Australian Michael Wrona is in.  </P> <P> Hollywood Park management, which never hid its desire to find another  race-caller, wanted John Tapp, Wrona's mentor and the dean of Australian  announcers.  </P> <P> However, he didn't want to come to the United States, so he recommended Wrona.  </P> <P> Alexander will remain at Hollywood Park through the Memorial Day program and he  will call the "bulk of the races" until he departs. Beginning next Wednesday,  Wrona, 24, will be on his own.  </P> <P> How Wrona will be accepted here remains to be seen. There will be the  inevitable comparisons to Denman, whom Santa Anita wouldn't permit to work at  Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Alexander, who worked as a patrol judge at Hollywood Park before he replaced  Perrins last year, has been offered a job in the racing office. Before he  called the final race Wednesday, he said he had accepted the spot, but his  duties have yet to be determined. BOB MIESZERSKI  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Orb to Pounds 13.8m Orb Estates, the commercial property developer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.8m for the year to June 30, compared with a restated loss last time of Pounds 38.3m. The company had returned to the black at the interim stage, with a profit before tax of Pounds 8.23m. The full-year result came on the back of turnover down 14 per cent at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 13.1m). The board said profits were almost entirely made up of exceptional items, including Pounds 14.5m credited in respect of the company's capital reconstruction, as well as a Pounds 626,000 profit on the sale of investment properties. Last year's figure included a Pounds 20.2m write-off. Operating profits were Pounds 2.92m, against losses of Pounds 3.6m after losses at discontinued operations of Pounds 4.05m. Earnings per share were 1.98p (41.8p losses), taking into account the reconstruction and the share issue in January.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Industry plans may form Tory agenda Mr John Major has set up a high-level cabinet committee to oversee the government's planned white paper on competitiveness. The move has reinforced suggestions in Whitehall that the prime minister wants the document to become a mid-term manifesto for his government rather than a more narrow analysis of the immediate problems facing manufacturing industry. Mr Major has told colleagues that he intends to make enhancing Britain's competitive edge a central theme in the second half of the present parliament. The white paper will thus be expected to pull together all of the policies which have an impact on the success of British industry. Ministers serving on the committee say they plan to combine a detailed assessment of how British industry is faring on world markets with a much broader view of the fundamental forces underlying competitiveness. That implies a reassessment of the government's approach to education and training; a further drive to encourage the private sector to take on large-scale infrastructure projects, and a commitment to maintain the pace of deregulation. Early drafts circulating to members of the committee also emphasise an overriding commitment to a stable macro-economic framework and to keeping business taxes low. The committee, chaired by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is hamstrung to a degree by the Treasury's insistence that the white paper must not be an excuse for increased public spending. In spite of his avowed support for the private-sector financing initiative, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is being accused by cabinet colleagues of being over-zealous in his defence of the Treasury's public borrowing rules. But ministers still see an opportunity in the white paper to give coherence to a disparate range of policies which have all been aimed at giving support to manufacturing industry. Mr Major is particularly keen to see a much closer relationship between the government's education and training policies with an emphasis on breaking down the distinctions between academic and vocational qualifications. Some ministers also want Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, to take the opportunity to revamp the government's approach to training by restructuring Training and Enterprise Councils. For its part, Mr Heseltine's department is examining ways in which the government can help to build stronger links between industry and the City and methods of bolstering government support for British exporters.</p>

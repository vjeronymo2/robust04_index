			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sense of reprieve sweeps the Conservatives' HQ AT SMITH Square, where the evening had begun with an air of suppressed relief as exit polls indicated the result was too close to call, Mr Shaun Woodward, communications director, was holding the fort. The energetic young official, resplendent in blue pinstripe wore the look of a man just reprieved from Death Row, resplendent in blue pinstripe. He was already confident enough simply to smile when it was suggested the early signs were he would not be clearing out his desk. As he did so, he crowded closer to the television to catch comments made by Mr Chris Patten, the drained-looking party chairman. While the defeated Mr Patten spoke, an attentive minion distributed cassettes of the Conservatives' campaign theme tune. Other Central Office superintendents - some wearing bages designating them as 'gofers' - began to perk up. 'I'd rather be watching Duck Soup,' said a doorman. At around 10.20pm, Mr Woodward, who had 'enjoyed every minute of the campaign' was successfully fighting the urge not to pronounce on these early indicators. But he was happy to offer his view of how the campaign had gone, together with the prediction: 'I think it is going right down to the wire.' According to Mr Woodward, the Tories had stuck to their guns after they had got off to a predictably slow start due to unhelpful economic statistics. 'We broke their (Labour's) momentum a week ago,' he said, expressing satisfaction that pressure to change tack in the final days had been resisted. 'We were running fastest to the tape,' he added. 'We believed this morning we would be the largest party. The other thing coming through was a very strong sense of John Major.' There was certainly a strong sense of John Major in the journalists' bunker, thanks to the upbeat posters of the prime minister surrounded by smiling schoolchildren and the slogan proclaiming him 'The Best Future For Britain'. At 12.45am, with Basildon and Putney held, Southport won and Cheltenham lost, Mr Woodward made another sortie. 'At the moment, it looks like Labour are falling way behind their expectations,' he said. still cautioning that it would be a long night full of surprises.</p>

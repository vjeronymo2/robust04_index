			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Maxwell's pensions The ruthless and systematic looting of pension schemes in the Maxwell business empire by the late Mr Robert Maxwell was deplorable enough. Yet many of the 30,000 employees and pensioners whose retirement prospects have already been jeopardised now face a further threat, arising from the considerable legal uncertainty that surrounds the status of pension fund members in a winding up. Under existing insolvency legislation, it is far from clear where a pension fund deficit ranks in relation to other creditors once the receivers and liquidators move in. While the Fourth Schedule of the 1990 Social Security Act contained a provision for a pension fund deficit to be treated as a debt due from the employer to the scheme, it has not yet been brought into force. Small wonder that trustees of the Maxwell pension schemes were yesterday trooping into Whitehall to bend the ears of social security secretary Mr Tony Newton, Mr John Maples of the Treasury and corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood. They risk finding themselves trampled in the stampede, as the big banks lay prior claim to those assets that remain. Yet it was the banks who magnified the damage wreaked by Mr Maxwell when they encouraged him in his reckless expansion - this, despite powerful anathemas pronounced on him by department of trade inspectors. Dismal pittance The government will, of course, meet its statutory obligation to stump up the equivalent of the guaranteed minimum pension provided under the state scheme for the Maxwell pensioners. But that is a dismal pittance; and the government's dilatory behaviour in implementing the relevant provisions of the 1990 Act means that the trustees' only obvious recourse, in the absence of constructive Whitehall intervention, is to embark on a time-consuming test case. That would create further uncertainty for the pension fund members as well as running the risk that heavy legal costs might further reduce the resources of the funds. This underlines, once again, the way in which the odds in occupational pension schemes have been unduly tilted against the employees. Even if the relevant legislation had been in place, the members of the Maxwell pension funds would merely have ranked as unsecured creditors. Yet most of them probably regarded their stake in the fund as a form of remuneration for work that they had already done. Questionable value The pensions lobby, in contrast, argues that pensions are not deferred pay because the employer has to meet the balance of the cost of providing pensions after employees have made a fixed contribution. Yet in practice this apparent guarantee of solvency is of questionable value since most trust deeds permit the employer to discontinue the scheme unilaterally. This leads to a situation where the employer enjoys disproportionate benefit from any pension fund surplus, while the employee loses most of the benefit of the guarantee if the employer chooses not to implement it or the company goes to the wall. The government must bear substantial responsibility both for the Maxwell pensions debacle and the wider shortcomings of the occupational pensions system. Had ministers heeded the calls for the rapid introduction of tighter regulations governing pension funds, Mr Maxwell might, at the very least, have found it harder to plunder and loot. The role of Imro in providing a seal of approval to Mr Maxwell's in-house fund management group also raises questions about the effectiveness of the Financial Services Act. Pension fund members both in and out of the Maxwell group have been singularly ill-served and their reasonable expectations have been needlessly frustrated. It is inevitable that they will be frustrated again, unless the government is prepared to confront the problems of the underlying conflict of interest. That means that it must recognise that the whole point of a pension fund is to provide pensions. Membership of occupational pension schemes should be made part of employees' contracts of employment.</p>

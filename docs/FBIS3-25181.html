			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>   [Text] Clashes between government troops and National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] rebels, which left  more than 350 dead and 400 wounded over the past five days, have  subsided since dawn today. Most of the victims were women,  children, and elderly people. The men in the service of Jonas  Savimbi have stopped shelling Cuito. A relative calm prevails,  but this could be designed to deceive government troops. The  operational command of the Angolan Armed Forces says UNITA's  decision is to gain time and reorganize its forces in view of  the defeats it has suffered. Brigadier (Filione Mukume), deputy  commander of the government forces stationed in Cuito, says  UNITA will be met with the appropriate response if it tries to  gain the upper hand.</p>

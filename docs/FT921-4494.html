			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Mitsotakis tries to calm shooting row MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has expressed regret over an incident on Friday in which the captain of a Turkish fishing boat was shot and killed after ramming a Greek Navy patrol vessel off the island of Leros. Mr Mitsotakis said he was sorry about the shooting and hoped this 'small problem will not affect Greek-Turkish relations in a more permanent way.' A Greek merchant marine ministry announcement issued earlier did not mention the captain's death, saying only that shots were exchanged as the Turkish vessel was being chased out of Greek territorial waters. It was the first death reported in this kind of incident, which occurs fairly regularly in the narrow straits between the eastern Greek islands and Turkey. Greek-Turkish tension was already high after the collapse last week of the latest round of United Nations-sponsored talks on the reuniting of Cyprus.</p>

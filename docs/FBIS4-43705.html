			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by `Lz': "Is This Enough?"] </F>   [Text] The federal law on the deployment of Swiss troops  in peacekeeping missions has been rejected by a surprising  majority. For the third time in almost two years, the Swiss  people have voted in favor of being screened off from the  outside world. The disappointing result does not just signify a  no to the formation of a Swiss Blue Helmet battalion. It also  signifies a brusque refusal toward international solidarity  concerning security policy. In this way, Switzerland is  avoiding a task that has gained in importance since the end of  the Cold War, a task that other neutral countries have already  been performing for several years. But the strong majority of  our people do not seem to care about that.    From an internal political angle, it is not good that a new  rift has emerged between the German and French-speaking parts of  Switzerland, even though this rift is not as wide as it was  during the European Economic Area vote. Apart from the two  dual-language cantons of Freiburg and Wallis, all the  French-speaking cantons spoke out in favor of an opening out to  the world in the sphere of security policy. Even there, people  are acquainted with the principles of the Swiss Confederation.  Cantons containing large conurbations, such as Zurich, Bern,  Basel-Stadt, and Basel-Lansdschaft, had a below-average number  of no votes.    Switzerland was one of the first countries to adapt its  security and political ideas to the post-1989 changes, and it  was justifiably proud of its leading role in this regard. But  today the country still seems reluctant to develop the  nationwide strategy formulated in the Bundesrat's report on the  1990's, and prefers to let circles of experts discuss this topic.    Detailed examinations will be required to establish  individual reasons for the no vote. But it already seems clear  that neutrality in its rigid form is more firmly rooted in  society than was originally thought. Neutrality is viewed not  so much a security strategy as an ambiguous, almost theoretical  state slogan that remains valid whatever happens. At a time  when everything is falling apart, there has to be something that  remains unaltered, many citizens probably say to themselves.  People conclude that in the current world political situation,  traditional patterns of thought and conduct are not always  suitable.    The opponents to the deployment of Swiss peacekeeping troops  took advantage of this mood. With an avalanche of propaganda  that did not stop short of false statements and made a laughing  stock of foreign policy moves, they created the impression that  by deploying Blue Helmets, Switzerland would be engaging itself  in a war. In this way, fears were aroused that made moral and  humanitarian calls for solidarity unheard. Nevertheless, the  opponents did not succeed in separating the subject of Blue  Helmets from our basic relationship toward the United Nations.  The dramatic financial situation and the debate on old-age and  survivor pensions might have contributed to the negative result.  Last but not least, the result might indicate a certain  mistrust in the government.    What are the consequences of the 12 June vote? The point now  is to make maximum use of existing possibilities, which means  that unarmed military personnel are to be placed at the disposal  of the United Nations also in future. A further development is  possible in this sphere. The work of the disaster assistance  corps and International Red Cross is to receive continued  support, something that the opponents to the deployment of Blue  Helmets should be reminded of. During the prevote campaign,  they did not tire of telling people that it is these two  organizations that require support, and not the Blue Helmets.    The refusal to Swiss Blue Helmets hardly effects national  defense, but it remains to be seen whether the principle of  peacekeeping can retain its credibility if a country with a  400,000-strong army refuses to deploy 600 Blue Helmets. From a  foreign policy angle, it remains to be seen whether the  international community will continue to be interested in the  services of a country that does not want to fulfill a major  military-diplomatic task. The terrain for Swiss foreign policy  is certainly not going to be easier. It will take some effort  to convince our neighbors that a refusal to implement an  important political task does not mean isolation, for there is  no question that after the 12 June vote, Switzerland continues  to rely on international cooperation.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Losses at Thomson widen LOSSES at Thomson Corp-oration, the Canadian-owned travel and information group, widened in the first quarter, largely because of weak demand and higher spending on new North American publishing products. The company disclosed it had sold all but one of more than 70 loss-making UK free sheets. The loss on these sales was covered in a special charge against 1992 earnings. The first-quarter loss was USDollars 55m, or 10 cents a share, up from Dollars 47m, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to Dollars 1.07bn from Dollars 1.14bn. The first quarter is normally the weakest for the travel group and substantial parts of the publishing business. Thomson said seasonal losses had grown as its interests in these areas expanded, but higher winter losses should be offset by improved summer profits. The information and publishing division suffered an operating loss of Dollars 19m, after amortisation of publishing rights and circulation, up from Dollars 3m last year. But UK regional newspapers achieved 'improved' results. Thomson Travel's operating loss narrowed to Dollars 29m from Dollars 34m, due to the stronger US dollar against sterling and profits from aircraft disposals. The company said summer 1993 holidays were selling well after a slow start, with sales volumes 8 per cent ahead of this time last year. But Britannia Airways' business was slower in the first quarter than a year ago. Profits and margins of North American newspapers improved, due largely to cost cutting. But trading conditions remain difficult, with advertising lineage down 5.1 per cent and circulation of many titles under pressure. Mr Michael Johnston, head of Thomson Newspapers, resigned earlier this week after a disagreement with senior management.</p>

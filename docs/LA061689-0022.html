			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DAVIS PERFORMS IN GRAND STYLE FOR SEATTLE, 9-5  </P> <P> Alvin Davis' grand slam in the seventh inning and Greg Briley's two-run homer  in the eighth inning led the Seattle Mariners to a 9-5 victory over the Twins  at Minnesota Thursday.  </P> <P> Infield singles by Omar Vizquel, Harold Reynolds and Briley loaded the bases  before Davis connected for the sixth grand slam of his career and his seventh  homer of the season to put Seattle ahead, 7-5.  </P> <P> Briley then hit his second home run of the season with Vizquel aboard. Vizquel  reached base on a one-out single to right.  </P> <P> Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre is happy to have Davis back in the lineup, after  Davis recently spent time on the disabled list with a strained left calf  muscle.  </P> <P> "We missed him when he was on the disabled list," Lefebvre said. "He means so  much to this team because he is our top threat. He's a guy we rely on. Hitting  that grand slam is another one of those things that makes him great.  </P> <P> "We have guys who can hit well ahead and behind him in our order. Now he is in  a perfect batting position."  </P> <P> Reliever Dennis Powell (2-2), retired the Twins in order in the sixth to get  the victory. Mike Jackson pitched the final three innings to gain his third  save.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 6, Toronto 4 -- Gary Sheffield's seventh-inning sacrifice fly drove  in the winning run and Rob Deer hit two home runs at Milwaukee as Brewer  reliever Tony Fossas earned his first major league victory.  </P> <P> Jim Gantner and Paul Molitor opened Milwaukee's winning rally with consecutive  singles. Gus Polidor forced Molitor at second before Sheffield drove in Gantner  with a flyball to left.  </P> <P> Said Deer, who has 15 home runs this season: "The first time up (a line drive  to shortstop), I hit a slider. I hit it hard so I thought I wouldn't see  another slider. I went up looking for fastballs after that and that's what I  got. It was just one of those days when I got good pitches to hit and I hit  them."  </P> <P> Toronto starter Jimmy Key (6-6) took the loss.  </P> <P> Robin Yount's club record for most consecutive games played ended at 276 when  the Brewer center fielder missed the game with a bruised left knee.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Cleveland 4 -- Bill Buckner reached 1,200 career RBIs by driving  in three runs, two of them during a three-run eighth inning that gave the  Royals a come-from-behind victory at Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Royals trailed, 4-0, after two innings and were behind, 4-2, entering the  eighth. But George Brett started the inning with a walk, finishing Cleveland  starter John Farrell, and Bo Jackson singled off reliever Doug Jones (2-3), who  blew a save for only the third time in 17 opportunities.  </P> <P> After Jim Eisenreich struck out, Buckner doubled just inside the left-field  line, scoring both runners. Pinch-runner Bill Pecota went to third on Matt  Winters' single, and pinch-hitter Pat Tabler grounded to second, scoring Pecota  with the winning run.  </P> <P> Bret Saberhagen (6-4) gave up four runs, three of them earned, and seven hits  in seven innings. Jeff Montgomery and Steve Farr each pitched an inning, with  Farr getting his 15th save in 17 opportunities.  </P> <P> Baltimore 3, New York 2 -- Rene Gonzales singled home the winning run with two  out in the 10th inning to give the Orioles a victory at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Gonzales' hit snapped an 0-for-9 slump and drove in Mickey Tettleton, who led  off with a double off Lance McCullers (2-2).  </P> <P> Mark Thurmond (2-1), pitched the 10th inning and earned the victory for  Baltimore after starter Jeff Ballard allowed two runs and 10 hits in 7 1/3  innings.  </P> <P> After Tettleton's double, Joe Orsulak was intentionally walked, Randy Milligan  popped out and Larry Sheets flied out before Gonzales got his game-winning hit.  </P> <P> In the first inning, the Orioles completed the first AL triple play of the  season and their first in 10 years. After singles by Rickey Henderson, Steve  Sax and Don Mattingly gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead, Steve Balboni lined to  shortstop Cal Ripken, who threw to second baseman Bill Ripken to double Sax,  and the relay to Milligan at first got the third out.  </P></p>

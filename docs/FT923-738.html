			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Reassurance needed on accuracy of trade figures Sir, In his interesting 'Anatomy of the UK defeat' (Economic Viewpoint, September 24) Samuel Brittan states ' ..the Bundesbank economists have straightforward, unreconstructed mainstream views. They judge the sterling parity by the British trade figures. . .' For pretty well all my working life the published British trade figures have been so consistently dreadful that one wonders how on earth Britain, far from sinking without trace, manages to survive as a comparatively wealthy nation. Since published trade figures appear to be taken at face value by people and institutions whose actions can be favourable or very damaging to the national interest it is obvious they should be compiled with the utmost accuracy and care. I do not believe we can be entirely confident that this is the case and there seems to be a need for some public reassurance on the following matters: (a) How are monthly trade figures compiled? (b) Who prepares them and from what sources? (c) What steps are taken to verify that the figures are accurate and complete? (d) Are the figures compiled on a comparable basis and with a similar degree of accuracy to those of other countries, for example in the EC?

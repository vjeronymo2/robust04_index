			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Aggressor Forces Aimed at Asian </F> Countries"]    [Text] While the United States is intensifying its  strong-arm politics against our Republic under the pretext of  the nuclear issue, the U.S. Forces in Japan are making dangerous  moves. The U.S. Forces' military exercises are frequently  conducted in various places in Japan, and the aircraft carriers  and nuclear submarines are frequently calling at Japanese ports.  This shows that the U.S. bellicose circles continue to pursue  their Korean and Asian policy from a force-oriented position  [himui ipchangeso].    It is the invariable U.S. policy to maintain and intensify  the domination over the Asia-Pacific region. This U.S. policy  is becoming more conspicuous today when the power balance is  broken in the international arena. The United States is  particularly nervous about the Western powers taking increasing  interest in this region in recent years with the economic  development of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region and with  the strategic importance and significance of this region brought  to the fore. This is leading the United States to head in the  direction of further strengthening its influence and power  sphere over the Asia-Pacific region. Here the U.S. ruling  circles give great significance to the force-oriented policy  [himui chongchaek]. A typical example of this is the present  U.S. scheme to continuously maintain and strengthen the U.S.  Forces and their bases in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear  issue.    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are claiming that the  maintenance and strengthening of the U.S. Forces in Japan is  aimed at strengthening the Japan-U.S. security. But this is a  lie, and a deception and mockery at the peace-loving people of  Asia and the world.    It is not hard to know this from the composition and the  particulars of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan. The U.S. Armed  Forces in Japan are the mobile strike forces of an offensive  type composed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. They have all  the arms and equipment--from tactical to strategic  weapons--enabling them to carry out operations in any region of  Asia, and their function is to carry out the role of a shock  brigade for the aggressive U.S. Asian strategy.    The U.S. Forces and their bases in Japan participate,  without  exception, in the war exercises conducted in the Asia-Pacific  region, and are used as supply and launching bases for war  exercises. Here they are strengthening the operational and  commanding system among the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean  forces and accelerating the preparations for overseas  aggression. This shows that the U.S. Forces in Japan are not  for the Japan-U.S. security but they are aggressor forces aimed  at the Asia-Pacific region using Japan and South Korea as a  stepping stone.    The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan are the nuclear forces aimed  at maintaining nuclear superiority in the Asia-Pacific region  and attacking other countries. Not to be overlooked is the fact  that the operational focus of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan is  directed at our country. The U.S. imperialists, who overturned  [twijibo opun] the DPRK-U.S. talks, are busily moving the U.S.  Armed Forces in Japan, babbling about coping with our nuclear  development. The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan aimed at our  country are prepared to be put into war at any time.    The U.S. ruling circles are advertising, brazen-facedly,  that  the U.S. Forces in Japan are a so-called war-deterrent. This is  nothing but a sophistry. The U.S. Forces and their bases in  Japan are the source of misfortune that threatens the  sovereignty, independence, peace, and security of our country  and other countries in Asia.    The United States should immediately withdraw its Armed  Forces in conformity with today's environment in which the Cold  War ended, and clearly know that the force-oriented policy is  far from an omnipotent prescription.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Brussels may act on money transfer charges European Union banks may face more pressure to limit double charging and hidden costs on internal cross-border payments and speed the rate at which they are carried out. Such pressure, from the European Commission, might take the form of an EU directive, aimed at easing the costs on consumers and small businesses that rely on banks to make transfer payments within the EU, and removing an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single market. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, told ministers at a meeting in eastern Germany that the pressure on banks to stop double charging - imposing fees at the sending and receiving end of a transfer - had to be stepped up. However, he sought to allay bank fears by emphasising that any legislation would not be 'heavy or intrusive' but the minimum necessary. The need for action follows a survey, ordered by the Commission, which found that many banks were not complying with EU targets, set at the end of last year, on double charging, transparency and the time to complete a transfer. An initial report last year said charges were duplicated in 43 per cent of transactions. It found that on average a Ecu100 cross-border transaction cost Ecu20. Banks were also required to complete the transaction on the first working day after receiving the request. Mr Vanni D'Archirafi's inclination to take legislative action is likely to lead to a row in the Commission. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner responsible for consumer affairs, believes a voluntary code of conduct for banks would be more appropriate. The banking lobby has also mounted an effective campaign against legislation, arguing that regulation might result in banks withdrawing their services altogether. They argue that tough requirements on speed might cause banks to refuse to execute payments to EU countries with less efficient payment systems. However, not all banks oppose legislation. Some believe present arrangements discriminate against banks that stick to the guidelines. They would like legislation to make standards conform.</p>

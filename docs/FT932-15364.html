			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Hopes strengthen for housing upturn ESTATE AGENTS are more confident this year that Easter, traditionally the start of the main house buying season, will confirm evidence of a sustained recovery in one of the economy's worst-hit sectors. The National Association of Estate Agents, which represents 10,000 member companies, said yesterday that there was 'a different feel to the market' this year after Easter optimism in each of the past two years rapidly turned sour. Mr Michael Jones, the association's president, said: 'Many of my colleagues have had a lot of inquiries, especially from first-time buyers and at new developments.' Interest is reported to be strongest in the Midlands, Wales and the north, but Mr Jones believed that London and the south-east would also 'gradually feel the effect' of the recovery. Estate agents and mortgage lenders announced figures which they claimed proved the market was on the move after three years in the doldrums. Royal Life Estates, which has nearly 500 estate agencies throughout the country, said new instructions - a seller putting a property on the market - and sales subject to contract were both up by a fifth in the last quarter. Contracts exchanged were up by 40 per cent. Mr Roger Hicklin, business development director, said: 'We are very cautious about saying the worst is over, but the longer we have some stability with a gentle upward trend in prices, then the more will confidence return.' Abbey National, the country's second-largest mortgage lender, said mortgage applications had doubled since March last year. Most of that rise had come in the past three months, with a surge of 60 per cent between February and March. At the same time the number of first-time buyers entering the market had now risen to nearly 50 per cent of the total. Halifax building society insisted there was 'no dramatic surge' in its 500 estate agencies over the weekend but there had been 'a healthy level' of interest and inquiries.</p>

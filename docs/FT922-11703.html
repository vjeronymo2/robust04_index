			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Hilary Term cases DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD (FT, January 28) The plaintiff, Davy, agreed to supply a floating production facility and single point mooring to the defendant, Emerald, which was a contractor to supply equipment and services to licensees of the right to explore and extract oil from the Emerald Oil field in the North Sea. The scheme entailed that Davy was to produce the various listed documents to Emerald which then had to issue the completion certificate, sign the final stage certificate, and obtain a section 10 certificate under the 1972 Industry Act. The documents would then be returned to Davy which would present them to the bank under the letter of credit. Payment by the bank was to be postponed for five working days after presentation and acceptance of documents. Giving judgment for Davy on the contractual intention as to the point at which title should pass, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that it was Davy's drawing under the letter of credit that satisfied the condition to passing of title. THE BERGE SUND (FT, January 31) A charterparty provided that the master, although in the owners' employ, 'shall observe the orders of the charterers as regards employment of the vessel'. An off-hire clause provided that hire should cease for loss of time 'not caused by charterers' fault . . . due to repairs, breakdown, accident or damage to the vessel, collision, standing, fire, interference by authorities or any other cause . . . preventing the efficient working of the vessel . . . .' The vessel carried a contaminated cargo and loading was delayed until the tanks were cleaned. The arbitration dispute concerned the delay and the charterers claimed back hire paid for that period. The arbitrators awarded Dollars 600,002 to the charterers, stating that they were unable to make a definite finding as to the cause of the failure of the corrosion test. The owners, on the other hand, contended that the delay was caused by the the charterers who had chosen to employ the vessel in shipping dangerous cargo. Dismissing the owners' appeal against the award, Mr Justice Steyn stated that there had been no express finding that loss of time resulted directly from compliance with charterers' orders. IN RE BISHOPSGATE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LTD MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS AND OTHERS v MAXWELL AND OTHERS (FT, February 4) Dismissing the appeal by Kevin Maxwell (and others) against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision that he must answer questions put to him by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Management Ltd, Lord Justice Dillon said that the Court of Appeal agreed with the approach of Mr Justice Vinelott in the case of Levitt (FT, October 29 1991), where he stated that the provisions of the 1986 Insolvency Act must be looked at as a whole to ascertain the purpose of an examination under section 236, and whether that purpose necessarily involved abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination. There Vinelott J said: 'To answer that question, the court must ask whether there is any public interest in ensuring that the inquiry was carried out thoroughly and expeditiously.' Part of the mischief in the old law was its apparent inability to deal adequately with dishonesty or malpractice on the part of bankrupts or company directors. By the 1986 Act, parliament had acted to allay public concern and, with the assistance of the court, had extended greatly the investigative powers available to appointed office-holders. GIROZENTRALE UND BANK DER OESTERREICHISCHEN SPARKASSEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT &amp; OTHERS v THE TOSG TRUST FUND LTD (FT, February 5) The nine plaintiff banks appealed against a decision that the defendant, the Tosg Trust Fund Ltd (incorporated in 1970 by members of an unincorporated association, the Tour Operators Study Group (Tosg)), was entitled to use money advanced by the banks for purposes other than in connection with claims against members of the Tour Operators' Study Group. In allowing the appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that in so far as monies had been expended in alleviating the consequences of failure to customers of subsidiaries of a holding company, Travel, they were not expended in the performance of the Fund's rights, duties, powers or discretions set out in its memorandum of association. When the banks had issued their bond, they had covered one company only, namely Travel, and had exposed themselves to the risk of failure of Travel which, in the present case, was the only Tosg member. Thus the banks' exposure in the present case could not be affected or extended by something of which they knew nothing. STANDARD CHARTERED BANK AND ANOTHER v WALKER AND ANOTHER (FT, February 7) The banks proposed the reconstruction of Brent Walker and sought injunctions requiring the defendants to vote in favour of, or restraining them from voting against, resolutions at an extraordinary general meeting. The banks believed that if the restructuring arrangements were not approved, Brent Walker's collapse would be inevitable and the shares would be worthless. In giving judgment for the banks, Mr Justice Vinelott stated that, in appropriate and rare circumstances, the court had the jurisdiction, however it was described, to restrain conduct which would destroy property over which a debtor had given a charge. It was only in an extreme case that the court would interfere by injunction with the exercise by a shareholder/debtor of the voting right attached to his own shares. However, in the present case, the banks had shown that the obstruction of the reconstruction proposals would amount to the wilful dissipation of assets which, consistent with Mareva principles, the court had jurisdiction to prevent happening. GOMBA HOLDINGS (UK) LTD v MINORIES FINANCE (FT, February 11) Minories Finance made substantial advances to the mortgagors under debentures, guarantees and mortgages. Demands for repayment were not met and joint receivers of the assets were appointed. After having raised sufficient funds to meet their liabilities, the receivers were discharged but there were outstanding disputes as to the accounts. The mortgagors served notice of their objections to the accounts submitted, including 'unreasonable and/or improper amount'. Mr Justice Vinelott declared inter alia that the mortgagors were not entitled to object to non-litigation items on the ground that they were unreasonable. Allowing part of the mortgagors' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the effect under Order 62 Rules 19 and 24 was that if an account contained items of litigation or non-litigation costs, they could be referred to a taxing master for him to decide what amount was recoverable. The mortgagors were entitled to object to items that they said were unreasonable but any doubts were to be resolved in favour of Minories. ITALIA EXPRESS (FT, February 12) After the assured, Mr Ventouris, had served notice on the underwriters for total loss of the vessel Italia Express under a War Risks insurance policy, the underwriters did not dispute that the loss fell within one of the insured perils. Their sole defence was that the loss was caused by Mr Ventouris's wilful misconduct. On the 37th day of the trial, the underwriters withdrew those allegations. The present issues related to damages and Mr Ventouris claimed special or general damages for (a) loss of income which would have been earned by a replacement vessel; (b) loss of increase in capital value of a replacement vessel; and (c) damages for hardship, inconvenience and mental distress. The underwriters contended that such damages were irrecoverable in principle, and that those claimed under (c) were in any event not sustainable. Upholding that damages were not to be awarded under (c), Mr Justice Hirst stated that such claims were only recoverable in the case of a contract to provide peace of mind or freedom from distress. A marine insurance contract was not of that character.</p>

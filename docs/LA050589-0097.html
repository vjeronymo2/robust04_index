			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S. BACK PROTESTS  </P> <P> Chinese students in the United States have written an open letter to their  government expressing strong support for the pro-democracy student  demonstrations in China.  </P> <P> The message was read by telephone Tuesday to students at Beijing University who  tape-recorded it for dissemination in China, Guyang Huang, a University of  Massachusetts graduate student, said Thursday in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Students at the University of Massachusetts wrote the five-paragraph document  last Saturday and placed it on the two-year-old computer network that allows  Chinese studying in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan to  communicate about events in China. Some of the 230 Chinese students at UC San  Diego, one of the largest such communities at an American university, took part  in the effort.  </P> <P> "All over the world from the east to the west, democracy has become an  irresistible historical trend. . . . How about China?" part of the statement  reads.  </P> <P> "Please let the people speak and know the truth . . . . We appeal for a  dialogue between the (Communist) Party and the people and students to answer  people's questions instead of suppressing them. . . ."  </P> <P> Huang said Thursday that overseas scholars have raised $15,000 from among their  peers in the United States, Canada, West Germany and Norway to help in  disseminating the letter to students throughout China.  </P> <P> The Voice of America said Thursday that it has received calls from Chinese  students at 30 American universities asking that the letter be broadcast. The  VOA has requested a copy and its East Asian division chief will decide, based  on its newsworthiness, whether to put it on the air, a VOA spokesman said.  </P> <P> There is strong support for the demonstrations among the approximately 20,000  Chinese students in the United States, according to students at several  universities. All are anxiously awaiting the Chinese government's response to  the three weeks of demonstrations.  </P> <P> "Chinese people now want a real government system, not just a good king like  Deng Xiaoping (China's paramount leader) was," Dan Hu, a graduate student in  electrical engineering at UC San Diego, said.  </P> <P> Said colleague Li Sen, who is working for a doctorate in biochemistry: "I think  the concerns of Chinese students have changed, and we are now as concerned  about the political future as well as the economic future."  </P> <P> Chai Xiaoyong, a University of Chicago graduate student in sociology, used the  computer network last week to help organize a demonstration by students at 11  Midwestern universities in front of the Chinese Consulate in Chicago.  </P> <P> "All students abroad have the same feeling, the responsibility to do whatever  we can to support those back in our country . . . to give them courage and a  loyal boost," Chai said.  </P> <P> The great number of Chinese students who have received degrees abroad since  1980 -- an estimated 30,000 from the United States alone -- is contributing to  the demands for more openness, several UC San Diego students said.  </P> <P> "I think there is a large indirect influence, and because of our country's more  open policy on travel, and so forth, we are much more able to make  comparisons," said mathematics graduate student He Zhengxu, who has accepted an  assistant professorship at Princeton next year rather than return to China.  </P></p>

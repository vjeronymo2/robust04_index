			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: The Adventures of Mr Broucek - Max Loppert on the ENO's new production of Janacek's opera Janacek's fifth opera returns to London after a gap of nine years, in a brand-new English National Opera production - the second such to be mounted by the company in its tenure at the Coliseum. Most important opera-cities have yet to see and hear even a single staging of this glorious and remarkable opera. We owe our good fortune to ENO's undimmed enthusiasm for this composer, shared by former Director of Productions (Colin Graham) and current (David Pountney) alike, and to the continuing presence of Charles Mackerras as our foremost Janacek conductor. The Adventures of Mr Broucek is comedy, romance, satire, fantasy and historical epic all in one, not sustained for long on any of those levels but a magically elliptical and unpredictable voyage through them all. The plot-point is simple - Broucek, a petty-bourgeois Prague landlord, prosperous and small-minded, gets drunk at his local, and finds himself transported out of his stupor, first to the Moon (the first part) and then (the second) to the 15th-century Prague of the Hussite Wars. On the Moon he encounters a gaggle of arty poseurs and Style Counsellors, who display their wares (pretentious artefacts, fancy political nostrums) and, in turn, mock his philistinism and carnivorous appetites. In the 15th century, Broucek shows a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the battle against the Germans still enveloping the city, and is condemned to death for cowardice - yet, waking up head-first in a beer barrel, he soon brags of having liberated the city 'single-handed'. The realisation is complex, and studded with potential pitfalls of background and foreground understanding. On the Moon the problem is a combination of incoherence and excessive generosity in the choice of satirical targets - and, indeed, their speed of delivery: the whole episode goes at a cracking pace. In the 15th century, it is the copious references to important but possibly unfamiliar figures and events of Czech history. And yet, in the actual experience, problems recede and magic takes over. Janacek's idiosyncratic dramaturgy is grappled together by the title character - always comprehensible in his foibles, prejudices and limited moral sense, not exactly lovable, perhaps, but utterly human; by a love of Prague which links every image and event and infuses every note; and above all by Janacek's score, pithy and muscular, filled with bursts of elating visionary radiance. With this new Broucek Pountney completes his British production-cycle of the mature Janacek operas. In the programme he writes lucidly of the composer's 'cinematic' ie 'fast-moving, non-linear drama created by juxtaposition and collage'. The staging, designed by Stefanos Lazaridis (sets) and Marie-Jeanne Lecca (costumes), is a characteristically intelligent, forcefully argued attempt to realise that peculiar dramatic modernism by commanding every area of space and type of stage action. Film, drop-cloths, the spin of the central revolve, the trollying on and off of quirkily shaped props, the use of chorus in complex dance formations (choreographer: Quinny Sacks) - all this, and much more, is set in motion for a show that seeks a bold, fantastic foreshortening of dramatic and visual perspective. The influence of the 1920s cinema, of Rene Clair comedy, Vigo poetry and the magical surrealism of early Bunuel, is strongly apparent. In the second part, rather easier to stage, the presentation of knights and huge caparisoned horses on stilts pinpoints exactly the time-travelling mixture of martial grandeur and Broucek's own fuddled response thereto. In the first, Pountney, with the aid of his own new translation (packed with sallies enjoyable on the printed page that too often go unheard), embarks on a virtual re-writing: the time and place are 1992, a mad whirl of contemporary modes and manners. Starry-Eyes, Wonderglitter, Rainbowbrush and all the other lunar aesthetes are banished; jokes about David Hockney, feminism, political correctness, surtitles, and even some of the house's own 'interventionist' operatic fashions tumble out in quick, jolly succession. The production has been paid for by the Coliseum audience itself, as a result of the Pounds 100,000 sum elicited on appeal. This is a source of justifiable pride and gratitude. Watching the opening-night account of it, however, I wondered whether for Pountney's purposes either too much or too little money had been raised. Much of the Moon scene looked a fearful mess, a pudding over-egged, over-spiced and over-sugared, with technical means constantly overstretched. In my no doubt hopelessly old-fashioned way I yearned for a more loving, less physically caricatured treatment of the principals, for more romance, picturesqueness: for more matter, in sum, with less art. Two features were securely preserved: the lyrical effulgence of the tripartite leading soprano role, beautifully taken by Vivian Tierney; and the majesty of that extraordinary Act 2 'vision of the author', here presented as a Vaclav Havel figure - the production is dedicated to him - and nobly, if near-wordlessly, delivered by Alberto Remedios. Otherwise, the cast, which includes such company stalwarts as Bonaventura Bottone, Paul Napier-Burrows, Arwel Huw Morgan and Christopher Booth-Jones, tended not to make a strong impression with words and notes. This seemed true even of Graham Clark in the title role, a wonderful tenor singing-actor already at home with bloated-stomach and wonky-umbrella routines but not yet wholly inside the music. Of course this may well alter with practice and wearing-in; and no opera-lover in search of unstaled operatic pleasures should dream of staying away. Already, Mackerras paces the two parts as though their shape and content were as simple as Boheme's; the wealth of knowledge, experience and simple 'knack' in the musical unfolding is summed up in the blissful quiet enchantments of the Act 1 curtain-close. If there were no other reason to praise the new ENO Broucek, ENO's great Janacek conductor and his splendidly responsive orchestra would provide reason enough.</p>

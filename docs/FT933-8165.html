			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Beijing plans record 1994 treasury issues BEIJING plans to issue a record amount of treasury bonds next year, Reuter reports from Shanghai. The planned value of 1994 bond issues is Yn60bnto Yn70bn (Dollars 10.4bn to Dollars 12.2bn), more than double this year's total of Yn30bn, the Jiefang Daily quoted a senior finance ministry official as saying. In all, Yn30bn of 1994 bonds will be sold through provinces and localities. These bonds may be traded on the secondary market, the paper said. Another Yn30bn would be bought by state-owned 'specialist' banks and would not be traded, while Yn10bn would be paperless scrip for issue on the primary market. At present, state banks hold virtually no bonds, depriving the Beijing of a powerful tool to regulate the economy. However, the official made it clear that state-owned banks are being asked to buy bonds not for the state to use as an instrument of economic control but to utilise the banks' huge deposits to bail the government out of its immediate financial crisis. The newspaper gave no details of the coupon rates for next year's bonds. Three-year bonds issued this year carry a coupon of 13.96 per cent and five-year bonds 15.86 per cent. The 1993 bond issues flopped because coupon were set unrealistically low and were swamped by inflation. In addition, many individual investors chased opportunities in the booming stock and property markets and were lured by spectacular returns from unauthorised enterprise bonds. Beijing was twice forced to raise 1993 coupons. In the end, the issues were forced on local governments with a threat to stop provinces from listing shares on China's stock markets until the bonds were sold. After extending the deadline for selling the bonds, Beijing said last month that they had been sold. The authorities are increasingly relying on bonds to balance the budget.</p>

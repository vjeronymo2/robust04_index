This was pointed out by Kinkel in Athens this morning after  talks with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. The letter  by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the leader of the Bosnian  Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has created favorable preconditions for  a settlement in Bosnia, he stated.    However, Kinkel warned against too much enthusiasm. "The  NATO ultimatum will continue to be valid. It apparently had the  desired effect." To achieve a peaceful settlement in Bosnia,  Russia must by all means be involved in the talks. Kozyrev  stated in Athens that the promise by the Bosnian Serbs to  withdraw their weapons in exchange for the deployment of 400-500  Russian blue berets in and around Sarajevo is the "beginning of  the end of the war in Bosnia."    A new round of political dialogue between Russia and the  European Union started in Athens this morning. It is being  attended by the executive foreign ministers of the European  Union from Belgium, Greece -- which currently holds the  chairmanship of the European Union -- and its successor Germany.    Referring to Greece's unilateral action against the former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- it closed the port of Salonika  for all deliveries to and from Skopje -- Kinkel stressed that  this was an "unusual step that does not correspond to practices  within the community." Exerting pressure is no instrument for  settling such issues. "We do not need a destabilization of  Macedonia," he pointed out.</p>

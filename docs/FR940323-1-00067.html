			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time, Congress did not want to overburden industry or FDA with overreporting requirements. The reporting requirements thus apply only to the ``more important postmarket actions, excluding those events already reported to the [agency].'' However, to ensure that FDA has access to all relevant information on corrections or removals, for those corrections and removals that need not be reported, Congress provided that records be maintained. (S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes FDA to promulgate substantive binding regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Weinberger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 412 U.S. 609 (1973); see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Weinberger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 412 U.S. 645, 653 (1973);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Ass'n of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 637 F.2d 877 (2d Cir. 1981);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Confectioners Ass'n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Califano <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 569 F.2d 690 (D.C.

Section 704(e) of the act requires that any person required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of such records must, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have access to, and copy and verify, such record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Scope of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations implementing the provisions of section 519(f) of the act will be set out in new 21 CFR part 806. Proposed &sect;806.1(a) provides generally that device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are required to report promptly to FDA certain actions concerning device corrections and removals, and to maintain records of all corrections and removals regardless of whether such corrections and removals are required to be reported to FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;806.1(b) describes the actions that are not subject to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation (set out at proposed &sect;806.10). Those actions are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Actions undertaken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to improve the performance or quality of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused by the device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Routine servicing as defined in proposed &sect;806.2(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Actions similar to item 1, undertaken by manufacturers of general purpose articles, such as chemical reagents or laboratory equipment, whose uses are generally known by persons trained in their use and which are not labeled or promoted or otherwise intended for medical uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Reports of Corrections and Removals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Who Must Report and When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;806.10(a) requires device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to submit a written report to FDA of any correction or removal of a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. Only one report is required for each reportable event. The person initiating the action to correct or remove a device is required to report. In the case of a foreign manufacturer or distributor, the U.S. designated agent is required to report. If the distributor or importer corrects or removes a product on its own, then the distributor or importer is required to report the action. Regardless of who submits the report or to which FDA district office the report is submitted, the name and location of the manufacturer must be reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Time and Place for Submission of Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;806.10(b), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must submit required correction or removal reports within 10 calendar days of initiating a device correction or removal to the appropriate FDA district office listed in &sect;5.115 (21 CFR 5.115) for their location and region. If the device is manufactured at multiple manufacturing sites, the report must be submitted to the FDA district office where the device is finally assembled and/or packaged. A foreign manufacturer or distributor that ships devices to the United States shall submit its own reports of corrective or removal actions through the U.S. designated agent on its behalf. The U.S. designated agent shall submit such reports to the FDA district office in which the agent's office is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. What to Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;806.10(c), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must include the following information in the report:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The name, address, and telephone number of the manufacturer or distributor, (including foreign manufacturer), and the name, title, address, and telephone number of the individual responsible for conducting the device correction or removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Fire kills refugees TWO PEOPLE were killed and one was seriously injured in a New Year's Day fire at a hostel for asylum-seekers near Stuttgart in southern Germany, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Police ruled out arson. The blaze was in a prefabricated wooden building, part of a complex where up to 95 asylum-seekers have lived temporarily. Yesterday saw another huge German demonstration against racism, when an estimated 300,000 people turned out on a freezing evening in the city of Essen, in the industrial Ruhr region, to form a 'chain of light', with lanterns and candles, to condemn right-wing violence. Similar demonstrations of up to 500,000 people at a time have been held in other cities.</p>

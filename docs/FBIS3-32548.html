During the ceremony for the creation of the ADN, held at the  Monument to the Revolution, Cardenas demanded clean elections on  21 August 1994 and called for a national mobilization for  democracy.    The ADN is formed by the Party of the Democratic Revolution  (PRD), which is headed by Cardenas and is the only legally  registered organization; the Democratic Forum Party (PFD); the  Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT); the Social Democrat Party  (PSD); the Socialist Party (PS); and the Socialist Alternative  (AS). The ADN also includes fractions of the Labor Party (PT),  the Broad Socialist Left Party (PAIS), Socialist Refoundation  (RS) [Refundacion Socialista], and the National Patriotic Front  (FPN), which consists of diverse organizations and personalities.    Among the social and urban movement organizations, we have  the Assembly of Neighborhoods (AB) [Asamblea de Barrios], the  Independent Union of Agricultural Workers and Peasants (CIOAC)  [Central Independiente de Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos], the  Emiliano Zapata People's Union (UPREZ) [Union Popular Emiliano  Zapata], the New Tenochtitlan People's Union (UPNT) [Union  Popular Nueva Tenochtitlan], and the Assembly of the Workers  [Asamblea de los Trabajadores], among others.    Among the regional organizations there are regional groups  from Chihuahua State, Baja California Sur State, Colima State,  Queretaro State, Mexico State, citizen committees from 29  Mexican states, and numerous personalities from academic,  political, artistic, and cultural life.    Cardenas, who also aspired to the presidency in 1988, was  also supported by diverse political groups in that election.</p>

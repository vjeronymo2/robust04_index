			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> THIS UNLIKELY AIRPLANE DEAL COULD REALLY FLY  </P> <P> You would think that an airplane leasing company that calls itself  International Lease Finance Corp. would make its money by leasing airplanes to  customers. But you would be wrong. International Lease makes most of its money  not by leasing airplanes but by selling them.  </P> <P> Combine that wonderful fact with the fact that changing just one number can  send International Lease's reported profits rocketing up to the stratosphere,  and you begin to see why American International Group, the huge insurance  holding company, has the hots for International Lease.  </P> <P> AIG is forking over more than $3 billion -- $1.3 billion to International  Lease's stockholders and assuming $1.9 billion of debt -- to get into the  airplane game. But airplanes, if you can forgive the pun, are notorious for  being an up-and-down business. And the down part of the cycle seems to be  starting. Prices of some used airplanes are starting to slide. Some U.S.  airlines are starting to weaken.  </P> <P> And if the deal goes through, AIG will be on the hook not only for the $3.2  billion it's spending to buy International Lease but also for $15 billion or so  worth of planes that International Lease has committed to buy over the next 10  years. Committing billions to the airplane business in this market makes about  as much sense as buying a lifetime pass on Frank Lorenzo's airlines. Unless, of  course, you're very clever -- and AIG is nothing if not clever.  </P> <P> Part of the answer to why AIG is buying International Lease, of course, is that  AIG thinks the airplane market will be so strong in the next few years that it  will make a fortune because International Lease, the world's second-largest  plane leasing company, ordered its planes at cheap prices.  </P> <P> Another part of the answer, which emerges only when you massage some numbers,  is that AIG is an almost sure bet to have higher earnings with International  Lease than without it. How? By changing the way that International Lease  charges its earnings for depreciation on its planes.  </P> <P> Here's how it works. A company like International Lease has to charge its  earnings for the fact that its planes get closer to the end of their useful  lives with every passing year. You've heard of this before -- it's  depreciation. It's what happens to your car as you get more miles on the  odometer.  </P> <P> Airplanes can become old rust-buckets, too, but companies can't just put a  bumper sticker and a piece of fiberglass over the holes; they have to account  for it on their financial statements. Say International Lease spends $100  million for a plane. It charges its profits $4.5 million a year for  depreciation and decreases the plane's value on its balance sheet by that  amount.  </P> <P> International Lease makes its profit when it comes time to sell the plane; the  profit is the difference between the depreciated value of the aircraft and the  price for which it's finally sold. International Lease makes big money on sales  -- which means that its depreciation charges have been higher than they had to  be. In 1988, for instance, International Lease made $36 million (before income  taxes) by selling planes, compared to $20 million for leasing them. In 1989,  $53 million versus $20 million. In the first quarter of 1990, $14.9 million  versus a loss of $7 million, compared to $2.5 million versus a loss of $10.1  million a year earlier.  </P> <P> So AIG could cut the depreciation charges and give International Lease's  earnings a real boost. The company would report smaller profits on sales of  planes, but who cares? AIG's reported profits from "financial services" would  be up, and everyone would be happy.  </P> <P> AIG Vice Chairman Edward Matthews says that changing the depreciation numbers  "is under active consideration," but he wouldn't be drawn into a discussion  about it.  </P> <P> Say International Lease depreciated planes the way the world's biggest airplane  lessor, GPA Group, does. If you take that difference and apply it to the  $10-billion fleet that International Lease will soon have, reported earnings  increase $90 million a year at one stroke. That's a much easier way of making  money than actually earning it. And $90 million a year is about what  International Lease's whole operation earns now.  </P> <P> If the deal takes place, it should be fun to watch. The companies couldn't be  more different. Not only are they on opposite coasts -- AIG in New York City,  International Lease in Beverly Hills -- but AIG's 27-person tax department is  almost as large as all of International Lease, which has just added its 28th  employee.  </P> <P> AIG, as an insurance company, likes to eliminate risk. International Lease  relishes it. The company simultaneously juggles currencies, interest rates,  projected airline prices in the 21st Century and the financial outlook for  foreign airlines so obscure that few Americans can pronounce their names, let  alone figure them out.  </P> <P> The idea is "synergy." AIG talks about using its group of trading whizzes to  hedge International Lease's interest rate risk. International Lease talks about  some incomprehensible plan to do something with planes in Indonesia to take  advantage of Indonesian tax credits.  </P> <P> It all sounds wonderful -- but then again, it always does. Whether this deal  makes economic sense for AIG won't be clear for several years. But AIG's  ability to play games with depreciation means that the deal will make earnings  sense. These days, you take what you can get.  </P></p>

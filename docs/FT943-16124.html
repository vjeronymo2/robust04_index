			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Chernobyl's fate on the table  -Jill Barshay on a dilemma for G7 nations as they meet this week The road to Chernobyl is strikingly green. Even the abandoned ghost town, where the power station's employees used to live just 13km from the reactors, is surrounded with densely packed evergreen and birch trees. Only the monstrous cement and steel sarcophagus, covering the remnants of the exploded fourth reactor, reminds the visitor that a terrible disaster happened here eight years ago. Radiation levels have fallen considerably around most areas at the station to about the level of Kiev. Though safety precautions are still observed inside the reactors, outside workers and engineers no longer button up their outer body suits and often skip radiation checks at in spite of random patches of high contamination. The fate of Chernobyl will be a main topic at a meeting of the seven industrialised nations in Italy this week. Both the European Union and the US have been seeking to shut the station's two operating reactors since the Ukrainian parliament voted last October to keep them open. While western pressure is heightening, Ukraine is building its production capacity at Chernobyl. Contract labourers from western Ukraine are working around the clock to dismantle the old generator in a third reactor, which has been shut since a 1991 fire, and are preparing to put it on line again by 1997. Government ministers now freely admit that a secret presidential decree was issued last February to restart this reactor. Under domestic political pressure, the State Committee for Nuclear Safety gave a preliminary green light last Wednesday for the work to continue. Officials have argued persuasively that the electricity produced at Chernobyl, where each reactor saves Ukraine 2m tonnes of Russian oil a year, is vital for their nation's survival. They point out the reactors are no less safe than the other 13 antiquated graphite core reactors of this type that are scattered throughout Russia and Lithuania, but for which the west is not pressing immediate closure. 'Chernobyl is being isolated because of its symbolism and world opinion rather than its reality,' says Viktor Baryakhtar, vice president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Beyond the future of Ukraine's graphite core reactors, Ukraine is eager for western assistance in a greenfield clean-up of the Chernobyl zone. A new sarcophagus is needed to cover the existing one over the destroyed fourth reactor. Some 1,000 sq m of cracks originated with the hasty installation of the shell following the 1986 disaster. More than half have been sealed with fibreglass glue, but at least 400 sq m of cracks remain, admitting sun and rain to 10 tonnes of highly radioactive dust. Nuclear waste burial sites, filled with contaminated reactor parts from the explosion, also present an environmental hazard. These underground dumps have not been lined with clay, allowing the risk that radiation could seep into the water supply, although the water table is low in this area. Ukraine is willing to close the Chernobyl reactors if the west would offer a 'comprehensive solution', which includes new reactors to build Ukraine's domestic energy production and a full clean-up from the 1986 explosion. The issue is how much and how broad this compensation package will be. So far the EU has offered only Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) of what it estimates will be a total Ecu1.35bn G7 package to close the reactors. 'Ukraine has not formulated its position yet. We're waiting for the G7 to make an offer and we'll start our serious negotiation from there and say what Ukraine can do for this amount of money,' explains Yuri Kostenko, environment minister. Part of western frustration is that Chernobyl is not seen as a danger by Ukrainian officials, but as a bargaining chip. There is the fear that Kiev will continually up the ante and stall as it did during the negotiations over getting rid of its nuclear arms.</p>

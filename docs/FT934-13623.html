			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: India's trade regime too complex, says Gatt report INDIA's bold economic reform programme which started in 1991 has already begun to pay off in improved competitiveness at home and abroad, but its trade regime remains complex, distorted and difficult for traders to fathom, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published yesterday The Indian government is urged to pursue lower and more uniform tariffs, scrap import licensing and tackle the 'still significant' anti-export bias of trade policy. The report says the 1991 reforms, in the wake of an economic crisis, reflect 'a paradigm shift away from economic intervention towards greater reliance on the interplay of market forces' and mark a sharp departure from India's previous almost closed trade regime. Maximum tariffs have been sliced from 355 per cent to 85 per cent in 1993 and will be lowered to 50 per cent by 1997. However, the maximum tariff continues to apply to about a quarter of tariff lines, with the result that the average tariff has fallen less dramatically to 71 per cent from 125 per cent in 1990-91. Gatt says tariffs have become more dispersed and their structure remains complicated and non-transparent. India has 'bound' (agreed not to raise) fewer than 1 per cent of its tariffs under Gatt. India's system of discretionary import licensing, which still affects over one-third of tariff lines and almost all consumer goods, also comes in for criticism from Gatt. The European Community has failed to include any reductions in its high duties on fish imports in its latest market access offer circulated this week to trading partners in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The omission, which on some estimates covers over half the EC's peak tariffs (duties over 15 per cent), sits oddly with the EC's insistence that the leading traders should slash most peak tariffs by half. Embarrassed EC negotiators, said yesterday that Brussels was prepared to negotiate lower tariffs against satisfactory access arrangements to foreign fishing grounds where these did not already exist.</p>

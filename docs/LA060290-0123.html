			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA TAKES NEW STEP TO END SEGREGATION  </P> <P> The white minority government took a step toward changing its policy of  apartheid by introducing legislation Friday to end the racial segregation of  public amenities such as parks, libraries and bathrooms.  </P> <P> The Separate Amenities Act, passed in 1953, had granted provincial governments,  municipalities and privately owned entertainment establishments the right to  reserve facilities for whites.  </P> <P> A bill that would repeal the act was published Friday and is expected to be  passed in mid-June, the South African Press Assn. reported. It was the latest  move by the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk to dismantle  apartheid.  </P> <P> The Conservative Party, the largest white opposition party, is the only  parliamentary group expected to oppose the bill, but the party does not have  enough votes to block it. Hernus Kriel, minister of provincial affairs and  planning, has called for the changes, if approved, to take effect Oct. 15.  </P> <P> The bill would remove local governments' authority to racially segregate public  facilities such as libraries, toilets, parks and buses. It also would remove  the legal protection of individuals who want to reserve restaurants, hotels,  resorts and other public facilities for whites.  </P> <P> In most major cities, such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, public amenities have  been desegregated in recent months. But in hundreds of smaller cities, towns  and villages, there are either no public facilities for blacks in the city  centers, or there are inferior, separate amenities.  </P> <P> The Separate Amenities Act is considered one of the pillars of apartheid, the  system of racial separation and white domination encoded in law by the National  Party when it came to power in 1948.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Energy treaty near on helping ex-Soviet bloc THE 50 signatories of the European energy charter could finalise a legally-binding agreement by the summer on how to help the former Soviet Union exploit its energy resources, according to the chairman of talks on the charter. The ideals of the December 1991 political declaration which launched the charter cannot be put into effect until a legally-binding treaty is agreed. But Mr Charles Rutten, chairman of the talks, indicated yesterday that a majority of countries could sign such a treaty and press ahead with implementation of the charter, even if single members continued to resist. Advocates of the charter believe it will help kick-start market economies in the former Communist eastern bloc, by guaranteeing stable conditions for investment in the east's dilapidated energy system. Mr Rutten told journalists that last week's full session of the charter talks, attended by members of the Community and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as almost all east and central European countries, had reached agreement on a number of central aspects of the treaty. But he has had to revise initial predictions that a treaty could be signed in May, because of a series of outstanding problems. They include the need to dove-tail a treaty with existing commitments under the Gatt agreement and continuing resistance from Norway over clauses which would prevent members treating foreign energy companies less favourably than their own national groups.</p>

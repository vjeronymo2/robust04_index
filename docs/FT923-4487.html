			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Israeli budget proposals attacked ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday delivered a sharp attack on the Labour-led government's 1993 budget plan - its first broad economic policy initiative since coming to power in July - saying the proposals lacked the right measures to stimulate growth and employment in the immigration-burdened economy. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, was released from hospital where he was being treated for a leg infection to present his Shk98bn (Pounds 20bn) budget to the cabinet. It is meant to shift the emphasis laid by the previous Likud government on construction - especially in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - towards increasing employment in the private sector within Israel 'proper' where unemployment is running at more than 11 per cent. A package of proposals for significant structural reforms, including liberalisation in the capital markets, the import regime and the state's monopoly in telecommunications, was also presented to ministers. The budget encompasses a Shk800m tax cut and a modest shift to greater spending on infrastructure. But Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, told the cabinet it did not go far enough. 'A greater increase of investments in infrastructure, additional tax reductions which will increase employment in the business sector and additional investments in human infrastructure by increasing education budgets are required,' he said. 'In the budget submitted today there is no satisfactory concentration of such steps.' Mr Frenkel said the government should be willing to cut the welfare and defence budgets to finance extra investment. Both areas, which together make up almost half of government expenditure, were largely untouched in Mr Shochat's proposals. Nonetheless, leftist members of the government attacked the budget for not allocating more to social spending. They also called for deeper cuts on spending next year on Jewish settlements which is estimated to total around Shk2.5bn, mainly on housing envisaged by the previous government. Mr Shochat's reform proposals included: abandoning preferential government bonds issued to trade union pension funds; breaking the monopoly of Bezeq, the state telecommunications company, on international telephone links and mobile phones, and freeing imports of petrol and meat.</p>

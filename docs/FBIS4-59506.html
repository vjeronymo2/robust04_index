			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of approximately 40 Council of Jewish  Settlements leaders and yeshiva students, headed by Knesset  Member Hanan Porat, arrived in Jericho's old synagogue a short  time ago. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports they arrived in a  convoy of cars hoisting Israeli flags. The commander of the  Palestinian police force in the area opened the synagogue gates  and they entered accompanied by many media crews. Our  correspondent notes that there is great tension in the place.</p>

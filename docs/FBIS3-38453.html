			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Silver Lining to the Economic </F> Clouds"]    [Text] In the course of the recovery in West Europe in  1994, Austria's economic development will slowly get out of the  period of shrinking, Andreas Woergoetter, economic researcher at  the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS), says with cautious  optimism.    In particular the revival of the economic development in the  United States has a positive effect, Woergoetter says. Thus,  domestic exports to the United States strongly increased last  year.    At the moment a strong and "healthy" impulse is coming from  the United States, because growth is still taking place without  an acceleration of inflation. The other large industrial  nations are currently not able to generate their own stimuli  since they must cope with far-reaching structural adjustment  problems, Woergoetter says.    "There is no doubt that the low point of the recession has  been overcome, but the upward movement is very slow," Ewald  Walterskirchen, economic development expert of the Economic  Research Institute (WIFO), says, assessing the current economic  situation. The signals from the United States and the Austrian  tax reform do have a positive effect, but the trust of the  investors is not yet there. Last year industry's plans for  investments were reduced by about 20 percent, this year  Walterskirchen expects a 4-percent decline.    Walterskirchen, too, does not see any reason at the moment  to  revise the forecasts for Austria (WIFO: 1.5 percent growth of  the real GDP; IHS: 1.4 percent).    Both researchers see problems for the FRG, Austria's most  important economic partner. The tax increases that have been  announced for 1995 could have a dampening effect on growth.</p>

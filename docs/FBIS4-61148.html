			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by IPRINDA correspondent Nana Rizhamadze: "Lost </F> Credits?"]    [Text] On 20 April, Colonel Valerian Gogolashvili, head of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Center, stated in a  conversation with an agency correspondent that there had been a  sharp increase in economic crimes recently. In particular,  according to Gogolashvili, the Department for the Struggle  Against Economic Crimes is investigating a large number of facts  connected with credits received by various firms and private  individuals. All these processes involve serious violations.  Under the pretext of purchasing food products, petrol, and so  forth, firms are receiving large credits from banks (often  through stooges). Then, these sums are transferred to other  banks outside the republic; as a rule, these sums -- already in  rubles and dollars -- are "pocketed" and, naturally, they are  not used to purchase anything. In this regard, according to  agreements concluded between the ministries of internal affairs  of the CIS member states, power structures are carrying out  joint work (sometimes with the involvement of Interpol) aimed at  exposing all these facts.</p>

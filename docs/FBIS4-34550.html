			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  on 17 June implicitly condemned North Korea's position of  keeping its nuclear program secret. He said: "The largest world  powers are making a considerable effort to prevent a small  country from causing a true holocaust on the planet."    Without mentioning the Asian country, Menem said: "It is a  small country, which went practically unnoticed in the past few  years, that has embarked on intensive development of nuclear  energy, and has obviously built atomic bombs that can cause  grave damage to the planet."    The president emphasized: "We Argentines work for life while  others work for death."    Menem made these remarks during the inauguration and  beginning of operation of the plant for cyclotron-produced  radioisotopes for medical use [planta de produccion de ciclotron  de radioisotopos de uso medico] in the Ezeiza Atomic Center.    The plant has state-of-the-art German equipment and will  permit the manufacturing of products vital in modern medicine.  It will reduce costs and permit the use of these products in  hospitals located far from urban centers. Radioisotopes are  radioactive atoms with a nucleus with a different mass. Their  use in improving living conditions is increasingly diverse. They  are useful in increasing the yield of vegetables, preserving  food, sterilizing medical products, conducting hormone analysis,  using X-ray tubes in the control of industrial processes, or  studying environmental contamination.    Menem was accompanied by Manuel Mondino, head of the  National  Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), and Buenos Aires Production  Minister Carlos Brown and Public Works Minister Hugo Toledo.    Menem made a list of CNEA achievements and then added that  "some countries develop nuclear energy for death. We Argentines  have been working for life ever since we began operating in this  area 44 years ago, perhaps a little more, under the inspiration  of General Juan Domingo Peron."    Menem added: "There are two countries with this type of  development in the Southern Hemisphere: Australia and  Argentina."    "When you work on atoms you realize that they can be used  not  only for medical purposes but also for production to improve all  types of activities in rural areas such as agriculture and  livestock or pest eradication and control. We work on these  aspects here and we are at the same level as the world's other  great countries."</p>

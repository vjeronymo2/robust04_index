			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Short-lived Paris rally on rates move THE TURMOIL in Europe's currency markets continued yesterday with defensive initiatives from France and Spain, and more positive moves in the strong currency markets of Belgium and Austria, writes Our Markets Staff. Equity investment reflected extremes of sentiment with Switzerland, once again the fiscally safe haven, performing well and Sweden, afraid of an ERM collapse, higher interest rates and more disasters within its own banking sector, back in the pits again. PARIS initially rallied after the central bank raised key interest rates, before falling back on fears that efforts to support the franc may fail. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a high of 1,851 during the session, retreated to close 3.88 lower at 1,828.93. Turnover was steady at FFr2.5bn. Basket-trading was reported to have contributed to the fall in some defensive stocks, including L'Oreal's 4.6 per cent decline as its shares closed down FFr46 at FFr961. Air Liquide reflected first half results issued after Tuesday's close. The 5 per cent rise in profit was below expectations and the stock lost FFr14 to FFr747. Lafarge came off FFr11 to FFr279 ahead of figures, released just after the close, which were slightly better than expected, while Credit Lyonnais lost a further FFr22.50 on its investment certificates to FFr484.50 following Tuesday's bad half-year results. FRANKFURT re-ran the twin themes of interest rate cut hopes, and fears of industrial recession. The obvious international blue chips moved both ways, although the DAX index rose 7.49 to 1,557.83. Banks rose on the rate talk, with the interest-sensitive Bavarians in the van. Bayernhypo and Bayernverein both put on DM9.50, to DM393 and DM409.50 respectively, and Deutsche Bank ended DM11.50 higher at DM661.50; among insurers, Allianz followed suit, up DM37 to DM1,824. Carmakers and chemicals, once again, were not so ebullient. BMW continued to lose ground in its sector, DM11.50 lower at DM514 as Volkswagen stayed flat at DM306.50. Hoechst, recently the strongest of the big three chemicals, fell DM1.70 to DM244.50 while BASF and Bayer came out fractionally ahead. MADRID was uneasy at the reintroduction of currency controls and fears persisted of a further 5 per cent peseta devaluation. The general index closed off 2.34 at 205.22 while the Ibex was 1.6 per cent lower. Turnover slipped to Pta12bn from Pta15bn. Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities said that the measures taken by the central bank yesterday might have bought a bit of time, 'but if sentiment turns negative again there may have to be a further devaluation'. He added that Spain's commitment to the ERM might well leave the peseta 'in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe.' AMSTERDAM, calm in the eye of the storm, was speculating that the central bank may cut interest rates today, independently of any move by the Bundesbank. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 113.1. BRUSSELS took little notice of a cut in local interest rates and the Bel-20 index lost 2.24 to 1,112.26 in turnover of BFr691m. Delhaize put on BFr20 to BFr1,530, helped by the stronger dollar. Clabecq rose BFr122 to BFr552, having lost more than 50 per cent over the previous four trading days. MILAN recovered from early lows to close with the Comit index 5.05, or 1.4 per cent lower at 364.54 after a fall of around 2 per cent in the morning. But dealers said that the mood remained gloomy and that the price changes were only technical corrections. Mediobanca shed 3.5 per cent, Fiat 2.5 per cent and Sip 2.7 per cent in heavy trading. Fiat, which is due to announce half-year results today, rebounded on the kerb to end the day at L3,640 against an official close of L3,578. ZURICH rose in strong volume, its relatively high monetary and political stability taking the SMI index up by 12.8 to 1,913.4. One dealer said that French investors, in particular, were channelling funds into Switzerland, attracted by lower interest rates and a rally in the bond market after UBS cut rates on all cash bonds by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 1/2 per cent. Banks, the quickest to gain, topped the active list as CS Holding rose SFr20 to SFr1,930 and SBC firmed SFr5 to SFr278. Chemicals were also in demand with Ciba-Geigy registered SFr12 higher at SFr643. VIENNA was firmer after the Austrian National Bank cut its intervention rate leading to speculation of further interest rate reductions. The ATX index advanced 13.61 or 1.6 per cent to 836.05, Creditanstalt advancing Sch5 to Sch435 in spite of warning that dividends may be cut this year. STOCKHOLM fell sharply, and closed at the day's low. Swedish institutions were perceived as sellers, partly due to the troubles of the domestic financial sector and a need to create liquidity. High interest rates and a lack of foreign interest completed the story. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 26.8, or 3.6 per cent to 709.2. All sectors fell, but banking continued to bear the brunt of the decline, dropping by 10.6 per cent. S-E Banken, which has claims of about SKr1bn on Gota, which recently suspended payments to creditors, fell to a new 1992 low of SKr9.50, down SKr2.50.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 23                               Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1044.11  1045.76  1047.52  1053.15  1053.31  1050.46  1045.21  1043.77                   Day's High  1055.00    Day's Low  1043.42         Sep 22      Sep 21     Sep 18      Sep 17      Sep 16        1044.34     1050.43     1070.95     1058.13     1053.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

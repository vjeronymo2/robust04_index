			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> We all have mental pictures of natural events large and small: cyclones, phases  of the moon, lightning, the simple act of dropping a rock into a pond. In his  recent work, John Divola meditates on the distance between these frozen,  simplified images and the nuanced complexity of real-life events.  </P> <P> He constructs engagingly raffish mock-ups of natural scenes with wildly painted  papier-mache and photographs them in black-and-white with a large-format  Polaroid camera.  </P> <P> Resulting images reduce grandiose acts of God into simple plays of form and  light, and amplify small corners of nature into exuberant fanfares. In the  sequence of four photographs that make up "Cyclone on the Beach," a cone shape  gradually darkens, shadows deepen and "stars" emerge on the gray "sky"  backdrop. In "Splash," a papier-mache rock churns up a frankly fake wake of  choppy brush strokes on a painted body of water.  </P> <P> Most works have a strong, elemental visual appeal especially "Lightning," with  its trio of whisper-thin, vertical white lines cutting through a drippy  gray-black ground. As Divola writes, his work is about "accident, gesture,  process and a melancholy faith." (Jan Kesner Gallery, 164 N. La Brea Ave., to  Feb. 17.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

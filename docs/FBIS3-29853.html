The amendment was signed by Japanese Ambassador to  Indonesia,  Kimio Fujita, and Wisber Loeis [name as received] of the  Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    It is now possible for Japanese airlines to exercise traffic  rights for their own stopover passengers between Jakarta and  Denpasar from April 1, 1994.    After the Kansai International Airport opens, Indonesian  Airlines will be able to extend air services to Tokyo, Nagoya,  Osaka and Fukuoka.    Flights between Japan and Indonesia have been conducted on  the basis of an agreement signed between the two countries on  January 23, 1962. The schedule has previously been amended in  1965, 1970, 1987 and 1990.    The latest amendment is designed to cope with the increasing  demand for flights between Japan and Indonesia to cope with an  increase of tourists to Bali in particular, and to help the  Indonesian Government promote tourism.</p>

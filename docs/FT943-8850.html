			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Breaking the link Since the last time UK equity yields fell below those on index-linked gilts was before the 1987 crash, it is not surprising that the current 10 basis point premium enjoyed by the latter is attracting attention. But direct comparisons are risky. The premium is smaller than it was in 1987 when equities looked seriously overvalued on other yardsticks too. The index-linked market, which is tiny in proportion to equities, is also notoriously lacking in liquidity. Though real yields of close to 4 per cent look cheap, they may not in practice have much room to fall. Marketmakers report a modest shift into index-linked paper by UK institutions anxious to match long-term assets with liabilities. But this demand has been readily matched with supply from the Bank of England. If it believes in its own inflation forecasts, index-linked gilts are obviously a cheap means of funding. They are also an alternative to the fixed-rate market where borrowing conditions remain difficult. Also it would not be surprising to see additional index-linked borrowing from utilities like water companies, which have high capital spending requirements and revenues linked to the retail price index. Pressure of supply may thus be forcing the index-linked market to decouple from equities. The pace of economic recovery also points to upward pressure on real interest rates. That need not worry equities as long as earnings growth is fast enough to allow dividends to rise in real terms. If that prospect were undermined, for example by higher base rates, it would be much harder for equities to out perform.</p>

A change is needed to implement Title V, Section 516(d) of Public Law 102&hyph;552, Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which provides that grants may also be made to create, expand, and operate rural distance learning networks and rural learning programs that provide educational or job training instruction related to potential employment or job advancement for adult students. The intended effect is to make this an eligible grant purpose under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective May 23, 1994.

Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling. All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B, must be exhausted prior to filing suit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Intergovernmental Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This action affects the following RDA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under 10.769 Rural Business Enterprise and Television Demonstration Grants and is subject to the provisions of E.O. 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983, 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984, 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0132 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This interim rule does not revise or impose any new information collection requirement from those approved by OMB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion of the Interim Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> It is the policy of the Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, the Department is making this action effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  without securing prior public comment. The purpose of this rule is to implement Title V, Section 516(d), of Public Law 102&hyph;552, Farm Credit Banks and Association Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which amends Section 310B(c) (7 U.S.C. 1932(c)) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act which allows grants for the creation, expansion, and operation of rural distance learning networks or rural learning programs that provide educational instruction or job training instruction related to potential employment or job advancement for adult students. This rule making action does not encompass discretionary decision making by the agency, but merely adds the text of Section 516(d)'s amendment to Section 310B(c) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act into the regulations governing the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. That program provides grants to facilitate the development of small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas. This assistance is expected to further the development of small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas by making available to developing businesses qualified employees necessary for successful startup or expansion. While the Department is reluctant to short circuit prior public comment, it is certain that failure to implement the program will result in negative impact in rural areas by not fully utilizing the grant program to its fullest authorization for avenues to help facilitate the development of businesses in rural areas. Because the appropriated funds for the program are not available past the end of fiscal year 1994, it is essential that this authorization be implemented this fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

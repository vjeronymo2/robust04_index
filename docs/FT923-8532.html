			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Union urges greater Bundesbank accountability THE 'uncontrolled power' of Germany's independent Bundesbank should be balanced by greater accountability to parliament and other democratic institutions, according to Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the I G Metall trade union. While the central bank paid 'extensive and excessive' attention to inflation, it neglected its other legal and economic responsibilities, the metal workers' leader said in a newspaper article yesterday. Laws governing the central bank obliged it to support the overall economic policies of the government, he wrote. Price stability was only one of its responsibilities; others included increasing employment, steady economic growth and foreign trade balances. He wrote that the bank 'sets itself apart from the democratic exchanges over economic policy aims with its extreme and one-sided focus on price stability'. He proposed that the bank present reports at least once a year for debate in the Bundestag. Parliamentary committees should be able to summon officials to hearings, and the bank should have a new advisory committee to reflect the views of society at large. Democratising German monetary policy in this way was all the more important in the light of the planned establishment of an independent European central bank, he said. This, too, should have increased accountability. The right to hearings and consultation should apply not just to the European Parliament but to the economic and social committee, for example. Federal factions, such as the central banks of Germany's individual states, should also have a say. Referring to the recent controversial increase in the discount rate, he said indirect attempts to control inflation through attacking money supply had negative side-effects. 'All too often a blow aimed at money supply ends up hitting companies' solvency and their ability to invest,' he claimed. Seizing on the political and business criticism - at home and abroad - of July's rate increase, Mr Steinkuhler said the protests must be taken to heart and the bank should be set new aims. Although the governing coalition was upset by the Bundesbank's latest move, which was against the wishes of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, the parties rejected the union leader's proposals. 'Price stability must remain the main aim of our economic and finance policy,' said Mr Gunnar Uldall, representing the main Christian Democrat/Christian Social Union group. Liberal Democrats leader Otto Lambsdorff suggested the union leader would be better occupied contemplating the inflationary effects of I G Metall's pay demands than criticising the Bundesbank.</p>

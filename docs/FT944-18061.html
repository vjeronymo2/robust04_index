			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe confirms VSEL bid talks British Aerospace has finally confirmed that it is seeking to negotiate a 'recommended offer' for VSEL, the submarine maker. British Aerospace's announcement of discussions follows five days of speculation over the deal; but advisers said the company was anxious to ensure there was a firm basis to negotiations before they were made public. The company was also under considerable pressure from the Stock Exchange to make a statement. Shares in VSEL rose 17p to 1195p on the news that negotiations were moving forward, and a final announcement could be made before the week-end. British Aerospace is aiming to become a major defence contractor on land, sea and air, but thus far its sea activities have been restricted to weapons systems rather than shipbuilding. The company clearly reckons that its expertise in defence contracting and systems integration could help VSEL win the next Ministry of Defence contracts for Trafalgar Class submarines. An added attraction is VSEL's cash holding of around Pounds 320m, which would provide welcome support for a group which suffered a Pounds 115m operating cash outflow in the first half of 1994. The Ministry of Defence, which is a key party to negotiations as both VSEL's major customer and holder of a golden share in its shipbuilding operations, has been briefed on progress. British Aerospace is confident a deal would be approved. The negotiations are being handled by Kleinwort Benson, for British Aerospace, and Morgan Grenfell. So far there has been no approach from an obvious alternative buyer, GEC. Analysts said GEC was unlikely to emerge from the background until a price was agreed, or unless talks collapse.</p>

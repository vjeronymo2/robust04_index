The talks, which were initiated by the Islamic Republic of  Iran, had significant outcomes for the solution of the  Tajikistan crisis. To inform you of the views of the Tajikistan  opposition, the following are remarks by Akbar Turjanzadeh, head  of the Tajik opposition delegation to the talks, from an  interview with our correspondent:    [Begin Turjanzadeh recording, in Tajik] The outcome of our  talks was good because the basic preconditions we had set before  holding any talks with the regime in Dushanbe were met and we  held a meeting with a high-ranking Russian envoy, Anatoliy  Adamishin, in Tehran.    Our basic preconditions for holding talks in Moscow were  that  the full security of the participants in the talks be ensured  and that observers and mediators from Iran, Russia, Pakistan,  and Afghanistan be present. Russia did not formally accept this  precondition. But after two days of talks, Russia accepted this  precondition.    In the talks that will be held in Moscow and then in Tehran  or other countries, we will discuss topics; the most important  ones are the creation of an interim government council  consisting of neutral personalities who did not participate in  this fratricide, the complete disarmament of both sides, and the  holding of free elections two years after the establishment of  tranquility and stability in Tajikistan with the participation  of various parties. [end recording]    As far as efforts by the Islamic Republic of Iran in solving  the Tajikistan crisis, Morteza Bank, director general of the  East European Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry, said:    [Begin Bank recording] Various steps have been taken by the  Islamic Republic of Iran within this period. The most important  step was coordination and cooperation with the United Nations  and representatives of the UN secretary general, with whom we  held very good talks during their two visits to Tehran. Also,  our diplomatic mission in Tajikistan was extremely active in  this issue and was able to inform the UN representative of the  situation inside Tajikistan.    Another effort was our continuous contacts with important  regional countries, namely Russia, including the visit by the  Russian foreign minister to Tehran, the two visits by the  special envoy of the Russian president to Tehran, and the visit  by the Russian deputy foreign minister to Tehran. We held  extremely good and detailed talks with these officials, who were  briefed on the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    We also had continuous contacts with the Tajik Government,  met with Tajik officials--the president and the foreign  minister--in various sessions, such as the Economic Cooperation  Organization [ECO] session in Istanbul and the ECO session in  Tehran, and discussed various viewpoints. And finally, a strong  contact was established with the opposition--both the national  faction and especially the Islamic faction. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Management: Ain't no mountain high enough - Christopher Lorenz explains why Berghaus is revamping its distribution for the second time / Rethinking Europe AS BEFITS an enterprise run by all-weather mountaineers, rock climbers and hill trekkers, Berghaus has always been a pioneer. Its innovative technical design and marketing have made the 450-person company one of Europe's leading and most fashionable makers of 'performance' outdoor clothing, including rucksacks, jackets, trousers and gaiters. Like so many of Germany's medium-sized companies - the 'Mittelstand' - Berghaus has long enjoyed soaring sales and an export ratio of around 50 per cent. As from last week, the company is preparing to pioneer in a new direction: by revolutionising its relationship with retailers in continental European markets. Its move is likely to affect all its competitors. Berghaus is also rethinking a distribution system it set up in Italy and Germany as recently as 1987-88. That, in turn, results from a newly-implemented two-year revamp of its manufacturing process, which has been shifted from mass production to flexible short runs. Berghaus is not German, Swiss or Austrian, as its name suggests. It is thoroughly British, or to be more specific, steeped in the gritty character of its home town of Newcastle upon Tyne in north-east England. In the last 20 years it has built thriving export businesses to Italy, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Benelux and Switzerland (in approximate order of current sales volume). Only in France has it 'utterly failed to crack the market so far', admits David Udberg, its joint managing director. He blames vicious domestic price competition and French chauvinism. In the current financial year sales will top Pounds 20m for the first time, with pre-tax profit climbing towards the Pounds 750,000 peak of the late 1980s after two years of problems caused by the factory reorganisation and the UK recession. When, four years ago, the Financial Times last looked at Berghaus's continental European sales strategy, it had just introduced what was intended to be a faster and cheaper way of responding to orders from the 500 small family shops which constitute the fragmented Italian market. And it was on the verge of extending the approach to Germany. A vital back-up for both markets was to be a Pounds 300,000 German computer system in Newcastle, capable of reserving and allocating stock several months in advance. With the exception of the German arrangements, little of this has turned out as planned. Almost all of it had to be rethought. For a start, the computer software failed to function as promised. The result, from July 1989 to the end of that year, was five months with no management accounts or credit notes and two without invoices. No sooner had that problem been resolved than the company was hit by the third mild winter in a row. Both Berghaus and its retailers were burdened with stock. The company's reaction was to pull out of skiwear - a strong seller in Italy  -and accelerate a move towards more flexible garments with removable layers, which sell throught the year. The immediate result was a drop in Berghaus's Italian sales by 15 per cent in 1990-91. This has been more than recouped, with this year's Italian revenue expected to be more than Pounds 2.5m, keeping Italy well out in front of Germany and fast-growing Norway (with Pounds 1.6m each) as Berghaus's largest export market. At the same time as the computer and the weather were wreaking havoc, Berghaus's Italian branch and warehouse were having problems (see panel). To put no finer point on it, 'we got our fingers burned,' says Mark Held, the 35-year-old export director. Just as the Italian warehouse has been replaced by a direct distribution system, Berghaus may have to reconsider the role of the efficient but costly German distribution base it set up near Cologne in 1989. Such a review may be sparked by a more radical decision: Berghaus's attempt to steal a march on its continental competitors with a new rapid order and delivery system for continental Europe which will allow retailers to cut stocks drastically. Until now, outdoor clothing retailers in continental Europe have mainly ordered stock and taken delivery in two frenetic seasons. This has meant retailers holding stock for up to six months. In recent years British retailers have shied away from this pattern because of soaring interest rates, unpredictably dry and hot weather and the effects of recession. As a result, Berghaus this year launched a 'stock response system' based on the sort of 'direct sell-through' ( or 'just-in-time') supply relationship between makers of fast-moving consumer goods and their UK supermarket customers. This shifts most of the stockholding risk, and much of that for demand forecasting, on to suppliers. As from this month Berghaus's main UK retail outlets can choose to hold an agreed range of goods and up to four weeks' of stock, in exchange for automatic replenishment from Berghaus once a month, with delivery within a week. In 1989, for both home and export markets, Berghaus's order-to-delivery cycle on many items was as long as six-12 weeks. Last week, as a precursor to introducing a full UK-style 'stock response system' this autumn, the company relaxed its Pounds l,500-2,000 minimum order levels for its main continental European retailers to a single garment. Berghaus will thus no longer be able to rely on having a fat order book seven or eight months ahead. 'Its a drastic change - the biggest since I joined the company nine years ago,' says Held. 'We'll have to forecast better, manufacture speculatively, and take a risk on stock.' The company's back-up stock is being raised by 30 per cent. To its main export customers, Berghaus is aiming to offer the same order-to-delivery response of seven days or less that it provides in the UK. This will put on severe trial its planning, manufacturing, supply and distribution arrangements. It will also test whether the theory of an efficiently operating single European market can become a reality during 1993. A previous article in this series appeared on January 4</p>

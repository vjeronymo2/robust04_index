			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (5): Structure has been simplified - Andrew Hill says the telecoms industry has a difficult task ahead Correction (published 8th November 1994) appended to this article. If Italy's state-controlled telecommunications companies have one advantage over their counterparts in other European countries, it is that their customers love to talk. That does not just mean Italians make a lot of phone calls from home. They are also Europe's most flamboyant users of mobile telephones - telefonini - flaunted everywhere from the tables of the local trattoria to the pillion-seat of scooters. This phenomenon has brought a smile to the face of executives at Telecom Italia, the state-controlled telephone operator, and its parent Stet in particular, because they are preparing Telecom Italia's mobile telephone operations for a potentially lucrative demerger and flotation before the end of the year. But despite successful attempts at modernisation over the past decade, Italy's telecoms industry still has a difficult task ahead over the next five years if it is to compete internationally in a fast-changing sector. At least the structure of the Italian telecoms sector has been simplified in the past six months. Until recently, separate state-owned companies, each with a different corporate identity, worked in parallel, sometimes on tasks which overlapped. Earlier this year, however, it was agreed that Italy's five telecoms operating companies, headed by Sip, the domestic telephone operator, should be merged to form Telecom Italia. Stet now owns some 60 per cent of Telecom Italia together with other holdings in areas such as manufacturing and software, and international joint ventures such as Stream, the multimedia company jointly owned with Bell Atlantic of the US. Stet is itself 65 per cent owned by IRI, the state holding company, and the outstanding shares in Stet and Telecom Italia are traded on the Milan stock exchange. 'We took a great step forward when we agreed on this merger between the five companies,' says Mr Umberto Silvestri, chairman of Telecom Italia and former chief executive at Stet, who identifies the change of management culture at the 60-year-old monopoly as one of his main challenges. But there are at least four other important areas in which Stet and Telecom Italia must act quickly: Liberalisation. Like rivals in other European Union countries, Italy will have to meet a deadline of 1998 for the introduction of competition in voice telephony. This may prove to be more of a challenge in Italy than elsewhere, because its tariffs are further out of line with the international average than those in other European countries. In particular, international calls from Italy are among the most expensive in Europe and business users are already taking advantage of private call-back services which capitalise on cheaper US rates, for example. Further rebalancing of tariffs in April has reduced the discrepancies but there is still more work to be done. For example, according to Telecom Italia it now costs more to call Italy from the US than vice versa, but Mr Silvestri still estimates that the price of international calls will have to come down by about a quarter and local tariffs increase by about the same amount. The role of an independent regulatory authority - yet to be established in Italy - will also be crucial in making sure that Telecom Italia does not abuse its dominant position on the market after liberalisation, particularly as Italy is proving slow to implement existing directives opening up specialised telecoms services to competition. Earlier this month, a Milan court ruled that Sip-Telecom Italia, in line with European Union rules, would have to offer leased lines to Telsystem, a small telecoms services company, a move widely interpreted as opening a crack in the domestic operator's monopoly. Investment. Stet and Telecom Italia have both been investing heavily to modernise the much-criticised Italian telephone system. Telecom Italia, for example, invested L9,500bn in 1992 and more than L10,000bn last year. In 1994, that figure will drop to about L9,500bn, and again in the years leading up to 1998, but the overall amount invested over the six years between 1992 and 1998 is still likely to be more than L50,000bn. Much of that has been spent on bringing the Italian network up to scratch, and adapting it to the likely demand for high technology multimedia services. Telecom Italia is set to spend some L2,000bn in the next three years specifically to ease the growth of a market for, say, video on demand or sophisticated tele-shopping. At the moment, some 60 per cent of Telecom Italia's investment is financed by debt, and 40 per cent from internal funding. Mr Silvestri hopes that by the end of 1997 that ratio will be reversed. Privatisation. 'The sale of IRI's remaining shares in Stet is now unlikely to take place before the middle of 1995, probably after the flotation of the cellular phone business. Both events are keenly awaited by international investors, and by the telecoms companies themselves, which have been constrained by their inability to raise finance through share issues because of IRI's unwillingness to stump up cash for its rights. A merger between Stet and Telecom Italia - which would give the Italian telecoms sector an even simpler structure - now seems unlikely for practical reasons, but the sell-off should be eased by the fact that Mr Michele Tedeschi, chairman of IRI since the summer, used to be chief executive of Stet. As this survey went to press, IRI was preparing to choose advisers for the Stet sell-off. They will have to decide what sort of mechanism to install to prevent Stet's 'strategic importance' being compromised. A 'golden share' is likely to be one possibility, or the formation of a hard core of large investors, dominated by Italian companies and institutions. International weight. In terms of market value, Telecom Italia and Stet are already the biggest industrial companies listed on the Italian stock market. Following the merger, Telecom Italia can count on a total annual turnover of L2,700bn, and a net profit of at least L1,025bn. It is the sixth-largest telecoms operator in the world, after NTT of Japan, AT&amp;T of the US and the German, French and British national operators. But Italian telecoms executives concede that this is not weighty enough, particularly as most rivals are rapidly forming international alliances. Telecom Italia is in discussion with 'three or four' medium-sized companies in the hope of finding a partner. Without such a deal, Telecom Italia and Stet risk being left behind in the race to be one of the five or six big operators which most analysts believe will dominate the world telecoms market at the beginning of the next century. CORRECTION In the FT survey on Italian Industry and Technology, published on October 25, the article on the telecoms sector stated that 60 per cent of Telecom Italia's investment was financed by debt, and 40 per cent from internal resources. The company points out that those figures refer to the coverage of capital invested as at December 31 1993, before the merger of state-owned telecoms companies, and not to annual investment, which is financed entirely from internal resources. In 1994, Telecom Italia expects capital expenditure to be more than covered by cash-flow. The annual turnover of the company in the 1993 pro forma profit and loss account was approximately L27,000bn (Dollars 17.27bn) and not L2,700bn, as incorrectly reported.</p>

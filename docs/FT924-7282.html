			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Politics and poor results depress Japanese volume VOLUME fell to a 10-year low yesterday as share prices lost more ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 167.80 to 16,162.99 on small-lot selling by individuals and arbitrage-unwinding. It opened at the day's high of 16,314.94, and fell to a low of 16,122.97 in the afternoon. Volume was just 120m shares, its lowest since August 1982. Declines led advances by 593 to 293 with 204 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.72 to 1,232.52 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.69 down to 989.06. Investors remained cautious over the continuing deadlock in parliamentary debates, and weak interim company results. Wako Research Institute reported a fall of 39 per cent in the total non-consolidated pre-tax profits at the 407 first-section companies which had announced their results by last Friday, while sales had declined by 3.4 per cent. For the full year to March, 322 companies expect a fall in profits while 267 companies project a decline in sales. On the trading floor, speculative issues dominated activity. The medium-sized SS Pharmaceutical was the most active issue of the day, declining Y30 to Y1,010. It rose initially by its daily limit on early reports of the development of a new Aids drug, but fell later on heavy profit-taking. Green Cross, which followed SS in activity, rose Y10 to Y1,310. Bank shares were lower on worries of short-selling. Rumours that hedge funds may target bank shares, which have remained relatively stable during the recent downturn, discouraged investors. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y100 to Y2,310 and Sakura Bank lost Y20 to Y1,060. Electronics continued to lose ground on prospects of lower profits. Hitachi fell Y6 to a new year's low of Y700, while NEC also saw a new low for the year, declining Y17 to Y610. Steel companies retreated after last Friday's poor results. Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y275. Sega Enterprises, the video maker, was one of the few gainers of the day, rising Y50 to Y9,400. The company retained its popularity thanks to its brisk profit projections. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 121.21 to 17,560.35 in volume of 20.3m shares. Aoyama Trading, a discount retailer of office workers' blue suits, rose Y140 to Y7,450. The company posted firm interim results as consumers opted for cheaper clothing. Roundup THE region's markets mostly followed Tokyo down, although for their own reasons. HONG KONG finished sharply lower as the worsening Sino-British row over the colony's future triggered profit-taking by local investors, but a flurry of late buying allowed it to retrace some early losses. The Hang Seng index retreated 71.73 or 1.1 per cent to 6,294.83, above an intraday low of 6,261.99. Turnover fell from HKDollars 3.24bn to HKDollars 2.50bn. Blue chips which gained most in the recent rally were hit hardest by profit-taking, with the most active HSBC Holdings losing 50 cents to HKDollars 65 and its Hang Seng Bank unit dropping Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 56.50. AUSTRALIA fell for a seventh straight day to end at a 21-month low ahead of this week's release of bank results. The All Ordinaries index closed 14.5 down at 1357.2, the lowest finish since February, 1991, in turnover of ADollars 183m. ANZ profits are due today, and Westpac and NAB on Thursday. ANZ closed 7 cents lower at ADollars 2.53, Westpac fell 4 cents to ADollars 2.59 while NAB rose 6 cents to ADollars 6.83. SINGAPORE fell sharply in nervous trading on talk, confirmed after the close, that both of the country's deputy prime ministers were suffering from cancer. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,414.27, down 2.3 per cent or 32.53 in active volume of 130.39m shares. BANGKOK dropped 1.8 per cent after the central bank requested banks, finance and securities firms to cut down their loan credits to stock investors. The SET index lost 15.93 to 893.31 in turnover of Bt5.64bn, the thinnest day's trading in four weeks. SEOUL slid in very thin trading in a technical adjustment after the recent rally. The composite index closed 15.64 lower at 616.64 in turnover of Won370.68bn compared with Won496.35bn. TAIWAN's weighted index, which edged just above 3,600 before profit-taking set in, ended 15.35 higher at 3,588.44 in turnover of TDollars 5.85bn. The financial sector closed 1.4 per cent higher as investors regained some buying interest in the Big Three banks, which rose between TDollars 1 and TDollars 1.50 each. MANILA dipped in light trading as the composite index fell 7.35 to 1,339.57 in combined turnover of Won152.27m. KUALA LUMPUR continued to consolidate after the recent bull run. The composite index fell 4.37 to 646.25 in volume of 170.2m shares against 217.6m. NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a strong performance from Carter Holt Harvey which gained 14 cents to Dollars 2.64 after reporting an interim NZDollars 112.4m profit on Friday. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 8.6 to 1409.50 in turnover of Dollars 17.6m.</p>

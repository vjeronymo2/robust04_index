			<p>BFN     [Text] Jamba Govenor Brigadier Isaias Chitombe gave a long  interview to the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel  [Vorgan] today, speaking of various issues concerning the  country's political and military situation. The most important  topic in his interview were revelations of attempts by the  regime against the rearguard of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA], particularly here in Jamba,  using the Namibian territory as its launching pad.    According to Brig. Chitombe, Namibia and Eduardo dos Santos'  regime are evidently determined to destroy UNITA, particularly  in Jamba. The governor draws a clear picture of the situation  on the field.    [Begin Chitombe recording] At 2245 on 24 March, agents from  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA- PT] were detected near the Vorgan antenna installations.  Surprised by our security forces, they fled in disarray. Our  forces were however able to capture one of the group. We also  captured engineering material that the group carried, as well as  explosives, detonators, wirecutters and so on.    We know that with regard to Jamba, the enemy has a two-phase  program. The first phase would be to mine parts of  Cacuchi-Jamba road because it thinks that that we obtain  supplies through this road. Officially, we do not obtain any  supplies from Namibia because of the economic blockade. The  enemy also wanted to mine parts of (Buabuata)-Jamba road. If  they were able to infiltrate and deploy their forces in Jamba,  they would perhaps mine a number of roads and even destroy  Vorgan antennas, so as to silence the only genuine opposition  voice in Angola. This would be the first phase.    According to our intelligence sources, the second phase  would  be a large-scale phase supported by mercenaries coming from Cabo  Ledo. These mercenaries are presently in Nambia, in the last  phase of preparations. The South-West African People's  Organization [SWAPO] gave the MPLA a piece of land, from the  bridge over Cubango River in (Bagani) to 2 km before (Chetu).  The MPLA has deployed its temporary bases on this piece of  land, from which it would carry out actions in Jamba. On this  same piece of land that SWAPO gave to the MPLA-PT, there is a  base called Omega, with a hospital to give first aid to wounded  troops during the period of action.    What is more, at a given period of operations, these troops  would be supported by an air cover, MI-8 and MI-35 helicopters,  equipped with cannons. These helicopters would also be deployed  on the same base, Omega.    We have also been informed that the MPLA deployed 2,000 riot  policemen in Namibia. One thousand of them have already left  for South Africa to support the African National Congress in the  elections due on 27 April this year. Of the one thousand  policemen who remained in Namibia, 400 are in Rundu. These riot  policemen are led by the following chieftains: Colonel Joaquim  Mbundu, Colonel Alberto Simao, and Lieutenant Colonel Angelo,  who is also in charge of border control and physical elimination  of UNITA cadres and leaders here in our region. Other  chieftains are Captain Alberto Sitani, Capt. Jacinto Manuel, and  Chituwawa Mapa.    We are also aware that some of these chieftains have already  left for (Bucussu) on a reconnaissance mission to watch our  movements. We also know that SWAPO has included MPLA agents in  its border-guard troops, police, secret services, and  communications services, and so on. Thus, when SWAPO carry out  border patrols, it is just doing it to allow the MPLA forces to  reconnoitre our positions along the border.    As in the past, we would like to once again today alert the  national and international communities that in the event of any  attack on Jamba from Namibia, we shall retaliate and pursue the  attackers to where they are based. If this happens, the  provokers and those assisting the provokers will be exclusively  and solely to blame.    We have decided to reveal this information to the national  and international communities to enable them to know exactly who  is not interested in peace. When we are negotiating in Lusaka,  when it is possible to sign a general cease-fire accord, and the  MPLA is using mercenaries to attack the free territory  controlled by UNITA, we call this an act of provocation. It is  not only an act of provocation, the MPLA is sabotaging the  efforts being carried out by the entire peace-loving  international community so that war ends in Angola and the  Angolan people can begin to enjoy peace. [end recording]    Meanwhile, in view of this evidence, a source from the  General Staff of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FALA], gave assurances that all military measures were in place  to repulse any attempt by joint FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for  the Liberation of Angola]-SWAPO forces. The source said the  FALA will not accept any responsibility for the consequences  resulting from the MPLA adventure. If the Namibian regime wants  to maintain good neighborly relations with UNITA, it should then  cease to support the diabolic and treacherous actions by the  Luanda Communist regime, the source said in conclusion.    Here in Jamba, a senior officer of the FALA military command  said today that in view of threats of aggression from the  Republic of Namibia, all FALA units have been placed in a  maximum state of alert. According to the source, in case of  provocation, FALA forces have instructions to react with the  greatest violence possible and pursue the attackers to their  base. The source said UNITA will not accept any responsibility  for the consequences that could result from this adventure. It  said in case of attack, the Namibian Government will be solely  to blame. We want to maintain good neighborly relations with  all neighboring countries, but this is only possible when there  is mutual respect, the FALA officer said. He said the United  Nations must warn Namibia not to internationalize the conflict.</p>

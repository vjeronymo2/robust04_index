			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Water consumer surveys questioned Water companies have been warned not to rely on surveys of the public's willingness to pay for higher water quality. Mr George Gaskell, of the London School of Economics, said surveys of whether households would pay for enhanced quality could be unreliable. A particular target of his criticism, made in an LSE research paper, is a 1992 survey conducted for Ofwat by MORI, the market research company. Mr Gaskell says that the findings - which showed concern about rising water bills as well as about pollution - are not reliable because water is a highly political and subjective issue, where people are not well-informed about the technical details. His criticism comes just days before the water companies of England and Wales submit their strategic business plans to Ofwat, the water industry regulator. The proposed investment plans, which cover the next 20 years, have been based partly on detailed customer surveys conducted last summer. Mr Gaskell, LSE head of social psychology, says: 'Until consumers are more informed it is probably inappropriate to use responses in opinion surveys as the basis for the development of services.' According to water industry estimates investment by the industry in long-overdue modernisation and in meeting new environmental standards could reach Pounds 40bn this decade. Ofwat, which is concerned that water bills will have to keep rising much faster than inflation to pay for this spending, has asked the companies to examine whether some discretionary improvements - such as those to taste, colour and flood defences - are really wanted by customers. Ofwat, whose executives say they are 'braced for pantechnicons on paper' from the companies on Thursday, will tell the companies in May how fast it will allow their prices to rise between 1995 and 2005. Mr Peter Hutton, the MORI director responsible for the 1992 Ofwat study, said MORI had conducted 14 surveys for individual companies since the 1992 survey, and found nothing to contradict its findings.</p>

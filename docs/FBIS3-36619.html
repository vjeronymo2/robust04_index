			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two new Russian Army units have been formed on the  territory of Skrunda radar station. Ilgonis Upmalis, head of  the Latvian bureau for monitoring the Russian Army withdrawal,  told the Baltic News Service that until now there has been only  the radar station itself and an MT [expansion unknown]  battalion, but now an additional hospital and a  counterintelligence unit have been formed as separate military  units.    Although the Russian military personnel who are already  stationed in Latvia serve with the units, Upmalis believes that  the stationing of the units on just the territory of the Skrunda  radar station is wrong, because the issue of the status of that  facility in Latvia has not yet been coordinated at interstate  talks.</p>

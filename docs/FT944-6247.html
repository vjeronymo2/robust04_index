			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Spending rise of 1% welcomed by department - Education The Department for Education hailed the 1 per cent rise in its budget in real terms as proof that the government regarded education as a priority area. However, opposition politicians said the new budget for 1995-96 - of Pounds 10.958bn, up Pounds 427m from its level this year - represented a cut from the original plan to raise it to Pounds 11.059bn. There is also no money specifically for nursery education, in spite of the prime minister's 'copper-bottomed' pledge at the Conservative annual conference to introduce education for all four-year-olds whose parents wanted it. Detailed plans also showed a significant climbdown on its policy towards grant-maintained schools, which opted out of local authority control under legislation introduced in 1988. Previously, only opted-out and church schools could benefit from the scheme started earlier this year to allow schools to specialise in particular subjects, such as languages or technology. Now local authority schools may also benefit. Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, described this as 'another major U-turn towards Labour's proposals'. Part of the budget has been earmarked for specialist schools, and this will expand from Pounds 15m next year to Pounds 25m in the education year beginning September 1997. The budget also showed a sharp shift of funds towards helping adults and the less academically able. Numbers at further education colleges, which cover mostly vocational training as well as some A-levels, are projected to rise by 28 per cent over the five years to the year beginning September 1997. At university level, the department says it is funding an increase in the number of mature students, although the proportion of school-leavers moving on to university will remain unchanged, as expected. This might mean a slight fall in total numbers due to a decline in the number of 18-year-olds. Students' maintenance grants will be cut by 10 per cent, as expected, following a similar cut last year. The amount available to them in state-subsidised loans will be increased so that the total available from loans and grants rises by 2.5 per cent. Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said that schoolteachers would lose jobs because of the squeeze on local authority spending, which is not covered by the education department.</p>

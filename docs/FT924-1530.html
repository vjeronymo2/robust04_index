			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: KIO named as seller of C &amp; C stake to Jardine SINGAPORE banking sources yesterday confirmed that the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) had been the seller of a 16 per cent stake in the local Cycle &amp; Carriage company to Jardine of Hong Kong for SDollars 212.5m (USDollars 129.7m). Earlier this week, Jardine announced it had bought the C &amp; C stake from OCBC Securities, a company owned by the Singapore-based Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp. Singapore-based investment analysts said the Jardine move was both good and bad news for the island republic. The purchase has brought life into what has been an inactive local market. It also signals a further move by Hong Kong's biggest 'Hong' - or trading house - into Sing-apore. In late October, Jardine announced that its retail division, Dairy Farm International, would buy the Singapore retail company Cold Storage Holdings for SDollars 130m. But brokers were concerned about the effects on the local market of continued KIO disposals. 'The KIO has sold a large chunk of its holdings in this part of the world in recent months,' said one broker. 'If it sells everything in a hurry then it could cause some nervousness around the region.' The KIO still retains substantial shareholdings in blue chip stocks in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. It also has extensive property holdings and is involved in the plantations sector. A consortium led by Singapore's Keppel Corp has acquired the Philippines National Oil Dockyard and Engineering Corporation (PDEC) for 680m pesos (Dollars 27.6m), Reuter reports. The offer by Keppel and its three Philippine-based partners was the highest among foreign bids which closed in October. The sale of the 22.9 hectare yard is part of the Philippine government's effort to privatise state-owned companies and revitalise the Philippines economy.</p>

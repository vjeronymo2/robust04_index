			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: SA set to soften tariff blow - Bid to balance pain and gain of Uruguay Round deal A new South African government is likely to be in the enviable position of possessing a comprehensive, negotiated and revamped trade policy within weeks of taking office after the country's first non-racial elections in April. Credit has to go to the foreign trade policy task force of the National Economic Forum, the tripartite representation of government, business and labour, which drew up South Africa's successful offer to the Uruguay Round in less than six months last year. Mr Michael McDonald, the chief business representative on the task force, says the NEF should be able to present a broad trade policy document to the government in June. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, singled out the achievement of a unified offer for special praise during a visit to South Africa last week, clearly impressed at the workings of the 'golden triangle' of government, business and the trade unions. His message for his hosts was largely that of 'no pain, no gain'. South Africa, with a number of highly protected industries and one of the world's most cumbersome tariff structures, would find it tough to meet the requirements of the Uruguay Round, but the country was well placed to take advantage of new opportunities because of flourishing sectors such as agriculture which had barely started to tap their export potential. Mr Sutherland's outlook is borne out by research by the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation. Although it showed that the Round would lead to growth domestic product growth, with exports outpacing increases in imports, sectors like textiles and car-making, currently enjoying 100 per cent protection, would suffer a 4-5 per cent decline in employment as tariffs were reduced to 45-50 per cent. The implications of the Uruguay Round for jobs have become the prime concern of the NEF given that a new government will be expected to tackle unemployment, estimated unofficially at 40 per cent. The clothing and textiles industries remain large employers with a combined workforce of about 190,000, despite thousands of job losses in recent years, on which some communities are entirely dependent for their livelihood. The NEF is sanguine about what needs to be done. Further job losses are inevitable, but the NEF is devising short-to-medium term subsidies to cushion the blow while an industry task force is finalising recommendations on restructuring the sector. Mr McDonald says it would be wrong to over-emphasise the suffering which adherence to Gatt rules will cause the economy. Industry faces only a gradual introduction of new tariffs over as long as 12 years after their formal implementation from next January. Negotiations are under way which may give South Africa access to the US's general system of preferences while an EU team is in the country to discuss preferential tariffs.</p>

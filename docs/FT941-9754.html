			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Savers to suffer from rate cuts - Societies keen to retain margins Savers rather than mortgage-holders are more likely to feel the effects of Tuesday's base rate cut. Institutions usually pass on a full rate reduction to their savers but give mortgage-holders a smaller one. And while savings rates are usually cut immediately, mortgage rate reductions are often not implemented for existing borrowers until the next month. Building societies appear reluctant to narrow their margins by maintaining savings rates while passing on a cut to borrowers. They were only too happy this week to take their cue from Halifax, the largest lender, which dismissed the base rate reduction as 'a technical adjustment' too small 'to cause us to re-think our mortgage or savings rates.' Halifax's standard variable mortgage rate remains at 7.64 per cent and that of Nationwide, the second largest society, at 7.74. Meanwhile, three banks announced mortgage rate reductions, but at least 17 cut their savings rates. These included Barclays, Bank of Scotland, Co-Operative bank, National Westminster and Yorkshire Bank. According to Vicki Burn, of Moneyfacts, Yorkshire bank dropped savings rates mostly by the full quarter point while Bank of Scotland reduced them by between 0.25-0.35 of a percentage point. Barclays made the reductions on its one-month and 90-day notice accounts (Capital Advantage and Select) while National Westminster cut more broadly, with rates on the Reserve accounts all down and that on its tax-exempt special savings account (Tessa) now down to 5.35 per cent gross instead of 5.61. Other banks to have made reductions on some or all their savings accounts include AIB, Aitken Hume, Bank of Ireland (GB), Caledonian, Cater Allen, Charterhouse, Julian Hodge, Leopold Joseph, Northern, Tyndall and Ulster. The mortgage rate reductions have come from Citibank, a centralised lender, TSB, and Kleinwort Benson's private banking arm. Centralised lenders are well-placed theoretically to implement cuts when base rates come down because the cost of their borrowing is reduced. They do not share the same mortgage-funding constraints as societies because they can obtain funds from the money markets. Citibank has reduced its standard variable mortgage rate to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 for new customers and from the beginning of April for existing borrowers. TSB, which has been attempting to increase its share of the mortgage market, has cut its variable rate by 0.19 of a point to 7.45 per cent. New borrowers have to wait until March 9 to get the benefit. The bank says it has not yet made a decision on whether to cut interest rates for savers. Kleinwort Benson's private bank has one of the lowest variable rate mortgages on the market, and this will be cut to 7.25 per cent from 7.49 from March 1 for both new and existing borrowers. The mortgage is packaged into a Budget Account for long-term borrowing, which allows a draw-down facility charged at the variable rate. There is also a Flexible Account package with a chequebook for immediate access to funds for short-term borrowing. Interest on the amount borrowed is charged at 1 percentage point above the standard variable rate. Some banks and societies argue that they do not need to react to such a small base rate cut because there is a wide variety of mortgage discounts and fixed rates, which are below the standard variable rate and are proving popular with home buyers. Mortgage broker John Charcol this week launched a variable rate mortgage of 2.75 per cent (7.7 APR), with funds provided by Britannia building society. The rate represents a discount of 5 percentage points off the society's variable rate and lasts until January 1 1995. Borrowers can opt for a fixed rate in the second year or an 0.5 point reduction in the society's variable rate. Completion fee is Pounds 195 and the mortgage does not depend on compulsory insurance-related products. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society has abolished its application and valuation fees for new borrowers or those taking out a further advance with the society. This represents a saving of Pounds 135 to Pounds 450. The society also operates a 3 point reduction in its variable rate, now 7.64 per cent, for the first year of a new mortgage for borrowers with a minimum deposit of 20 per cent. The John Lewis Partnership is to cut the cost of its store cards from March 1. The annualised percentage rate on purchases will fall to 18 per cent instead of 19.5. The last change was on October 1 1992 - and there have been four base rate cuts, excluding this week's, since then.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Higher revenues boost margins at The Telegraph HIGHER REVENUES boosted operating margins at The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group has a 68 per cent stake, in the half-year to June 30. That led to a 30 per cent increase in operating profits, from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 21.3m, and lifted pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 21.6m. The group was floated on the stock market early this month at a price of 325p, but the shares fell sharply when dealings began. Yesterday they rose 16 1/2 p to 292 1/2 p. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said that the low cost base meant a rise in revenues had an even greater effect on profits. Operating margins rose from 14.9 per cent to 17.8 per cent. Sales rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 119.9m, with revenue from circulation, including a cover price rise in February, and advertising contributing roughly equally to the gain. Mr Cooke said display advertising had been dull in March and April, but began to recover in May and was good in June. The pre-tax result, which included first quarter profits of Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 7.9m), was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 2.2m relating to the flotation (Pounds 1.5m) and net interest income of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 4m). The prospectus had warned that the second quarter would bear, for the first time, the Pounds 1m a quarter cost of moving to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. It said interest income would be Pounds 600,000 lower in the quarter, and Pounds 1m lower in future quarters, because of the Pounds 20.2m purchase of a stake in Trinity International and the Pounds 13.4m cost of a special pre-flotation dividend. Associate profits rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 1.8m, largely reflecting the 15 per cent stake in John Fairfax, the Australian media group. This is regarded as an associate, although The Telegraph does not have any contractual right to board representation. The tax charge rose from 20.4 per cent to 31 per cent, as accumulated tax losses dating back to the mid-1980s had now been used up. As a result, earnings per share fell slightly to 11.1p (11.4p). The interim dividend is the promised 4.5p. COMMENT The Telegraph's rather meagre statement yesterday shows it has not quite got the hang of being a public company yet, and the doubts about having a majority shareholder remain. That said, the company redeemed itself with slightly better than expected results. The jump in operating margins came as something of a surprise even though the prospectus published a month earlier hinted at the high operational gearing of the group. It is a reminder of the money that can be made in a relatively mature market when things start moving the right way. The February price increase has not hit copy sales, and arguably readers are getting a better product as new sections are introduced. Forecasts have gone up to Pounds 44m (Pounds 40.5m) or more and the prospective p/e of about 13.3 is now reasonable. The shares may find it difficult to rise above the 325p issue price for some time, though.</p>

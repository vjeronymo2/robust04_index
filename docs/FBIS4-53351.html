			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party appointed Rep. Pak Pom-chin as its new spokesman  on Saturday.    The party accepted resignations handed in by Spokesman Ha  Sun-pong and three deputy spokesmen -- Cho Yong-chik, O  Chang-sop and Son Hak-kyu earlier in the day.    New deputy spokesmen are expected to be named on Monday.    Explaining the background of the change, DLP  Secretary-General Mun Chong-su said, "Spokesman Ha expressed his  intention to resign and the party accepted the resignations of  Ha and the three deputy spokesmen to change the atmosphere in  the spokesman's office."    Ha reportedly resigned assuming responsibility for the  tension between the DLP and the Democratic Party created by his  recent remarks that retired opposition leader Kim Tae-chung had  covertly encouraged the opposition Democratic Party to adopt a  hard-line stance toward the ruling party.    New DLP Spokesman Pak, 54, was born in Chechon-kun, North  Chungchong Province, and graduated from the political science  department at Seoul National University. He worked at the  CHOSON ILBO and served as editorial writer for the SEOUL SINMUN.</p>

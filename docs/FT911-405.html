			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: CPU Computers in second-half loss A setback for CPU Computers in its second half means it will only be close to break-even for the whole of 1990. The result for the half is well below expectation, the directors said, particularly after a first-half profit of Pounds 484,000. For the year 1989 the figure was Pounds 534,000. They explain there were operating losses in the second half, essentially from the Austrian subsidiary where trading difficulties were experienced. But the group's principal shareholder, Scoa SA, has provided a cash injection and enabled CPU to recapitalise the troubled subsidiary by Pounds 700,000.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Asprey's jewel of the north Britain may be in the grips of its worst recession since the 1930s but the House of Asprey, owners of the world's most expensive gift-shop, seems to be on a Ratners-style expansion binge. First it gobbled up crown jeweller Garrard, and Paris's exclusive Rene Boivin not to mention Mappin &amp; Webb. Now it has pocketed Hamilton &amp; Inches, Edinburgh's royal silversmiths and official repairers of the Calcutta Cup. When Asprey began buying up the opposition just under two years ago its market capitalisation was less than half the size of Gerald Ratner's family firm. Capitalised at over Pounds 200m, the 211-year-old Asprey is now five times as big as poor old Gerald's outfit, and its appetite is not yet sated. 'We are in our prime; I am very bullish,' says Naim Attallah, the well-known publisher who doubles up as Asprey's joint managing director. Like all good jewellers he refuses to disclose how much he has paid for his ' pearl of the North'. The target was under-capitalised and feeling the recession, and Asprey could hardly turn down the chance of picking up Scotland's crown jewellers. However, Attallah insists that his firm is not over-expanding like Ratners. For a start he has no debt and close to Pounds 20m of cash in the bank. With Sears maintaining a protective stake Asprey seems safe enough for the moment.</p>

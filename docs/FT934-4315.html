			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / 'Floaters' carried messages of peace An intermediary who passed messages between the IRA and the UK government talked to Jimmy Burns yesterday. Channels of communication between Sinn Fein and the government have involved a range of so-called 'floaters' - intermediaries drawn from the church, local government, community politics and serving and retired civil servants. The government has said that serious contact got under way only in February after the IRA sent a message: 'The conflict is over but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.' However, one of the floaters said that by then both sides had acknowledged that 'no side could win (the war)'. In private contacts it had been understood that if an agreement was announced it would have to be phrased so as not to suggest that either side was victor or loser. 'This explains the pique of Sinn Fein over the last few days,' said the floater. 'What they were trying to do was to get off the hook with dignity, but Sir Patrick Mayhew . . . put them in a very difficult situation with . . . supporters.' The floater said there had been more communication in the last two years than before, and it had become particularly intense by the start of this year. At an early stage of the talks Sinn Fein officials were uncertain whether the people who put themselves forward as 'government representatives' were really reflecting government policy. Some of the mediators involved in the early stages of the Hume-Adams talks are believed to have been priests from the Clonard monastery in west Belfast.</p>

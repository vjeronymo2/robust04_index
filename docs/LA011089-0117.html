			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENERAL AUTOMATION WILL GET BOOST FROM SANDERSON ELECTRONICS  </P> <P> General Automation, a struggling Anaheim computer maker, said Monday that it  has reached a definitive agreement with Sanderson Electronics PLC in England to  obtain a financial infusion of up to $4.1 million  </P> <P> As part of the deal, General Automation has restructured its top management and  plans to lay off about 65 of its approximately 390 employees. About a dozen  employees based in Orange County will be included in the work force reduction.  </P> <P> On Friday, Sanderson gave General Automation the first $500,000 of a  $1.75-million loan and will provide the rest by Jan. 23, a spokesman said. The  loan funds will be used to shore up General Automation's computer manufacturing  operation.  </P> <P> General Automation has been losing money for more than a year. It posted an  $11-million loss for the fiscal year ended June 30.  </P> <P> But the company's new chief executive was upbeat, attributing losses to past  problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fresh Blood  </P> <P> "This is exactly what the company needed -- a shot of fresh blood," said  Leonard Mackenzie, General Automation's vice chairman and newly installed chief  executive. "This is a very good deal for our customers, our employees, our  shareholders -- everybody."  </P> <P> The losses have not eroded customer service, he said, and the firm expects  sales to rise. The company also has reduced its worldwide operating expenses by  $2 million a year as part of a cost-cutting plan, Mackenzie said. In addition,  the company is negotiating to sell non-essential operations, which were not  specified.  </P> <P> The company's stock, he said, will continue to be traded on the American Stock  Exchange, where it closed Monday at 50 cents a share, down 6.25 cents.  </P> <P> A tentative deal with Sanderson was hammered out 2 weeks ago, capping a series  of merger discussions with several potential suitors. An unspecified number of  interested companies never got beyond the initial talking stages, said Joseph  Allen, a company spokesman.  </P> <P> In order to accept Sanderson's offer, General Automation had to spurn a merger  bid by Alpha Microsystems in Santa Ana. Earlier in the fall, General Automation  executives were talking with WesPac Technologies in Irvine about a possible  merger.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compatible Businesses  </P> <P> Mackenzie said company executives liked the fact that Sanderson's business is  compatible with General Automation's. Like the Anaheim firm, the British firm  specializes in the Pick operating system, a software program that controls a  computer's basic functions.  </P> <P> Sanderson is less than a third the size of General Automation. In U.S. dollars,  it earned $1.3 million on sales of $15 million last year, Mackenzie said.  General Automation's revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 was $50.9  million.  </P> <P> Besides the dozen layoffs expected in Orange County, the firm will cut about 40  employees from its operations in England, where General Automation is  consolidating two plants into a Birmingham facility it acquired last year when  it bought Aston Technology Ltd.  </P> <P> The rest of the layoffs will come from operations elsewhere in the United  States, primarily Dallas and New Jersey, Allen said. The layoffs are in  addition to about 50 positions trimmed through attrition since June, the  company said.  </P> <P> Under the deal, Sanderson will be able to convert its $1.75-million loan into  2.5 million shares of newly issued common stock in General Automation. In  addition, Sanderson will receive about 200,000 shares in lieu of loan fees.  </P> <P> The British firm also will get warrants that will allow it to purchase up to  2.9 million additional shares of newly issued General Automation stock at 70  cents a share by midsummer. If the warrants are exercised, the proceeds will be  used for working capital, Allen said.  </P> <P> If Sanderson converts the loan and exercises its warrants, it will wind up with  5.6 million General Automation shares, or a controlling interest of 51%. Even  so, Mackenzie said General Automation expects to remain autonomous.  </P> <P> "Sanderson is looking at this as an investment," Mackenzie said. "The company  will still operate as General Automation."  </P> <P> Sanderson, however, has appointed three of its executives to General  Automation's six-member board.  </P> <P> One of them, Paul Thompson, 36, is the Anaheim company's new chairman. He  replaces Alexander W. Giles Jr., who was named chairman in a restructuring in  August. Giles will remain on the board as one of three board members from  General Automation.  </P> <P> Mackenzie, who had been chairman for 8 years until the August restructuring,  became chief executive, replacing W. Norris Agee, who resigned as president,  chief executive and director after 5 months on the job. Mackenzie has  previously held the posts of president and chief executive.  </P> <P> Two other directors, lawyers William Lucas and John C. Conlan, also resigned to  make room for Sanderson directors.  </P> <P> General Automation also named Douglas C. Tullio as president of its North  American operations. Together with presidents of Pacific Rim and European  operations, he will report to Mackenzie. The office of president is being  eliminated, Mackenzie said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GENERAL AUTOMATION AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Headquarters: Anaheim  </P> <P> Number of Employees: 400  </P> <P> Products: Computer systems and products  </P> <P> Earnings (loss): ($11 million)*  </P> <P> Sales: $50.9 million*  </P> <P> 52-week stock price range: $2.375/$0.3125  </P> <P> Monday's closing stock price: $0.50  </P> <P> Shares outstanding: 5,637,388 (March 31)  </P> <P> Market value of common stock: $2.8 million  </P> <P> * Year ended June 30  </P></p>

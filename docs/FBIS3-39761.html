			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer  for the Cyprus issue, arrived in Cyprus this afternoon to be  briefed on the proximity talks. He will be received by  President Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow and he will hold  consultations this evening with UN's Gustave Feissel. Mr. Abou  said upon his arrival that he will also hold meetings with the  ambassadors of the 12 EU member countries as stipulated by the  regulation. He also noted that there is no time schedule  according to which he has to submit his report to the EU, but  when Cyprus' application for accession is discussed in 1995, he  will have to give all the details.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described the  observer's arrival as practical proof he is following  developments in the Cyprus issue. The EU observer had also  requested to have a meeting with Rauf Denktas but the latter  left for Turkey at noon today. Both Ankara and Denktas refuse to  meet with the EU observers because they object to his  appointment.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: European research centre for Rank Xerox RANK XEROX, the office equipment group, is to set up a European research centre in the French Alpine town of Grenoble. The centre will open in April with an annual budget of Ecu15m (Dollars 18.45m), to carry out research into electronic handling of documents in different languages, including computer-assisted translation. It will have control over Rank Xerox's research centres in Cambridge and employ 50 people, rising to 150 by 1996. This is the latest in a string of international research bodies to set up in Grenoble, France's biggest research centre outside Paris. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, said Grenoble was beginning to benefit from a 'snowball effect' of investment in high technology and his government was eager to attract research projects. Grenoble groups 250 private and public sector laboratories and five European research facilities, a big factor in Rank Xerox's choice of the site against alternatives in Italy, Spain, Germany and elsewhere in France, said Mr Bernard Fournier, managing director of Rank Xerox. Various forms of French public aid cover 10 per cent of the first two years' costs, about the same as was on offer from rival sites. The aim is to develop products that will reduce the 8 per cent of spending which the average company spends on compiling and handling documents, said Mr Fournier. Eastman Kodak, Sony and Hitachi have agreed on a standard for a video print pack for thermal dye transfer printers to be used in the home, Reuter reports. The printers can produce colour prints from video and digital sources, such as video cameras and electronic still cameras. The companies said current thermal dye transfer printers are used mainly for business and commerce, and print paper and cartridges differ with each manufacturer.</p>

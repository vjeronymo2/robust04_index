			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Lamont denies shift in policy MR Norman Lamont last night gave the following interview to BBC television news: Interviewer: It was said again and again that the pound would not be devalued and the government would take whatever measures are necessary to prevent that. Those statements turned out not to be true. How can anybody rely on your word? Mr Lamont: 'I have not sought a devaluation, nor I think did the Italian prime minister, nor the Spanish finance minister, all of whom found themselves overwhelmed by the extraordinary events of the last couple of weeks, the like of which we haven't seen for 20 or 30 years. 'It has been a very exceptional set of circumstances. The French referendum has created extraordinary strains within the exchange rate mechanism and this has posed enormous problems, not just for us, but for many other countries. 'I don't suppose the Swedish finance minister found it very easy putting up interest rates to some 500 per cent over-night. 'That is the sort of extraordinary circumstance that we have been living through. What I did was simple common sense. The decision I made was an unavoidable one.' That justified you in being unable to live up to your word? 'I believe the decision that I made was the correct one, since I have not sought a devaluation, I did not seek to leave the exchange rate mechanism, but we were overwhelmed by these wholly exceptional circumstances.' How was it that the centrepiece as you described it of the government's whole economic strategy for the next many years could be destroyed in one day? 'Well, what we have done is to suspend our membership and I have made it clear that we intend to resume our membership when circumstances allow. But our policy is a continuous one. 'Our policy is to get inflation down and there will be no let-up in that at all. We have been dramatically successful in getting inflation down from nearly 11 per cent to under 4 per cent in less than two years. It's been a long, hard slog and I can assure you, having worked so hard to get this country to be a country of low inflation, I am not going to chuck it away just in a few weeks' time. I refuse to do that.' But, chancellor, again, how did it happen that the centrepiece of membership of the ERM was destroyed in one day? 'What happened was that we faced an extraordinary set of circumstances - a huge speculative flow that was shifting because of the uncertainties caused by the French referendum. Those were circumstances the like of which we haven't seen for decades.' And which you did not foresee? 'I did not foresee that we would be forced to take the decision that we had to take.'</p>

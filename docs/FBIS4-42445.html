			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arturo Zampaglione: "Clinton Stages Comeback in </F> Europe -- U.S. President Lands in Europe Thinking About Home"]    [Text] New York -- Having reviewed the history books and  listened to advice on how to formally address the pope, the  [British] queen, and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, and having  even learned a couple of words in Italian, Bill Clinton will be  landing at Ciampino airport, near Rome, at midnight, in the  first stage of a European "grand tour" which abounds in  symbolism and expectations.    In the next eight days, he will have his first encounter  with  Italy's Second Republic and its protagonists, he will shuttle  from England to France, and will take part in D-Day  commemorations on the anniversary of the Allied landings in  Normandy. His aims? He has a professed one, and a covert one.  The first is to reaffirm U.S. attachment to Europe and American  interests in promoting East-West integration on the continent so  as to gradually absorb postcommunist Russia. However, Clinton's  secret dream is that his official trip may signal a reversal in  the trend of his political fortunes at home.    Whether right or wrong, the White House feels persecuted by  a  series of political mishaps which have beset it over the past  five months. The red-light scandals denounced by Paula Jones,  the Whitewater inquiry, the drop from 48 to 42 percent in  popularity polls, the setback to health system reform as a  result of the forthcoming resignation of Dan Rostenkowski, who  was one of Clinton's key allies in Congress, the blunders in  Bosnia, Haiti, and China -- all this has considerably weakened  Clinton, who is now hoping that his own D-Day -- the beginning  of reconquest -- will start in Europe.    Will he succeed? Of course, the trip is organized in such  away as to highlight his "presidential" role -- and his image as  leader of the sole superpower -- as much as possible,  particularly in TV coverage. Starting tomorrow, we will be  seeing him in the Quirinale [president's palace] and the  Vatican's halls. Against the background of Campidoglio Square  he will speak to Rome's inhabitants about the liberation of  their city. On Friday [3 June], he will pray at the Neptune  Cemetery, where almost 8,000 American soldiers are buried and,  on Saturday, he will pray at the cemetery in Cambridge. He will  dine in full dress with the other 14 heads of state from  countries that took part in D-Day. He will sail in yacht  Britannia together with Queen Elizabeth. He will listen to  early morning mass on the shores of Normandy. He will speak in  the French Parliament, and will receive an honorary degree in  Oxford.    However, all these political show business events, useful as  they may be in terms of impressing American audiences, will be  accompanied by polemics old and new. Clinton is very much aware  that, in the places where the rangers landed 50 years ago or  where General Clark drove in his jeep, there are three political  mines ready to go off and transform the trip into a fiasco.  They are called: neofascism, abortion, and foreign policy.  Journalists accompanying the presidential airplane will miss no  opportunity to ask embarrassing questions, and Clinton may have  to pay a high price for any thoughtless replies or blunders.  "The President's mission is not an easy one," Republican Senate  floor leader Bob Dole, who is one of Clinton's most  uncompromising opponents, remarked in an interview with LA  REPUBBLICA.    The neofascism knot will inevitably come up at the American  President's press conference following tomorrow afternoon's  meeting at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. However,  Clinton's discussion with Berlusconi will be focusing on much  different matters, such as preparations for the G-7 summit in  Naples, Russia's integration into Europe, the former Yugoslavia,  the Middle East, and Italy's plans to reform the UN Security  Council. Clearly, the occasion represents the United States'  first act of "approval" of the center-right government. On the  one hand, Clinton will utter words of encouragement to  Berlusconi, but, on the other, he will have to justify his  support for a government that includes National Alliance among  its members. He will presumably repeat the same arguments that  he put forward in an interview granted to two Italian TV  networks: "People should be judged according to what they do,  not according to labels. Let them govern and let us see what  they are capable of." Again tomorrow, in the Vatican, Clinton  will try to avoid stepping on the second mine, namely the  abortion issue. In fact, Pope John Paul II has severely  criticized White House policy -- both at the national and  international level -- regarding termination of pregnancies.    The third mine consists of foreign policy -- the Democratic  administration's veritable Achilles' heel. Inevitably, all its  weaknesses will be revealed during Clinton's tour. Only  yesterday, in an article published in NEWSWEEK, Henry Kissinger,  the guru of American foreign policy, charged the President with  not having so far fulfilled the "global leadership vacuum which,  should it persist, would condemn the United States to  progressive international irrelevance." According to the former  secretary of state, what is lacking is "a conceptual framework  to manage the difficulties of the post-Cold War order."    In his talks with Berlusconi, John Major, and Mitterrand,  Clinton will confirm Europe's importance to the United States;  he will speak of the extraordinary opportunity opening up in the  coming years for "the integration of a greater Europe, from  Portugal to Russia," to which Washington intends to make its own  contribution; he will stress the "partnership for peace" concept  and the need for greater cooperation between Moscow and the  European Union. However, as Kissinger noted, this is still a  lopsided, rather incoherent European picture, which is not  linked to a strategic view of American interests. As a result,  a crisis such as the one in Bosnia, rather than being a bench  test of the new European-American cooperation, has become an  excellent example of very bad diplomacy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Zhirnikhin] </F>   [Text] Budapest, 18 Feb -- Since the replacement of  totalitarian regimes, and Hungary and Russia embarking on the  democratic path of development, the relations between the two  countries have entered a qualitatively new stage. Hungarian  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky stated this today to the  ITAR-TASS correspondent on the occasion of the upcoming official  visit to Budapest by Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev.    Naturally, many spoke of equality in the Hungarian-Soviet  friendship during the "Communist period" though in reality  Hungary was in a clearly subordinate position, the minister  said. The USSR constantly interfered in the internal affairs of  our country. Nevertheless, the Hungarian people never identified  the Soviet policies that in many cases violated the national  interests of Hungary, with the stance of the Russian people.  Many in our country understood and continue to understand that  it was the peoples of Russia who were, in the first place, the  victims of Stalinism and the communist model, G. Jeszenszky  pointed out.    In this connection, he said, suffice it to recall the events  of 1956 in Hungary, when most of the Soviet soldiers and  officers in the country understood the true nature of the  popular uprising. This is why, at the decisive phase of  suppressing the revolution, they were replaced by a "fresh"  contingent of troops from another part of the USSR. Some  soldiers and officers took the side of the uprising against the  Communist dictatorship of the Hungarian people. One can only  speculate how many were subsequently executed for failure to  obey orders.    G. Jeszenszky expressed hope that the new Russian Federal  Assembly, unlike its predecessor, would ratify the treaty  between the two countries with the paragraph condemning the  Soviet intervention in the 1956 events in Hungary.    The minister thought it necessary to recall that beginning  with August 1991 in the Soviet Union, the Republic of Hungary  has consistently been one of the first to voice support for the  democratic forces in Russia and their leader, Boris Yeltsin. In  recent years, he stressed, our states have established good and  constructive political relations that are free of any  ideological element. President Yeltsin's official visit to  Hungary was a timely high point to these relations, and the  documents signed in Budapest provided a boost to development of  bilateral economic ties.    The question of the ex-USSR's debt of $2 billion to Hungary  was also resolved. Under an agreement reached, Russia inherited  the debt and has already delivered various military hardware to  half that sum. Intensive negotiations are now underway  regarding the remainder.    The upcoming talks with A. Kozyrev will focus on Hungary's  relations with NATO and East European countries' involvement in  the Partnership for Peace program, G. Jeszenszky said. He said  he was firmly convinced that a close relationship between East  and Central European countries and NATO, and their subsequent  joining of that military-political bloc, would in no way run  counter to Russia's national interests. Hungary realizes, he  said, that a certain part of the Russian public has  preconceptions about NATO. The old stereotype has been too hard  to kill off and many people in the Russian Federation still see  the alliance above all as an enemy. But it is obvious to all who  are familiar with the history of the North Atlantic alliance  that it has always had a purely defensive nature and has never  threatened anybody, Russia included. The minister thought that  Russia should be interested in calm and stability in the region  that abuts its western borders. In turn, NATO's very existence  has a beneficial influence on political stability in central  Europe, and this is precisely why Moscow should not be anxious  about NATO expanding in the region at Russia's expense.    The "South Slav crisis" will occupy an important place in  the  upcoming Russian-Hungarian talks. In this connection, the  minister pointed out that at all international bodies Hungary  has always advocated an active role for Russia in resolving the  Balkans conflict. The events of the past few days provide solid  grounds for hope that the Russian leadership's constructive  initiative to solve the Bosnian crisis will be successful, and  that NATO air strikes will not be required. This became  possible primarily because of Russia's even-handed policy, which  took into account the problems and concerns of the Bosnian  Serbs, and also of the Croats and Moslems living there.    G. Jeszenszky said in conclusion that in any event Hungary  will not play any role in NATO military action in Bosnia if it  goes ahead. The main reason for this, the minister said, is  that a significant Hungarian minority lives in Vojvodina  (Serbia). Concern for the interests of ethnic Hungarians and  the fact that the Hungarian and Serbian peoples are neighbors  means that we must stand aside from "any use of force in  Bosnia," the foreign affairs minister said.</p>

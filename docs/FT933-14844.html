			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Optimist's upward curve: Daniel Tully, chairman of Merrill Lynch, talks to Patrick Harverson A golf club rests against a table, pictures of his family adorn the walls, but no stock market computer screens clutter the desk of the chairman of America's most powerful financial company. Mr Daniel Tully, who a week ago took over the helm of Merrill Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, does not fit the popular image of Wall Street's elite. Instead of the intense, blue-blooded financier that people might expect to run one of the nation's largest investment banks and securities houses, Mr Tully is a big, cheerfully confident Irish New Yorker, the son of a dockside steam-fitter from the borough of Queens. He believes his Irish heritage has helped him to manage a big company with a large number of staff. 'The Irish have a certain empathy, compassion and a willingness to put themselves in the other person's shoes.' He admits that, when he started in the securities business in 1955, he knew nothing about stockbroking. Neither, it seems, did his mother. Laughing at the memory, he says: 'When I got the job that day, and went home and told my mother that I had a job with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane, she said: 'That's great son. I always knew you would do well in the advertising business.' ' While he might not have done well in advertising, the 61-year-old Mr Tully has thrived in stockbroking. After joining Merrill's accounting department, he worked up through the firm's broking workforce, moving to the New York head office in 1976. Six years later, Mr Tully was made head of the firm's private client business, and in 1985 he was appointed president and chief operating officer. From 1985, he ran Merrill with his long-time friend and partner, Mr William Schreyer, who was chairman until his retirement two weeks ago. During Mr Tully and Mr Schreyer's tenure, Merrill has grown from one of several dominant firms on Wall Street, to the dominant force. Today, the firm is pre-eminent in almost every area of the US capital markets - its brokers earn more commissions than any other firm, its investment bankers underwrite the most corporate stock and bond issues, and its investment managers handle more client assets than any financial institution except Fidelity, the mutual funds group. Despite the firm's growth, Mr Tully's stint at the top has not been problem-free. In the latter part of the 1980s, Merrill's rapid expansion left it with an average return on equity of only 10.8 per cent, well below the industry average of 15 per cent and in 1989 it made a loss of Dollars 213m (Pounds 142m). At the time, Mr Tully and Mr Schreyer were criticised for allowing Merrill to get badly out of shape. Critics and analysts argued that the duo were great salesmen, but lacked the modern management skills to guide a giant securities house into the 1990s. The two responded with a three-year cost-cutting programme, which shrank Merrill's workforce from 50,000 to just over 40,000. Mr Tully patrolled the firm's offices, slapping small red dots on equipment and furniture that he believed was surplus to Merrill's needs. Today, the red dots have gone but, says Mr Tully, the attention to cost control has not. Merrill employs what its chairman calls the 'burden of proof' policy, which regularly asks every unit to justify why it should remain part of Merrill Lynch. Mr Tully says: 'The burden of proof is on that organisation to come back to us and sell management on why they are critical and integral to our long-term strategy and success.' If the management is not convinced, out comes the axe. While retreating from some businesses, Merrill has been expanding in others  -most notably asset management. In common with other big Wall Street firms, Merrill wants to build up its fee-based revenues as an insurance against the volatility of its more cyclical businesses such as trading, broking and underwriting. Today, Merrill's recurring revenues cover half of its fixed costs. Mr Tully wants all of the fixed costs covered by the end of the decade. If that target is reached, Merrill's earnings from broking commissions, trading and investment banking would be pure profit. Back in 1955, when Mr Tully joined Merrill, broking commissions represented virtually all of the firm's earnings. Twenty years later, however, the industry abandoned fixed broking commissions and Merrill, like many Wall Street firms, decided to offer a broader range of services to clients and lock them into long-term relationships. Consequently, the Merrill of the 1990s is much more than a broker. It is a large financial services supermarket. It offers individual and corporate clients everything from banking-type products such as cash accounts, cheque books and mortgages, to services such as insurance, business loans, stockbroking, investment management and high-tech corporate finance. Mr Tully thinks that the firm should follow the clients' needs, rather than the other way round. 'The logic is, if you focus on your clients, then you change along with them as they go through their life. It's a recognition that the only constant is change.' This attention to the client, he believes, has turned Merrill into the country's biggest securities house. In spite of the firm's size and the complexity of its business, Mr Tully has always adopted a style of management that is straightforward, upbeat and reminiscent of another Irish American, former President Ronald Reagan. Mr Tully says: 'I think you could liken my style, absolutely, to a Ronald Reagan; that is, someone who has vision, principles and who will not get mired down in the details. That does not mean you don't have a great knowledge and understanding of the business, but it's built on mutual respect and trust and the dignity of fellow-individuals. You've got to believe that from the bottom of your mind and heart. I believe it. I trust people.' He trusts his senior managers to get on with managing the firm while he travels, meeting clients and employees. Slipping into one of his many anecdotes, he says: 'At a recent conference someone said to me: 'Mr Tully, how can you manage forty-some thousand people, and Dollars 120bn of balance sheet?' I said: 'I don't. It's 11.15am and I haven't spoken to my office yet.' I said: 'Someone is managing 40,000 people, and a lot of people are managing the balance sheet.' Part of my executive responsibility is to set priorities, allocate resources and set the tone and principles which will guide us through the good times and the bad.' He comes down hard, however, on employees that abuse his trust. 'If you go outside the parameters,' he says, making a slicing motion across his knees with his hand, 'I'm not very tolerant.' Otherwise, he seems a tolerant man and, despite his avowed fondness for former President Reagan, broadly supportive of the current Democrat president. 'I applaud President Clinton's deficit-reduction goal, but would prefer it if he accomplished more through spending cuts rather than tax increases.' In particular, he is disappointed that there is little in Mr Clinton's economic policy that encourages savings and investment. Mr Tully is extremely positive about the US, despite the country's economic and social problems. Asked if the American dream has fizzled, he answers vehemently: 'Hell no. I don't think the future has ever been brighter. You look at all the trends in the United States, and you might see a little ripple, but the long-term trends are extremely positive. Every chart I look at starts in the lower left-hand corner and goes to the higher right-hand corner.' Sitting in his spacious office, with its view of the river, and those twin symbols of hope - Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty - Mr Tully is the embodiment of the American optimist. There is nothing wrong, he says, with being an optimist. After all: 'I've never met a rich pessimist.'

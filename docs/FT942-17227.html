			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Slaves to outmoded fashions Sir, Trevor Harvey (Letters, March 30) is right to point out the dangers of current practice in building society governance. Too many societies have embarked on policies which do little for their members but much to demonstrate the incompetence of their management. Slavish adherence to such already outmoded management fashions as delayering has resulted not only in the appalling standards of service evident in so many branches of the larger societies but - worse - in a lack of middle management capable of reacting on the ground to the opportunities that the fast-changing housing market will present during 1994. This which will mean that many societies lose market share as they fail to take advantage of the improving mortgage market. All this has come about because societies have pursued the cult of personality to a point where their charismatic but inept chief executives are able to force muddle-headed policies through weak boards which are, as Mr Harvey points out, effectively accountable to no one. There will be tears in the building society world ere long, and those who have allowed the societies to become unaccountable will largely be responsible.

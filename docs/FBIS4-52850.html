			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Monday [16 May] made a renewed pledge to seek permanent  membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], saying Japan  should gain a permanent seat in the key council to break its  monopoly by war victors.    Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that  there is a growing voice in the United Nations for Japan to play  a larger role in the key UN forum, which was set up by the  victors of World War II.    Hata said many important issues, including even environment  and population problems, are decided at the council.    "There is a call in the UN in the new age for Japan to play  a  role," Hata said.    The premier responded to questions by Manso Hamamoto of the  Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and Akira Kuroyanagi of  Komeito over Hata's key policy speech before the Diet last week.    Hata also said the government is working on objective  criteria to measure progress in Japan's market opening steps to  reduce its huge trade surplus with the U.S., but reiterated his  refusal to set numerical targets.    While stressing the importance of improving soured trade  ties  with the U.S., Hata said setting numerical targets would run  counter to the efforts for administrative reform aimed at  lessening the government's intervention in the private sector.    The bilateral talks under a trade framework agreement  foundered in February, when former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa rejected demands by U.S. President Bill Clinton for  numerical targets to gauge market access improvement in some  sectors, such as in autos, insurance and medical equipment  procurement.</p>

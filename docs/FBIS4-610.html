			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein April 12 SAPA -- Farmers using their  land productively should not feel threatened by a future African  National Congress government in the Orange Free State [OFS], a  senior ANC official said on Tuesday [12 April]. ANC southern OFS  chairman Solomon Nthatisi said farmers operating productively  had a right to continue to do so and anyone wanting to buy land  would have to show they could put it to good use.    However, a future regional government would abide by the  rulings of a constitutional land claims court and all land  matters would be dealt with within a strict legal framework.  Land not currently being utilised, like the vast tracts of rich  property owned by the state and military, would be provided to  those who could put it to good use.    Mr Nthatisi, who is third on the ANC's regional electoral  list, said he was currently visiting farmers to reassure them  their land would not be appropriated by a future government.</p>

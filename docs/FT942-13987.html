			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Wales is ruled out of move to curb cars Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, has decided that the Department of the Environment's latest planning guidance, aimed at curbing the growing use of cars, should not apply in Wales. It is believed he is concerned that the guidelines could hinder economic regeneration in the country and that the rural nature of much of Wales should be taken into account. He has asked the Welsh Office to draw up its own guide-lines. The DoE issued the guidelines, PPG13, to local authorities last month as part of its policy to discourage out-of-town development which depends upon car use.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, deputy leader of </F> the Bosnian Serbs, by Dragan Colovic; place and date not given  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Colovic] Good day, Mr. Koljevic.    [Koljevic] Good day.    [Colovic] We here think that the atmosphere is somewhat  calmer, that diplomatic-political activities are being stepped  up, and that the situation is better than it was yesterday or  the day before yesterday. Do you agree?    [Koljevic] Yes, I also think that the situation is somewhat  calmer, although it is still very difficult to calm the  justified anger of the entire Serbian nation that was caused by  the air strikes. I think this will not be easy to do without  recognizing, acknowledging the very vital interests of the Serbs  in the Serbian republic and the Serbian people as a whole.    However, [words indistinct] is easier today than yesterday  because there are new initiatives.    [Colovic] Vitaliy Churkin, envoy of Russian President  Yeltsin, stated yesterday that this was the moment when a  decision has to be made on which path to take, whether to aim  for peace or war. One can conclude from the context of his  fairly long statement that the Serbs will not do anything -- if,  of course, not provoked -- that would endanger peace and even  his personal efforts. In this context he made some proposals,  initiatives to the leadership in Pale regarding the continuation  of the peace negotiations. Mr. Koljevic, when can we expect a  response to these initiatives.    [Koljevic] I think that the response to these initiatives  could be expected tomorrow, because a decision on possible  future contacts with the United Nations will be made at the  meeting of the supreme command of the army of the Serbian  republic tomorrow. Contacts with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  are out of the question for the time being. However, we will  very seriously consider a possibility of contacts with the  civilian sector, those who are not directly involved in military  matters, and thus in the bombing. If the decision is positive,  then a meeting with the representatives of the civil authorities  or civil sector, above all, Mr. Akashi, could take place very  soon.    [Colovic] There is one encouraging fact, and I hope you will  agree with this, namely that Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of  the Geneva Conference, who have been out of the game for some  time, have now rejoined the diplomatic-political action. They  are now back in the game and it is interesting that they  returned to the game after your meeting with them in Paris.    [Koljevic] Yes. We followed a basic criterion after these  aggressive attacks on the Serbian people and the Serbian  republic. Our criterion was simple. Those people and those  forces who were not directly involved in these attacks are  possible partners for talks. Considering that Russia was not  informed [about the air strikes], as has been publicly  announced, we held a series of consultative meetings with Mr.  Churkin. Since Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were not  involved in this action either, in fact they were left aside,  they were considered as possible partners for talks. They even  offered their good services. If it is possible to overcome this  critical moment, we would find it a lot more acceptable to  negotiate via them and via Mr. Churkin rather than anyone else.    [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you said if this critical moment is  possible to overcome at all. New threats are coming from the  United States. How should they be interpreted?    [Koljevic] I can interpret them as yet another mistake, a  big mistake of causing anger among the Serbian people. I have  already said several times that the unity and anger of the  Serbian people can only be caused by such unjustified threats.  I hope that this will remain at the verbal level and that the  mistakes made so far will not be fatal. After all, we will see  whether the international community, above all the United  States, cares more about establishing peace and separation, but  above all peace, than about threatening the Serbs and menacing  the Serbian people as a whole.    [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, can we expect meetings between the  military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim forces to take  place soon, at which they could reach an agreement that would  prevent further incidents, new provocations, by above all the  Muslim side.    [Koljevic] I do not believe that such meetings are possible  at present. However, agreements or contacts will be possible  indirectly, via the civil authorities. Direct ones are out of  the question at present.    [Colovic] You are continuing your activities today. Can you  tell us a little more about your intentions for the next few  hours?    [Koljevic] There will be a number of consultations on, above  all, our principled stand in this situation, then on our  military situation. Muslim forces are launching fresh offensive  attacks in different parts of the Serbian republic. Therefore,  we will hold diplomatic and military consultations today, and  tomorrow, we will decide on our conduct in the days ahead.    [Colovic] You are talking about the meeting of the supreme  command of the Serbian republic.    [Koljevic] Yes.    [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, thank you very much.    [Koljevic] Thank you and thanks to the listeners.</p>

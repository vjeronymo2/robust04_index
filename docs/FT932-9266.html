			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Government vows to tackle crime: Plan to raise retirement age for women from 60 to 65 is delayed THE GOVERNMENT attempted yesterday to respond to turmoil in the Tory ranks with a programme for the year ahead that stresses what Cabinet ministers see as populist measures to tackle crime and cut regulations. The politically controversial plan to raise the state retirement age for women from 60 to 65 has been dropped from next year's legislative programme. But Cabinet gave the go ahead to three Home Office bills - on Sunday trading, tougher penalties for criminals, and restructuring the police service. Mr John Major will today try to restore an impression of stable government after the serious buffeting of the last week following disastrous by-election and local election results. In spite of government 'U-turns' this week on schools testing and yesterday on the unit fines system, the prime minister will seek to assure party activists at the Scottish Tory party conference that he is determined to carry through the policies to which Tories are pledged. Mr Major will claim that a commitment to combat crime is an enduring strength of the Conservative party and will promise all policies will be geared towards a sustainable economic recovery. The prime minister's office rebuffed suggestions the government had slimmed down its legislative plans in the face of growing dissent within Tory ranks. It promised, 'lots of red meat'. Adding to government's difficulties was the death yesterday of Mr Robert Adley, Tory MP for Christchurch, cutting the party's majority to 18. The swing Liberal Democrats need to over turn his 23,000 majority is less than the party achieved in last week's Newbury by-election. Between 15 to 20 bills are expected for the Parliamentary session beginning in November. Besides the bill on equalising male and female state retirement ages, other casualties include Post Office privatisation and the bill on banking supervision promised after the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is not now expected to publish a pensions White Paper until the autumn. Changes would not take affect anyway until well into the next century. Other measures agreed for next year include a de-regulation bill, drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry but including the deregulation of London buses and other transport measures. The Foreign Office has won space for a bill to put the overseas security service MI6 on a statutory basis. But the government has yet to decide on whether to increase the accountability of MI6 and its domestic counterpart MI5 to Parliament. A decision is also still due on the contents of a bill expected imposed restrictions on the media's use of bugging and telephoto lenses.</p>

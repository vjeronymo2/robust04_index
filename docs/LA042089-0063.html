			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS SEEK $180,000 LOST IN ACCOUNTING ERROR  </P> <P> The Whittier Union High School District is asking the Legislature for $180,000  to make up for an accounting error by Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Assistant Supt. Lowell Shira traveled to Sacramento this week to testify about  the mistake before the Assembly Education Committee.  </P> <P> The error happened when the county auditor-controller's office reported $1.8  million too much in property tax revenue for the district. As a result, the  state cut its contribution to the Whittier district by $1.8 million, and the  district lost use of that money for six months.  </P> <P> The state began correcting the error in March by increasing the district's  monthly allotment, but Shira estimated the money would have earned the district  about $180,000 during the first six months of the school year.  </P> <P> The bill asking for the $180,000 was sponsored by Assemblyman Frank Hill  (R-Whittier).  </P></p>

Our province reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1993. The  total  output of grain and soybean totaled 23 billion kg, the best  record in history. As of 20 January this year, we had laid up  3.165 billion kg of grain under state contract purchase,  fulfilling 79.9 percent of the contract purchasing task. The  annual grain purchase totaled 5.05 billion kg, surpassing the  plan by 26 percent.    The provincial grain departments have resolutely proceeded  from the provincial conditions and grain conditions, reformed  the grain purchasing and marketing system, and on the basis of  the previous year's reduction of grain purchasing quota and  decontrol of grain marketing work, implemented the system of  stabilizing the grain purchasing quota and decontrolling the  marketing of grain, continued to decontrol grain management and  grain prices, effectively alleviated the difficulties of  peasants in selling grain, and guaranteed the stability and  vitality of urban and rural grain and cereal oil markets.  Forty-two prefectures, cities and counties across the province  have established grain markets and put them into operation. We  have initially formed a grain system with provincial grain  wholesale markets as the head, regional markets as the backbone,  and city and county primary markets as the basis, and succeeded  in reducing deficits and increasing profits.    In grain work, this year our province should further deepen  the grain purchasing and marketing system; the annual grain  purchase should be 7.5 billion kg, and the marketing of grain  should be 6 billion kg. Beginning from the time when new grains  are put on the market, we should implement the method of  guaranteeing the amount of grain under state contract purchase  and decontrol its prices and allowing the province to retain 460  million kg of grain under contract purchase, and after the  implementation of this method, relatively abolish the cash  deposit for the contract purchase of soybean and the coefficient  of guaranteeing the amount of grain purchase. The grain  purchasing prices will be adjusted according to market demands,  and the system of protective prices will be implemented. While  doing a good job in grain marketing, all localities should also  pay attention to grain export. Beginning this year, in the  export of state grain, we will change the system of delivering  grain at government fixed prices into the system of exporting  grain through agents at negotiation prices. At present, special  efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of export grain  to Japan, open up the channel of exporting rice, and expand the  quota of grain export during border trade. Meanwhile, we should  actively promote reform of the property right system, copy the  work methods of Mudanjiang city grain bureau and Bayan County  grain bureau, and do a good job in reform of the enterprise  shareholding system.    This year we should guarantee that the deficits of the grain  departments will not exceed the contract quota of 730 million  yuan, and that no new deficits or default in payments will  occur. During the Spring Festival, we should make proper  arrangements for the grain, cereal oil, and salt markets in an  all-round manner, persist in selling products according to the  price tags, and realistically organize the living of people in  the disaster areas.</p>

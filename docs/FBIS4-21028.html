			<p>Hamburg   <F P=102>   AU2803165494 Hamburg DPA in German 1459 GMT 28 Mar 94 </F> <F P=103> AU2803165494 </F> <F P=104>  Hamburg DPA </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Drug squads recently seized 6.3  tonnes of marijuana and 57 kg of cocaine in two operations in  the port of Hamburg. This was reported by the customs  authorities on Monday. The actions took place as early as in  November 1993 and last January, but they were reported later for  tactical reasons.    The customs officers discovered the marijuana in containers  from the west African port of Warri (Nigeria) that were supposed  to contain ginger and nut oil. Instead, the drug squad found  almost 100 barrels with small, pressed marijuana packets.    The two containers were originally destined for Riga and  Warsaw. The container with the destination Warsaw was not picked  up in the port of Hamburg. The other container with the  destination Riga was shipped to Latvia, but the actual  addressees did not turn up there either.    The investigators found out about the cocaine delivery  through a tip from abroad. As a result, they checked a  container from Ecuador that had arrived on a Chinese ship. It  contained 29 barrels with liquid polyester resin and was to be  taken to Morocco. With the help of an x-ray vehicle [roentgen  fahrzeug], the investigators discovered metal containers with  two packets of cocaine each under the lids of the barrels.</p>

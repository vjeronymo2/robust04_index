Today, according to expert  estimates, the physiologial survival basket costs 383,996  karbovanets, which is double the november figure.    A more or less normal minimum consumer basket, comprising  twenty products, now costs 900,738 karbovanets, while the  average wages are much lower than that. NORMA-PRESS economists  stress that all the measures taken by the government to raise  minimal wages, pensions, scholarships, and allowances to poor  families leave these sections of the population without any hope  for even purely physiological survival.</p>

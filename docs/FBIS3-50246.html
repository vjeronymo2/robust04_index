This arms smuggling has helped Moslems arm  themselves, Brankovic told Radio Yugoslavia. Brankovic also  recalled that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had warned on  time that someone within the UNPROFOR was involved in secreat  arms deliveries to the Moslem forces in the civil war-torn  former Yugoslav Republic.    After several months of investigtion, a special U.N.  commission proved that some UNPROFOR members were involved in  illegal traffic in fuel, passes for departure from the Moslem  part of Sarajevo and stolen goods, as well as in prostitution.  Brankovic said it was good to have the U.N secretary general  order the investigation, as it has proved that only a small part  of the UNPROFOR and not the entire force was involved in illegal  activities.    Truths which had been hidden from the public for a long time  are now being unveiled, as proved by the interview given by the  former UNPROFOR Commander in Bosnia General Francis Briquemont  to the WASHINGTON POST, unequivocally stating that only Bosnian  Serbs abide by their commitments, Brankovic said. Without any  doubt in many cases, UNPROFOR had been presenting to relevant  U.N. bodies true reports on what was happening in the field in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, these reports were placed ad acta  or passed over in silence, whether in UPROFOR headquarters in  Zagreb or New York, Brankovic said.    It is to be expected that UNPROFOR reports will from now on  get the green light on time, i.e. that the international public  opinion will be informed of them, Ambassador Brankovic said.</p>

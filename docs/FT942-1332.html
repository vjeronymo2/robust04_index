			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Windsor back in the black Windsor, the insurance broker which specialises in sports, leisure and contingency business, is back in the black. The group, which was hard hit by write-downs on a property investment in 1993, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18,000 for the six months to March 31. The corresponding loss last year amounted to Pounds 1.9m, including Pounds 1.7m exceptional items. Earnings per share were 0.01p (loss 5.64p and an adjusted loss of 0.61p). Windsor said it was in talks to let its troublesome investment property, a 25,000 sq ft office block in Hemel Hempstead, Herts. Some Pounds 1.7m in provisions were incurred as a result of writing down the market value of the property last year and Windsor has lost over Pounds 2m on the property since it was acquired in 1989. The group's core insurance business continued to perform well.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / US reduces projections for growth THE Clinton administration yesterday sharply reduced its forecasts of US economic growth, predicting that real gross domestic product would expand by only 2 per cent this year, not 3.1 per cent as forecast in April. The new projection, which covers the 12 months to the fourth quarter of this year, represents a halving of the economic growth rate since last year. Revised figures released this week showed that real GDP grew 3.9 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1992. The administration's growth projections for next year were revised down from 3.3 per cent to 3 per cent. However, in its 'mid-session' economic review, the White House also released more optimistic estimates of future budget deficits. The federal deficit is now expected to fall from Dollars 285bn (Pounds 190bn) this fiscal year to Dollars 179bn by fiscal 1996. Previously it had projected a decline from Dollars 322bn to Dollars 212bn over the same period. Economic data released yesterday also pointed to continuing lacklustre economic growth. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the health of manufacturing industry - was 49.3 per cent last month, slightly down from July. Readings below 50 per cent are regarded as a sign that manufacturing industry is contracting. An index gauging employment trends fell particularly sharply, indicating that jobs are probably still being shed in manufacturing. The Commerce Department said floods in the Midwest and droughts in the southeast contributed to a 0.2 per cent decline in personal incomes between June and July; personal incomes fell 0.1 per cent between May and June. Officials said this was the first time since 1954 that personal incomes in cash terms had fallen for two consecutive months. Consumer spending, however, rose 0.4 per cent in July, to register its fourth consecutive monthly gain. In a separate report, the department said construction spending fell 0.5 per cent between June and July, following a 1.8 per cent gain in the previous month. The administration's forecast of only 2 per cent growth this year mainly reflected disappointing growth in the first half. The White House claimed that GDP growth would have been 0.3 per cent faster both this year and next had a Republican minority in the Senate not blocked a planned short-term fiscal stimulus earlier this year. The 2 per cent growth forecast is consistent with a modest acceleration of economic growth in the second half to an annual rate of close to 3 per cent. The revisions to White House projections mirror similar adjustments by private-sector forecasters: the consensus 'Blue Chip' forecast is for growth of 2.3 per cent this year. The administration's new estimates, however, do not take account of substantial upward revisions to GDP between 1990 and 1992 announced this week.</p>

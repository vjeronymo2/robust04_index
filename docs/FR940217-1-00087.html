			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that receipt of a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract is necessary because it states the services that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer performs for a guaranty agency. With this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, the Secretary will be better able to monitor program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance and integrity of the guaranty agency's portfolio that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer is administering. These changes would parallel the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements concerning contracts between institutions and third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that section 552 of the Administrative Procedure Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require disclosure to the public, under the Freedom of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Act (FOIA), of subject matter that is deemed to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade secret or is of commercial or financial interest or is of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privileged or confidential nature (note also that the entity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting the information is responsible for identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that is not subject to the FOIA's disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 682.413&blank;Remedial actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to revise this section of the regulations to clarify a lender's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its third-party servicer's responsibility to pay liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the servicer has not complied with FFEL program statutes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations with respect to services it has contracted with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender to perform. Under this section, a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and lender under whose contract the servicer committed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation would be considered jointly and severally liable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paying to the Secretary any interest benefits and special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance or any compensation the servicer has received on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan from the lender from the date that the servicer fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with any of the requirements in &sect;682.406(a)(1)&hyph;(a)(6),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(9), and (a)(12), for any period when the loan has lost its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for reinsurance coverage as a result of the third-party servicer's actions, and for any period after it erroneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bills the Secretary for interest benefits and special allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would vigorously attempt to collect any of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities first from the lender and, if the lender does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay those liabilities within 30 days or does not make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary to repay those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities, pursue the third-party servicer for the payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed section would also clarify a guaranty agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its third-party servicer's responsibilities to pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities to the Secretary if the servicer has not complied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FFEL program statutes or regulations with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services that it has contracted with a guaranty agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform. Under this proposed provision, the Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a guaranty agency to repay to the Secretary any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinsurance payments the guaranty agency received on a loan if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the third-party servicer contracting with the guaranty agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causes a loan to lose its eligibility for reinsurance. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the repayment of reinsurance, if a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer makes an incomplete or incorrect statement in connection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any agreement entered into under this part or any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal requirement, the guaranty agency with which it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entered into a contract may be subjected by the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return payments made by the Secretary to the agency, have its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments withheld by the Secretary, or have its participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL programs limited, suspended, or terminated. In addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to these penalties, the guaranty agency and its third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer may be fined, may be required to repay any payments the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary became obligated to make to others as a result of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomplete or incorrect statement or violation of any Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, or be responsible for repaying any interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits, special allowance, or reinsurance paid on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consolidation loan for a violation of 34 CFR 682.206(f)(1). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency and its third-party servicer would be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jointly and severally liable for any of those liabilities. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method by which the Secretary would collect any liability would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parallel the proposed provisions governing the circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which a lender and third-party servicer would be jointly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and severally liable to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the issue of third-party servicer liability generated controversy and dissension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among the negotiators. With regard to liabilities assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against a third-party servicer under the FFEL programs, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators raised the same objections previously discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with liability for servicers under 34 CFR part 668.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negotiators raised an additional objection, suggesting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities assessed against third-party servicers under the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are unnecessary given the ability of the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine a loan to be uninsured and thus able to be collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from a lender or guaranty agency. In response to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objections, the Secretary offered the same modification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept of joint and several liability discussed previously in 34  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 668. As noted, no consensus was reached. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary agreed to incorporate language into these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to specify that the Secretary would first attempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection from a lender or guaranty agency in the event of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability on the part of a third-party servicer. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included this provision at the request of negotiators because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that this provision would not adversely impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the integrity of the FFEL programs. The Secretary specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites further public comment on the issue of joint and several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability for servicers contracting with lenders and guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies in order to obtain additional advice from the higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education community in the development of final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary specifically invites public comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether, and how, the Secretary should hold a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer that administers FFEL programs jointly and severally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liable for any violation of an FFEL program requirement by that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer and whether any alternative less than assumption of full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability is sufficient to protect the public interest. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary notes that substantial losses have occurred in the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs due to third-party servicer violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

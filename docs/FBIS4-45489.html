Over the two weeks since the beginning of the operation, the  police have seized over 20 kilograms of drugs.    On Tuesday, on one of the metro stations they detained a  resident of Tajikistan who was carrying one kilogram of opium.  An investigation was launched.    The operation is generally viewed as part of the federal  anti-crime programme approved by the president. The government  plans to spend about five trillion roubles to implement it,  hoping to receive back twice as much.    The programme largely expands the rights of law enforcement  bodies and provides for a greater role of counterintelligence in  fighting organised crime in Russia. Counterintelligence service  leaders said they will set up a special body to take active  measures to combat the rising wave of crime and will act in  cooperation with other crime-fighting organisations. Similar  bodies are planned to be set up in several big Russian cities,  including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.    On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree giving  Russia's police new powers to fight organised crime which has  been lately terrorising most Russian cities.    To prevent possible criticism of the decree, a high-ranking  Russian counterintelligence official said earlier today that the  decree does not infringe upon civil right and curbs only the  rights of criminal groupings. Yevgeniy Savostyanov, head of the  counterintelligence service in Moscow and the Moscow region,  said that the decree aims at protecting the population of Russia  from organised crime. "The adopted measures limit only the  rights of the members of criminal gangs and their direct  accomplices," he said.</p>

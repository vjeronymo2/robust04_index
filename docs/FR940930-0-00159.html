			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, EPA has decided not to pursue the proposed Credit Exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs for Manufacturers of Heavy-Duty Clean-Fuel Fleet Vehicles. The programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeared to be administratively burdensome with minimal economic and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit, and there was no support expressed in the comments for these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Labeling. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 86.095&hyph;35 of Part 86 requires that all heavy-duty vehicles and engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified by EPA have a permanently affixed label indicating that this vehicle or engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets all of the applicable requirements of Part 86. All heavy-duty LEVs, ULEVs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZEVs will be required to meet additional labeling requirements so the purchaser (e.g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleet operator) knows the vehicle is a CFV and ``double counting'' of emissions benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the purchasers or manufacturers of CFVs is prevented as discussed above in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Averaging, Banking, and Trading section. Those clean-fuel vehicles and engines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are regulated under both Part 86 and Part 88 (e.g., gasoline-fueled vehicles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol-fueled vehicles) shall meet the standard labeling requirements of Part 86  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the addition of a statement that this vehicle or engine meets the applicable heavy-duty LEV, ULEV, or ZEV standards. However, certain clean-fuel vehicles (for instance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric vehicles) are regulated under Part 88 but have not yet been regulated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 86. For these clean-fuel vehicles not yet regulated under Part 86, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer shall affix a permanent label that indicates that the vehicle or engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the requirements of Part 88 for heavy-duty LEVs, ULEVs, or ZEVs, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, but does not necessarily meet the requirements of Part 86. The reason for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement is to inform the consumer that the vehicle may be used by a fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator towards meeting the purchase requirements of the Clean Fuel Fleet program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the vehicle is not eligible to be used in the averaging, trading, and banking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in Part 86.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Conversions to Clean-Fuel Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 247 states that fleet owners may meet clean-fuel fleet vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase requirements through the conversion of existing or new gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles to clean-fuel vehicles. A converted CFV will thus be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new vehicle for the purposes of the Clean Fuel Fleet program, and so it will be eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet CFF purchase requirements and to earn credits and TCM exemptions. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this purpose, a clean-fuel fleet vehicle (or engine) is one which meets the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFV emission standards and other requirements as prescribed in CAA sections 242  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 245. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. EPA's General Regulatory Approach for Conversions of Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

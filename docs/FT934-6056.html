			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / State pension age for women may rise to 65 Senior figures in the pensions industry believe the government has decided to equalise state pensions ages at 65 for men and women. Top executives in the industry are expecting Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to make the unpopular announcement immediately after next week's Budget. They believe Mr Lilley will unveil a consultation paper recommending that the retirement age for women is raised from 60 to 65 when he makes his speech outlining the upratings in social security benefit for the 1994/95 fiscal year. Last night, both the Treasury and the Department of Social Security would neither confirm nor deny the possibility. Pension industry executives, however, say they have been advised by senior Whitehall officials to stand by for an important policy announcement during Mr Lilley's speech. He is also expected to announce a review of government contracting out provisions for the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and a review of the guaranteed minimum pension. The decision, likely to be unpopular with women, who are currently entitled to a full state pension at the age of 60, fits in with the government's long term plans to reduce the burden of the state pensions system on the exchequer. The industry also hopes that such an announcement will mean that the government will not attempt to raise revenues by removing the tax advantages currently available for private pension schemes. The government has said it would like equalisation to be part of its overall pensions legislation for the 1994/95 parliamentary year. The equalisation of pension ages will not save much in the short term. But once phased in, this change could save the Treasury an estimated Pounds 3bn a year.</p>

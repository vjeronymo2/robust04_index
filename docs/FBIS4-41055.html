			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] The general level of production in the country  continues to fall, although slower than before, [Tajikistan]  Prime Minister Abdulmadjid Samadov has told INTERFAX.    He sees one of the main reasons for the current situation in  the fact that transferring payments between Tajikistan and  Russia in either direction is still a major problem. Samadov  believes it would be necessary to draft a plan for a CIS payment  union at the heads of government level in the near future and  submit it to the CIS heads of state conference in September.  "The current situation is unbearable," Samadov said. "True, it  would be impossible to count on the restoration of ties at the  previous level, but putting financial and monetary affairs of  the CIS in order is an urgent need," the Tajik Prime Minister  said.    In his opinion, at the first stage there should be simpler  rules of transferring payments from country to country, which  would help stop the decline of economic indices in all CIS  member-states.    Businessmen in both Russia and Tajikistan have been trying  to  handle the problem at their level, Samadov said. For instance,  the recent visit of a Russian delegation under the President of  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy to  Tajikistan was a good start. "Russian experts are working in  Tajikistan and ice has been broken," the Tajik Prime Minister  said.    Samadov said that effective political reform in Tajikistan  --  the adoption of a new constitution and elections of a President  and parliament -- was another major condition for overcoming the  crisis.    About the situation in agriculture the Prime Minister said  that the first phase of field work had been completed and the  immediate targets formulated by the Council of Ministers early  this year met.    Tajikistan is now faced with another big problem, that of  acquiring and using mineral fertilizes to achieve high crop  yields, in the first place, those of cotton, Prime Minister  Samadov said. He added that Tajikistan's own resources for that  were not enough.    To import mineral fertilizers Tajikistan urgently needs a  Russian technical credit. Prime Minister Samadov said the  agreement on the credit was signed by his Russian counterpart  Viktor Chernomyrdin as early as last March, however, the  question has not been finally settled yet.    According to conservative estimates the use of mineral  fertilizers would help increase this year's cotton crop 30-40  percent against last year's and improve to a certain extent  Tajikistan's financial and economic position. Prime Minister  Samadov said that a great deal more had been achieved in  agriculture than in industry or construction this year.</p>

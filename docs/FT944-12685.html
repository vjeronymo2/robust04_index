			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Yeltsin backs bank candidate Mr Boris Yeltsin has proposed that Mrs Tatyana Paramonova, presently acting governor of the Russian Central Bank, be confirmed in her post. He has sent his recommendation on her candidacy to the state duma for debate and ratification in the latter half of this month. Mrs Paramonova, the youngest member of the bank's senior management and the sole woman member, was named acting governor after the resignation of Mr Victor Gerashchenko from the governorship last month following the dramatic fall in the rouble. An investigatory commission specially appointed by the government is due to report tomorrow on what caused the plunge in the Russian currency.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: JOHANNESBURG;  </P> <P> TESTS FOR DE KLERK  </P> <P> South Africa's four-year-old state of emergency expires next Monday, and there  is speculation it either will not be renewed or will be extended in sharply  curtailed form. Either option would presumably help pave the way for  negotiations with the African National Congress.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, voters in the coastal town of Umlazi, near Durban, go to the polls  to fill a vacant seat in Parliament in what amounts to the first referendum on  President Frederik W. de Klerk's reforms since last September's general  elections brought his ruling National Party back into power.  </P></p>

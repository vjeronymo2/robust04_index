			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone 45% take-up Hartstone Group's investors have taken up less than half the available shares in the leathergoods and hosiery company's Pounds 30m rescue rights issue. The group will still be able to meet its October deadline to repay Pounds 15m to lenders, however - a key element of its recent refinancing. The issue was underwritten by J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, and sub-underwritten by several institutions. After the rights, Schroders will control 13.8 per cent of Hartstone, either directly or through funds under discretionary management. Hartstone announced yesterday that acceptances had been received for 44.66 per cent of the 215.64m shares on offer in the 2-for-1 cash call at 15p. However, it put a brave face on the outcome, and pointed to the fact that the shares closed  1/2 p down at 16p, above the rights price. Hartstone's annual meeting to approve the accounts will be held in High Wycombe today.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> OWNER OF 2 HOTELS FIGHTS FEE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> A company that owns two hotels in Oxnard is opposing a city proposal to charge  hotels and motels a fee on room rentals to help finance the city's Convention  and Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, said Friday that he is  concerned about the opposition of the 140-room Casa Sirena and the 273-room  Financial Plaza Hilton.  </P> <P> Martin V. Smith and Associates, which owns a controlling interest in the two  hotels, said in a written statement that it opposes the assessment because  hotels and motels are "already paying a substantial fee, and the industry  cannot pass on more costs."  </P> <P> Hotels and motels in Oxnard now pay a 9% bed tax.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the city considered eliminating the bureau to save $398,000  and help reduce the city's projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91  budget.  </P> <P> Instead, the City Council voted to contribute $199,000 to keep the bureau open  until December to give staff members time to identify a new source of funding  for the bureau.  </P> <P> Under the assessment, which was proposed in July, the city would charge a 2%  fee on room rents for all hotels, motels and apartments for transients in the  city and generate about $360,000 a year for the bureau.  </P> <P> However, if the city receives written protests from hotel and motel owners who  would generate 50% or more of the fees, the city cannot legally form the  district, city officials said.

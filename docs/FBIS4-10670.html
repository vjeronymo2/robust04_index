			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of a series of reports by journalist Carlos Santana </F> Ojeda on unlicensed private taxi drivers in Havana; date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Santana] Yesterday, I presented the reasons and  means of operation used by drivers of private cars who taxi for  tourists. Today we will hear from their counterparts. We will  hear the feelings of the Turistaxi drivers with whom I spoke to  learn how they are affected by the illegal activity of these  so-called pirates.    [First taxi driver] A lot. They are affecting our work.    [Santana] Why?    [First driver] Because they do whatever they want and charge  less than we do. It affects us in regard to the fare because our  fare is higher. When the tourist sees that we charge 15, and  that they charge five or seven, they go with them, as can be  expected.    [Santana] How is it with prices and distances?    [First driver] Our distances are gauged by a taxi meter,  which begins with one peso or one dollar. Each kilometer is 35  cents.    [Santana] Are you also a taxi driver here, comrade?    [Second taxi driver] Yes.    [Santana] How much are you affected by their activities?    [Second driver] I would say our business is affected by 50  percent in one day.    [Santana] Do many tourists use your services?    [Second driver] Well, this tourist who is approaching us,  for  example, is Mexican and is being controlled by these illegal  drivers because he has come to Cuba several times. That tourist  likes to visit the prostitutes, and since he has been here  before, already has directions. As a matter of fact, they even  pick him up at the airport. We can no longer count on that  tourist's business.    [Santana] According to some interviews I had yesterday,  these  illegal drivers say they give better service to the tourists. Is  that true?    [Second driver] That is not true because we are prepared. We  have even been trained. We are at the political level in  language and tourism. We have gone to school for that.    [Santana] Is the tourist more secure with you than with  those  illegal drivers?    [Second driver] You want to know if the tourist is safer  with  us? With us, the tourist's life is insured. If anything happens  to the tourist while he is with us, he has no problem because  his life is insured. Furthermore, if the car breaks down, within  seconds he has another car because we have a plant. These cars  are new and are much more comfortable than those of the illegal  drivers.    [Santana] Do you wait for the tourist to come to you or do  you go to the tourist?    [Second driver] Well, we are lined up in front of the hotel.  When the tourist leaves the hotel, he can see our cars, which  are right in front of the hotel. What happens is that the  illegal drivers enter the lobby. If he can enter, he controls  the tourist and we can no longer count on that tourist. As a  matter of fact, this type of illegal activity, which has  increased lately, has, or we believe has, a contact in the  hotel. They enter the hotel, make contact with the tourist, make  an offer to the tourist, which is half of what we charge. The  tourist does not think about accidents or any other situation,  that if anything were to happen they would not be able to claim  anything from the state. On the other hand, if they are in one  of our taxis, they can demand insurance from the state. Besides,  we are professional drivers who are prepared for this type of  work.    [Santana] How do you think this situation can be resolved  -- by lowering the fares of the taxis?    [Third taxi driver] We believe the state must take measures  regarding this situation. What kind of measures? Not by fining  Cuban pesos because after making the conversion, if they are  fined 100 pesos, it is $1. I therefore believe they should be  fined in hard currency because they are working with hard  currency. The first time, they should be fined $50; and the  second time, their car should be confiscated. There are many  problems here regarding the problem with cars.    [Santana] In this case, how would the problem be solved if  this action were not taken?    [Third driver] The problem of our fares is already being  analyzed. It is being reviewed to be more competitive.    [Fourth taxi driver] I believe our fares are a little high  in  comparison with capitalist countries. The tourism that comes  here is generally from Latin America. In Canada, for example, a  tourist is charged a high fare, but the salaries and the living  standards of those countries is superior to Latin American  countries.    [Santana] Has this been discussed?    [Fourth driver] Yes, all this was mentioned at the workers  parliament.    [Santana] How do you and how will you defend your work from  the illegal drivers?    [Fourth driver] We have already spoken to them and told them  they cannot work here because it is affecting our work and is  affecting the state. While we see them around here, they are  going to have serious problems with us. We are not going to  allow that here.    [Third driver] I wanted to point out that the problem that  our comrade mentioned of lowering the fares -- because they are  a bit high -- does not mean that they are going to be lowered to  compete with those illegal drivers, because in this case there  is no competition. We are a serious activity and they are people  who are not serious in this aspect. Furthermore, they push  propaganda. They tell tourists: Do not ride in those cars  because they are too expensive and [words indistinct] by the  police. They even do that. It is unfair and incorrect.    [Santana] Well, that is the opinion of the drivers of  Turistaxi regarding the activity of the so-called pirates. But  what do the tourists and the people on the street think about  this? That will be covered in our next report. Thank you.</p>

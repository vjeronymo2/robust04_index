			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Virtuosos at the piano - Weekend music in London On Saturday in the Wigmore Hall, the Swiss pianist Andreas Haefliger - late 20s, son of the distinguished Bach tenor Ernst - made his first London appearance, and on Sunday at the Barbican the 21-year-old Russian Yevgeny Kissin (already heard here in a concerto or two, one of which is reviewed by Andrew Clements, below) gave his first solo recital at the Barbican. Even in London, it is rare to come upon a pair of such remarkable debuts inside 24 hours. On the strength of these performances Haefliger might be thought to have the edge in continual, passionate expression, Kissin to excel in miraculous pianism - not just aggressive bravura feats, but a speaking subtlety in piano and pianissimo that held his Barbican audience in bated-breath silence. Nonetheless, any such comparison would be pointless. Haefliger's extra few years may explain why he could illuminate Schumann's Davidsbundlertanze with so much direct feeling. This set of linked pieces - later than Carnaval, despite their arsy-versy opus numbers - trades off the composer's 'Florestan' persona (florid and pressing) against his soulful 'Eusebius' (tremulous and introspective) more specifically than any of his other music. Most pianists treat it as semi-private, rarefied stuff to be rendered in half-tones. In Haefliger's hands it brimmed with vitally contrasted sentiments, naked and assured, and it made a grand, riveting sequence. The comparable high-water mark in Kissin's recital came with the three slow Intermezzi of Brahms's op. 116 Fantasies. The quicker Capriccios were superbly fastidious and fluid - that combination is Kissin's special strength - but just on that account less craggy, troubled and unassuageable than some old masters can make us hear. The Intermezzi, however, were sculpted with nerve-end delicacy; they hung in the air like densely luminous objects, each with its own poignant freighting. The house was spellbound; this was piano-playing of a very rare order. Haefliger had started off with Sofia Gubaidulina's Chacona, already 30 years old but still bristling with muscular, visionary flashes. Kissin began with four Liszt transcriptions of Schubert songs, where he emphasised the tunes over the charms of Liszt's filigree enrichments. Instead of being cajoled by those latter, which must be the best excuse for playing the Liszt versions, we were reminded of how much more penetrating a singer can be with the vocal lines. After them came the 'Wanderer' Fantasy, in which Kissin's lofty, unblinking long-view compensated perfectly for his penchant for languishing moments. Both artists saved their pyrotechnical gifts for their second halves. After unfolding deep, sumptuous textures for Debussy's second book of Images, Haefliger whirled through Liszt's 'Mephisto Waltz' with far more digital brilliance and sweep than he had allowed himself earlier in Mozart Kissin went from his radiant Brahms back to Liszt, with a Rapsodie Espagnole of bewitching elegance, wit and dazzling dispatch. Barring fatal accidents, these pianists should command delighted audiences for many years to come. On Sunday afternoon, while young Kissin was giving a recital at the Barbican, a senior Russian pianist of considerable fame was doing the same at the Royal Festival Hall (a regrettable clash for those in either audience who might have wished to attend both). Lazar Berman has been absent from the London scene since 1984; he returned with a familiar Berman programme - Liszt and Liszt-Schubert in the first half, Mussorgsky's Pictures ay an Exhibition in the second - and a keyboard style not at all changed by the passing years. Berman remains a 'piano animal' of astonishing ability. In the climaxes of Liszt's Funerailles and Mussorgsky's Great Gate of Kiev finale he drew from the instrument a sustained lion's roar that had nothing in it of banging or applied force. In the Liszt Tarantella he achieved remarkable feats of dexterity and filigree fleetness. The darker-toned Pictures were characterised with many a piercingly idiomatic inflection derived from a precisely weighted and varied keyboard touch. What was lacking was any deep command of musical form and progress - rhythms of slower passages tended to droop, phrasing to be vague - and any specific involvement in re-creating moods of charm, tenderness, delicacy. The three Liszt transcriptions of Schubert songs and the Petrarch Sonnet no. 104 were delivered, not sung. For me (though not for the throngs of noisily enthusiastic admirers) a Berman recital remains an odd compound of moment-by-moment thrill and overall disappointment.</p>

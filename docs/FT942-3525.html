			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson float considered Part of the capital of SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, could be floated on the stock market in the near future, according to one of its largest shareholders. CEA Industrie, the French atomic energy commission which holds about 12 per cent of the shares in SGS-Thomson, said a partial flotation of the semiconductor group was being discussed with other shareholders. These include France Telecom, Thomson-CSF, the state-owned electronics group, and Italy's Finmeccanica and Iri, the state holding company. CEA said no decisions have been taken on the the timing of a possible partial flotation nor on the method. Industry observers in Paris said, however, that it would either take place as part of a capital increase for the semiconductor manufacturer or through the sale of shares by existing investors. The operation could take place by the end of this year or at the beginning of 1995, according to one industry source. The discussion of plans for a partial privatisation coincide with an improved performance at the group which was created in 1987 through the merger of the semiconductor activities of Thomson of France and SGS Microelettronica of Italy. Last year, the group reported net profits of Dollars 160m, compared with Dollars 3.4m in 1992. Further improvement is expected this year, despite expectations of a slowdown in the international semiconductor market. Texas Instruments, a leading US electronics group, has introduced a set of computer chips to produce VHS-quality video and compact disc-quality sound for emerging video-CD applications, including movie and music video playback, video games and karaoke, AP-DJ reports from Dallas. The company said the chips would be available for sampling this summer. Production quantities should be available during the fourth quarter.</p>

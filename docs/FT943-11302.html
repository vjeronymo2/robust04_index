			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Keep on the right tracks in Europe - Practical Traveller Not long ago I took a train trip from the bottom end of Europe to the top, from Marseilles to Helsinki, writes Nicholas Woodsworth. I did it because I had time - the journey, with a 12-hour stop in Copenhagen, required four different trains, two ferries, and took 63 hours. I also did it because it was cheaper than flying: less than half the price. But most of all I did it because I enjoy trains. There is perhaps not as much romance in European train travel as there was 50 years ago. But it still has its pleasures. Apart from some horrendous delays, atrociously cramped seating and one or two dodgy landings, I cannot say I have any clear and lasting memories of airports or flights I have taken; such things are anonymous and without character. Yet I clearly remember train trips from years ago. If you want a physical sense of Europe, a feeling for changes in its climate and countryside and cities, if you enjoy chance encounters with its inhabitants, then trains are the best way to see the continent. Old tales of Italian peasants exuding garlic in stuffy compartments during interminable journeys are no longer worth telling. Rail commuters in Britain may have continuing grounds for complaint, but European mainland rail travel is now seen as the transport of the future - services and networks on the whole are comfortable, reliable and fast. The French TGV - train de grande vitesse - that I took between Marseilles and Paris, for example, takes just a little over four hours, and from city centre to city centre rivals flying for rapidity. While most of the hardware on the continental rail network is impressive, I found the software - the vital information necessary to a complex network - less satisfactory. It may vary from country to country, but railway employees throughout the continent seem to regard the provision of travel information as a special favour. In Marseilles the man behind the counter was too hot and bothered to look into an alternative to the inconvenient routing he first suggested. Even in Copenhagen station, that model of Nordic efficiency, I was sold a ticket for a service that did not exist at the time promised. On the German train to Denmark, I saw an elderly American couple come close to nervous collapse because their carriage attendant had failed to tell them that the train split at Aachen. They emerged from a dining car in the wrong half to find their carriage, with all their documents and belongings, heading in the other direction. The essential act, then, before boarding a train or buying a ticket is to check and recheck. Euro City, Euro Night, Inter City Express, Inter Region - there are scores of different types of trains. Do not worry about making a nuisance of yourself; ask about the most convenient departure times, connections and routings. Language problems, guaranteed in many smaller or rural stations on the continent, can only make matters more difficult. But a bit of polite perseverance can make all the difference. Perhaps the best place to begin is the International Rail Centre in London's Victoria Station (tel: 071-834 2345). For those planning a set itinerary in Europe, or wanting to avoid on-the-spot language problems, Thomas Cook publishes a European timetable, updated monthly, available at bookshops or by phoning 0733- 268943. The same company also publishes On the Rails Around Europe (Pounds 9.95), a rail-travel guide separately detailing more than 40 different routes. It is worth finding out, too, about discounts on standard tickets, and, for those making extended tours, rail passes: these can offer real savings. Discounts are available for senior citizens, students and children, and often for travel outside peak and weekend travel periods. There is a great range of rail passes such as the Eurail, available only to those living outside Europe, which offers anything from 15 days of first-class travel for Dollars 498 (Pounds 321) to three months for Dollars 1,398. For Europeans a variety of passes exists, none of which offers the same comprehensiveness. For those under 26, the Inter-rail pass offers unlimited second-class rail travel through most countries in Europe for Pounds 249 a month. The Inter-rail 26+ pass, at Pounds 269 a month, offers unlimited travel to those of any age, but is not valid for Iberia, Belgium, France, Italy or Switzerland. However, most European countries, including those just mentioned, provide savings on their own national railways with the awkwardly-called Euro-Domino Freedom passes. If you are contemplating a longer trip across Europe, chances are you will find yourself on an over-night train. The charms of falling asleep to the sound of turning wheels has been exaggerated. After three nights of station shunting, customs checks and snoring passengers, I rolled into Helsinki feeling not entirely rested. Make sure you take ear-plugs. You are more likely to get a better sleep in a proper sleeping car than in couchettes, which are much cheaper and provide four to six berths for mixed sexes in a converted day-time compartment. Pillows and sleeping-bag-style sheets are sometimes made of disposable material, and I found the bunks short and narrow. Far more comfortable are single-sex sleeping compartments, with a maximum of three berths and the possibility, in some first-class compartments, of individual accommodation. You get a proper bed and, if you like, the attentions of a steward. While most overnight trains offer dining-car services, he will bring you drinks in the evening and breakfast in the morning.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Lamont defies EC demands on VAT MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, came under strong pressure from the European Commission yesterday to abandon Britain's policy of refusing to accept legally binding minimum rates of value added tax throughout the EC. The Treasury signalled that it would be prepared to face a clash with the Commission over the issue. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC commissioner responsible for fiscal policy, warned that Britain would face a 'hard time' unless it agreed a compromise with its EC partners before the end of this month. She was speaking after meeting Mr Lamont in London about preparations for the next EC finance ministers' meeting to be held in a week's time. Mr Lamont used yesterday's talks to reaffirm Britain's firm line not only on VAT but also on excise duties on spirits sold throughout the EC. The UK wants to protect the Scotch whisky industry from possible increased duties in some EC states under plans to harmonise indirect taxes. Underlining a toughening of the sparring over indirect taxation, Mrs Scrivener hinted that Britain might put into jeopardy its hard-won right to maintain zero VAT on a range of everyday goods unless it backed down over the minimum rates question. 'We want the UK to realise that the situation is very serious,' she said. The Treasury flatly contradicted Mrs Scrivener's implicit threat that the zero-rate exemption might be at risk. Britain's zero VAT rates were guaranteed under the EC's sixth VAT directive, which could be changed only by unanimous decision of finance ministers, the Treasury said. The VAT tussle goes to the heart of Britain's desire to maintain maximum fiscal policy freedom in spite of growing economic integration. Mrs Scrivener said she was hopeful that a solution could be found before Britain took over the Community presidency in a month's time. Britain has agreed Commission plans for a Community-wide minimum VAT level of 15 per cent, to come into effect on January 1 next year with the establishment of the single market. But the UK has refused to enshrine the measure in a legally binding EC directive, on the ground that it would restrict the Treasury's freedom of manoeuvre. Mrs Scrivener said that other EC countries that had already decided to align their national VAT rates with the new rules were growing increasingly angry about Britain's VAT obduracy.</p>

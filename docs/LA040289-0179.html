			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: FLUTIE MAY BATTLE KRAMER AT CALGARY  </P> <P> Erik Kramer could face a short but significant hurdle in his hopes to succeed  in professional football.  </P> <P> After being cut by the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints of the National  Football League, the former Burroughs High and Pierce College quarterback  started the final four games of 1988 for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian  Football League.  </P> <P> This week, while Kramer was in Calgary for meetings with coaches, it was  revealed that the Stampeders have begun negotiations to sign 1984 Heisman  Trophy winner Doug Flutie.  </P> <P> Officials of the financially strapped team concede that their chances of  signing the 5-foot-9 Flutie are not good. Regardless, Kramer isn't fazed by the  possibility that Flutie could be heading north.  </P> <P> "The fact that pro teams are constantly looking at other quarterbacks isn't  something that has just dawned on me," Kramer told the Calgary Herald.  </P> <P> Nancy Nicholls, a two-time All-City selection from Cleveland High, has signed a  letter of intent to play volleyball at Cal State Northridge. Nicholls is a  middle blocker.  </P></p>

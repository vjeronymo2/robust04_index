			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Voting plan fuels family feud - Richard Wolffe explains the upheaval at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold When Nicholas and Robert Barr asked their uncle, Malcolm Barr, to stand down as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the company's fate seemed to hang on the outcome of a family feud. Like all family rows, the Barrs' brawl over the leisure and motor group has its roots in the past. But both camps say they want to modernise the company with a new corporate strategy and enfranchisement of non-voting A shares, held almost entirely by institutions. The brothers, who speak for 30 per cent of the ordinary shares, which enjoy voting rights, have played havoc with the retirement plans of their 67-year-old uncle. Malcolm Barr, who is also chairman of the Leeds Permanent building society, had overhauled his management team and planned to rid the company of its anachronistic two-tier share structure. 'The whole exercise is very much part of a management plan and obviously I am a part of that. I am 68 in December and, at some stage, am looking forward to retirement. 'I think enfranchisement will do a lot for the company and a lot for the family. I do not think that good professional management like to be locked into companies with the two-tier structure because they cannot expand the company properly.' In May, Malcolm Barr, who speaks for 16 per cent of the ordinary shares, appointed an outsider, John Parker, as chief executive. Mr Parker in turn appointed a new finance director, Brian Small. Last month Barr &amp; Wallace reported a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 928,000 for the first half of 1994 on turnover 15 per cent up at Pounds 124m. Two weeks ago the brothers called an EGM to unseat both Mr Parker and Mr Small. They claimed majority support among voting shareholders, including the backing of Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman who owns 16 per cent of the ordinary shares. The board countered by calling a second EGM to discuss enfranchisement of the A shares. A document, including proposals for a 1-for-1 scrip issue for ordinary shareholders, is imminent. At present there are 2.45m ordinary shares and 9.95m A shares. The plan would reduce family control - albeit warring - from about 55 to 18 per cent. While the brothers say they support enfranchisement, they have pledged to vote against the plans while the present board remains intact. Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold was founded in 1908 by Malcolm Barr's father. For years Malcolm ran the company with his brother Stuart, who was managing director. However, the balance of family power changed two years ago when Stuart, father of Nicholas and Robert, died. His sister, Margaret Hook, left the board through ill-health. Within a year Nicholas Barr had resigned as development director of the motor division which his father had built. In July, the group sold its leasing wing, Trust Leasing, for Pounds 2.15m to Robert Barr, its managing director. The brothers now run the leasing company, renamed Barr &amp; Barr. 'To some degree we were suppressed in the company, probably by the fact that it was a family company and the senior generation was intact until my father died two years ago,' said Nicholas Barr. The brothers' strategy is to split the leisure operation from the motor division, Trust Motors, and run them as stand-alone companies. Nicholas Barr would be chief executive of the group, with responsibility for the motor business, while his brother would run the leisure company. 'We saw the motor distribution business grow in the 1970s into the tenth largest in the UK and now it stands at about thirtieth,' said Nicholas Barr. 'There is a lot of opportunity, but our feeling is that Trust Motors will not have a chance to benefit while the holiday business uses capital to acquire hotels.' The board, however, says the divisions are complementary. In terms of cashflow, the deposits on leisure bookings help to fund stocks at the motor division.</p>

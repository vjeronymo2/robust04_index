			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: More loans no help to Russian economy Sir, I have read with interest your coverage of International Monetary Fund negotiations with Russia. The Russian economy clearly has not adjusted to market principles, and another Dollars 1.5bn loan is as useful as pouring petrol into a broken engine. A justification would be the avoidance of mass unemployment. But the country would be better off having some unemployment. The unemployment rate is only 1.5 per cent, but that disguises the fact that millions of Russians work for a subsistence wage producing goods which go into stockpiles because no one has the money to buy them. The state would be better off giving a higher payout for those workers to stay at home. Let us help the Russians in the transition to a market economy. More loans, however, protract rather than quicken this process. James Maughan, 20 King Henry's Road, London NW3 3RP</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (1): Revolution in plastic  -As a new generation of cards supplants old-fashioned credit cards in the UK and US, payment by plastic is spreading to more and more countries / A look at prospects for the industry against the background of a slowdown in the world economy THERE MAY be a recession in many countries across the industrial world, but it has done little to hold up the advance of card-based payment systems across the globe. In countries where payments cards are well established, such as the US and the UK, a new generation of plastic card products, from debit cards to prepayment cards, is supplanting the old-fashioned credit card. Elsewhere, the plastic card revolution is spreading to countries where cash dispensers and electronic terminals were previously unknown. This spring Plus, the international inter-bank cash dispenser network, expanded into 12 new countries from Malaysia and the Philippines to Spain and the United Arab Emirates. In 10 years Plus has grown to the point where it has nearly 200m card holders in 30 countries. It describes its growth as explosive. Nevertheless the slowdown in the world economy has been bad news for the card world, judged against the rates at which payment card systems expanded in the late 1980s. Visa's worldwide card sales volume of Dollars 393bn in 1991 was a relatively modest 16 per cent up and MasterCard grew by only 12.5 per cent during the year to Dollars 220.9bn. Visa's market dominance looks unshakeable for the foreseeable future. Though the gap between Visa (281m cards worldwide) and MasterCard (172m cards worldwide) remains wide, Alex 'Pete' Hart, the MasterCard president since 1988, has restored morale and a sense of direction to his organisation. MasterCard now has effective regional structures and it is moving fast to catch up on services such as international cash-machine networks where a few years ago it lagged well behind Visa. On one market front, the debit card, MasterCard is this year making a bold initiative which, if it succeeds, could place it ahead of Visa. Several Visa debit cards, such as Barclays Connect in the UK, have been up and running for several years, but Visa's debit card products are hard to distinguish from its credit cards. MasterCard has entered the debit card market much later but is taking a more radical approach to the challenges it poses. This summer MasterCard rolls out Maestro, its brand name for a world-wide on-line point-of-sale debit card operation. It now has a network of bank cash-machines and retail outlets covering most of the US. In Europe, it will be represented by a sister scheme, EDC, the European Debit Card, set up by Eurocard. The debit card has already established itself as the dominant payment card product of the 1990s with the numbers of cards issued rising rapidly. It offers the banks an easy way to reduce their processing costs and consumers seem to have accepted it. Those who do not like the idea of losing a few week's free interest may be mollified with a second generation of debit card products in which payment is made monthly: by 1995 there will be around 90m monthly debit cards in Europe alone. By contrast, the credit card may be now on the way to becoming a niche product supplying a revolving credit linked to a bank account. Though a few banks and building societies do not charge an annual fee for their credit cards, their number is shrinking rapidly. Consumers in other countries already pay charges, usually much stiffer ones. They may end up paying much higher charges if some day retailers across the globe revolt against the present fee system and bring down the interchange system under which most of the commission a retailer pays on each credit card transaction by his bank goes to the bank which issued the card. Even without such an upset in the economics of the credit card industry, some bankers think that the credit card may already be coming to the end of its life as a product. They foresee a shift towards gold cards to serve customers who want to borrow money on their cards. It is not only the credit card issuers who are feeling the impact of market pressures. Take American Express: to protect its customer base from erosion by Visa and MasterCard, it has to spend heavily on marketing. In spite of this the number of Amex cards worldwide has dropped slightly to 36.1m from 36.7m. Its income was down by 23 per cent in the first quarter of this year to Dollars 125m. Attempts to beat Visa and MasterCard on their own ground by entering the credit card market with the Optima card caused Amex heavy losses over the past few years. As a result, Amex plans to trim its Dollars 9.4bn Travel Related Services budget by just under 11 per cent over three years. It has also sold a Dollars 1.1bn stake in First Data Corporation, its processing subsidiary in a public offering. One way forward for the charge card issuers is to seek co-brandings with an outside partner. Amex recently announced a tie-up with Banco Santander in Spain and says it plans further deals of this sort. Diners' Club, the other main charge card issuer, has found a successful niche by issuing co-branded cards with airlines. Another response to the changing economics of the card-based payments world is to farm out some of the operations involved to a third party, rather than try to do them all in-house. This trend has been particularly striking in the processing of credit cards where an outside specialist can take advantage of larger volumes of business to process cards more cheaply than the individuals are able to do for themselves. Last year, First Data Resources became Europe's largest third-party processor by purchasing Signet, the Southend-based processing plant set up by the Access consortium, for Pounds 146m from Lloyds, National Westminster, and Royal Bank of Scotland. FDR, which now processes about 14m card accounts a year, is looking to expand in Europe. There are other competitors bidding for the same market, notably Sligos of France (which also bid for Signet), but FDR has the head start. In the US, there has been a steady withdrawal by banks from the processing market and also from providing card services directly to retailers. In their place new specialist third-party processors are emerging. In Europe, CCN Systems, a subsidiary of Great Universal Stores, has set up a joint venture with Asko, Kaufhof, Metro, one of Europe's largest retailing consortiums, to provide European third-party processing services. Rising operating costs are not the only pressures affecting the economics of the payments card business. One unwelcome item on all card issuers' agenda is fraud. MasterCard International describes fraud as an international moving bush fire, leaping from one country to another. Global losses on fraud are thought to have passed the Dollars 1bn mark in 1991. To combat losses on this scale, it looks as if the banks will have to invest in new technology and strike deals with telecommunications companies all over the world allowing them to handle more transactions on-line. The fraud challenge has speeded up the adoption of new technology, but much of it will be ineffective unless banks and governments across the world agree on common standards. Technology is also spawning a host of new payment card products. Ten years ago, pre-payment cards were virtually unknown. Today, about 1bn are used world-wide each year. Applications are spreading from telephones to transport, such as road toll systems. Mr Peter Harrop, the author of a recent study of pre-payment cards, expects around 1.7bn cards to be used by 1995 and thinks that they will gradually replace coins and low value banknotes in many everyday transactions. This is good news for suppliers. Bank payment cards are relatively uniform, but pre-payment cards are likely to be much more diverse, not least because it does not matter if one issuer's cards are completely incompatible with those of another. Indeed it can be a positive virtue, making fraudsters' work hard and obliging a card holder to stick to a particular service. Even more diverse forms of payment may lie in the distant future. The machines that identify card holders at point of sale terminals may one day fulfil the dreams of some rich North Americans and make cards unnecessary. By 2020, a generation of super-intelligent terminals may be able to identify customers from their finger print or retinal patterns; check their account status with their bank; and simply ask them to sign for their purchase. But that is probably a fantasy. Plastic cards are more than just extremely convenient payment instruments. They enable banks to carry their branding deep into the daily lives of their personal customers. Modern retail banking is unthinkable without payment cards and their influence is set to grow further in the years ahead.</p>

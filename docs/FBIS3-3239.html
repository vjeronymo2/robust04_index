Speaking at the ongoing session of the CPPCC National  Committee, Li Yongchang, vice-chairman of the Shandong  Provincial Committee of the Jiu San Society, said that grain  crops should account for 70 percent of the total acreage and at  least for 65 percent so as to ensure growth of grain output.    Zhu Xiangyuan, director of the Beijing Nutrition Research  Institute, suggested that the government readjust the grain  purchasing price, protect interests of grain farmers, support  and adopt preferential tax policies for commodity grain  counties. "It is of vital importance for China to maintain the  per capita grain output at a high level while the population  continues to increase," he said.    Sun Han, vice-chairman of the CPPCC Jiangsu Provincial  Committee, suggested that China accelerate establishment of  community economic cooperatives in rural areas and finally set  up a national network of economic cooperatives. Economically  developed areas should organize specialized cooperatives to meet  needs of a market economy.    Some CPPCC members said that China should build up a grain  supply guarantee system to stabilize grain prices. Zhu  Xiangyuan proposed that the new system consist of three sectors:  first, establishment of central and local grain reserve centers  and risk funds; second, supervising grain prices throughout  China, setting ceiling and bottom prices and stabilizing the  prices with grain reserve or risk fund when fierce fluctuation  occurs; and third, assigning relevant institutions to regulate  grain supply with rational subsidies and rules.</p>

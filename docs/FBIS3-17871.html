			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mass Media and Politics"] </F>   [Text] On Monday [21 March], members of the Association of  Independent Radio and Television Stations met with  representatives of opposition parties in the Seimas  [parliament]. Association President G. Babravicius explained  his claims to the government and requested the lawmakers'  intercession. Leaders of radio and television stations are not  content with the fact that the Seimas has deprived the  electronic mass media of the right to privatize the facilities  they have leased thus far. They also stated that the government  resolution on licensing telecommunication activities runs  counter to the law on enterprises. "The government's actions  violate the Constitution which states that the mass media cannot  be monopolized," said Radio Center leader R. Pleikys.  Independent radio and television stations are also dissatisfied  with the ban on air commercials on holidays and memorial days --  such a flaw is incorporated in the draft law on the mass media.    "The conflict between independent radio and television  stations and the government is almost free of a political  tinge," claimed Association President G. Babravicius. However,  the representatives of the opposition firmly diverted the  conversation to political issues. According to G. Vagnorius,  chairman of the Homeland Union Executive Council, "one must  often look for political motives behind economic difficulties as  well." Seimas deputies proposed that a decision should be  adopted on whether to apply political or technical measures.  Journalists maintained, however, that the press, which is  seeking the status of a fourth power, will never find a common  language with the first two. "We have no illusions that a  change in the parties in power will entail a change in their  attitude toward the mass media. First of all, we need a  compilation of rules," stated the representatives of radio and  television looking for an intercession.</p>

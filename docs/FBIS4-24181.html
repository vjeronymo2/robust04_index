			<p>BFN     [Text] A statement issued by the United Somali Congress,  USC, urged the entire Somali community to collectively confront  the instability begun by the Somali National Alliance, SNA, in  Mogadishu town. The USC added that the SNA has made a habit of  creating friction among the general public living in Mogadishu,  using ill-informed persons, in order to achieve its objectives.  The statement further added that the USC constantly opposes  shedding of blood and creating enmity and confrontation among  the general public and Somali people. This has become the  custom of the SNA.    The statement appealed to the international community, and  especially the Somali people, to confront any groups aiming to  hamper the ongoing reconciliation and peace of the Somali  people. The USC believes in the principle of searching for peace  and peaceful co-existence of the Somali people.</p>

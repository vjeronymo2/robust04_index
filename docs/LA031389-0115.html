			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AMEX PRESIDENT LOUIS GERSTNER JR. NAMED RJR NABISCO'S TOP OFFICER  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco Inc., the tobacco and food products giant that recently went  private in a $24.7-billion buyout, said today that American Express Co.  President Louis Gerstner Jr. will be its new chairman, president and chief  executive officer.  </P> <P> Gerstner, 47, heads up Amex's Travel Related Services Co. unit, which manages  the company's lucrative charge card and travelers' check businesses. He will  take office at RJR on April 3, replacing acting Chairman and Chief Executive J.  Paul Sticht.  </P> <P> RJR's top post became vacant when Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson resigned  after failing to win a record bidding war for the Atlanta-based company, maker  of Winston, Salem and Camel cigarettes, as well as Oreos, Shredded Wheat and  Fig Newtons.  </P> <P> Johnson, who made an initial bid for RJR last October, was ultimately defeated  by New York leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,  which conducted the search for his replacement. Gerstner's choice surprised  some industry leaders -- the executive has never worked in the tobacco or food  business. But the Harvard Business School graduate is well-known for his strong  marketing and managing skills. Amex's travel unit, considered a blue-ribbon  outfit in the financial services industry, had record profits of $183.5 million  in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

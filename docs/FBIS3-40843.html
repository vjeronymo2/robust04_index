			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vibhavasu Tiwari: "BJP Created New Limits of </F> Success"]    [Text] The political platform in Delhi was divided between  the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the Congress (I) until  recently, and the Janata Dal has joined it to make it a  triangle. The Delhi Vidhan Sabha results show that the political  tableau of this metropolitan city is not the same. The  continuously rising population and the changed socio-political  environment have sent the vote banks from one party to another  party's coffers.    A review of the political activities of 1993 indicates that  this year was not very good for the Congress (I) and Janata Dal  parties in this state, while the state's BJP has set new  standards of success and has established its rule in Delhi. It  was successful in increasing its prestige among the people.  Meanwhile, the Congress (I) leaders in this city were occupied  in groupism, accusations and counter-accusations, and fighting  with each other. The same is true for the state's Janata Dal.  Instead of trying to strengthen the party in the state and  increasing its support base, the Janata Dal leaders spent the  whole year fighting over leadership. Both these parties because  of their weakness have not played their expected role in Delhi  Vidhan Sabha. The Congress (I), of course, was defeated, and the  Janata Dal did not take advantage of the situation as it could  have.    The Delhi branch of the Communist Party under the leadership  of M.M. Gope, and the CPI (M) behind its local leader Jogender  Sharma, tried to increase their political activities by holding  public meetings and rallies. However, they failed in luring the  Delhi voters. Janata Dal won over them. By snatching away the  traditional votes, it proved that it can be the cause of some  party's victory and other party's defeat.    The results of the Delhi Vidhan Sabha elections held on 6  November show that the votes cast for Janata Dal had spoiled  Congress (I) arithmetic, and it was defeated by the BJP. Senior  Congress (I) leaders have admitted that if the Janata Dal was  not in the race, the Congress (I) would not have faced this  defeat. Despite its weak organization and lack of money, the  Janata Dal's stealing Congress (I) votes can be called its  achievement.    Actually, the Janata Dal limited itself to one dimension  during 1993. Neither was its organization strong nor did it  manage to increase its support base. Its unity was broken  because of the internal strife and leadership conflict.    The last year was not good for the Congress (I) in Delhi.  The  local leaders remained busy in groups politics all through the  year and weakened the state party with accusations and counter  accusations. The atmosphere was hostile to the state president,  Mr. Hari Kishan Lal Bhagat, during the whole year. Efforts were  made to cut off his control. R.K. Dhawan, member of the Congress  Working Committee and a legislator; New Delhi legislator Rajesh  Khanna; and Jagdish Tytler, legislator from Delhi Sadar and a  cabinet member; joined forces against Mr. Bhagat. The call for  changing the leadership was raised repeatedly. Now after the  defeat in the vidhan sabha elections, the demand for changing  state's party leadership has become stronger.    The main reason for the defeat of the state's Congress (I)  was its internal strife and loss of its traditional vote bank.  Once during the last year, the prime minister reproached the  Delhi leaders, however, it was not effective. On one side, Mr.  Bhagat's residence at 34 Prithvi Raj Road was the meeting place  for the local leaders, while Mr. Dhawan's house in Golf Link and  Mr. Rajesh Khanna's government residence in Lodhi Estates were  the meeting places for the dissenters. Both sides played this  game which was disgraceful, and the Congress (I) leaders in  Delhi will never be able to forget the catastrophe it led to.    This year has been very pleasing for the local leaders who  are controlling Delhi government now. They may not have been as  successful as expected in other states, but in Delhi, which is a  miniature reflection of India and on whose palpitation moves the  whole country, BJP's access to its throne is a major victory. It  is a commendable achievement for the BJP to have the first chief  minister in Delhi's newly elected vidhan sabha. The reason for  is the BJP leaders' active involvement in local problems. The  Congress (I) lost its face in front of Delhi voters in 1993, and  the BJP put its entire energy to win their respect.    Despite this success, there has been some minor skirmishes  among the state BJP leaders. Some workers also got a taste of  it. Mr. Om Prakash Kohli was elected as president of the state  party organization again for two year. He has started working on  tightening the state's organizational structure. It has also  been kept in mind not to offend the veteran senior leaders.  While trying to strengthen the party, active cooperation from  various BJP units including the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak  Sangh] was sought. Despite some conflicts, the RSS was  successful in keeping its clout at the state level.    The state BJP had been actively increasing its support all  year. It was for the first time that it prepared a large vote  bank in rural Delhi. Strategies were planned to include people  living in slums and refugee resettlement camps through meetings  and conferences. It was successful in this effort. All in all,  the BJP managed to form new vote banks in Delhi.    The Sikhs have always influenced the politics in this  metropolis. The Sikh community and their political groups have  their own importance here. Before the 1984 riots, this groups  had traditionally stayed with the Congress (I). However, it  drifted away from this party after that. The state BJP took full  advantage of this situation and tried to get the Sikhs with  them. Their success in these efforts resulted in more about 80  percent of Sikh votes coming to the BJP.    Opposed to it, the Muslim voters remained away from the BJP  for the whole year. If we review the activities of the this past  year, this group has been suspicious about the situation in  Delhi. Although this group was angry at the Congress (I), part  of it stayed with it because of the Janata Dal's frailty, and a  larger part supported the Janata Dal.    That was the reason for the polarization of the Muslim votes  in Delhi politics. The decision to vote was based on the  candidates themselves in the vidhan sabha election. The Muslim  politics also showed that it is not limited to the inner city  now; its votes can be cause of victory or defeat in areas  outlying Delhi.    The caste equation proved to be neutral in this changing  political platform in Delhi, still there are some seats where  victory or defeat was decided by the caste equation alone. Some  seats in eastern and outer Delhi, caste played strongly in  decisions and votes were cast according to caste decisions. The  composition of seats has also changed because of the rapid  urbanization of areas around Delhi. Thus, 1993 has continuously  shook the Delhi politics and politicians. This year has been the  year of 'political examinations,' the results of which will help  the political pundits to spread their political chess game in  the coming years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Muslim Army will  attack Serb parts of Sarajevo if Gorazde were to fall -- DELO  claims today, citing sources within the Muslim leadership.    Units of Izetbegovic's army are preparing to attack  Grbavica,  Vogosca, Ilidza, and other Serb-held districts of Sarajevo.  High-ranking Muslim military officials and Izetbegovic's close  aides have worked out a plan to attack Serb positions,  encouraged by the fact that Serb units have no heavy weaponry in  the area. They have been left without artillery and tanks and  the Muslim leadership is aware of this, the Slovene daily  stresses.</p>

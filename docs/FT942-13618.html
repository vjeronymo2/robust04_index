			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Motoring: An alpha rating for the new Vauxhall Omega In Britain, the Vauxhall Carlton (Opel Omega on mainland Europe) was a worthy but under-rated car, coming somewhere in between a Sierra and a Granada in many a business motorist's pecking order. The new Omega - the Carlton name has been dropped - promises to put that right. The German-built Vauxhall Omega range of saloons and estate cars (an estate is pictured above) retain rear-wheel drive although all of them now have an elaborate multi-link suspension once confined to the costliest Carlton GSi and Senator CD models. Safety and security were vital concerns. All Omegas have anti-lock brakes; most are fitted with three-point seat belts for all five occupants, and airbags for driver and front passenger. Remotely controlled deadlocking, with a fuel pump, starter relay and electronic control unit immobiliser are all standard. Buyers have a choice of three multi-valve petrol engines - a 2-litre, 136 horsepower four-cylinder, a British-made 170 horsepower 2.5-litre V6 and a 210 horsepower, 3-litre V6 - plus a 130 horsepower, 2.5-litre BMW-sourced six-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled diesel. There are five standards of trim from the entry-level Select to the poshest leather-seated Elite. Any Omega can have five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Of the four Omegas I sampled very briefly in Scotland last week, a turbo-diesel estate and 2.5-litre V6 saloon appealed most. The diesel, with 'fly by wire' accelerator control, was almost as smooth and silent as a BMW 525tds which has a similar engine. Its torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) is greater than that of any other Omega except the 3-litre and is produced at only 2,200 revolutions per minute. For low speed flexibility and mid-range pick up, not to mention fuel economy and distance per tankful, it would be my choice. The 2.5-litre V6 was more refined than the 3-litre and, of course, more urgent than the 2-litre four-cylinder or diesel. But I would rate any Omega saloon or estate car highly as a comfortable motorway mile-eater, with a good ride and ample agility on minor roads. Prices range from Pounds 15,995 to Pounds 26,950.</p>

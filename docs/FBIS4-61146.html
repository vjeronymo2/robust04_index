			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 29 April (SNARK) -- The head of Georgian  state, Eduard Shevardnadze, issued an order according to which  the number of state-funded facilities will be reduced since the  second quarter of 1994. The order also reads that, with purpose  of fast transition to free prices, the state subsidiaries for  bread, electric power and gas are planned to be cut.    At the same time, VAT [value-added tax], customs taxes and  excise duty for petrol will be increased. The 8-percent tax for  products export will be removed. Also the obligatory currency  sale to government by the enterprises is no more valid.    The order, as think the government specialists, has been  developed according to the IMF and IBRD [International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development] recommendations.</p>

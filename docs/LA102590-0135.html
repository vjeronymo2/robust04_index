			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA PANEL PROPOSES BLACK VOTE, WHITE RIGHTS  </P> <P> A parliamentary advisory body on Wednesday recommended a constitution for South  Africa that would extend voting rights to the black majority but protect the  political rights of whites.  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk's government has yet to put forth a formal  constitutional proposal. The plan recommended Wednesday loosely resembles other  blueprints under consideration.  </P> <P> These blueprints are likely to provide the guidelines for the government as it  enters into constitutional negotiations with the African National Congress and  other opposition groups, black and white, perhaps early next year.  </P> <P> Wednesday's proposal, which is not binding on the government, emerged from the  constitutional committee of the President's Council. This is an advisory  commission in which all the parties in the racially segregated Parliament are  represented but which is controlled by De Klerk's National Party.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for a two-chamber Parliament, with one house elected on the  basis of proportional representation to satisfy black demands for one person,  one vote, and the other elected on racial or regional lines. It also recommends  a bill of rights.  </P> <P> The council report, issued by Chairman Willie van Niekerk, warns that the  success of a new political system in South Africa will depend on the protection  of whites, who are outnumbered 5 to 1 by blacks.  </P> <P> The ANC, which many analysts believe would win a popular election in South  Africa, has strongly opposed enshrining minority rights in any future  constitution. It argues that a bill of rights, enforced by a strong judiciary,  would provide ample protection for minorities.  </P> <P> "What we see being floated by the government shows they've still got a long way  to go to reach any acceptable democratic position," Albie Sachs, a member of  the African National Congress' constitutional committee, said in an interview  Wednesday. "They don't want power sharing, they want power division, so they  can hold on to power in crucial areas."  </P> <P> The President's Council proposal resembles a blueprint suggested recently by  the Broederbond (Brotherhood), the secret Afrikaner society that has helped  draw up much of the government's reform program.  </P> <P> De Klerk has said he supports a constitution that contains checks and balances  to prevent the 27 million blacks from dominating the 5 million whites.  </P></p>

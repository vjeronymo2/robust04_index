			<p>BFN     [Text] SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted a survey in late March of  59 members of the Diet belonging to Sakigake [Harbinger], the  Japan New Party [JNP], and the United Socialist Democratic Party  [USDP] on the future realignment of political parties, including  the formation of a parliamentary group and a new political  party, which has now been argued within the ruling coalition.  The results of the survey were compiled by 3 April.    Sakigake and the JNP have formed an intraparliamentary group  within the House of Representatives. Because all Sakigake  members refused to respond to the survey, SANKEI SHIMBUN  received responses only from some members of the JNP and USDP.  In the survey, a little less than one-half of the respondents  supported a merger between Sakigake and the JNP, which is  currently a focal issue, and not many supported the idea of  forming a new party among the ruling parties.    Thirteen clearly stated that the JNP and Sakigake "should  merge into one party," while only one strongly opposed the  merger. Eleven said, "I do not know," indicating that they are  wavering in their judgment. The results show that although the  JNP and Sakigake formed a parliamentary group in the lower house  on the condition that they would merge into one party in the  future, the majority of the JNP members have begun to feel  scruples about the merger due to confrontation between the  leaders of the two parties over a cabinet reshuffle and  differences in opinions on methods to promote political  realignment.    Concerning the ideal structure of the ruling parties in the  future, nine of the respondents said the parties should form a  "parliamentary group," four favored the idea of the ruling  parties merging into a "new party," and one said they should  only "cooperate in elections." The results show that one-half  of the respondents think it is necessary for the ruling parties  to strengthen their unity in some ways. On the other hand, nine  said it was too early to consider forming a parliamentary group.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has proposed forming a  policy study group among the ruling parties. Asked whether they  would participate in the policy study group, 10 said they would,  while 12 said, "I do not want to participate" or "I do not  know." Those who said, "I do not know" pointed out that "the  prime minister has not proposed forming a policy study group."    They were also asked what would constitute the "nucleus of  future political realignment." Most of the respondents said  "foreign and security policies" and some mentioned "tax  reforms." But as a whole, their answers to this question had an  erratic pattern, indicating that it has not yet been decided  which policies should constitute the nucleus of the political  realignment.    SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted the survey in late March. It sent  questionnaires to 59 members of both houses of the Diet  belonging to Sakigake, the JNP, and the USDP (42 JNP, 15  Sakigake, and two USDP members) and received responses from 26  JNP and two USDP members. At a general meeting of party members  on 30 March, Sakigake decided not to respond to the survey,  concluding that "because now is a delicate time, it is better  not to respond."</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: NCM Holding posts profits of Fl 33.1m NCM Holding, the Dutch private-sector credit insurer which acquired Britain's short-term export credit arm last year as part of a UK privatisation programme, said that after-tax profits in 1991 totalled Fl 33.1m (Dollars 17.9m), just under the record Fl 33.6m posted in 1990. The 1991 figures are almost entirely composed of NCM's Netherlands operations because the company did not complete its purchase of the short-term insurance arm of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department until December 1. In 1992, the first full year of operations in the UK, NCM said it expects insurance transactions worth Pounds 14bn (Dollars 24.78bn), while premium income is expected to total Pounds 80m. NCM described the UK acquisition as marking a new phase in its existence, leading to a doubling of its business and opening up opportunities for growth in Europe. Mr Harry Groen, chairman, said the British market's initial response to a new package of products launched by NCM in April was encouraging. In the first month, NCM Credit Insurance, Ltd, the new name of the privatised UK insurance arm, had issued several hundred 'quotes' to potential customers and had already closed some business transactions. The 1992 figures will not include the technical results of NCM's British subsidiary because of the normal three-year lag before these enter the books. NCM Ltd will, however, contribute to NCM Holding's results through its investment income. NCM's results on direct underwriting in 1991 (which covers the 1987 underwriting year) rose to Fl 42.9m from Fl 32.2m a year earlier, when the books on the 1986 underwriting year were closed. However, results for indirect underwriting swung into a loss of Fl 3.9m from a profit of Fl 10.3m.</p>

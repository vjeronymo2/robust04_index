Chernomyrdin told journalists after the meeting that he was  pleased with its results and intended to meet Camdessus again  Friday and Saturday. "Meanwhile the experts will do their bit,"  he said. He added that IMF experts wanted to have a better  insight into the Russian economy.    Valeriy Grishin, first deputy director of the government's  press service, told INTERFAX that IMF officials were troubled by  the recent remarks made by the Liberal Democratic Party leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who doubted the indices mentioned in the  budget draft. Zhirinovskiy accused the cabinet of promising  unduly high revenues and unduly low spending.    Grishin said that Chernomyrdin had asked the IMF delegation  directly if the IMF was willing to help Russia and added that  the Russian government did not depend on the Fund's support for  its success. Grishin recalled that the Russian cabinet had met  the conditions made by the IMF earlier by holding monthly  inflation below the 16 to 18 percent mark. According to  Grishin, the IMF officials had admitted this. Now the IMF  wanted to verify the budget indices, thus making a new  condition. Grishin said that the Western experts and their  Russian colleagues would be given this opportunity.    Camdessus will also meet with Russian Economy Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin Friday.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Mexican trade deficit at Dollars 1.38bn in February MEXICO recorded a trade deficit of Dollars 1.38bn (Pounds 772m) in February, bringing the deficit for the first two months of the year to Dollars 2.59bn. The figures suggest the annual deficit, on current trends, will be close to Dollars 16bn, far above official government forecasts and nearly Dollars 5bn more than last year. However, the deficit's rate of growth has slowed and may have levelled off. For the past four months the monthly deficit has hovered between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.4bn. February's deficit falls to Dollars 1.04bn if revenues from maquiladoras (in-bond plants) are included. While revenues from oil exports have fallen, manufacturing exports rose to Dollars 1.3bn in February, 23 per cent more than a year earlier. Imports climbed to Dollars 3.46bn, an increase of 29 per cent on February 1991. In the short-term Mexico can easily finance its widening trade gap as reserves are estimated to top Dollars 20bn and foreign capital continues to roll in.</p>

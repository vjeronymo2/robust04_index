			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Shakhray who submitted his resignation from  the post of deputy prime minister to the president and prime  minister has told Interfax that on Tuesday morning he met Boris  Yeltsin and gave his reasons.    Asked about the president's response to Shakhray's ideas he  said Yeltsin promised to think them over. Shakhray did not have  reasons to believe that the resignation would not be accepted.    After resignation he is planning to concentrate on his work  in the State Duma and the strengthening of local branches of his  Party of Russian Unity and Accord. Shakhray is also convinced  that his resignation will not have "avalanche consequences" for  other members of his party in the cabinet: the Minister of  Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, the Minister of Labor Gennadiy  Melikyan and the Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov.    According to Shakhray, Russia is now at a crossroads, like a  legendary Russian warrior having to choose one of three roads:  to chaos, to transformation into a police state or to the  formation of a full-fledged federation with broad rights of  local government bodies. To make the last option a reality  several fundamental steps should be taken.    Firstly, Shakhray thinks the president and prime minister  should start playing the part of arbiters in society. Secondly,  the hard core of a confederation should be formed in the  framework of the CIS so that the process is not led by such  extremists as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Thirdly, Russia should  start truly protecting the rights and interests of Russians in  former Soviet republics. In the fourth place, Shakhray is  convinced, "basic order should be restored" and spending on the  government machinery reduced. In the fifth place, crime should  be resolutely combatted. In the sixth place, a common national  idea should be worked out. In Shakhray's opinion this should be  the idea of reviving Russia.    If the authorities remain inactive and fail to achieve  political accord and resolve the problem of mutual debts in the  economy, Shakhray predicts developments "according to the  gloomiest script".    Here is his vision of this script. In July there will be  mass strikes and unrest among work collectives, primarily in the  defence industry. This, according to Shakhray, can lead to the  resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in August.  The situation can be such that Chernomyrdin will have to go  himself in order to ease the social tension. In this case  Shakhray named as possible candidates to the post the Moscow  Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Deputy Prime- Minister Oleg Soskovets and  the Chairman of the Federation of Manufacturers Yuriy Skokov.    However, Shakhray foresees great difficulties with the  approval of any of these candidates by the Duma. This can lead  to calls for the dissolution of the lower house of parliament.  In such circumstances the Council of the Federation could  become opposed to the president. As a result the situation in  October could be similar to the one in October 1993.    Shakhray also thinks that Chernomyrdin can keep his cabinet  unchanged only if he manages to resolve the problem of mutual  debts.    He went on to say that he sympathizes with the head of  government adding that he did not have any conflicts with either  Chernomyrdin or Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Management: Coming to terms with changing needs - A day's events in Doncaster / Enterprise agencies It is the weekly executive meeting at DonBAC, the enterprise agency and business advice centre based in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and the three-man executive committee is discussing plans to expand the agency's range of information services. DonBAC is hoping to provide space in its already cramped offices for an information officer from the local public library and for staff to operate a telephone helpline on behalf of its area Training and Enterprise Council, the Barnsley and Doncaster Tec. Consideration of the plans has already been going on for 18 months and Brian Crangle, DonBAC's chief executive, and his two fellow directors are keen to press on. But recruitment of the librarian has been held up by a salary review and slotting the data links and the extra telephone lines into DonBAC's already crowded phone system is causing headaches. The expansion of the agency's information service is just one of several initiatives to be discussed at last week's two-hour meeting. Like many of the 300 enterprise agencies around the country, DonBAC is attempting to come to terms with rapid changes which are occurring in the field of small business support. The creation of a nationwide network of Training and Enterprise Councils and a new-found vigour on the part of the Chambers of Commerce movement represent at the same time an opportunity and a threat to the enterprise agencies. Meanwhile the winding-down of government funding for the enterprise agencies and an increasingly demanding approach on the part of their private sector sponsors are forcing the agencies to question their role. Can they continue to function as a social service, providing free advice to the smallest business, or must they adopt a tougher, more commercial approach? Set up during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Britain's enterprise agencies originally saw their main role as providing advice to unemployed people seeking to become self-employed or to establish small businesses. Towards the end of the 1980s, though, the emphasis shifted to helping more established businesses by providing training and financial support. Nimrod Holdings, a manufacturer and retailer of computer games, is not untypical of the companies helped by DonBAC. Alan Scott, a National Westminster Bank manager on secondment to the agency, spent one morning last week on a monitoring visit to Nimrod, which has 11 stores, 100 employees and turnover of Pounds 2.8m. Scott's interest in the company arises from a Pounds 24,000 loan which DonBAC has made to Nimrod's Appletree Print subsidiary. DonBAC was established in 1985 to help counter the rising unemployment caused by pit closures in the south Yorkshire coalfield. It received a significant boost in 1987 when British Rail provided Pounds 1.5m of funds to help soften the impact of cut-backs in its engineering activities in the Doncaster area. DonBAC has set up a loan fund with the money. DonBAC also operates a venture capital fund which has Pounds 850,000 to invest. The risks attached to venture capital are graphically illustrated, however, by the failure in February of one of its two investments at a cost to DonBAC of Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 170,000. The DonBAC team underestimated the amount of time required to monitor equity investments, concedes Bryce Staniland, financial executive. The agency now has a staff of 12 people; all three of its executive directors are employed on a permanent basis. This gives it a decided advantage over agencies which depend on secondees to fill senior positions, says Crangle. Money is tight but DonBAC is self-sustaining on a budget which was Pounds 200,000 last year. Finance comes in the form of sponsorship from nearly 40 organisations, including the local council, British Coal and British Rail, interest and fees from its lending activities and training fees. DonBAC has its offices in a small arcade in central Doncaster. This gives it a shopfront onto one of the town's busiest streets but the premises are cramped and there are plans to move to a new site with the Tec and other business advice groups to provide inquirers with a one-stop service. It was the decision by the government to create a nationwide network of Training and Enterprise Councils which has caused DonBAC and other enterprise agencies the greatest amount of heart-searching in recent months. Many enterprise agency directors wonder how the Tecs will interpret their small business role and whether the two networks will be able to work smoothly alongside each other. An example of how the relationship can work is the contract which DonBAC has won from the Barnsley and Doncaster Tec to provide business counselling sessions. But Crangle and his team have been unable to agree with the Tec on a plan to approve business plans submitted by applicants for the Tecs' Business Start Scheme. The Tec was keen for DonBAC to assess the business plans but was unwilling to pay it for the service. 'We are used to giving advice to people on their business plans but we told the Tec there was an extra effort involved in approving plans,' explains Crangle. The Tec has now said its own staff will approve the business plans but Crangle wonders if they are qualified to do this. Despite these difficulties, Crangle says he is hopeful that the Tecs will rapidly gain experience. But the launch of the Tecs and the decentralisation of many government-funded training programmes has posed further problems for agencies like DonBAC. Spending cuts have hit DonBAC's training programmes and reduced its income from this source over the past two years. Further pressure on its finances have come from some of its sponsors who are increasingly insisting on their backing being allocated to specific programmes or projects. This threatens DonBAC's ability to provide its core service - free advice and counselling to would-be entrepreneurs and small businesses. It is to counter these financial pressures that DonBAC is seeking to broaden its range of services. Last week saw Derek Evans, DonBAC's training and marketing director, providing a one-day pilot course to a group of 15 Midland Bank enterprise counsellors on how to deal with small business clients. Evans believes Midland will decide to go ahead with the courses on a regular basis. DonBAC is also keen to expand its range with the creation of a franchising centre to provide training, advice and finance to both franchisors and franchisees. After the weekly executive meeting Evans goes into talks with Brian Smart, executive director of the British Franchise Association. The enterprise agency has been receiving a growing number of queries about franchising while the association has been working for some time on opening a centre to promote franchising. The franchise association wants to base its centre in London but Evans and Smart discuss the possibility of Doncaster serving the north-east as part of a support network of regional centres. A third area where DonBAC is keen to expand is in the field of innovation support. It recently became one of 14 agencies around the country to be designated a 'gateway agency' providing help to inventors and innovative small companies seeking advice on subjects such as patents and licensing. Evans is working with John Gaskin, a DonBAC business counsellor with special responsibility for innovation, on a one-day Inventors' Forum to be held on April 30. If the forum is successful Evans hopes to stage similar events in other towns in south Yorkshire and Humberside. In an area which has been dominated by large industry,creating an entrepreneurial climate has not been easy. Crangle believes, nevertheless, that attitudes to enterprise have improved in recent years. Much more could be done, though, if resources were not so limited. Getting the most value from the resources available and avoiding wasteful overlaps will be the challenge of the next few years. DonBAC, 19-21 Hallgate, Doncaster, DN1 3NA. Tel 0302 340320.</p>

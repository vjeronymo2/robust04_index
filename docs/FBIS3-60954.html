In a raid Sunday on the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunus refugee  camp,  they arrested Farid al-Qaysi, 21, and 'Ala Abu-Sita, 20, on  charges of killing alleged drug dealers Hayim Weizmann, 34, and  David Bublil, 41, near Tel Aviv last Friday.    The two were reportedly seen writing on the main Khan Yunus  mosque that "the Ahmad Abu-Rish group carried out the murder of  the two Zionist dogs at al-Ramlah to avenge the army's killing  of Ahmad Abu-Rish."    Al-Qaysi, Abu-Sita and two other Palestinians who were at  large had shown camp residents four ears they said they had cut  from their victims, Palestinians said.    Undercover Israeli troops shot dead Ahmad Khalid Abu-Rish, a  20-year-old member of the Fatah Hawks, on November 28, shortly  after he had been set free from prison.    The Hawks vowed afterwards to resume their armed attacks  which they had abandoned on Arafat's orders following the  September 13 autonomy accord.    The army also arrested Muhammad Abu-Rish, a former member of  the Islamic Jihad movement who had been pardoned at the same  time as his brother Ahmad.    Soldiers also raided the al-Burayj camp and arrested Yasir  Taha, 20, a member of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qasim, the armed wing  of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).</p>

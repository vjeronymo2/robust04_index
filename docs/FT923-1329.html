			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Tesco's growth slows to 10% PROFITS growth at Tesco slowed to 10 per cent in the first half of the financial year as the UK's second biggest grocery chain ran into the brunt of the recession. Higher operating margins and contributions from 12 new stores enabled the company to lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 251.8m but Tesco said there were clear signs of customers cutting their spend. At the interim stage last year profit growth was 22 per cent. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said: 'I have been in this industry for 30 years and I have never experienced trading conditions like this before. Consumers have been shot to pieces. Confidence has absolutely gone and is at zero in this country. The government has to try to regenerate confidence.' In the 24 weeks to August 15, group sales, excluding VAT, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 3.41bn of which 2 percentage points was generated from existing stores and 7 points from new selling space. Operating profits climbed 17 per cent to Pounds 234.9m as Tesco benefited from improved productivity levels and the extended use of information technology. The operating margin climbed 0.5 percentage points to 6.9 per cent but interest receivable fell from Pounds 29.4m to Pounds 16.9m. Sir Ian said Tesco's sales performance was better than the industry average with market share improving from 9.6 per cent in February to 9.9 per cent in July. However, he conceded Tesco's sales increases might have lagged behind those of its arch rival, J. Sainsbury. The average spend in Tesco's superstores fell 3 per cent to Pounds 30 during the half-year. The company said there had been a fall in food price inflation in recent months to the present level of 1.5 per cent. Sales were running 8.5 per cent higher with new stores contributing 7.5 per cent and existing stores experiencing a 0.5 per cent volume decline. 'In the short-term we do not anticipate any increases in current sales trends,' Sir Ian said. Staff productivity was sharply higher as the number of employees fell 3 per cent to 85,081. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 9.04p. The interim dividend was lifted 12.5 per cent to 2.25p. Tesco said it served 500,000 customers each Sunday and was pressing for total deregulation. Lex, Page 20, Details, Page 23</p>

"these resources would permit the FBI to hire 236 new  special agents and 218 new clerical and professional support employees, nearly  half of whom would be accounting technicians," Sessions told a Senate  Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Federal bank and thrift regulators have  testified that fraud is involved in many recent S&amp;L failures.  </P></p>

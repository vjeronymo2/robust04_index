			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Benson reaches Pounds 0.8m as growth continues GROWTH AT Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineering company, continued during its first half to November 30. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 817,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 4.85m). The profits growth marks an extension of last year's second-half trend and follows the absorption of five acquisitions. New management arrived in 1990 and undertook corporate surgery earlier in the recession than many of its peers. The group has disengaged from the difficult agricultural machinery markets. Margins have been maintained at the levels of the last financial year in the three main lines of business - environmental controls, vehicle engineering and engineering components. 'We have been determined not to enter the fray of reducing prices,' said Mr Richard Phillips, chairman. Earnings per share were 0.55p (0.39p) and the interim dividend is restored with a payment of 0.1p. For 1991-92, Benson paid a final, also of 0.1p. Gearing rose from 30 to 50 per cent during the six months.</p>

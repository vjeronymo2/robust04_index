			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The prospects for tax cuts Give us our tax cuts please, Mr Clarke. Two more years of pre-announced tax increases may be in the pipeline, but this is already the cry of dispirited Tories. The pre-election tax-cutting budget is a time-worn ritual. Lord Howe in 1983 did it, Lord Lawson in 1987 did it, even recession-struck Mr Lamont in 1992 did it. With up to three budgets before the last possible date for a general election, Kenneth Clarke may find an excuse too. Yet, however politically well-judged cuts might prove, they are unlikely to be justifiable on economic grounds. This is so even though the revised forecasts from the Treasury, published yesterday, have a relatively good story to tell. Real gross domestic product is forecast to increase by 2 3/4 per cent in 1994, compared with the 2 1/2 per cent forecast at the time of the budget last November. The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to be Pounds 36bn in 1994-95 (5 1/4 per cent of GDP), down from the earlier forecast of Pounds 38bn. This follows an outcome of Pounds 46bn (7 1/4 per cent of GDP) in 1993-94, compared with the earlier forecast of Pounds 50bn. Best of all, the retail price index is forecast to rise by 2 1/2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1994, as against the 3 1/4 per cent forecast last November. This performance must be heartening to the forecasters. But how heartening should it be for the politicians? It is better than another knock on the head, but still no cure for what ails them. Roughly right This is most obviously seen in the case of the public sector borrowing requirement. The forecasts for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are 5 1/4 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP, respectively, both only a quarter of a percentage point lower than forecast in November. If the fiscal strategy was roughly right then, it must also be roughly right now. That is what Mr Clarke told his colleagues in opening this year's spending round, when he confirmed the earlier targets for the 'control total' (covering supposedly non-cyclical spending) of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97 respectively. One thing that does help the chancellor is lower-than-expected inflation. Even so real growth of the control total is forecast to be a mere 1.7 per cent between 1993-94 and 1995-96. Another reason why the chancellor is slightly better off than expected is lower unemployment, which reduces spending on cyclical social security, with each 100,000 people off the register expected to save the government about Pounds 350m. The November forecast was for unemployment in 1994-95 at 2.75m. The outcome may add another Pounds 1bn to the chancellor's room for manoeuvre. Greater squeeze On balance, however, these developments merely make it less unlikely that the government will hit its spending targets. To do better would demand either a still greater squeeze on public sector pay or greater radicalism towards the public sector, something this government will not dare and, in any case, should not attempt on an emergency basis. This leaves two arguments for tax cuts before the election. One is that economic growth should be faster. Here there is a case to answer. Coming off a recession, an economy whose long-term trend rate of growth is around 2 1/4 per cent a year ought to be able to grow faster than 2 3/4 per cent. The question is how much faster before inflationary bottlenecks emerge, the problem being that an economy's potential output is an uncertain zone, not a well-defined line. Moreover, while retail prices have been rising more slowly than forecast, there are already signs of tightening in the labour market. If the authorities want to keep inflation at around current levels, let alone reduce it further, it would be wrong to assume growth can much exceed 3 per cent. With faster economic growth unlikely to make a huge fiscal difference over the next three years, what is left for the government is prestidigitation. PSBRs have been so huge in relation to the amount of tax normally 'given away', or imposed in any given year, that there has to be room for a few billion pounds in 'cuts'. But what would that mean? First the government would impose a multi-year fiscal squeeze. Then it would introduce a partial reversal in the last year of the parliament. How very British] This may be a way to win an election. It is no way to run a country.</p>

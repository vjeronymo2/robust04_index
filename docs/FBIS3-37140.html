Meshkov Met With Admiral E. </F> Baltin"]    [Text] Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Crimean Republic,  on 7 February met with Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the  Black Sea Fleet, in Sevastopol at the Black Sea Fleet  Headquarters. Yu. Meshkov pointed out that the Black Sea Fleet  "has been and continues to be a guarantor of stability on the  peninsula." In his opinion, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet  must be resolved in the interests of all CIS members, taking  into account the expression of will of the peoples residing in  the Crimea and of its supreme legislative and executive bodies.  "The question of the fleet, Sevastopol, and the Crimea is a  triune problem of the relations between Russia and Ukraine,"  stressed Meshkov. Admiral E. Baltin, in turn, expressed the  hope that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet would be resolved  as soon as possible. He is convinced that the problem of the  Black Sea Fleet will be resolved "with an account of the  opinions of the Black Sea sailors and residents of Sevastopol."</p>

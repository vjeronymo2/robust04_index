			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CAPITALS REPORTEDLY TO RE-SIGN STEVENS; MAY TRADE HIM TO KINGS  </P> <P> The Washington Capitals will sign free-agent defenseman Scott Stevens and then  trade him rather than allow him to join the St. Louis Blues, the Associated  Press reported today.  </P> <P> Sources close to the situation said the Capitals would match the Blues' offer  sheet before the 9 p.m. PDT deadline and then trade Stevens to either the  Montreal Canadiens or Los Angeles Kings.  </P> <P> Stevens signed an offer sheet worth more than $4 million over four years with  the Blues last Thursday, a deal that would make him the NHL's highest-paid  defenseman.  </P> <P> The Capitals were unhappy that the Blues went after Stevens and decided to  match the offer and trade him rather than let the Blues sign him.  </P> <P> If the Capitals re-sign Stevens, they can trade him to any team except the  Blues. The Capitals had no comment on the report they would re-sign Stevens.  </P> <P> Stevens, 26, is an eight-year veteran and was a first-team NHL all-star in 1988  after scoring a career-high 72 points. He has led Capitals defensemen in  scoring two of the last three years and has 98 goals and 331 assists in 601  career games.  </P></p>

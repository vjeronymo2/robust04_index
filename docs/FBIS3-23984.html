			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alexander Zhilin, MOSCOW NEWS military analyst: </F> "Lefortovo Prison Comes Under Ministry of Interior"; first  paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment]    [Text] By the president's decree on the abolition of  the Security Ministry, the prison cells and the investigation  department of Lefortovo are being placed in charge of the  Ministry of the Interior (MVD). The investigators, including  those holding an inquiry into the October events of 1993 in  Moscow, were advised to turn over their duties in ten days.    It is well known the main oppositionists from the White  House  are not the only prisoners in Lefortovo. Also conducted in this  prison are serious investigations of smuggling, corruption and  narcobusiness. These are hundreds of bulky cases, numerous  material evidence and valuables, and stacks of classified  material. According to investigators, only the regular checking  of classified and non-classified documents usually takes 30-35  days. If the transfer of Lefortovo to MVD is speeded up, it is  quite possible that many case files may be lost in this chaos.    The Lefortovo employees do not conceal their concern and  embarrassment. Their fate is not yet clear. The investigation of  all cases has been suspended. The persons under investigation as  well as officers are waiting for a decision of their destiny. It  is still not clear to whom the material values confiscated from  those arrested will be handed over to. The Main Military  Procurator's Office seems to have voiced its readiness to assume  responsibility for a part of the cases, but the question was:  Who will investigate them. It has enough problems of its own.  All the members of the investigation team inquiring into the  October events have been dismissed. Their vague future and the  absence of distinct explanations make the investigators assume  that the abolition of the Security Ministry is a convenient  pretext for making corrections to the "October case." An MN  [MOSCOW NEWS] correspondent was told at Lefortovo that from the  first day the president's entourage was dissatisfied with the  investigation team. It was made clear what kind of results were  expected from it. Investigators were compelled to hold a meeting  and demand that they be protected against the pressure of the  interested sides.    Nevertheless, from early November the investigation team was  kept in a state of temporary "time trouble": at the meetings in  the General Procurator's Office its members are hastened, then  the president set the task of taking the matters to court before  the New Year. Investigators believe that this is a direct  interference in judicial procedures and fear that in the process  of the transfer of the cases the materials they had obtained may  be sifted through the "political sieve."    Of late it became known that several investigators of the  General Procurator's Office handed in a request to Alexei  Kazannik to release them from the cases on October events  because of pressure they are subjected to from the officials of  the president's staff. And from January 1 the Defense Ministry  stopped financing military courts (tribunals) which were  supposed to plead the cases of Rutskoi, Achalov, Barannikov,  Dunayev and others. Added to this the rumors on the forthcoming  dissolution of the General Procurator's Office, we shall have a  strange chain.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lep advances 22% to Pounds 29.4m - Accounting changes have marked impact on profits for the year LEP GROUP, the distribution, property and security services company, achieved a 22 per cent increase, from Pounds 24.09m to Pounds 29.4m, in pre-tax profits for 1990. Mr John Read, chairman, said that there was scope for further improvement but it was a creditable performance. Trading since the year-end had been below expectations, but he remained 'cautiously optimistic' on prospects. The results were affected by a change in accounting for the discount on a seven-year bond issued in 1988 by St Paul's Vista, Lep's vehicle which owns Swiss Bank House in the City of London. This is now being amortised through the profit and loss account. The effect in 1990 was to depress pre-tax profits by about Pounds 1.63m and earnings per share by 0.8p. Against this, a switch in 1990 to average exchange rates had a positive impact on the pre-tax line amounting to Pounds 1.13m and on earnings to 0.9p. Operating profits from distribution, which comprises freight forwarding and automotive activities, moved ahead to Pounds 23.26m (Pounds 13.9m). Mr Read said some Pounds 4m of that arose from an acquisition in Germany. He said National Guardian, the US-based electronic security business, achieved a 14 per cent rise in dollar terms but, owing to the weakening US currency, sterling operating profits were curbed to Pounds 25.74m (Pounds 24.77m). The company made 31 acquisitions during the year. Property produced operating profits of Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 10.5m). Gearing was 188 per cent at the year-end. However, that included some Pounds 79m of non-recourse debt relating to St Paul's Vista, taken onto the balance sheet after changes introduced in the 1989 Companies Act. Taking that out, it was about 120 per cent. Earnings rose to 16.5p (13.7p). The final dividend is lifted to 5p for a 7p (6p) total. COMMENT The Pounds 1.6m bond amortisation charge came as a surprise to Lep followers yesterday, but even stripping that out these results were seen as just a touch disappointing. Freight forwarding looks, on the face of it, to have put in a strong performance but much of the organic growth is really turnround. That said, Lep would appear to have come through a difficult period in fairly good shape. This year, factoring in the gains that the dollar has already made, the assumption that there will be a start to economic recovery in the US and the UK and distribution activity in the Gulf will pick up, the company's pre-tax profits should edge a bit higher to about Pounds 32m. Given the progressive dividend policy, and assuming investors can live with the gearing, the shares look modestly rated on a prospective p/e of about 8.5. The trouble is the 27 per cent stake owned by ADT will confuse the issue until the state of Mr Michael Ashcroft's affairs becomes clearer.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / French PM tries to end jails dispute MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday tried to quell unrest in the country's jails by urging striking prison officers to return to work and promising that the government would take action to improve prison security. The French prison system yesterday came close to chaos as 137 of the country's 182 penal institutions were affected by the industrial dispute which flared up on Friday following the murder of a prison officer at the Clairvaux high security jail when seven inmates tried to shoot their way out. The government has suspended 39 striking officers in an attempt to end the stoppage. The killing of the warder at Clairvaux followed the murder of an officer at Rouen earlier this month. The Rouen killing prompted a wave of industrial action by prison officers which was only called off when the government promised to take action. The current strike started on Saturday and by yesterday had spread to 137 prisons, with riot police moving into a number of jails to restore order. One riot squad broke into Ajaccio prison after inmates set fire to cells. Police scuffled with warders at a jail near Le Mans when the staff blocked the entry to the institution. Mr Beregovoy, who is anxious to create a picture of political stability before next Sunday's crucial referendum on the Maastricht treaty, appealed to prison officers to end their strike. 'The government will act responsibly, ' he said on French radio. 'It has understood your message. Now you must go back to work.' The government has already begun an investigation into the illegal traffic of arms in French jails following the Clairvaux shoot-out. The ruling Socialist party yesterday suggested that next year's national budget should make extra provision for the prison system.</p>

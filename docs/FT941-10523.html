			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Central Statistical Office 'From baked beans to counting beans,' is how Philip Powell describes his latest career move. Powell, 41, starts on Friday as the Central Statistical Office's first director of marketing in a move that underlines the CSO's determination to make its numbers pay under the Australian Bill McLennan. A marketing professional since he left the University of East Anglia with an economics degree, Powell's most recent job was with the Cow and Gate baby food group. Before that he was in New Zealand where he did some work for Heinz. But Powell maintains that 'maximising the value of the CSO's statistics as a product' will not be such a departure from the past. Statistics have become increasingly important as a tool of marketing in recent years. His goal now is to see how they can be packaged and made more user-friendly - at a price, of course - although those numbers regarded as a public good will still be available to the press.</p>

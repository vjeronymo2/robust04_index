			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / People: Jean Wood to head Irish Life in UK Irish Life, Ireland's largest life assurance, pensions and investment group, has appointed Jean Wood as chief executive of Irish Life UK on the retirement of Ralph Sepel. She will also take on responsibility for Irish Life's operations in Europe outside Ireland, which was formerly handled from the Dublin HQ by John Edmonton; he departed last month to head the new operation of J. Rothschild International Assurance at the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. Wood is well known in the UK insurance industry having been managing director of the life insurance, pensions and unit trust company, Prolific Group, until it was bought for Pounds 82m from Hafnia, the Danish insurance group, by Scottish Provident last year. Scottish Provident gave Wood a senior position to integrate Prolific, but not on a long-term basis. She had helped build Prolific's strong reputation for investment management, indeed it had a portfolio of Pounds 1.15bn and Pounds 20m in cash when it was taken over. Wood, 51, has worked most of her life in the life assurance business, starting out in the North American market - she spent ten years with Manulife; she later moved to Cyprus and on to the UK where she became the managing director. She was apparently the personal choice of David Kingston, the group managing director, to replace Sepel and Edmonton. Her appointment is a significant departure for Irish Life, as she is the first woman to be appointed to a senior executive position. Wood says her new job 'will require a serious review of the UK operations which will consider options of acquisition or disposal. There are distinct possibilities of expansion elsewhere in Europe and I will be looking at those, but the immediate task will be to get the three existing branches of the (non-Irish European) business to deliver the goods.' Around 15 per cent of the group's premiums are derived from its UK subsidiary, but its market share is only around 0.5 per cent in the UK; Dublin analysts believe that either an acquisition with a retail distribution network for its life products needs to be made, or resources should be released to expand elsewhere, such as in Norway and France.</p>

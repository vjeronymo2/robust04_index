Chen Xitong, secretary of the  municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the  conference. He emphatically pointed out: Party committees at  all levels should pay great attention to united front work,  further enhance the concept on united front and never slightly  slacken our leadership over united front work. It is necessary  to unite with nonparty personages in various sectors to jointly  build our country and unite with as many people as we can. If we  fail to have this consciousness, that means we are practicing  closed-doorism and will be unable to vigorously develop our  undertakings.    Chen Xitong pointed out: At present, a considerable number  of leading cadres have failed to fully understand the importance  of united front work and believed that united front work was  "important in the past, but not now," and that it is "all right  to have it or do without it and to slacken or tighten efforts in  it." These are all wrong. United front work is our "magic  weapon" in the past and it is still so today. During the  democratic revolution period, our party was fairly weak and  small. We would be unable to win victory in the revolution if  we did not have the people's support and have so many people to  rally with us. At that time, united front work was a matter of  life and death and the people had a fuller understanding of it.  However, along with the victory in revolution, our strength  became stronger; we were in control of the political power; and  some comrades began to pay less attention to united front work.  This is very one-sided. Actually, during the period of  accelerating reform, opening up and economic development, we  need united front work and the new situation has also put  forward higher demands on united front work. The united front  is playing an important role in guaranteeing social stability  and economic construction, and its tasks are not lightened but  aggravated.    Chen Xitong called on party committees at all levels to  further enhance their understanding of the united front's  strategic status, strengthen the party's leadership over united  front work and include it on the agenda. We should pay  attention to making friends with people outside the party, do a  better job in implementing the system of multi-party cooperation  and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC,  formulate specific measures and open more channels for  democratic parties and people from various circles to  participate in the discussion of political affairs and give  democratic supervision; pay attention to absorbing people  outside the party to participate in the work of government  departments; support and help democratic parties to train  successors and solve some practical problems of democratic  parties and representative personages outside the party.  Meanwhile, we should realistically strengthen the building of  ranks of united front work cadres and of united front work  organs.    In his speech, Chen Xitong further stressed: To successfully  carry out united front work, we must deeply conduct  investigations and studies because only on this basis can we be  able to develop and blaze new trial in a better manner. To  judge the success or failure in united front work, we should see  whether we can unite with all the strength that can be united,  whether we can mobilize all positive factors and whether we have  made contributions to safeguarding stability and unity in the  country and the capital and realizing the goal of enabling  Beijing Municipality to become well-off three years ahead of  schedule.    At the conference, Shen Rendao, vice chairman of the  municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political  consultative Conference [CPPCC] and director of the United Front  Work Department of the municipal party committee, delivered a  work report, entitled: "Clearly Understand the New Situation,  Form a New Climate, and Make New Contributions To Realizing the  Goal of Achieving Stability and Development in the Capital and  Enabling It To Become Well-Off Three Years Ahead of Schedule,"  and made specific plans for implementing the guidelines of the  national united front work conference and further strengthening  the municipality's united front work.    Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee, presided over the conference and gave a summing-up  speech. He said: This conference is quite successful and the  participants have conscientiously implemented the guidelines of  the standing committee meeting of the municipal party committee.  Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as a guidance, unceasingly enhance our  understanding of the importance, strategic meaning,  inevitability and necessity of united front work are the  preconditions for successfully carrying out united front work  under the new situation. At present, the united front is facing  the new situation, new circumstances and new problems, and at  the same time, it is also facing very good opportunities. The  establishment of the socialist market economic system has opened  up a vast world for united front work and has instilled positive  factors into it. The broad masses of cadres on the united  front should have a sense of urgency, seize the opportunity,  put forward new ideas and create new experiences.    Li Zhijian demanded: After the conference, party committees  at all levels should propose specific opinions in line with the  reality of their own units; do practical things for the people  outside the party and exert efforts to solve their practical  problems; strengthen the building of united front work  departments and urge united front work cadres to strengthen  study, unceasingly raise their own quality and further create a  new situation in the united front work of Beijing Municipality.    Wang Daming, chairman of the municipal CPPCC Committee, gave  a speech on doing a better job in united front work.    Wang Tong, Yang Shichao, Qiang Wei, Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, He  Luli, Chen Dabai, Li Bokang and Zhu Zupu, and other leaders  attended the conference.</p>

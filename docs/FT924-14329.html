			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / House gloom deepens as prices fall by 3.1% THE CRISIS in the housing market deepened last month, with UK house prices falling on average by a record 3.1 per cent, Halifax, Britain's biggest building society said yesterday. The fall in prices was twice as large as any monthly drop since the society began publishing its house-price index in 1983. It was the third successive month in which prices fell. Halifax blamed the sharp decline on a bunching of sales in August, as buyers rushed to beat the deadline for the end of stamp duty concessions. It added that concern about rising unemployment and the state of the economy was continuing to sap confidence in spite of the reductions in mortgage interest rates announced after sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. The society said further cuts in interest rates were needed if confidence was to be restored. Government measures to boost the housing market would also be welcome. The figures for September are particularly disappointing, as sales normally pick up after the end of the school summer holidays. That failed to happen this year. Both sales and demand for mortgages - reflecting sales likely to be completed this month and next - fell sharply compared with September last year. Some estimates suggest that sales could have been as much as 40 per cent down on September last year. According to Halifax, the average price of a UK house fell by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 62,605 during the 12 months to the end of September. The biggest falls have been in southern England. In the past 12 months prices have fallen by 9.8 per cent in London, by 8.5 per cent in south-east England as a whole and by 6.8 per cent in south-west England and East Anglia. By comparison, prices in northern England have fallen by 1.2 per cent and prices in Scotland have risen by 0.3 per cent. An average house in Greater London, however, still costs Pounds 84,511 compared with Pounds 66,455 in south-west England; Pounds 60,579 in East Anglia; Pounds 61,608 in the West Midlands; Pounds 58,523 in north-west England; Pounds 62,643 in Scotland and Pounds 52,033 in Wales. 'This is extremely bad news,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He said the market trend was still 'sharply downwards' and that there was little prospect of a recovery before 1994 without the government providing 'a major fiscal 'kick-start' for the market to stop this perpetual decline'.

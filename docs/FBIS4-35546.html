			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent has learned that Egypt, in its  capacity as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM]  conference, is currently working to bring the views of Iraq and  Kuwait closer on the final statement of the conference, which  will be issued Friday [3 June]. The draft Egypt prepared is  based on Iraq's recognition of Kuwait, its sovereignty, its  safety, and its regional border. The draft also notes progress  in Iraq's position and the need to consider the suffering of the  Iraqi people.</p>

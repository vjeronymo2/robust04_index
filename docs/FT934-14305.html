			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Managers gloomy over recovery BRITAIN'S senior managers believe that the country is not yet out of recession and as many as two-thirds do not believe it will be over next year, Robert Taylor writes. This gloomy message is contained in the Institute of Management's latest survey of managerial opinion, published today. Mr Roger Young, the institute's director-general, yesterday said: 'It shows that managers have not registered recovery despite the government's claims.' As many as three out of four managers in the survey of 600 said they did not believe the recession would end in 1994 while only 3 per cent said it would be over by December this year. Sixty per cent said they thought Britain would dip into further recession during the course of next year. While 60 per cent of the sample said they had cut jobs, 41 per cent added they were giving top priority to keeping down the number of workers they employed. Unison, the public service union , said its latest jobwatch survey suggested as many as 20,000 jobs were at risk in the health service and local government sector.</p>

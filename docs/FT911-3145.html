			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: China may use Sydney as entrepot CHINA may use Sydney as an entrepot port for expanding trade with the island states of the South Pacific, Yvonne Preston reports from Peking. Li Lanqing, China's minister for foreign economic relations and trade, said yesterday that many Pacific island countries wanted to buy Chinese goods, but their small markets made direct trade difficult. In future, Australia could provide an entrepot trade point. Sydney could offer duty-free storage for Chinese products, enabling small orders to be shipped to Pacific customers from Australia, obviating the need for a direct trade relationship between China and the islands. The Chinese minister was speaking before talks with Senator Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister. Senator Evans, who has been visiting Peking to normalise post-Tiananmen relations, has now left China. During his two days there, he met Premier Li Peng, Jiang Zemin, China's Communist Party chief, and Qian Qichen, Peking's foreign minister, Nothing concrete had been decided about the entrepot proposal, Li reiterated, but the possibilities were being studied.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE SPRING FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> SCRIMMAGE DOMINATED BY DEFENSE  </P> <P> It is a sure bet that Joe Rice will never inspire comparisons to Jerry Rice,  but the Cal State Northridge receiver can at least say he was the most  impressive player on offense as the Matadors concluded spring drills with a  scrimmage Saturday night at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> That, however, is not saying much.  </P> <P> The defense, which was given points for interceptions, stopping first downs and  recovering fumbles, defeated the offense, 18-7.  </P> <P> A preview of things to come? Bob Burt, Northridge's coach, can half hope so.  Perhaps the defense will make a lot of teams look bad.  </P> <P> For now, attribute the Matadors' sluggishness on offense to jitters brought on  by a new quarterback -- Sherdrick Bonner -- at the helm.  </P> <P> And, perhaps more so, to the absence of four offensive linemen who are out for  the spring because of injury or temporary ineligibility.  </P> <P> That left Rice, a 5-foot-10, 168-pound junior, to impress. And he did just  that, catching five passes for 50 yards and the offense's only touchdown on a  17-yard pass from Bonner.  </P> <P> Burt said that Rice was one of a handful of players to "up their stock at bit"  on Saturday.  </P> <P> Rice, who has been to four colleges -- Pierce, Glendale, Cal State Long Beach  and CSUN -- since leaving Verdugo Hills High, seemed content with that  assessment afterward.  </P> <P> "I felt I had to really get out and prove myself," he said. "I'm just glad they  felt confident enough to give me a shot out there."  </P> <P> Bonner, who played caddy for Rob Huffman at quarterback the past two seasons,  completed 13 of 21 passes for 97 yards, but he threw two interceptions.  </P> <P> "There were some flashes of what we expect him to do," Burt said of Bonner.  </P> <P> The interceptions -- by Ed Mitchell and Baron Atkinson -- came on back-to-back  passes.  </P> <P> "It always looks like the quarterback's fault, but there were some routes that  weren't right," Burt said.  </P> <P> Greg Bratten, the No. 2 man on the quarterback depth chart, completed eight of  12 passes for 68 yards, and Chris Folsom was two of eight for 12 yards with an  interception.  </P> <P> Asked if he was concerned about the prospect of entering the season without an  experienced backup at quarterback, Burt was polite.  </P> <P> "I know one thing," he said. "If Sherdrick is not in there sometime this  season, we're definitely going to run it down their throats until they stop  it."  </P> <P> A ringing endorsement it was not.  </P> <P> A lighter and stronger player will be starting at tailback for the Matadors  when they open the season Sept. 2 at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> No, Albert Fann, a two-time All-Western Football Conference selection, has not  been replaced. But he has shed 12 pounds from last season's playing weight.  </P> <P> Fann, a junior, played at 225 pounds last season but plans to stay between 210  and 215 this fall.  </P> <P> "I'm so light it feels weird," Fann said. "I'm a lot faster because I'm still  used to carrying all that weight.  </P> <P> "Actually, I'm stronger, too, because I get more forward motion going."  </P> <P> Fann, who gained 973 yards last season, will work out under the supervision of  a personal trainer this summer.  </P> <P> A sprained left foot cut short Fann's participation in Saturday's scrimmage. He  carried four times for nine yards and caught one pass for two yards.  </P></p>

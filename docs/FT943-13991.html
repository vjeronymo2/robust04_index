			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G Any disappointment the market felt about the High Court judgment blocking Lloyds' bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has proved short lived. C&amp;G's confident assertion that it could find an alternative means of consumating its takeover cheered investors yesterday. But the 4 per cent rise in Lloyds' shares seemed a touch excessive given the market had long assumed the deal would succeed. HSBC's strong showing and a general bounce in the banking sector may have been the more influential cause of Lloyds' buoyancy. As yet, there is little clue how C&amp;G will proceed. But the building society did stop opening new accounts with voting rights soon after the judgment. One way to get around the judgment would simply be to wait until all members qualified to vote by having their accounts open for two years. But the talk of concluding a deal by mid-August suggests that C&amp;G may have devised a more elegant solution. The details of the deal will make little difference to Lloyds. It has put Pounds 1.8bn on the table and is only likely to change the form, not the substance, of its offer. It would perhaps be better to defer payments as long as possible rather than paying the full amount up-front. But either way, the differences are marginal. Other banks with designs on building societies will be keen to learn C&amp;G's secret formula. But whether it makes sense for them to follow suit is debatable. The remaining targets seem less attractive than C&amp;G. The take-out prices are likely to be steeper.</p>

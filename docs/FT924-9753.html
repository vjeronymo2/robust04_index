			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / High road costs criticised THE DEPARTMENT of Transport ends up paying an average of 28 per cent more on road contracts than the price originally agreed, according to a report published today by the National Audit Office. The report catalogues a series of cases where costs have been pushed up for the department by factors such as unforeseen ground conditions, changes to designs and outright errors. In one case a road bridge was designed without enough headroom for trains passing underneath. The road had to be raised after work on the bridge started. Total costs resulting from the bungle were Pounds 70,000 for the extra work. It also led to a claim of Pounds 350,000 from the contractor for delays and disruption, and an estimated Pounds 450,000 in the cost of delays to road users. The report says the final cost of government road contracts will almost always be higher than the tender price because civil engineering work is unpredictable. The Transport Department accepts the risks of unforeseen alterations rather than requiring contractors to price for all possible risks. The audit office, however, says the overruns are much greater than they should be. The department set itself a target of reducing average increases from 18 per cent in 1985-86 to 15 per cent in 1988-89. Instead, the figure rose to 28 per cent and continued at that level in 1990-91. The audit office says the department has paid close attention to reducing the risk of collusion between tendering companies and has made substantial efforts to ensure fair competition.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (10): Bamburi's profits reinforced Amid the near-continuous and deafening noise of the kilns and grinders, there is suddenly an unusual silence at the Bamburi cement plant. A power cut has halted the heavy machinery. Periodic failures in the supply are a costly, frustrating and frequent problem for the factory, which consumes the largest single share - up to 5 per cent - of Kenya's electricity generation capacity. However, Robert Brenneisen, managing director of Bamburi Portland Cement, who joined the company at its creation in 1954, is more optimistic than he was during the previous decade. He welcomes a series of radical economic reforms that have improved its ability to make a profit in the past three years. The company was formed as a joint venture of Cementia Holding of Switzerland and Amalgamated Roadstone of the UK, which was replaced in 1964 by Blue Circle. The government holds 16 per cent of the equity through the National Social Security Fund, and a further 10 per cent is quoted on the Nairobi stock exchange. It now produces 1.2m tonnes a year, much of which is sold locally, and the rest exported to countries including Mauritius, Reunion, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles. 'We were suffering for many years from price control,' says Mr Brenneisen. He points to a six-inch-thick pile of documents on the shelf behind his desk. 'All these are submissions to the government to raise prices or remove price control.' Price control was introduced in 1972, and for several years the cap increased in line with rising costs. But by the early 1980s, the rises came too late and too small. 'We were subsidising the building industry for years but it nearly crippled the company,' says Mr Brenneisen. 'We only just survived. It was only possible because we had very tolerant shareholders.' The controls were finally lifted three years ago, and he says the company has since been investing in capital expenditure and paying off its debts to make good the losses of the 1980s. In comparison, Bamburi's other difficulties are more trivial. Like many others, the company has benefited from the removal of restrictions on holding foreign currency. Since it constructed its own port facility and has staff working full-time on customs clearance, it has had less trouble than many in handling imports and exports. However, Mr Brenneisen still raises concerns over delays until recently in granting import licences and duties. 'As a business we are impatient with the parastatals,' he says. 'We like to see things done yesterday. They take their business with a far too casual stride. They can't use excuses all the time.' The company has struggled to obtain sufficient rolling stock for internal transport of its cement from Kenya Railways, and has had to ship some cement at greater cost by road. It has also suffered from a lack of fresh water as a result of drought. Given an abundant supply of low-cost, motivated labour, the company has not seen the need to invest heavily in automated processes. It employs about 870 staff, although a similar capacity plant in Europe could do the same job with about 150. Mr Brenneisen says: 'The factory compares very well in performance with any in the world. We feel it is not morally justified to automate.'</p>

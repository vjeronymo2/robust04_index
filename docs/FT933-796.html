			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Sutherland warns of farm reforms impasse MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, damped hopes yesterday of any early solution to the critical dispute between the European Community and the US which threatens world trade reforms. Mr Sutherland said an attempt by the EC at French insistence to amend the Blair House accord reached last November on agriculture between the EC and the US had created 'an impasse to which a clear solution is not apparent'. A crucial aspect of the accord envisages a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised EC food exports over the next six years. Mr Sutherland, speaking after addressing the International Monetary Fund interim committee in Washington, said the dispute was among issues that could wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, are to discuss the dispute in Washington today. It arose after France called for further 'clarifications' to the accord. Mr Sutherland, who called for a renewal of the commitment by 116 countries involved in the Uruguay Round to cut tariffs, added that 'it is our job' to find a solution to the Blair House dispute. Mr Sutherland's remarks came as the World Bank disclosed the findings of a study which concluded that the partial trade liberalisation envisaged under the Uruguay Round could add Dollars 213bn a year to world income by 2002.

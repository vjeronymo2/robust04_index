			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Northern Electric prices rise NORTHERN Electric, the regional electricity company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, will increase its prices by an average 2.6 per cent from April 1, it said yesterday. The increase, well below the forecast rate of inflation, is likely to satisfy Offer, the industry watchdog which in October warned Northern and six other companies that it thought they were overcharging customers and might have to make refunds. Northern said the increases - 3 per cent for domestic customers, 1.9 per cent for small commercial and industrial customers and 1.2 per cent for larger customers - were well below its forecasts for inflation of 4.2 per cent for the year to October. Offer said Northern's increases, the first to be announced by a regional company this year, looked encouraging. However, it will check to ensure Northern is within the inflation-linked formula regulating price rises.</p>

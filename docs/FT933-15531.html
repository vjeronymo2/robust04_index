			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Warburg's war game for BT3: The launch of the global bookbuilding exercise It is a far cry from the world of the bumbling Inspector Morose. The SG Warburg machinery, clicking into place for the worldwide sale of the UK government's remaining 22 per cent stake in British Telecommunications, is highly computerised and, according to its operators, better oiled than anything which has gone before. Today, SG Warburg, co-ordinator for the third and last sale of the government's shares, launches the US-style 'bookbuilding' operation to collect investors' bids for the shares and help establish the selling price. Warburg concedes that there are few innovations in the bookbuilding technique, which has already proved itself in BT2 and in the Wellcome Trust's sale of its stake in Wellcome Plc. But it does offer refinements on the syndication procedure and new software, which Warburg says will simplify the process and save money on administration. Unlike BT2 and the Wellcome deal, the sale of BT3 shares does not involve a series of syndicates selling to designated geographic regions. Instead, there are 11 global managers who are free to market to any of 473 so-called 'exempt' institutional investors. These are large investors who have internationally diversified portfolios and were probably purchasers of, or bidders for, shares in the BT2 offering. Separately, three regional syndicates cover Japan, North America and the rest of the world. These may solicit bids from investors not on the exempt list. Each syndicate will submit bids directly to computers located in Warburg's war-room, on the sixth floor of the merchant bank's Broadgate headquarters. The room contains three sets of desks representing each region, a series of terminals on each, a television screen of the type used for viewing sporting events in a local pub and a fully stocked refrigerator. The room will be staffed around the clock, with staff putting in 12-hour shifts until July 19 when allocations will be announced. Mr Maurice Thompson, director of equity syndication at SG Warburg Securities, says the software can instantly produce colour graphics offering snapshots of the bidding process by region. 'People can take it home for bedtime reading.' Another advance is the commission structure. The commission to global co-ordinators could be worth around Pounds 40m on the basis of is 1 per cent of the sum raised, with 20 per cent of that distributed on an agreed basis. However, unlike previous global tender offers, the remaining 80 per cent will go to whichever of the global co-ordinators the investors select, rather to the firms that booked the orders. Mr Thompson says this tactic will make it easier for investors to spread the commission among the various firms which aided them in the bidding process. Mr Rory Tapner, director of Warburg Securities, concedes it is possible that investors unhappy with Warburg's tactics in the offering may choose to punish the firm by ensuring that it does not get its share of their commission. If that is the case, he insists there will be no retaliation in the number of shares awarded. 'Designation will not affect allocation,' he says. The ability of clients to split commission is aimed at motivating firms to encourage bidding, even when it is not clear they will earn direct remuneration. The aim of the bookbuilding is to achieve the highest price for the shares, while ensuring that those who bought them do not immediately dump them. Indeed, the vigour with which Warburg has pursued this goal has attracted howls of outrage from UK institutional investors. Warburg had said that in the allocation period, it would reward those who had bought shares in the run-up to the bidding process and penalise those who had sold them. To this end, it asked the London Stock Exchange in June to 'recommend' that dealings in BT3 shares in the run-up to allocation be for cash settlement rather than the two-week account period. Such a move would allow Warburg to know within two days who had bought and sold shares. After vigorous institutional protest, the exchange backed down on plans to concede to the request. It instead decided to require all deals involving more than 100,000 shares to be reported to it. Mr Tapner insists the request was only aimed at helping the firm to reward buyers. Investors will now be asked to sign a form confirming to the UK Treasury that they in fact own as many shares as they claim to on the BT3 bidding form. But he admits the request did reflect the experience of Robert Fleming, global co-ordinator of last summer's Wellcome sale, which saw the Wellcome share price plummet by nearly one-third in the run-up to the bidding process. A stock exchange review found that some investors had sold Wellcome shares short just days before bidding closed, driving prices down. Perhaps the true test of Warburg's success will come after trading begins. In this 'stabilisation' period, those who bought shares for a quick profit will sell them, forcing Warburg to support the price by buying them back.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BT3: The Countdown  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Today:           SG Warburg begins bookbuilding July 14:         1st tender - deadline for discounted offer to UK retail                  clients July 16:         2nd tender - deadline for institutional bids July 17/18:      Global managers meet to decide pricing and share                  allocations July 18/19:      Provisional allocation, Sunday; confirmation 6am                  Monday July 19:         Trading begins  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

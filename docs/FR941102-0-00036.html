These rules also implement section 321 of the Riegle Act, which amends the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to authorize the Board to shorten the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers (during which time the United States Attorney General may review the competitive effects of a proposal approved by the Board) from 30 to 15 days with the consent of the United States Attorney General. Because the procedures prescribed by section 319 and section 321 are effective immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will take effect immediately. The Board is seeking comments on this interim rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The Board also is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden associated with its application and notice procedures, and invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim Rule effective on November 2, 1994; comments must be received by December 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0853 and may be mailed to William W.

Section 319 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;325, section 319, 108 Stat. 2160, 2224 (1994)(``Section 319'')) amends section 3 of the BHC Act to establish a notice procedure for the formation of a new bank holding company resulting from a corporate reorganization that involves substantially the same shareholders. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In connection with section 319, section 320 of the Riegle Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for securities issued by a bank holding company pursuant to such a reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 319 also amends section 5(d)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(3))_commonly referred to as the ``Oakar Amendment''_to eliminate the requirement for prior Board approval of transactions by banks owned by holding companies to merge with thrift institutions. Under the Riegle Act, Oakar transactions continue to require the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the acquiring institution, and all Oakar transactions must comply with section 3(d) of the BHC Act, the ``Douglas Amendment.'' No amendments to the Board's regulations are needed to implement these amendments to section 5(d)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, section 321 of the Riegle Act (Pub.

The interim rule implement the provisions enacted in sections 319 and 321 of the Riegle Act. Comment is invited on all aspects of these proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Formation of a New Bank Holding Company Under Section 319  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By its terms, the notice procedure added by section 319 <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  applies only if certain conditions are met.

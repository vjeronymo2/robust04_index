			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING;  </P> <P> CHAOS AT START OF THE RACE TO CABO SAN LUCAS  </P> <P> Aggressive sailing in light, five-knot winds led to a chaotic start for the big  boats in the 13th biennial Long Beach-to-Cabo San Lucas race Saturday.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Yacht Club set a 3,000-foot-long line for the 24 boats, but  several bunched up at the favored pin (left) end. Mitchell Rouse's Taxi Driver  from LBYC brushed Peter Tong's Lady Godiva, which indicated that it will file a  protest.  </P> <P> Pat Farrah's Blondie (LBYC) was pushed over early and had to re-start, as did  Bob Doughty's Evolution from the California Yacht Club and Mongoose from San  Francisco.  </P> <P> As the confusion cleared, Les George's My Obsession II from Oceanside Yacht  Club had the early lead in the 820-mile event.  </P> <P> Among the eight smaller boats that started at noon Friday, Bruce Anderson's AND  36 Chicken Lips from Shoreline Yacht Club was reported at 8 a.m. Saturday to be  only 87 miles out in three knots of southeast wind on glassy seas.  </P> <P> Warren Rosendale's Bandit was two miles back.  </P> <P> The fleet must finish by noon Saturday to make the race official.  </P></p>

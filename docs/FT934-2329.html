			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (6): Scots are squeezed - A golden jubilee north of the border The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is celebrating 50 years of activity co-ordinating and supporting the work of charities north of the border. 'Fifty years on, many issues remain remarkably unchanged,' comments Mr Martin Sime, the council's director, in its golden jubilee report. Many items on the list of issues that half a century has failed to change are summed up by Mr Sime in the words 'inadequate funding.' Scottish charities, like those elsewhere in the UK, have recently been affected by the impact of the recession on individual and corporate donations and the continuing squeeze on public spending. But there are factors that place particular financial pressures on the Scottish voluntary sector. While some household name organisations like Barnardos and National Children's Home operate on both sides of the border, many other large charities do not. Most of Scotland's charities are purely Scottish based. This almost invariably makes them smaller than their English counterparts - and size is an important component of success in modern charity fundraising. Charities Aid Foundation figures show that, while the top 200 fundraising charities increased their income last year, smaller ones suffered a drop. Only a handful of specifically Scottish charities are in the top 200. The problem for the Scottish voluntary sector of charitable fundraising being dominated by big names is compounded by the fact that, although many of the largest charities do not provide services outside England and Wales, their advertising campaigns still attract funds from Scottish donors. There have even been examples of Scottish financial institutions entering sponsorship deals with charities that do not operate in Scotland. Scottish voluntary sector leaders believe that it is insufficiently appreciated that many 'national' charities do not cover the whole UK, and that this also affects the level of support Scotland receives from London-based corporate head offices and grant-making trusts. Less than 5 per cent of grant money from trusts goes to Scottish causes. The 1992 Charities Act does not apply in Scotland, where the sector is less rigidly regulated, and the powers of the Charity Commissioners do not extend there. There is anxiety that this may be about to lead to dubious fundraisers turning their attentions on Scotland. 'We are particularly worried about the abuse of telephone fundraising, which the act has tightened up in England and Wales,' said Mr Sime. 'There will be an enormous temptation for unscrupulous fundraisers operating in England to simply dial Scottish numbers instead.' While there are doubts among managers of Scottish charities about the appropriateness of importing the Charity Commission model from England, worries about the adequacy of Scottish charity law has prompted an SCVO campaign for a better regulatory framework. Voluntary organisations provide a third of all training for the unemployed in Scotland, while 840 local voluntary sector projects are funded through the government's Urban Programme. This makes public funds particularly important to the sector. Although the Scottish Urban Programme is not being run down - as in England and Wales - there are fears that money from its Pounds 80m annual budget will in future be diverted from supporting local anti-poverty and economic development projects to housing and other purely physical redevelopment activities. Without the strong social dimension that voluntary organisations can provide, argues the sector, physical regeneration cannot achieve its full potential. Voluntary sector leaders are also concerned about the likely impact of local government reorganisation in Scotland, with the proposed abolition of the big regional councils. They seek transitional financial protection for regional voluntary organisations likely to face loss of funds and closure. Scottish voluntary sector leaders share many common concerns with their colleagues elsewhere in the UK. These include worries about the extent to which the national lottery might undermine donations to established charities. 'Will there be much competition if someone is selling lottery tickets and someone else is shaking a tin?' says Mr Sime. 'And the reality is that the Treasury will take twice as much in tax out of the lottery as charities will get from their share of its gross income.' A shared source of anger throughout the UK is over the weakening of charities' finances by having to pay VAT. Throughout this year's Edinburgh International Festival volunteers from the Waverley Care Trust collected money for its Milestone House Aids hospice. They raised around Pounds 5,000  -the same amount as the hospice's costs will rise by having to pay VAT on fuel bills. A third area of concern, particularly strong in the relatively small Scottish fundraising economy, involves the extent to which high-profile one-off appeals distort public giving to the detriment of other charities. One such appeal, for a children's hospital, raised Pounds 11m and another for a children's hospice has now been launched with a Pounds 10m target. 'People are obviously entitled to give to whatever causes they choose, and there is no certainty that money donated to big, highly-publicised appeals would go to other causes,' said Mr Sime. 'But the voluntary sector has to try to find ways of encouraging donors, particularly statutory funders and grant making trusts, to become more strategic in their funding.' Some of the questions raised in the SCVO's jubilee report would not have been recognisable as issues to the council's founders 50 years ago. Is there a definition of the voluntary sector that can embrace all the new agencies, like trust hospitals, as well as traditional bodies? Can the sector at one and the same time serve the purposes of government and maintain its independence? They are reminders of the extent to which the voluntary sector, in Scotland and the rest of the UK, is undergoing a period of rapid challenge and change.</p>

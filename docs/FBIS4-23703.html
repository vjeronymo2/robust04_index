			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- Deputy President F W de  Klerk said on Friday [10 June] that after he had been given  certain assurances by President Nelson Mandela he was convinced  the government would be able to reach consensus on the issue of  amnesty and indemnity for political crimes committed in the  past. In response to questions at a press conference at the  World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he said the  proposed "truth commission" as announced this week by the  Minister of Justice Dullah Omar had not been "agreed- upon  policy". He, Mr de Klerk, had not been consulted about the  announcement. But ministers in the government of national unity  had been charged with looking at the matter from all angles and  had to "come up with a co-ordinated approach".    Mr de Klerk said Mr Omar's announcement should be seen as  "part of growing pains", but it should be remembered that Mr  Omar had said he was putting on the table a basic approach. Mr  Omar had made it clear a final decision would be taken only  after all views had been gathered and presented to the  government. It was not a sign of tension in the government, Mr  de Klerk said.    Mr Omar had also said in Parliament that the government was  not looking for a witch-hunt or Nuremburg-style trials.    Mr de Klerk said he had spoken "cursorally" to Mr Mandela  and  Mr Mandela had given him certain assurances about details "which  convinces me we will be able to reach some kind of consensus on  this issue".    Mr de Klerk said he would be telling a WEF open session on  Friday night that South Africa's past would have to be dealt  with in such a way that "we don't get involved in vendettas and  witch-hunts".    Asked about possible pitfalls, Mr de Klerk said a truth  commission would not promote reconciliation if double standards  were applied. But he did not wish to enter into a debate  through the media while negotiations on the issue were under way.    "Whatever is decided must promote reconciliation."</p>

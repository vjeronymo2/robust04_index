			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Bank goes to bat for Taiwan: The mixing of banking with diplomacy Mixing banking with diplomacy may seem a curious enterprise but for ChinaTrust Commercial Bank, but it has to be done. Controlled by one of Taiwan's wealthiest and most influential families, the island's biggest privately-owned bank is building an international presence by dovetailing its strategy to become a 'global Chinese bank' with the isolated government's efforts to improve its relations with foreign countries. Just 29 mostly small nations now recognise Taipei instead of Beijing, rivals since 1949. To begin with, ChinaTrust plans a network stretching from South America to the Indian subcontinent and from London to Jakarta. It will later aim to widen its reach to South Africa, Russia, Australia, Canada, Mexico and eastern Europe. By the end of the year, ChinaTrust expects to open branches in Hong Kong, New Delhi and Paraguay. Soon thereafter it plans to set up representative offices in Hanoi and Tokyo, buy into joint venture banks in Indonesia and the Philippines, apply to open a branch in New York, and apply to open offshore banking units in Thailand and Malaysia. The bank has five representative offices - in London, Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok and Hong Kong - and recently established a securities company in London. 'Our mission is not just to make profits, but also to play a quasi-diplomatic role,' concedes Mr Wu Ching-mai, senior executive vice-president in charge of international banking. 'Of course, Taiwan's efforts to gain recognition internationally was one of the important original motivations behind our overseas expansion, but at the same time it makes good business sense.' Cosy ties between business and government are common in Taiwan, but ChinaTrust's owners, the Koo family, are especially entwined with the governing Nationalist party. The clan patriarch and head of the family's diversified business interests, Mr Koo Chen-fu, chairs the Straits Exchange Foundation, a nominally private organisation that conducts Taipei's arm's-length political dialogue with Beijing begun in April 1993. He is also a member of the ruling party's central committee. His nephew and ChinaTrust's chairman, Mr Jeffrey Koo, doubles as an unofficial ambassador-at-large for Taiwan in part through his role as head of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce. The foreign ministry allocates funds to support Mr Koo's quasi-diplomatic endeavours, which include meetings with heads of state and other political figures whom Taiwan's leaders are unable to see because of China's objections. 'As Taiwan is severely limited in its official relationships,' says Mr Parris Chang, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive party and a member on the foreign affairs committee of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament, 'you find that Taiwanese businessmen often have more clout and much better access than government officials. For many years, CF Koo served as Taipei's unofficial foreign minister, and Jeffrey has inherited this role from his uncle.' Seen as one of the few Taiwanese banks with the potential to become a truly international bank, ChinaTrust recently retained Mr Samuel Hsieh, who finished a term as governor of Taiwan's central bank at the end of May, to help the bank consolidate its international links. ChinaTrust's strong push into south-east Asia is designed to complement the government's 'Go South' policy, an effort to divert Taiwanese investment flows away from China and into south-east Asia. President Lee Teng-hui added impetus to the initiative with his 'vacation diplomacy' tour of several countries in the region earlier this year. Taiwanese investment in China has surged in recent years to an estimated USDollars 20bn, and Taipei fears becoming economically dependent on China. 'Our philosophy is to become a global Chinese bank, meaning we will serve markets where there are Chinese communities and Chinese investment,' says Mr Wu. 'Taiwanese companies tend to be unknown quantities outside Taiwan so they can't get banking services in many countries. We can help them facilitate business by taking collateral here in Taiwan.' India is the one exception. 'We're going there because it's a place where we think Chinese ought to go, and we're confident they will, now that India has decided to open its economy,' Mr Wu says. 'In all other instances, we're following our clients.' Taiwan has opened a trade office in the Indian capital, and India is expected to open a similar office in Taipei soon. The bank's planned branch in Paraguay is not as improbable as it may appear at first glance. The Taiwan government is assiduously courting Asuncion with offers of economic assistance, and ChinaTrust's presence should bolster reportedly wobbly ties with the only government in South America to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taipei. 'There's a strong desire on the part of both governments to increase the flow of Taiwanese investment into the country,' says Mr Wu. 'As well, we feel Latin America is changing for the better. There are a lot of Chinese immigrants in the region, and we want to use Paraguay as a regional centre from which to look at Brazil, Argentina and Chile.' ChinaTrust's strength is likely to be in Asia, where Taiwan is becoming an important provider of both investment and, increasingly, debt financing capital. Taiwanese banks are beginning to join syndicated loans and will play a role in regional debt issues as capital markets become more developed. Trade flows are following investment flows in Asia, where Taiwan is already the second or third largest foreign investor in many countries and the biggest investor in Vietnam. 'I think you'll begin to see business groups from across the region teaming up to invest in third countries,' says Mr Wu. 'It's all about sharing risks. That's how Taiwan's industry was built.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The government should in  principle give the postal savings system full discretion over  the investment of postal savings funds, a study group for the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] said Friday [24  June].    The proposal takes aim at the existing rules that require a  large portion of the funds to go to the Finance Ministry's Trust  Fund Bureau which uses it to finance public works projects, a  practice that results in a limited return.    Under an agreement between the two ministries, the remaining  portion of the funds is invested largely in public bonds at the  postal ministry's discretion.    The study group, in a report presented to the director  general of the Postal Savings Bureau, said the government should  shift its policy on postal funds from the current rigid one to  one allowing the Postal Ministry basic discretion over how to  invest the funds.    It said the amount of postal savings funds to be entrusted  to  the Trust Fund Bureau should be determined on the basis of  funding needs for public works projects instead of entrusting  all of the funds to it first.    Among other proposals, the report gives high marks to one  put  forward by some economists that public entities issue bonds for  postal savings funds instead of borrowing funds from the Trust  Fund Bureau as at present.    The Trust Fund Bureau lends such funds using postal savings  funds entrusted by the Postal Ministry.    The report is in line with a persistent call from the Postal  Ministry to the Finance Ministry to expand the scope of its  discretionary investment of postal savings funds.    But the report has drawn a quick, cool response from the  finance ministry. "It embodies the desire of the postal savings  system to become a huge institutional investor. Nobody will  understand it," a Finance Ministry official said.    In fiscal 1993, that ended March 31, postal savings funds  subject to the Postal Ministry's discretionary investment  totaled 4.75 trillion yen.    The sum of such funds is to increase to 5 trillion yen from  fiscal 1994 through 1996 under an agreement already reached  between the two ministries.</p>

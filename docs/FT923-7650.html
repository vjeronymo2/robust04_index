			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Rao urges freeze on discussing 'divisive' issues THE Indian prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, has urged all political parties to agree to a 'three-year moratorium on divisive issues' in the interests of the 'co-ordinated development' of the country. In an Independence Day address, Mr Rao was in effect asking for a freeze on any debate on the key issues confronting his government. Referring to the Ayodhya temple dispute which threatened his government's authority in July, Mr Rao suggested that a grand Hindu temple be constructed without destroying the 16th-century mosque, built on a site claimed by Hindu militants to be the birthplace of Lord Ram. On Kashmir, Mr Rao said the state was an indivisible part of India, and 'no force on earth' could separate the two. The prime minister reiterated his government's commitment to punish the guilty in the Bombay financial scandal, and to see through economic reforms. Opposition parties have not responded favourably to his unusual suggestion that all 'dispute and dissention' be shelved for three years. Mr Lal Krishen Advani, the leader of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), yesterday opposed the move to stop public debate on controversial issues, and demanded that the prime minister clarify what he meant by a 'moratorium'. 'Let them have a moratorium on violence, terrorism, or political corruption,' said the BJP leader, who is head of the opposition in parliament. He said the prime minister's suggestion would mean a breakdown of democracy. Mr Somnath Chatterjee, leader of the Communist party (Marxist), described the prime minister's call as 'an excuse' to prevent people from raising uncomfortable issues.</p>

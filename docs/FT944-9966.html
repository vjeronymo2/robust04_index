			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Spying tonight - chefs' secrets / Nicholas Lander swaps information with French cook Alain Ducasse Although the fall of the Iron Curtain has brought an end to the careers of many a James Bond, spying - eating in your competitors' restaurants, trying to squeeze trade secrets out of suppliers or kitchen staff keen to move on - is still endemic in the restaurant industry. The Inland Revenue accepts it as part of a restaurateur's job, allowing 50 per cent of the cost of a meal taken not for pleasure but for education as a legitimate business expense, providing it is accompanied by a written restaurant report. Last month, London, in particular Knightsbridge, were subjected to an intense 48-hour spying mission conducted by Alain Ducasse, chef of the Louis XV restaurant in the Hotel du Paris, Monaco and, at 37, the youngest of France's 19 three-star Michelin chefs. Ducasse has been hired as consultant chef to a new club which will open on Sloane Street in late spring 1995. His job includes designing and equipping the kitchen; writing the menus; hiring kitchen staff; and, most importantly, responsibility for the presentation, cooking and look of the food served in the restaurant and bar. Before this trip Ducasse had spent only nine days in Britain. During the mid-1970s he had been a commis chef at The Bell Inn, Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. His memories are of wonderful ingredients, invariably overcooked, and of thick fog, which swiftly drove him back to France. Ducasse embarked on a series of culinary 'stages', most significantly with Alain Chapel at Mionnay. In August 1984, flying with other chefs to a business meeting in Courchevel, Ducasse was the sole survivor when an aircraft crashed into a mountain. He waited 10 hours for the rescue team. This experience has left him assured of his own skills and right to succeed but, at the same time, humble enough to recognise the thin line between success and oblivion. It was this humility which brought us together. Ducasse phoned me to ask whether I would arrange and chaperone him on his first visit to London. In return, he suggested, I should come out to Monaco, eat his food and meet his suppliers. We met and ate in what Ducasse calls his 'Aquarium', a cubicle just big enough for a small dining table and four chairs with glass sliding doors that looks out on to his immaculate kitchen. As we sat and talked, Ducasse watched as Laurent, his experienced sous-chef, took the 21-strong brigade through a busy service. Transfixed by the speed and elegance of a disciplined kitchen brigade, I ate superbly. The highlights were a delicate, creamy pheasant soup with chestnuts and a line-caught turbot cooked en cocotte with glistening ceps. The following morning, I met the unsung stars of Ducasse's kitchen: Rene Schmidt who, with his wife, picks fraises de bois every morning between 6am and 9am in a particular micro-climate along the hills above Nice and then delivers them to the top restaurants of the area; Madame Paulette Stropiana who, every morning, single-handedly (her husband does not like goats) milks 21 goats and then makes the most delicious chevre in a bergerie without electricity - it is so isolated that the cheeses have to be brought down by donkey; and finally, Philippe Catananzi, who displayed his fruit and vegetables and proudly told me that tomorrow a similar consignment would be sent via Nice and Geneva airports to the restaurants and hotels of Hong Kong. Ducasse acknowledged that creating a network of such suppliers could not happen immediately and understood when I explained that his first visit would just give him an overview of the best of British produce. Sandwiched between site meetings with builders, Ducasse's itinerary included: visits to Harrods' and Harvey Nichols' food halls; Soho's Chinatown; a 4.30am start to see Smithfield, Billingsgate and Covent Garden; a view of the game on offer at R. Allen &amp; Co, Mayfair, and tastings of wild Scottish smoked salmon, Morecambe Bay potted shrimps and the best breads baked in London. He found a late afternoon cheese tasting at Neal's Yard in Covent Garden exciting. Eating a couple of English apples from the Neal's Yard display, he drooled with pleasure over Colston Bassett stilton, Cheshire, Keen's Cheddar and a sheep's milk cheese called Emlett. He returned again and again to taste the unpasteurised Jersey double cream produced by SE Lane &amp; Partners, of Kent which, he was forced to admit, was better than anything he could buy in France. Restaurant espionage took place over lunch at Marco Pierre White's The Restaurant, where Ducasse was impressed by the technical excellence of the young British brigade. Dinner was eaten at Bibendum where the quality of the main course and wine list were only surpassed by the dessert - an old-fashioned steamed ginger pudding. This, Ducasse admitted, as he scraped the plate clean 'is the kind of dessert I have no idea how to make' while making a note to write to the chef, Simon Hopkinson, for the recipe. Finally, to lunch at Sally Clarke's restaurant in Kensington Church Street, west London, where Ducasse could see the same quality of vegetables and salads that he buys in France: delicious salad leaves and herbs from Halcyon Herbs, Oxfordshire and perfectly cooked Linzer Delicatesse potatoes grown by Adrian Barran in Suffolk. A novel gastronomic experience was a sampling of homemade oatmeal biscuits. Ducasse found them so impressive he ordered an extra helping. Ducasse left for Heathrow as a British holidaymaker leaves France - with a shopping bag full of food. But, instead of saucisson, baguettes and fromages, his bag contained cuts of Scottish beef, pots of Jersey double cream, oatmeal biscuits and Hopkinson's book Roast Chicken and Other Stories.

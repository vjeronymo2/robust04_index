			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION: BEYOND BASIC BLACK;  </P> <P> ACTOR RAY LIOTTA SHOWS THAT GOOD GUYS DON'T ALWAYS WEAR WHITE  </P> <P> Black shirts, the kind that give a man an air of intrigue, are under  reconstruction. Far from "basic," the new models have so many extras they make  the others look as plain as starter homes. There's the playful black shirt with  silver airplanes for buttons; the fancy-front model with black satin braid; the  romantic rendition covered with red roses. This new development in menswear has  a counterpart of sorts in home furniture. Consider an armchair made of  corrugated cardboard. Designed by architect Frank Gehry, it has all the  features of the greats from the past: round, rolling arms, an ample back and a  deep, roomy feeling. But there's no mistaking Gehry's model for a chair from  another era. The "Sherman," pictured here, is like this season's shirts. It  moves a classic design into modern times.  </P> <P> Grooming: Victor Vidal / Cloutier; stylist: Joanna Dendel  </P></p>

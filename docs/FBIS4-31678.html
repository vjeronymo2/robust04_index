			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by David M. Fistrovic: "The Croats Are Building on </F> Their Land!"]    [Text] Today, the Croatian metropolis and the first among  the Croats will receive the President of the Republic of  Slovenia Milan Kucan. The Slovene is coming for the sake of  bilateral relations and most probably also to discuss  Croat-Slovene border-dispute, nuclear power plant, Ljubljanska  Banka, and a series of other unsolved problems burdening  relations between the two young countries. He stated for  Slovene Television he was meeting the Croatian president to  personally protest about the border crossing in Istria, the one  in Secovlje. The Croats are allegedly building the border  crossing on disputed territory that belongs to Slovenia, and the  Slovenes have already filed a protest about it and threatened to  strain relations and spread the malice in the media (the Slovene  foreign minister had managed to halt the construction of that  border crossing once but not for good). The Slovene president  will most probably bring up the question of some allegedly  Slovene villages on the left bank of the Dragonja (Skodelin,  Buzin) which did not participate in the last elections in  Slovenia and which raised an incredible amount of dust in  Slovensko Primorje. The inhabitants of those villages were not  on the election lists and a part of the Slovene press considered  this to be a betrayal of national interests. Croatian Istria,  keenly interested in the controversial border crossing and the  said villages, calmly stood by watching the euphoria on the  other side of the Dragonja, expecting Kucan's visit to Croatia,  hoping that the Croatian president would tell him how the  Istrians feel.    On what grounds and with how much right will Kucan cite some  facts from Istria directly to his host? It is more likely that  the Slovene will spend more time talking about his (i.e.  Slovene) delusions than about actual rights at the delta of the  Dragonja and villages like Skodelin and Buzin. Those villages  and the Dragonja River are undoubtedly on Croatian territory.  The Istrians have known that from time immemorial and it was  also recently proved by Ljubo Boban, who has been researching  the history and the circumstances of the Croat-Slovene border in  Istria after World War II.    What, then, do those new documents say about the land on  which Croatia is building one of its most beautiful entrances to  Istria and about villages that did not go to latest elections in  Slovenia?    Some 20 documents that Boban presented to the Croatian State  Commission for Borders give Mr. Tudjman the right to reject all  the territorial demands of his guest and ask several very  unpleasant questions (about returning land registers which are  presently in Piran, moving the Dragonja River, or about the  arrogation of the river's delta). The Croat can tell his  Slovene counterpart with a clear conscience that, by requesting  that Croatia stop working on the border crossing in the  Plovanija-Skrile (Secovlje in Slovenian) sector, Slovenia is  making direct territorial pretensions toward Croatian territory.  And he would be telling the truth.  <H5>  Skudelin and Buzin -- Belong to Croatia </H5>   President Tudjman should first study the map from 1945 that  his guest will refer to and on the basis of which he claims the  disputed area of the Dragonja, saying that Croatia is building a  border crossing on the plot of land that belongs to the  cadastral municipality of Piran III. The map is a supplement of  publication "Cadastre National d'Istrie" [National Land Registry  of Istria] that was made in Susak in 1945 to be used at the  Paris peace conference. The publication contains all relevant  information about the population, the land registry and  administrative division in Istria of 1945. The controversial  map (drawn by the Adriatic Institute of the Yugoslav Academy of  Arts and Sciences) clearly shows that, in 1945, the land  registry borders of the municipalities of Piran (today in  Slovenia) and Kastel (today in Croatia) overlapped with the  administrative and political border. Already on pages 525-526  of the document the map is attached to, one can see that the map  does not correspond to the actual situation. Those pages show  that the administrative and political division at the estuary of  the Dragonja was different after all: the villages of Buzin,  Kaneda, Skudelin, and Veli Malin were registered as belonging to  the municipality of Kastel, the district of Buje.    President Tudjman should present some other documents from  that period to Kucan, for example the "Administrative and  Territorial Division of the District of Buje in 1945," which  says that the villages of Skudelin, Veli Malin, Kaneda, and  Buzin -- on Victory Day on 9 May 1945 -- belonged to the  territory of the Kastel People's Committee. From  "Administrative and Territorial Division of the District of Buje  of 15 March, 1946," it is obvious that the villages of Skudelin  and Buzin belonged to the Local People's Committee Kaldanija,  the district of Buje. Furthermore, Kucan should also see  "Submission of the District of Buje" of 1946, which says that  "the district of Buje stretches between the rivers Mirna and  Dragonja and that its eastern border are the villages of  Kucibreg and Zavrsje." The document proves that Skudelin, Veli  Malin, Kaneda, and Buzin belong to the territory of the People's  Committee of Kastel.  <H5>  Never in Slovenia </H5>   In the year 1947, when the peace agreement with Italy was  signed and the territory of Free Territory of Trieste (STT) was  established, as well as the so called Istrian District composed  of two sub-districts Buje and Kopar, the controversial building  site also belonged to Croatia. The decision about the  establishment of the Istrian District clearly mentions Skudelin  and Buzin. The "Administrative and Territorial Division of the  District of Buje" for 1947 puts the villages of Molini Scrile  (Molini, Skrile), Scodelin (Skudelin), and Canedo (Kaneda) under  the People's Committee of Kaldanija; the same document for 1948  again mentions Skudelin (Scodelin) and Buzin (Busin) as parts of  the People's Committee of Kastel. The "Background for the  Regional Index of the Istrian County of 21 April, 1949" shows  that Buzin and Skudelin fall within the territory of the  People's Committee of Kastel. Those villages also belong to  Croatia in accordance with the decision by the Istrian Regional  People's Committee of 12 April, 1952. The decision assigns them  to the district of Buje and to the cadastral municipality of  Kastel I.    Even when the order by Yugoslav Army Military Administration  of 1952 abolished the Istrian County and when, on 7 October,  1954, the area of what used to be known as the STT Zone A was  assigned to the civilian administration of the FNRJ [Federal  National Republic of Yugoslavia], those villages were in  Croatian municipality of Buje. Areas south of the present course  of the Dragonja (the so called cadastral municipality of Piran  III) were transferred to Croatia. This territory became and  integral part of it and it was so noted in all municipal,  republic, and former federal regulations. As we can see from  all those documents, the territory has never been a part of  Slovenia, it has never belonged to the administrative and  political unit of Piran, nor to the district of Kopar, and  therefore not to Slovenia either.  <H5>  Groundless Claims </H5>   If, in conclusion, we wonder what the dispute is about -- as  does Ljubo Boban -- on what grounds does Slovenia claim the area  of the so called cadastral municipality of Piran III, it must be  said that those claims are groundless. Croat-Slovene  demarcation in that area, from the outset, was not made  according to land registry criteria, but on an ethnic basis,  always in relation to the Dragonja River. In the world it is  normal that such border be also "covered" in the land registry.  There is nothing unclear about that.    Furthermore, President Tudjman could ask his eminent visitor  when Slovenia intends to return court (land registry) books for  the area of the cadastral municipality Piran III? Land registry  documentation for that municipality was semi-officially given to  the Land Regristy of the Municipality of Buje in 1963, but not  the court land registry. It was kept by the court in Piran and  those who are not well-versed in the matter use it as an  argument claiming that area as Slovene. And when his guest  starts telling him to his face everything regarding the  Plovanija border crossing and accuses him of sabotaging the  agreement on borders in Istria, President Tudjman will,  hopefully, have the courage to say: "But Mr. Kucan, those  problems have not been solved because of Slovene institutions'  blackmail with documentation."    That documentation, according to Boban, must be  unconditionally and immediately returned to Croatia.    Moreover, President Tudjman should ask his guest the  following question: where is the Dragonja River? For decades  this Croatian river has been moved from its bed by Slovenia,  which pushes it deeper and deeper into Croatia and then refers  to it as the border. The Croats could substantiate that by  Italian military maps which clearly show that the bed of the  Dragonja was once to the north of the St. Odorika channel in  which the Dragonja flows into the sea. Mr. Tudjman could also  show Mr. Kucan the map published by the Statistic Office of the  Regional People's Committee for Slovensko Primorje and Trieste  in 1947. That map also shows the Dragonja in its northern bed.  <H5>  Planned Moving of the Dragonja </H5>   From the landing of the allied forces in Normandy until the  present, the course of the Dragonja has always belonged to the  municipality of Buje, i.e. to the area that was included in  Croatia after 1945. Therefore, the area should not and must not  be a matter of agreement, especially as it was an integral part  of Croatia at the time it declared its independence in 1991.  The history of the area to the north of the St. Odorika channel  and the earlier bed of the Dragonja shows that its ownership has  become a matter of dispute only recently. In February 1944,  according to the agreement between Croat and Slovene partisans,  the Dragonja River was marked as a borderline of administrative  and territorial demarcation. Some 10 years later, Slovenia  started to move the river and create conditions for conquering  Croatian territory. Today, it is blindingly obvious that the  moving of the course of the Dragonja was planned and that it was  moved from its original bed to the bed of the St. Onorika  channel in order to get as much of Croatian territory as  possible. Such a perfidious moving of borders is not tolerated  by any court in the world.    By moving the river, the Republic of Slovenia gained control  over the area between the two river beds. Researcher Ljubo  Boban, however, could not find a single act according to which  that very sector would be specially regulated. Therefore, the  area should be discussed in a separate agreement between Croatia  and Slovenia and it should be viewed separately from the  question of the present course of the Dragonja (the so called  Piran III).    The northern course of the Dragonja itself is not and cannot  be disputed.    Convinced that historian Tudjman knows all this, the  Istrians  calmly await the results of Slovene-Croat talks in Zagreb,  firmly believing that the ominous prediction "Kucan in Zagreb --  Zagreb in trouble" will not come true.    After this round of negotiations, the Bay of Piran will  remain the biggest bone of contention in relations between  Croatia and Slovenia. The border in that bay has not hitherto  been regulated by any bilateral act and this is where one will  be forced to apply international law on so called flank  demarcation. All in all, it will not be Kucan and Tudjman who  will pull the chestnuts out of the fire, but some other group of  politicians.</p>

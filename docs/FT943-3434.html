			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition will help European arms producers improve Sir, Your editorial, 'European defence' (September 9), ignores some basic facts. As the Gulf war demonstrated, but most European militaries already knew, American weapons are not only cheaper than their European counterparts but also much better. They are better because they were designed for combat use, not for industrial policy purposes. The American military gained much combat experience during the cold war and was equipped to fight the Soviets. European militaries sat mostly in garrison during the cold war. Their weapons were acquired to keep local arms industries busy. Neither cost nor quality was much of an issue. But now Americans are likely to turn isolationist. Job needs will guide American weapons production. In contrast, Europeans must deal with chaos on their doorsteps. European militaries will need the best equipment, which they should be allowed to find wherever it is produced. With competitive pressure, European producers will gain in quality and efficiency.

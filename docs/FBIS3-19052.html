			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Uninominal Constituencies </F> Forza Italia Will Not Win"]    [Text] In the uninominal constituencies 35 percent of the  electorate will vote for a progressive candidate. The Forza  Italia candidates will acquire only 3 percent; this figure will  rise to 17 percent in case the Snake's [Berlusconi nickname]  people run with the National Alliance, and to 21 percent when  they align with the Northern League. The centrists will obtain  16 percent, Pannella 1 percent, and the others 2 percent. These  are the results of an opinion poll commissioned by TG5 [fifth  channel TV news] with CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research],  which interviewed 2,077 voters. In the proportional voting the  first party is Forza Italia with 29 percent, followed by the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] with 20 percent. The undecided  voters are at 28 percent, whereas 44 percent confirm to have  made a definitive choice. However, 36 percent says that they  might still change their minds.    This uncertainty is confirmed by the researchers of  Datamedia  and Noima di Accademia who questioned a sample of 6,174 people.  Approximately 40 percent still do not know yet for whom to  vote. However, the researchers instead wanted to know "what"  they will vote for, "how" they are making up their minds, and  "how much" their choice was influenced by the media. On these  issues, 46.1 percent believe that television is the most  reliable source, 15.3 percent the newspapers, 1.5 percent the  magazines, 0.9 percent the radio, 0.7 percent books, 27.4  percent personal knowledge, and 3.6 percent one's friends.</p>

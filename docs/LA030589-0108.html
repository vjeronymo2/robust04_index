			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> After recently reading the Los Angeles Times' excellent editorial ("AIDS: Cool  Reception," Feb. 20) about AIDS prevention programs, I was concerned that some  readers may conclude that the AIDS epidemic among males with male partners has  peaked and that the worst is over. That is far from the case.  </P> <P> While some may take the position that behavioral changes prompted by education  have drastically cut the rate of new infections among the gay population,  changes in behavior demonstrated in select groups may not be typical of the  population as a whole. Although some members of the gay population have adopted  "safer sex" practices, thus reducing the risk of transmission of the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV), others continue to engage in high-risk behavior,  as evidenced by newly diagnosed gonorrhea and syphilis cases in this  population.  </P> <P> In San Diego, more gay men will be diagnosed with AIDS during 1989 than during  any previous year. Progression to disease and transmission to others continue.  </P> <P> Accurately predicting the number of AIDS cases that will occur in San Diego  County is useful as a tool. This tool permits better recognition on the part of  health planners for the number of individuals who will be requiring hospital  beds, social services and medical care.  </P> <P> Detecting new trends such as the increase or decrease in the rate at which new  cases occur is, likewise, important. However, one must be cautious in  over-interpreting the results that are found.  </P> <P> AIDS is a specific disease condition diagnosed after many years of silent  infection with the HIV. In 1985 and 1986, it was felt that the interval from  the time of the infection until disease expression was relatively brief.  Likewise at that point, it was felt that only a minority of infected  individuals would develop symptoms related to viral infection.  </P> <P> As time has passed, we find that the vast majority of infected individuals will  ultimately develop symptoms of illness related to HIV infection, but that it  may take 7, 10, 15 or more years before symptoms of this infection are  recognized. Treatment agents, such as AZT, have shown an increase in the  interval before progression to the full criteria for AIDS.  </P> <P> The bottom-line significance is that a slackening of the AIDS epidemic in San  Diego County cannot be defined by noting small changes in the rate of increase  in new cases.  </P> <P> Continued emphasis on risk-reduction education and reinforcement of positive  behavior change to reduce HIV transmission in all high-risk groups must be  continued and repeatedly fostered. We cannot be complacent about the task of  changing high-risk behavior.  </P> <P> Instead, we must be consistent and reinforce the need for maintaining behaviors  that will eliminate HIV transmission risk, and continue to provide this  education and reinforcement to all individuals reaching the age of sexual  maturity.  </P> <P> MICHELE M. GINSBERG  </P> <P> Chief, Epidemiology Unit  </P> <P> County Department of Health Services  </P></p>

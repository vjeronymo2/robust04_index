			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTRICT DEVELOPMENT ON THE BOULEVARD  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is to be commended for criticizing the delays in  adopting restrictions on future development along Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> Over the past four years homeowners and developers have worked with city  planning staff to propose reasonable limits on density, additional parking and  transportation requirements and measures to protect residential areas from  commercial encroachment.  </P> <P> Whatever justification for the delays, the fact is that Ventura Boulevard  landowners and developers are quickly getting projects through the door so that  they do not have to meet the new requirements. If city officials do not act  now, the entire purpose and effectiveness of the proposed Ventura Boulevard  Specific Plan will be undermined.  </P> <P> Ventura Boulevard cannot tolerate the additional thousands of vehicles  generated by development pursuant to outdated code requirements. Some people  say it's too late, but there is a possibility of another 40 million square feet  of commercial development generating 150,000 more vehicles unless the new plan  is adopted.  </P> <P> We do not want any more delays, any more excuses or any more development  without the requirements and protections of the Ventura Boulevard Specific  Plan.  </P> <P> ROB GLUSHON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

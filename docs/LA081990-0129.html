			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / STEVE HENSON;  </P> <P> FRANCO DOING HIS PART TO DELIVER A HIT PERFORMANCE FOR PEORIA  </P> <P> Bing and Lou Russell shifted uncomfortably in their seats, growing ever more  irate as the heckler, a few rows back, continued his relentless diatribe. The  target was the first baseman for the visiting Peoria (Ill.) Chiefs.  </P> <P> "Hey, number nine, hustle to your position," the man yelled in a thick Latino  accent. "You're better than that, nine. Stay in the game."  </P> <P> No. 9 happened to be Matt Franco, the Russells' grandson. Finally, they had  heard enough. Lou turned to confront the loudmouth, then gasped in  astonishment. It was her son, Kurt Russell, doing one of his better acting  jobs.  </P> <P> Russell, best known for his roles in such films as "Silkwood," "Escape From New  York" and "The Best of Times," had only the best of intentions, however. He  wanted to fire up Franco without revealing his identity. No one knew Kurt was  at the game in Rockford, Ill., not even his parents.  </P> <P> "I heard him for a while, and when the inning ended, I looked up and it was  Kurt," Franco said. "He was dressed to conceal his identity. He's gotta go  incognito."  </P> <P> Franco, whose mother Jill is Kurt's sister, rapidly is establishing his own  identity. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter from Westlake High, Franco is  challenging for the Midwest League batting title. With 13 games to play, he is  batting .290, 15 points behind league-leader Scott Cepicky of South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> Franco has batted .382 the past month for the Chicago Cubs' Class-A affiliate  after beginning the season in a horrendous slump.  </P> <P> Like any 20-year-old from Southern California, Franco saw his spirits -- and  batting average -- rise along with the temperature.  </P> <P> "The first few weeks were ridiculous. Some nights it was 18 degrees with the  wind-chill factor," Franco said. "Who can hit when your hands are numb?"  </P> <P> Bedeviled: They have used pitches rather than pitchforks, but two former  Arizona State Sun Devils have helped toss former Camarillo High right-hander  Travis Willis from Peoria's starting rotation.  </P> <P> The Cubs assigned Lance Dickson, their 1990 No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona  State, to Peoria on July 4. After four starts, Dickson was promoted. He is now  with the Cubs.  </P> <P> Replacing Dickson at Peoria was Troy Bradford, the team's third-round draft  pick, also out of Arizona State. About the same time, Manager Greg Mahlberg  decided to stick with a four-man rotation after using five starters much of the  season. All of which left Willis in long relief.  </P> <P> At first glance, Willis seemed an odd choice for banishment to the bullpen. The  former Cal standout was 8-9 with an earned-run average of 3.18 in 20 starts for  the Chiefs (49-77), who are last in the Midwest League. With five complete  games he still ranks among league leaders and he has walked only 39 in 154  innings.  </P> <P> "My control worked against me," Willis said. "They told me I'm a guy they can  count on to come in and throw strikes. I was a better candidate for the bullpen  than somebody who can't find the plate."  </P> <P> Willis has been hit hard in relief -- he is now 9-11 with a 3.49 ERA -- and  Mahlberg might be having a change of heart. Willis got a start against Waterloo  (Iowa) on Friday night and gave up one earned run, getting the win in the  Chiefs' 5-2 victory.  </P> <P> Holy Toledo: How Scott Muckey made his professional coaching debut at age 37 is  basically a travel story. Certainly, it's circuitous.  </P> <P> The manager of the Toledo (Ohio) Mud Hens, John Wockenfuss, was afraid to fly,  so he was told to hit the road. The lone coach, Aurelio Rodriguez, had family  problems in Mexico, so he took off south of the border, never to return.  </P> <P> Tom Gamboa, the new Mud Hen manager, called Muckey, a longtime friend, July 18  and asked if he had two months to spare. Muckey was on the next flight to  Toledo.  </P> <P> "It took me all of a few seconds to make the decision," said Muckey, who had  planned to spend the summer in his usual manner -- coaching an American Legion  team and helping out at baseball camps.  </P> <P> Muckey, the Crespi High coach, has been at the high school or junior college  levels since his playing career ended at Pepperdine in 1974. All of a sudden,  he found himself pitching batting practice and coaching first base for the  Detroit Tigers' triple-A International League affiliate.  </P> <P> In Muckey's first game, Toledo played Oklahoma City, which coincidentally is  managed by Steve Smith, a friend of Muckey's. "He was kind of surprised to see  me," Muckey said.  </P> <P> The rookie coach trotted out to the first-base coach's box. The first Toledo  batter singled . . . and was promptly picked off. The next Toledo batter  doubled . . . and was picked off. Two innings later, a Toledo batter singled .  . . and was picked off.  </P> <P> "Old Smitty's over there in the dugout laughing at me," Muckey recalled.  </P> <P> Muckey has earned respect with his understated manner and knowledge of the  game. Yet he is a mere chick among the Mud Hens in terms of professional  experience.  </P> <P> "I've made all the rookie mistakes. Just trying to keep track of the time  schedule is hard enough," he said, chuckling. "I was running out there with my  uniform on when we were supposed to be in batting practice tops."  </P> <P> Another day he forgot his cap. "If they were serious about fining me, they  could have slapped me for $150 for not being in the right place at the right  time."  </P> <P> The fans have been less forgiving. During a game in Richmond, Va., Muckey  fielded a foul ball down the first-base line and tossed it to the ball boy.  </P> <P> Oops.  </P> <P> "The crowd was all over me," he said. "I don't know why. But now when a ball  comes near me, I watch it roll by."  </P> <P> The season itself is flying by. Muckey is enjoying every minute, but after a  month beating around the bush leagues, he paints a less-than-romantic picture:  Sit around a hotel room until 3 or 4 p.m., head to the ballpark, try to wind  down after midnight. The next day, ditto.  </P> <P> "I don't think the pro life's for everyone," he said.  </P> <P> "Probably a lot of kids looking to be pro players are in for a little bit of a  surprise."  </P> <P> Muckey, not being much for night life, has used his time in the hotel room to  prepare for his Crespi teaching duties -- school begins Sept. 3, one day after  the Mud Hens' season ends.  </P> <P> "I'm studying up on physiology," he said without enthusiasm. "That's what they  have me teaching this year."  </P></p>

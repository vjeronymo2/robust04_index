			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Banda in backdown on ballot boxes MALAWI'S President Kamuzu Banda has pledged to do everything in his power to ensure the June 14 referendum on whether the country should switch to multi-party rule is free and fair, Reuter reports from Blantyre. He announced he had accepted a proposal mooted by the United Nations that there should be a single ballot box at each polling station rather than separate ones for Yes and No votes. Mr Banda's pledge came as Amnesty International said pro-democracy campaigners in the referendum were likely to face attacks, death threats, arrest and prosecution. 'I will do everything to make sure this is a free and fair referendum,' the president said. The government had previously insisted that two ballot boxes be used at each polling station, prompting opposition charges that this would make vote-rigging easier. Pro-democracy activists in Malawi, who had threatened to boycott the referendum if two boxes were used, described Mr Banda's announcement as a 'humiliating defeat' for the ruling Malawi Congress party. Amnesty, a London-based human rights organisation, said in a report that regulations appearing to protect free speech for campaign participants were deeply flawed and ineffective. 'Those who do speak out for multi-party democracy are likely to face human rights violations. Unless the government takes urgent steps to guarantee basic human rights, the referendum cannot be considered fair,' it said. Amnesty has been refused access to Malawi, ruled for 29 years by life-President Banda, after alleging serious human rights abuses there for many years. It called on the government to protect the rights of participants in the referendum campaign and to release Mr Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist serving a nine-month jail sentence for sedition.</p>

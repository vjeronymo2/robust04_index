			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has called for worldwide celebrations of the 50th anniversary of  the victory over the Nazi in the World War Two and declare 1995  the year of memory of the WWII victims.    Yeltsin said the United Nations should urge all countries,  their parliaments and governments to declare 8-9 May, 1995 days  without shooting.    In his letter to the United Nations released by the  presidential press service on Saturday, Yeltsin said that "the  importance of the great victory won by joint efforts of the  people of various countries cannot be tarnished even by time.  One of its main lessons -- in order to defend peace, all  peace-loving forces must act jointly, concertedly and actively."    "It is important, especially now, because there is still a  possibility of armed confrontation between countries, blood  continues to flow in civil, inter-ethnic and local conflict, the  danger of the spread of weapons of mass destruction is growing,"  he said.    Russia believes that "it is in the interests of mankind to  actively help step up the role and increase the effectiveness of  the United Nations -- as a pivotal element of the system of  collective security -- in pursuing the lofty goal proclaimed in  its charter -- "to save the succeeding generations from the  scourge of war."</p>

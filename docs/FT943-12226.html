			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: ED&amp;F Man to buy out fund group ED&amp;F Man, the international commodity trading and financial services group which plans a UK stock market flotation in September, intends to buy the outstanding shares in AHL, a specialist fund manager which uses quantitative techniques to trade futures and currencies. Mr Stanley Fink, Man's finance director, said yesterday the value of the outstanding shares in AHL would be determined by Man's forthcoming flotation, since it was proposing a share-for-share exchange. The flotation is expected to value Man at about Pounds 450m (Dollars 697m). 'The exchange of the minority interest in AHL for shares in Man will enable Michael Adam, David Harding and Martin Lueck, who currently own shares in AHL, to participate in the flotation,' said Mr Fink. Although AHL's price/earnings ratio is likely to be lower than Man's, Mr Fink said Man would be paying close to 20 times more than it paid for its original stake in AHL, to reflect the growth in the business. When Man bought a 51 per cent stake in the trading adviser in 1989, AHL only had about Dollars 30m under management. Man has since built up its holding in AHL, which now has around Dollars 300m under management, to around two thirds.</p>

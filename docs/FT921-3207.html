			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Fax machines would cut queues at Heathrow Sir, In an electronic age, it is preposterous for people to have to stand in lines to have their passports checked on arrival at Heathrow. All passports ought to be looked at by airline personnel on checking in, with the information then faxed or otherwise transmitted to a central processing facility. That facility would fax back one of three messages: OK, No, or Verify. All passengers with OK status would leave the aircraft in the UK and would not need to have their passports checked at all. Those passengers with a No response would be denied boarding. Those passengers with a Verify response would be subject to special examination on arrival. This way of doing things would not increase check-in time, since it could be absorbed into the current security procedure. It would greatly increase speed on arrival.

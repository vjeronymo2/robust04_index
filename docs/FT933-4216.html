			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (9): Why Fiat needs a winner - The Punto must match its highly successful predecessor if the Turin group is to recover the leading position from which it has slipped / Italy ALTHOUGH austerity is becoming the watchword with Italians, they are unlikely to begrudge Fiat a PR splash in launching the Punto this month. A measured dose of ostentation and drum-beating will not be held amiss for a new car that is considered fundamental for Fiat's fortunes. The Turin carmaker has not had much success with new models since it launched the Uno a decade ago. The Uno earned praise from journalists and won the European Car of the Year Award in 1983. But as well as being a journalists' favourite, it was also a commercial hit with the car-buying public. Indeed, it continues to draw purchasers into showrooms. The Uno's appeal is such that it still heads Italian rankings of new car sales 10 years after its launch. With 146,400 sold in the first half of this year, the Uno achieved more than double the sales of its nearest rival, Ford's Fiesta. Clearly, the evergreen Uno will be hard to follow. Yet the Punto must match its highly successful predecessor if Fiat is to recover the leading position from which it has slipped over the past five years. 'The launch will represent an important milestone in the programme for the renewal of the product range,' Fiat's directors told shareholders this summer. Much depends on the Punto's visual impact. 'Styling is the principal factor in car purchase in Italy,' says Mr Giuseppe Gabriele, director of the car importers' association UNRAE. In involving stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro in the Punto, Fiat hopes that the designer of the Uno will be on target again. But the new factory at Melfi, near Potenza in southern Italy, where the Punto will be produced, will also play a critical part in determining whether the Punto will be a success or not. Quality and efficiency are the keywords at Melfi. Fiat says that its green-field factory is in the vanguard of car production and will ensure manufacturing excellence and cost competitive products. Flexibility and a just-in-time approach, achieved by the location of primary suppliers at the same site, are features on which Fiat is basing its hopes at Melfi. Series production will start in January, although cars will be leaving the assembly lines from this month. When Melfi is fully on-stream its 7,000 workers will be building 450,000 cars each year. Melfi represents total investment of L4,700bn and is part of a major capital expenditure programme. Fiat's capital spending in the car sector amounted to L3,920bn last year on net revenues of L27,450bn, a sharp increase on 1991's figure of L2,160bn on net revenues of L27,510bn. Fiat Auto also spent another L1,330bn on research and development last year, a slight increase over 1991. However, this is not an easy time for financing new investment. Cash flow at Fiat Auto fell from L1,990bn in 1991 to L1,330bn last year, and operating income has been sliding. From a L2,360bn high in 1989, operating income slumped to L160bn in 1991 before plummeting to a L540bn loss last year. Figures at group level underline the strain of financing the investment programme. From L3,310bn in 1989, Fiat Group net income dropped to L550bn last year, and cash flow almost halved from L6,430bn to L3,630bn. Over the four years 1989 to 1992, the group's net financial position suffered a massive reversal, moving from a surplus of L2,120bn at year-end 1989 to a deficit of L3,850bn at the end of last year. Hopes of improvement this year are slender. Industry specialists wonder about the impact on the accounts of summer sales campaigns, aimed at reducing stocks before the Punto's launch. But the costs of special offers, discounts and other encouragements to move stocks are less significant than market conditions. Fiat is launching its new model at an inauspicious moment. Car sales in Italy in the first half of the year slumped by 22.5 per cent against the same period last year. Mr Gabriele expects that new car sales will be between 15 and 18 per cent lower than last year, suggesting a total of between 1,950,000 and 2,010,000. Others are less sanguine. Mr Salvatore Pistola, managing director of Rover Italia, believes that 1,870,000 new cars will have been sold when the year closes. Mr Massimo Berni, head of General Motors Italia, says: 'There are no prospects for improvement in the short term, and the trend suggests a figure of 1,800,000.' Mr Pistola and Mr Berni both think that there might be a small increase to 1,900,000 next year. If the more pessimistic experts are correct, Fiat and the importers may have to wait until 1996 before the 2m threshold is again crossed. Economic, political and fiscal factors underlie the sharp drop in the market. The depressed economic climate is one of the reasons why Italians are deferring car purchases. 'There is no shortage of liquidity, but people are not spending because they are worried about their jobs,' says Mr Gabriele, adding that political uncertainty also acts as a brake on big spending decisions by families. Additional taxes and increased health charges have also induced caution in family spending this year. 'The government's continual search for extra tax revenues is causing diffidence and a reluctance to take extra commitments or spend savings when these might be needed to meet surprise tax bills,' says Mr Gabriele. The company car is not a significant part of the new car market in Italy, sales depending predominantly on how families manage their budgets. However, Fiat is not only launching the Punto into a sickly economy, it is also having to fight aggressive competition from importers. Over the past five years, foreign makes have steadily eroded Fiat's share of the Italian market. In 1988, the Turin group sold 1.35m cars for a market share of 59.9 per cent. Sales last year were 1.05m, cutting Fiat's domestic market share to 44.3 per cent. Fiat has paid the price of failure to renew its range with attractive models to compete with imports in terms of style, technology and cost. Indeed, even in the particularly difficult conditions of the first half of this year, during which Fiat was able to regain a little market share to 44.6 per cent  -albeit on a 22.1 per cent volume drop - some importers have been able to buck the trend. The most prominent is Nissan, which is enjoying booming sales of its Sunderland-built Micras and Primeras. In the first six months, Nissan sold 24,500 cars - an increase of 78.4 per cent on the same period last year - to take a market share of 2.3 per cent. Rover and General Motors are also both performing well, Rover suffering a volume decline of only 2.4 per cent and GM 4.1 per cent between January and June. Mr Pistola says that 'Roverisation' has been successful, with the Rover badge enjoying a good image for styling, quality and technology. 'We are competitive on price,' says Rover's managing director. The company is doing well in certain niches, and with its 800 series top-of-the-range saloons and coupes. 'November's launching of the 600 series, which has a distinctive styling edge, should help us increase market share. The 400 series station wagon being launched next year will also provide a boost,' says Mr Pistola. And he believes that Rover will double its market share when it launches its new small car in two or three years. 'Value for money is General Motor's formula,' says Mr Berni. Last year, Opel's sales rose by 33.7 per cent to 134,000, and its market share increased from 4.3 to 5.6 per cent. Although sales dipped slightly in the first six months this year, Opel's share increased to 6.6 per cent. 'We are a volume business, but strong in niches at the same time,' Mr Berni says, pointing to Opel's success with the Astra estate and Calibra coupe. Despite the German origin and D-Mark pricing of much of GM's imports, the company has made sure to keep price lists competitive. And this is true of other German and French carmakers. The lira devaluation is not offering respite to Fiat in its home market. Indeed, Mr Gabriele says that there is now a flourishing parallel export market of German and French cars due to a 30 per cent price differential. With Italians pragmatically assessing alternatives when considering their new cars, and no longer feeling patriotic obligations to buy Fiat, the Turin group's models have to prove their worth in order to win sales. The Punto is being launched into a different and much more competitive market than was the Uno 10 years ago. Its success is of fundamental importance to Fiat. But will it succeed? Whether or not Fiat has a winner should be known next spring.</p>

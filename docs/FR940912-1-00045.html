			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A performance test to demonstrate compliance of a vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream control device with the organic compound reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency requirement shall use Method 1 or 1A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, to select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling sites. The mass flow rate of organics entering and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exiting the control device shall be determined by using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, to determine the volume exhausted and by using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 18 of appendix A of part 60, or any other test method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of part 63, to determine total organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A performance test to demonstrate compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass removal provision shall consist of a determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass removal required to be achieved and a determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass removal actually achieved. The total required mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal is calculated by adding together the required mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal for each individual affected stream to be combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for treatment. The required mass removal for each affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater stream prior to combination of the streams for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment shall be determined using the wastewater average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow rate and volatile organic average concentration at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point of generation for each affected wastewater stream to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be combined for treatment. The actual total volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic mass removal in the wastewater stream shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined using the same procedures as described for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncombustion treatment processes complying with the percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a performance test to demonstrate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a biological treatment process with the 95-percent mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirement must be conducted using the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the proposed rule. The control efficiency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the biological treatment unit is a function of the fraction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biodegraded in a properly operated biological treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. This fraction shall be determined using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures in appendix C of 40 CFR part 63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A performance test is not specified for the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steam stripper; installation of the specified equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along with monitoring to show attainment of the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating parameter levels, demonstrates compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment design and operation provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each vapor collection system, closed-vent system, fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof, cover, or enclosure must be evaluated initially and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual intervals using Method 21 of appendix A of part 60 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the presence of detectable emissions from leaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 21 represents the best available method for detecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaks from these sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting requirements necessitated by the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard are authorized by section 114 of the Act. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the part 60 General Provisions, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard would require the submittal of several types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports. First, the part 60 General Provisions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require notification reports, which inform the Agency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities subject to the NSPS. These reports include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of construction, anticipated and actual startup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates, and physical or operational changes. In addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information required by the General Provisions, owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operators would be required to provide information with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice of construction identifying the process unit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream as well as a brief description of the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment and/or control technology. As part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of startup, sources would also be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide more detailed information on the waste stream and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste management units. For example, sources would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the chemical manufacturing processes that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed rule, information on the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance strategy, and any required control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameter ranges, unless the parameter ranges have already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been established in the operating permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reports of the required design analysis (for steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strippers) or of performance test results of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control systems would be required as well. These reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show whether a facility is initially meeting the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard. The proposed rule would override the General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions requirements for quarterly reports for excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and monitoring systems performance. Instead,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semi-annual reports would be required in the event of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control equipment failure or instance when monitored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters are not within their established values. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semi-annual report shall include the date of the inspection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of each waste management unit in which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control equipment failure was detected, description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure, and description of the nature of and date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair was made. The semi-annual report shall also contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on monitoring results that exceed the boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in the operating permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

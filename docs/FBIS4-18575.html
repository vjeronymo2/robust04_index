			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ozer Hatay: "First the Package Was Punctured and </F> Then the Ball Was Put in Our Court"]    [Text] The package on confidence-building measures [CBM's]  was first punctured in the indirect talks in accordance with the  Greek Cypriot wishes and then the ball was put in our court.  Acting in accordance with Greek Cypriot tactics, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and his representatives continue to  maintain the approach they adopted to place us in a difficult  position.    In his report to the UN Security Council, Butrus-Ghali  claimed that President Rauf Denktas objected on 21 March to the  issues that were included in the package of CBM's after it was  punctured some time ago. Butrus-Ghali's report said that  Denktas objected to the proposals on the access road to Maras  [Varosha], Nicosia International Airport's air traffic rights,  simultaneous and equal advantages for Turkish and Greek  Cypriots, and collection of custom taxes by UN officials.  Obviously, the report created the conditions Greek Cypriot  leader Glavkos Kliridhis needs to maintain his tactics. It will  be recalled that he has already said he "will agree to the  document if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." The  fact that Butrus-Ghali quoted Glavkos Kliridhis as saying that  he would accept the UN document if it is accepted by the Turkish  Cypriot side, that is, the document he conveyed to the two sides  through his representatives on 21 March, is an indication that  he wishes to give the Greek Cypriot side's tactics a chance.    Obviously, those who have punctured the package of CBM's to  satisfy the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, regardless of the fact  that that package was supported by experts, have now put the  ball in the Turkish Cypriot side's court. This approach will  neither be the first nor the last....    An effort is being made to change whatever dissatisfies the  Greek Cypriot side and have the Turkish Cypriots agree to new  elements. Accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of obstructing the  implementation of the CBM's, when changes are made on matters  related to Maras and the Nicosia International Airport in  accordance with the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, can only be  described as an unrealistic approach that is aimed at allowing  the Greek Cypriot side to maintain its two-faced policy.    UN officials have succeeded in persuading the two sides in  Cyprus to agree in principle to hold talks on the package of  CBM's. However, they then moved to puncture that package and  force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to the changes they made in  accordance with Greek Cypriot demands.    Meanwhile, considering the fact that the Greek Cypriot side  stands to gain from the changes and additions, which will  definitely undermine the spirit of the CBM's, the Greek Cypriot  Administration has disclosed that it "will agree to the document  if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." Obviously, this  is a tactic aimed at accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of  maintaining an irreconcilable approach.    Apparently, the point we have reached has confirmed that  suggestions made by certain individuals among the Turkish  Cypriot people to the effect that "the game must be played  wisely" have been useless. The outcome has been as expected.  We have been blamed for the deadlock again.    Obviously, the objective was to place the Turkish Cypriot  side in a difficult position.... Regardless of whatever we do,  we shall continue to be blamed as long as we refuse to approach  the Greek Cypriot side's position. Meanwhile, the UN officials  will continue to create advantages for the Greek Cypriot side.    The United States must be careful not to be misled by these  tactics.</p>

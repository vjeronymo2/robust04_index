			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Details to emerge of IRI's high-tech group DETAILS will be announced today of plans to create a single Italian high-technology group covering companies controlled by the IRI state holding concern. Shares in Finmeccanica, IRI's aerospace and engineering subsidiary, were suspended yesterday pending an announcement. The suspension, also covered Finmeccanica's listed Alenia aerospace and Elsag-Bailey precision engineering offshoots. The moves are the curtain-raiser to an offer by Finmeccanica to buy out minorities in its two subsidiaries. Terms of the deal, which has been preceded by detailed valuation work, will be released later today. Shareholders in Alenia and Elsag-Bailey will be offered equity in Finmeccanica. It is not known whether there will be a cash alternative. Nor is it as yet clear why shares in Finmeccanica's quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary have not been suspended. The plan crowns Finmeccanica's ambition to become the single quoted vehicle for all IRI's high-technology industrial activities. Apart from Alenia and Elsag-Bailey, Finmeccanica's operations include the big Ansaldo engineering and transport equipment concern. The group, which has 56,000 employees, had sales of L10,966bn (Dollars 7.78bn) last year. After meeting a European Commission requirement to repay IRI L719bn in aid and interest to the Alfa Romeo cars group, formerly owned by Finmeccanica, it posted a 1991 loss of L525bn. Taking their inspiration from conglomerates such as Siemens and General Electric, Finmeccanica executives have claimed that a single listing would provide substantial financial and marketing benefits. That strategy has been indirectly boosted by the new Italian government's privatisation plans. Last week, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, forecast eventual capital increases for both Finmeccanica and Stet, IRI's telecommunications holding company, including a much bigger role for private shareholders. Finmeccanica took a first step in October, when it gained a stock market listing through the reverse takeover of its already-quoted Sifa property and securities trading arm. The transaction was to have been the prelude to an ambitious multi-stage capital increase, raising up to L1,700bn via a cash injection from IRI, bank credits and, eventually, convertible bonds for private investors. However, IRI's financial difficulties and the poor state of the bourse forced the company to shelve its immediate cash-raising plans. Bankers question Finmeccanica's claim that a single listing will prove more attractive to investors than the current situation. Although it will create a much bigger float, the operation will reduce the transparency of Finmeccanica's individual operations. Incorporating subsidiaries such as Alenia electronics companies, could also help Finmeccanica mask trading difficulties at some operations.</p>

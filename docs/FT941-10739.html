			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / A question of value For the past week, Mr Alfredo Saenz has been engaged in a bizarre argument. The acting chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) has been trying to convince shareholders that the bank is worth less than they think. Mr Saenz's effort seems odd to an outsider, given that most company chairmen try to do the opposite. Yet squabbles over the true worth of Banesto have become a daily occurrence in Madrid since the Bank of Spain intervened on December 28 to dismiss its management and install Mr Saenz's team. The differences in views between the new management and shareholders became apparent last week when Banesto's shares were refloated after being suspended at Pta1,995 (Pounds 9.47p) each at the time of the intervention. Mr Saenz's plan to restore the bank to health, and absorb an estimated Pta605bn overvaluation of assets, includes a write-down of the nominal value of shares - their value in the bank's balance sheet - from Pta700 to Pta400. But Banesto shares yesterday closed at Pta760, placing the market capitalisation at well over Mr Saenz's estimate. This demand indicates that either investors think Banesto was not in as bad a shape as the authorities claimed - or they believe the rescue plan makes it a good investment. Either way, the differing valuations could spark a more serious dispute between participants in the proposed rescue. These include Banesto itself, the other Spanish banks being asked to contribute, and existing shareholders, who face a big dilution of their shares. The most significant investor is the Corsair Fund, the Dollars 1.1bn fund managed by the US bank J P Morgan, which advised Banesto's former management. Corsair invested Dollars 175m in a placing of shares at Pta1,900 each last summer. This stake would lose value significantly in the rescue plan. If Banesto's shareholders approve, the bank will be recapitalised via a Pta180bn issue, with new shares priced at the new nominal value of Pta400. The deposit guarantee fund, which uses contributions from the country's banks to insure deposits, will acquire close to 80 per cent of Banesto's equity, and that held by existing shareholders will be diluted. The deal is structured to encourage the banks to take part in a crucial aspect of the plan. The banks will help remove poor loans with a written-down value of Pta285bn from Banesto's balance sheet. They and the Bank of Spain will each provide half that amount. But the existing shareholders may object to the part of the plan involving a dilution of their stakes. Because the capital increase will come via a share placing with the deposit guarantee fund rather than a rights issue, existing shareholders will be unable to take part. Some are thought to be taking legal advice on how they might challenge the plan. They could question the deposit guarantee fund's right to underwrite a capital increase by itself or its right to issue new shares at a nominal value well below current trading levels. Under the terms of the rescue plan, the fund will publicly auction its Banesto stake this year, and will keep a tranche of this sale for a 'strategic buyer'. This is likely to be a large bank, which could end up controlling between 20 and 30 per cent of Banesto. Banesto's existing shareholders will, in theory, be able to exercise their rights to buy shares in this auction. But it is unclear what price they will be asked to pay for keeping the size of their stakes. Nor has it been decided whether the 'strategic buyer' will get preferential terms. Another point of contention could be how Banesto assets are to be sold to the banks and the Bank of Spain. Because the poor loans may turn out to be worth more than Banesto estimates, shareholders may try to ensure the banks do not benefit excessively. These tensions will come to a head by the time of Banesto's shareholders' meeting on March 26. Unless Mr Saenz has by then succeeded in talking down the value of shares, there will be substantial potential for conflict between Banesto, its existing shareholders and Spain's other large banks.</p>

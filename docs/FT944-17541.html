			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low directors share over Pounds 900,000 The four main directors of Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket chain acquired by Tesco in a Pounds 300m takeover last month, shared pay-offs totalling more than Pounds 900,000. Mr James Millar, chairman, who had been with the company for 34 years, received only Pounds 75,800, or the equivalent of 13 months' salary, the amount of time his contract had left to run. However, he will have made more than Pounds 121,000 from his personal shareholding in Wm Low, and should have netted at least Pounds 281,000 from exercising share options. Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, was on an annual salary of Pounds 115,000, but a 36-month notice period in the event of a takeover. That took his total pay-off to Pounds 345,000. He will have made Pounds 21,000 from his personal shareholding. Both Mr Harvey Findlay, financial director, and Mr Sandy Leslie, buying and marketing director, were on salaries of Pounds 81,120 and 36 months' notice. Their pay-offs would have been Pounds 243,360 each. Mr Findlay would also have made Pounds 13,000 from his shareholding and at least Pounds 204,000 from share options. Mr Leslie stands to have made another Pounds 23,000 from his shares and at least Pounds 165,000 from share options.</p>

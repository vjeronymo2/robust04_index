			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has decided to  license a party called the Pan-Arab Action Front Party [Hizb  Jabhat al-'Amal al-Qawmi].    Party spokesman Lawyer Salim al-Suways said: The licensing  of our party by the Interior Ministry at a time when the Arab  homeland is undergoing difficult circumstances comes as a real  test and a challenge, which we will face according to our  pan-Arab constants by entrenching effective organizational  structures capable of absorbing changes. We do not want to be  just another number in the list of licensed party. Moreover, we  do not want to become an elite organization; we seek to be a  popular pan-Arab instrument.    He added: We believe that the establishment of the Pan-Arab  Action Front Party, which includes pan-Arab parties and figures,  is an attempt to rebel against the deteriorating and fragmented  situation of the pan-Arab forces in Jordan and the Arab  homeland. This situation weakened these forces and robbed them  of their political influence. The pan-Arab forces, which seek  to achieve unity and democracy, should not remain divided and in  conflict. While we assert that we are a channel for pan-Arab  struggle, we hope to be the melting pot for pan-Arab forces on  the road toward the establishment of a united pan-Arab front.    Lawyer al-Suways added that the Pan-Arab Action Front Party  is a result of the unity of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the  United Organization [al-tanzim al-muwahhad], the Jordanian  Revolutionary People's Party, the progressive democratic and  pan-Arab forces, the Arab popular liberation movement in Jordan,  in addition to a group of independent national figures.    The party formed a leadership council of 27 members and an  executive committee of 11 members. It also formed a number of  party bureaus. The party will continue to call on the national  parties and figures to continue dialogue in order to achieve  unity and form a broad pan-Arab front.    It is worth noting that the party's executive committee  consists of Muhammad al-Zu'bi, the secretary general; Ahmad  Muhammad Ibrahim, also known as Abu-'Isa, assistant secretary  general and head of the political affairs bureau; Shams  'Abd-al-Karim, assistant secretary general and head of the  organizational bureau; 'Ali al-Hamshari, assistant secretary  general and head of the information bureau; Salim al-Suways, the  media spokesman; Mahmud al-Nawayisah, head of the cultural  bureau; Majid Mahafizah, secretary of the executive committee;  'Adnan Mansur, official in charge of financial affairs; Burayk  al-Hadid, head of the popular organizations bureau; Hani  al-Dahlah; and Fayiz al-'Adwan.</p>

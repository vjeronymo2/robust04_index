			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Government wants Bonn to be  the headquarters of the new World Trade Organization (WTO) that  is to succeed GATT in January 1995. The cabinet adopted  Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt's proposal on Wednesday [11  May]. The offer was transmitted to the GATT Secretariat in  Geneva immediately. The deadline for applications is 18 May.  If the application is successful, the new institution will be  understood as a compensation to Bonn for the government and  parliament's move to Berlin.

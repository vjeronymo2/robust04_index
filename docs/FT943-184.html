			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Observer: Manek's City challenge Forget Lenny Licht, the former Mercury Asset Management investment star who was lured away to Jupiter Tyndall with a Pounds 1m-plus golden hello. Wembley's Jayesh Manek, 38, who runs a small chain of chemists shops and dabbles in the stock market, sounds as if he could slaughter go-go fund managers like Licht at their own game. People in the City are starting to talk about Manek, a 38-year-old Ugandan Asian, because he keeps on winning The Sunday Times's weekly Fantasy Fund Manager competition. True it's only a game and since Manek's money is not on the line he can afford to take much bigger risks than any normal fund manager. Even so the consistency of his winning and the size of his gains is starting to be noticed. Since the competition started at the end of May, the FT-SE 100 has risen by less than 30 points, yet Manek's JP Growth fund has grown from Pounds 10m to Pounds 92.6m. More than 40,000 people are playing the game, yet 10 of Manek's funds appear in the top 50 performers. He has been helped by picking small highly-speculative stocks such as Middlesex Holdings, United Breweries and Anglo United. However, he is not playing the options markets. Manek spends three to four hours a week plotting his investment strategy. His one luxury is a computer technical analysis programme, but he gets most of his information from the Financial Times and the Investors Chronicle. He has not yet had a City headhunter knocking on his door. But if his winning streak continues much longer, he may well get an offer he might find hard to refuse.</p>

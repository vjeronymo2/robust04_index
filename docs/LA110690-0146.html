			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOME TEAM: There's hope yet for a championship in Anaheim. The Angels faded and  the Rams are out of it, but the Anaheim Cricket Club has played its way to the  finals for the Williamson Cup, emblem of cricket supremacy for Southern  California. . . . The match will be played against Pasadena on Sunday at 10  a.m. in Woodley Park, Van Nuys. Players don't expect a victory to rock Anaheim,  says one: "We're not planning on a ticker-tape parade."

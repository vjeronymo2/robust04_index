			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Property: Window shopping - Rising investment interest in European retail centres Cross-border property investment grew rapidly in the late 1980s in the UK, but the focus was mainly on city-centre offices rather than shopping centres. Two recent deals suggest that this trend may be changing. First, the Australian Lend Lease company stepped in as lead investor and developer of the proposed Bluewater Park regional shopping centre near Dartford in south-east England. Although the source of much of the money invested is British, Lend Lease, with a large portfolio of shopping centres in Australia and America, will be driving the devel-opment. Second, was the announcement that Pillar Properties, now successfully floated, had set up a Pounds 250m joint venture with SITQ, the largest public pension fund in Canada, to invest in UK shopping centres. The two deals, both concluded in June, are remarkable for their scale, and are just the latest in an accelerating number of investments in UK shopping centres by overseas funds. According to Hillier Parker, surveyors, between 1991 and the first half of this year, 138 deals were concluded involving interests in Britain's 763 shopping centres; in effect, this means that since 1991 there have been ownership changes in 18 per cent of UK shopping centres. Many of these deals involved joint ventures or transfers of less than 100 per cent of the equity. Nevertheless it is a remarkable level of activity during a period when the property market was in the trough of its worst recession in 60 years. The number and scale of the deals also reflects a degree of liquidity which exceeds continental Europe's and is fast approaching that of the US. This investment activity in shopping centres has gathered pace over the past 12 months and has opened up a previously unexplored property investment area to overseas groups, which have responded enthusiastically. Eleven deals since 1991 have involved overseas buyers, with four exceeding Pounds 50m in value. The Netherlands-based fund Waxy, a subsidiary of the Swedish LF Insurance Group, heads the list with four deals valued at between Pounds 5m and Pounds 25m. Another active player has been the US fund Dusco, which is a vehicle for American, British and other institutional investment. Nearly half of the deals involving overseas institutional investors were conducted with British joint venture partners. This unprecedented opportunity for continental European and US investors to snap up shopping centres in the UK has arisen because UK institutions have, for the first time, been prepared to sell. Last year, overseas groups emerged as significant buyers of UK shopping centres; insurance companies and pension funds were net sellers. Some 70 per cent of overseas purchases by value in 1993 were from institutional sellers. In the first six months of this year, UK institutions returned to the market as net buyers and it was scarcely surprising that foreign purchases fell. Investors, particularly insurance and pension funds, are nervous when buying property abroad. Institutions prefer to deal with a similar body in the host country, and particularly welcome a joint venture where ownership and risk are shared and where the host group oversees property management. The combination of a greater willingness to sell on the part of UK investors, and greater interest on the part of overseas funds, means that cross-border investment activity in shopping centres is set to grow, both in Britain and the cont-inent. Funds from France and the Netherlands head the continental European interest, while US funds specialising in shopping centres, such as O'Connor and La Salle, have also been notable investors. La Salle recently set up a joint venture with the UK's Grosvenor Estate. The next step in the development of an international investment sector for shopping centres could be the emergence of a robust market in continental Europe, which has consistently lagged the UK. Many in the industry believed the introduction of the European single market in 1992, which lifted investment barriers between the 12 members of the European Union, would speed up the development of such a market. But no sooner had the process started than the recession took hold, pushing many European property markets into a downturn. Values now appear to be bottoming on the continent and this could trigger investment interest, just as it did in Britain a year ago when the market emerged from recession. With most European property markets showing signs of recovery, the likelihood is that continental investors will spread their investments in several national shopping centre markets. This already happens where the home market is small such as in the Netherlands and Sweden. For a truly liquid cross-border market to emerge, three stages must be successfully negotiated. The first two stages - the construction of a shopping centre either by a developer or a hypermarket operator, and then the sale of the centre to an institution in the host country, usually an insurance company - are at an advanced stage. The third stage is when home institutions are prepared to trade their investments, which is where the market is currently poised. In continental Europe, only France equals Britain in terms of the number of shopping centres. Britain and France also have three times more shopping centre floor space than Spain and Germany, respectively third and fourth in Europe's shopping centre market by size. As a result, market activity is likely to continue to focus on Britain and France. In southern Europe the emphasis is on new development. A growing number of schemes in Italy, Spain and Portugal are looking to attract foreign capital, both debt and equity. In the short-term, it will probably be easier for a cross-border investor to find an outlet by funding a development in southern Europe, rather than buying existing centres, say, in Britain or France. By 2000, the European shopping centre market should be both liquid and international. The author is head of research at Hillier Parker, surveyors</p>

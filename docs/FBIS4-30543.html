			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- A bulletin was  published on June 20 by the Mozambican Committee for Friendship  With the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and  the Maputo City Committee of the Mozambique Liberation Front  Party in joint name on the occasion of the month of  international solidarity with the Korean people.    Printed in it are articles headlined "U.S. imperialists, the  provoker of the Korean war," "U.S. imperialists, sworn enemy of  the Korean people," "U.S. imperialists, murderers," "U.S.  imperialists, disturber of peace", "U.S. imperialism denounced"  and other articles.    Under the title "U.S. imperialists, the provoker of the  Korean war" the bulletin says the United States ignited the  Korean war by instigating the South Korean puppets on the  prearranged script. Whatever intrigues they may resort to, the  U.S. imperialists can never conceal their true color as the  provoker of the war, says the bulletin.</p>

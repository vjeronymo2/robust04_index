			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Press Review: A bone to chew but not much red meat - Ireland Ireland's press seized the opportunity to probe the weaknesses of the country's centre-left coalition government following publication of a report last week into the Irish beef industry. Despite attempts by the government to play down the report ahead of its publication, expectation was high in Dublin that the three-year inquiry  - which had already contributed to the downfall of one government in 1992 - would be critical of the role of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, for granting IPounds 100m (Pounds 99m) of export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq more than six years ago. Irish papers had all dutifully carried statements from Mr Reynolds - ahead of the report's publication but after it had gone to the government - that he had been 'totally vindicated', that he had 'acted in the national interest' and that 'there was no political favouritism in his decisions'. However, there was still the possibility that the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, already weakened by a series of minor political embarrassments, might break. Mr Reynolds' statement, issued by the government spokesman, intensely irritated the deputy prime minister, Mr Dick Spring, who leads Labour, the junior coalition party. In a late-night phone call to the Irish Times from his home in Tralee, County Kerry, after the release of Mr Reynolds' statement, Mr Spring made it clear that it did not reflect the view of the government collectively. Thus the scene was set. Leaks to the mid-market broadsheet Irish Independent seemed to back Mr Reynolds' verdicton the report, but the truth would only be known last Tuesday afternoon when the media received copies of the 1,400-page report. Mr Reynolds' vindication turned out to be something less than total. 'While it does indeed clearly uphold Mr Reynolds' integrity by quashing suggestions that he acted for improper motives, it contains strong criticism of the manner and the effect of the decisions on export credit insurance, which he took in 1987 and 1988,' reported the Irish Times. Interest was focused on Mr Spring's response. After all, it was questions in the Irish parliament by Mr Spring and others that had led to the inquiry in 1991. The deputy prime minister's 1,000-word response was scoured for any direct criticism of Mr Reynolds. However, all that could be found was some implicit blame in a sentence describing the export credit insurance affair as 'a major failure of public policy. . . a policy disaster'. Strong words, but unlikely to bring the government down: 'Hardly the words of a man planning to go it alone,' pointed out the Irish Times in its editorial on the report. The Irish Independent saw them as potentially more serious, remarking in its editorial yesterday: 'It is inconceivable therefore that political relations between the two men will ever be the same again or that the coalition can be anything but a very shaky structure from now on.' On the Wednesday immediately after the report's publication, both Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring moved publicly to play down the possible damage to the coalition from the report. However, their efforts were frustrated by the chairman of the Labour party, Mr Jim Kemmy, who told the Irish Times that the report would have 'serious implications' for the coalition and that the whole issue of the Labour party remaining in coalition would have to be discussed at a parliamentary party meeting later this month. But it got no worse than that. By Thursday the Fianna Fail leading daily tabloid, the Irish Press, had splashed: 'Beef: we stay together' across its front page, reporting that Mr Spring had moved to heal the rift between the two parties. By the end of the week, front-page tension had shifted to the death of three racehorses at a beach race meeting north of Dublin and public anger was being vented on the fact that Goodman International, the beef processor at the centre of the inquiry, was likely to avail itself of the general tax amnesty to avoid paying penalties on tax underpayments uncovered during the inquiry, which had cost Irish taxpayers about Pounds 30m. By yesterday it all appeared to be over, with the Sunday Business Post claiming: 'Senior Labour sources say the party would have no difficulty in voting confidence in the Taoiseach later this month when the Dail meets to debate the outcome of the beef tribunal.' A month is an eternity in politics, particularly the peculiar brand practised on this island, but the whole beef tribunal report seems to have fitted nicely into what the Irish Times described in its editorial of the day before the report's publication as 'the by now familiar model of the Labour-party-in-outrage-for-a-while. First the angry invocation of the party's separate and distinct position; then the hint of threats to match the sense of outrage; later the announcement that, having looked into the matter, everything appears to be alright.'</p>

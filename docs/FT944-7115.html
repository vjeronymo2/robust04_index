			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The Icarus Syndrome - In the Pink / Why hot managers usually melt John Train is chairman of Montrose Advisers, investment counsel in New York. He is the author of The Money Masters and The New Money Masters, and his latest book, The Craft of Investing, has just been published. Hot managers as a class often lose more money than they make, even though they display wonderful records. The reason is that when a hot manager's technique is really working, he can pocket fees of tens of millions of dollars a month - even Dollars 100m from time to time - so the temptation to stay on board the bandwagon too long becomes irresistible. Sooner or later, though, the good times end - often because he is managing too much money for his method to cope with - and the record collapses. By then, though, the hot manager may be running hundreds of times more money than at the time of his wonderful performance. So, in absolute terms, his losses may well exceed his gains. An interesting example surfaced recently when the most famous short-selling partnership in history closed its doors. It was run by a team of brothers, the Feshbachs, in California and, at its peak, reached Dollars 500m dollars. But the burn-out factor eventually took its toll. Performance slumped and the team decided - after waiting much too long - to wind down the partnership. Over its 20-year life, it had a total gain of 10 per cent net of fees, or 0.6 per cent a year compounded. Well, not the end of the world, you say. But in the very first reporting period after its inception, from February 15 to June 30 1985, it jumped 49 per cent, which elevated its record wonderfully thereafter. Yet, at the outset, the capital of the entire partnership was just over Dollars 3m. So, in absolute terms, the gain represented only Dollars 1.5m. In the first quarter after reaching its peak of Dollars 533m, the partnership actually dropped 39 per cent, losing more than Dollars 200m. So while, in percentage terms, those two particular quarters more or less cancelled each other out, in absolute terms the partners had, on balance, lost Dollars 200m. Incidentally, the statistical abuse of running up a wonderful record with a tiny amount of money, so giving the impression of extraordinary skill forever after, is notorious. In its worst variation, managers of families of funds privately incubate hatcheries of little wonders, waiting for a stand-out to emerge with a marvellous early record that can be taken public to form the basis for a throbbing sales campaign. In statistics, this is called 'survivorship bias'. Why does Icarus, so much more heavily-freighted at his apogee than at his take-off, usually tumble to earth? I see four different reasons: his own increased tonnage; an excess of imitation; the reversal of a major trend that the arrival of these same imitators has prolonged unduly; and his own hubris. First, taking on too much money. When a hedge fund artist makes Dollars 503m on a single bet, such as George Soros against sterling, his own reward can be Dollars 100m. Thus, it is inordinately tempting to keep trying. But why does he not just refuse to accept new clients at some point? Interestingly enough, the investment managers preferred by other managers often do just that. Warren Buffet turned his original clientele over to Bill Ruane, whose Sequoia fund has been closed for years now. A number of US money managers recently named Ralph Wanger, of Chicago, as their own choice  -yet, his Acorn Fund has not taken new money for a long time, either. For that matter, why do South American dictators not step down modestly with a few hundred millions instead of clinging on until they are deposed and exiled, killed or put on trial? The answer is, of course, ambition - 'the last infirmity of noble minds'. Money is a form of power and, in matters of power, most men are insatiable. It seems as important to make the next billion as it was to make the first million. Thus, the skilful manager of a Dollars 100m partnership might become the hopelessly overloaded administrator of Dollars 10bn. As to imitators, the forces are obvious. Almost all hot managers once worked for someone else, and split off to make their fortunes. Their own lieutenants have every incentive to do the same thing. When the number two man in Whizzkid Partners hangs up his own shingle, he does not fail to invoke the success of the predecessor organisation and suggest that the new fund, being so much smaller, will be more manageable. This is very possibly true so the clones, and close copies, proliferate. But to go on achieving their prodigious results, they assume increasing risk, skating on thinner and thinner ice. Eventually, it must break. Suppose, for instance, that the big idea of the moment is small-cap stocks. Of these, there is only a limited supply. Suppose further that, at the outset of the move, they were underpriced. But as new fund after new fund piles in, the small-cap boom will, by the nature of things, be reinforced until it has gone much too far. Nothing exceeds like success] So the collapse, when it comes, is devastating. As to hubris, we all see it around us in every domain. 'La fortune se plait a nous faire de ces coups/Tout vaingueur insolent a sa perte travaille,'* says La Fontaine. After enough success, one fancies oneself god-like, stops concentrating and becomes overbearing and jealous. But Someone Up There, I observe, notices with a frown: 'Oh, he thinks that, does he? He says that, does he?' Zap] I think that today's Icarus syndrome - the spawning we see of ever more supposedly hot managers, and hot managers of hot managers, is an obvious symptom of a bull market blow-off phase. Why? Because it happens only in a time of unreasonable expectations, when the public is not investing but speculating. But times of unreasonable expectations are dangerous to your wealth. *'Fortune likes to deal us those blows/Every proud victor works his own undoing.'</p>

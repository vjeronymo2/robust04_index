			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Surprising reversal of fortunes: The return to power of the former communists - The fall of the Wall The return to power at free elections of politicians with roots in the pre-1989 communist past counts as one of the most fasci-nating aspects of the post-Soviet world. It is particularly remarkable because it has occurred in countries where the rehabilitation of remodelled former communists might have been least expected. These include Lithuania, invaded by the Soviet army in 1940 and forcibly incorporated with the other Baltic states into the Soviet Union. Last year Algirdas Brazauskas, former communist leader, was elected president. His renamed Democratic Labour party had previously trounced the constitutional nationalists in parliamentary elections. In Hungary, where citizens fought Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest in 1956, Mr Gyula Horn's socialist party, heir to the Communist party, won a majority of seats in this year's parliamentary elections. And in Poland, which had been in a state of semi-insurrection against communist rule for most of the 1980s, Mr Alexander Kwasniewski's Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the Communist party's successor, is the largest party in the ruling coalition. Part of the explanation lies in the nature of the last communist governments in these countries. They were led by pragmatic, nationalistic, reform-minded leaders, permitted, even encouraged, by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to embark on structural political and economic changes unthinkable under his predecessors. In countries such as Hungary in 1989, the younger generation of communist leaders were people who had been doing deals and making compromises with their citizens much like ordinary politicians for years. The process was often corrupt and morally corrupting. It was summed up in bitingly accurate jokes such as 'they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work' or 'he who does not steal from the state robs his own family'. For ordinary people, this involved trying to live a private inner and family life and getting around the system as much as possible. For the leaders, it meant conceding as much freedom to their peoples as Moscow would turn a blind eye to, for the sake of peace and quiet. This tacit compact between rulers and ruled, which involved millions of ordinary citizens in moral and material compromises, was the main reason why the revolutions of 1989 turned out to be mainly non-violent and surprisingly lacking in vengeance. Even so, the speed of rehabilitation of former communists has surprised even those who have benefited. Hungary's Mr Horn fought as a communist against the rebels in the 1956 uprising against the Soviet-backed communist regime. While he could claim credit for opening the Austro-Hungarian border section of the iron curtain as foreign minister in 1989, many were surprised to see him back in power within five years of the fall of the Berlin Wall. They were also surprised by Poland's Mr Kwasniewski. Five years ago, he was one of the closest collaborators of Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Poland's last communist prime minister during the round-table negotiations with Solidarity that led to defeat for the communists in the subsequent elections. But in September 1993, Mr Kwasniewski's SLD became the largest party in the Polish parliament and part of the ruling coalition. Since then, he has been stealthily working towards a realignment of Polish politics, bringing the social democratic wing of the former communists into alliance with the liberal free-market and centrist factions of the Solidarity movement to create a stable, democratic centre/left party. In much of post-communist Europe, the electoral success of the former communists can be attributed - at least partly - to the failure of the politicians who took power after the collapse of the Soviet empire. The new politicians who have emerged from the rubble of communism were inevitably inexperienced amateurs. Most were dissident academics, intellectuals or artists, such as Lithuania's Vytautis Landsbergis, a music teacher; Hungary's Jozsef Antall, a history teacher; or Poland's Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a catholic intellectual and publisher. They inherited bankrupt economies, passive bureaucracies responding only to commands, and a long wish-list of expectations. Widening income differentials between the new entrepreneurs and the unemployed, old and sick swiftly led to disillusion with change among significant parts of the electorate that the former communists have been swift to tap. The country that has proved most impervious to the blandishments of recycled communists is the Czech Republic. Much of the credit for its swift transition to a market economy goes to the political skill and economic clear-mindedness of Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister since mid-1992. Mr Klaus, contemptuous of what he calls 'irresponsible intellectuals' with their hankering after a soft 'third way' between the rigours of capitalism and the blandishments of socialism, hoisted the standard of balanced budgets, low inflation and mass privatisation. Opinion polls indicate that he and his party will probably return to power after the 1996 elections. In addition to the problems of emergence from totalitarianism and collapse of the integrated Soviet economy, many of the former communist countries faced the difficult task of state-building. Millions of people who had been subject to powerful empires - Hapsburg, Ottoman or Romanov - in pre-communist days found that the collapse of the Soviet empire gave them the opportunity of self-determination. Ukraine and Belarus in Europe and the central Asian republics for the first time enjoyed independent statehood. It is hardly surprising under the circumstances that the combination of political inexperience, reawakened ethnic and cultural identity and economic chaos overwhelmed most of the hesitant politicians and economic reformers who bravely set out on the uncharted voyage of transition in 1989. Neither is it surprising that the countries that have moved furthest and fastest along the path to 'normality' are those with the strongest national identities, the biggest middle classes and most developed economies in the pre-second world war period. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic states retained distant memories of independent national status and democracy that had been snuffed out after the war. The greatest problems remain in Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, which were heading for a form of constitutional monarchy before the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. They have no democratic tradition to draw upon in rebuilding their societies. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is clear that the return to political 'normality' and reintegration into the world economy is the task of decades, and probably generations. This is the third in a series on the consequences of the fall of communism. Previous articles appeared on November 9 and 11</p>

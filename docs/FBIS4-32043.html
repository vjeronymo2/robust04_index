			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "TA SR, ao": "Lone Soldier in the Field; </F> Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Social Democratic Party in  Slovakia on Disagreements Within the Party"]    [Text] Bratislava--"Chairman Jaroslav Volf knows very well  that the situation in the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia  [SDSS] is very tense," SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby stated  in an interview for the TA SR, adding that he cannot be bought,  which the SDSS chairman knows very well.    Speaking about his attitude toward the SDSS's close  cooperation with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], Hruby  said that it was exactly the same as that of [late SDSS  Chairman] Alexander Dubcek. Hruby noted that, during elections  to the SDSS Central Council at the last party congress, he had  received the largest number of votes of all candidates. In  spite of that and in spite of his being SDSS deputy chairman, he  had been offered the 46th place on the joint slate of candidates  [of the Left Choice coalition of four left-wing, agrarian, and  green parties]. He added that not every SDSS member was buying  the honey-sweet rhetoric [not further specified), which is why  it is quite possible that the party will split into two  entities. He said that it was questionable whether Jaroslav  Volf's friends from the SDL would still be interested in the  Social Democratic appendage that will stay with Volf.    Yesterday, we asked SDSS Chairman Jaroslav Volf: "Your party  is supposedly falling apart. Is that true?"    He replied: "It is possible that some people harbor this  wish. Farmers and Greens had already been targeted, and I  suppose it is now the Social Democrats' turn.... I believe,  however, that this is just the effort of certain people from the  outside to exploit the personal disappointment of individuals  who have not been successful on the slate of candidates or,  possibly, a case of failure to comprehend that the preservation  of the party's identity is not incompatible with a coalition,  which can, moreover, spread Social Democratic ideas and give  them much greater publicity and a chance also in parliament and  the government. I cannot but assess these efforts by  individuals as an attempt that will most likely not meet with a  favorable response in our party. Quite the contrary. These  people are actually sealing their own fate."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Sarajevo's mainly Moslem  population is skeptical about NATO's latest warning that it  might attack Serb artillery positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  OSLOBODJENJE daily reported Wednesday.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation declaration on  Tuesday  is "not very clear and even contradictory," the paper said  adding that "it carries no ultimatum, thus no firm decision to  end Milosevic's campaign by the only possible means -- force."  Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Serbia.    The paper added that the mainly Moslem Bosnian army "would  suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO threat" and that  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has also dismissed the  warning. The NATO declaration came at the end of the alliance's  two-day summit Tuesday.</p>

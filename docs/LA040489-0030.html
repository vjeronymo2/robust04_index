			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSHA PROBE HELPS SUITS, LOCKHEED WORKERS SAY  </P> <P> Mark Gillaspie , a 29-year-old La Crescenta man, is one of 88 current and  former Lockheed workers who are suing the big aerospace company, alleging that  their exposure to harmful chemicals at Lockheed's Burbank manufacturing plant  made them seriously ill.  </P> <P> Gillaspie, who went on medical leave last fall complaining of rashes,  headaches, memory loss and other maladies, has yet to have his day in court.  The workers' eight lawsuits, the first of which was filed more than two years  ago in Superior Court in Burbank, are still pending, and no trial dates have  been set.  </P> <P> Yet Gillaspie said last week that he and his fellow workers are already  victorious -- thanks to the federal government.  </P> <P> "I myself feel that our case has been won," Gillaspie said. "Whether it was a  mistake or not, the fact still remains we were exposed to dangerous chemicals  and OSHA has proved it."  </P> <P> OSHA is the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which March 24  cited the Lockheed plant for 440 alleged violations of safety rules and  proposed $1.5 million in fines. The citations followed a four-month  investigation of some sections of the plant that began last September.  </P> <P> The sprawling plant is where Lockheed is building, among other things, a  top-secret stealth fighter. Stealth aircraft typically are made with  plastic-like composites -- materials made of chemicals and fibers that are  lightweight, strong and that absorb radar signals, making the planes harder to  detect than metal-bodied jets.  </P> <P> Lockheed, which is reviewing OSHA's report, can contest all or some of the  citations before a review commission. The company also is defending itself  against the lawsuits, some of which allege that Lockheed was negligent and  intentionally concealed the fact that workers were being exposed to dangerous  chemicals.  </P> <P> If many of OSHA's allegations are upheld, the question becomes: What effect  will OSHA's report have on the workers' pending lawsuits?  </P> <P> That answer could be: Plenty. If the workers can first establish in court that  Lockheed "fraudulently concealed" the chemicals' danger from the workers, as  the workers are trying to do, "then they can bring the OSHA results in to  buttress their case that there were indeed unsafe working conditions," said  Merle Rabine, head of the California Applicants Attorneys Assn., a group of  lawyers who represent employees in workers' compensation cases.  </P> <P> Rabine, who is not involved in the Lockheed case, said the "fraudulent  concealment" aspect is important because it is a test that often must be met  for an employee-vs.-employer lawsuit to go forward.  </P> <P> In theory, workers' compensation systems are supposed to prevent such suits.  Workers' compensation is meant to be the "exclusive remedy" for employees  looking to get reimbursed for illness or injury caused at the work site. And in  California, workers' compensation is a "no-fault" system, which means that a  worker's claim depends on whether the injury or sickness was caused at work --  regardless of who was at fault.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Further Corroboration'  </P> <P> But if an employee can establish that the employer fraudulently concealed the  cause of the injury, or engaged in "serious and willful misconduct" that led to  the injury, then an employee's suit can proceed, Rabine said.  </P> <P> Timothy A. Larson, an Encino lawyer who is representing many of the Lockheed  workers in their lawsuit, said the courts will see the OSHA report "as further  corroboration and verification of what our clients had indicated regarding  their health."  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman James Ragsdale acknowledged that "it seems possible" that  OSHA's report could find its way into the courtroom. "But Lockheed is not in a  position to speculate about what effect any OSHA findings may have on any of  the litigation that's now pending," he said.  </P> <P> About 150 workers' compensation claims have also been filed against Lockheed by  workers at the Burbank plant, also on grounds they were harmed at the facility.  </P> <P> Lockheed's Burbank plant is actually 200 buildings spread around the city with  about 14,000 employees, with some of its biggest facilities located just east  of the Burbank airport. Some of the buildings can be toured by the public.  </P> <P> But other Lockheed buildings are top secret, and workers there are prohibited  from discussing any classified projects. Even in their lawsuits, the workers  did not spell out what their jobs entailed if they worked in secret areas. a  </P> <P> One of the lawsuits listed all the chemicals that allegedly caused the workers'  illnesses as being found in Lockheed's Building 351. Many of the alleged  violations found by OSHA also were located in Building 351 and Building 199.  </P> <P> Lockheed's Ragsdale would say only that both buildings are used in  manufacturing and that other information is not disclosed because the buildings  are involved "in classified Department of Defense projects."  </P> <P> But Gillaspie and other workers suing Lockheed said that in the mid-1980s some  of the contents of the buildings were extremely dangerous. There, employees  worked with poisonous chemicals and other substances without protective  clothing, proper warnings on how to use the materials and adequate ventilation,  they alleged.  </P> <P> "Pure silver and pure copper was being sprayed out of paint guns," Gillaspie  asserted. "Nobody thought a damn thing about it, including me."  </P> <P> OSHA's 461-page report found dozens of instances in which Lockheed allegedly  failed to correctly label drums of hazardous chemicals on the site, failed to  ensure that workers wore gloves and had other adequate protection from the  substances, and failed to record illnesses and injuries that occurred at the  plant.  </P> <P> OSHA also allegedly found several containers of chemicals unmarked or poorly  labeled. In one instance, OSHA said there were three 30-gallon drums and one  55-gallon drum in Building 199 that contained a surface-coating mix of various  dangerous chemicals, but they were labeled only as "skybond mix" and did not  display "appropriate hazard warnings," OSHA said.  </P> <P> The "very nature and sheer volume" of the alleged safety violations has  prompted OSHA to send its inspectors back for a "wall-to-wall" inspection of  the entire Burbank plant.  </P> <P> Some workers expressed surprise that OSHA still found hundreds of alleged  violations more than two years after the workers' lawsuits asserted that there  were problems at the site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeared on 'Nightline'  </P> <P> Lockheed "knew OSHA was coming in, had a good length of time to prepare and  they screwed up royally," said Clyde Glasser in Burbank, who retired in 1985  after more than 30 years with Lockheed and who also is a plaintiff in the  lawsuits. "Just think what would have happened if they would have looked in  1985."  </P> <P> Gillaspie criticized OSHA for not immediately responding to the workers'  lawsuits and says the agency stepped in only after Gillaspie appeared on ABC  News' "Nightline" television program last Sept. 22 to comment on the Lockheed  case.  </P> <P> "They were embarrassed on national television," Gillaspie said. "They were  exposed for not doing their job."  </P> <P> Frank Gravitt, head of OSHA's Los Angeles office and who led the inspection of  Lockheed, noted that until July, 1987, responsibility for enforcing job safety  and health laws in California's private sector was handled by state officials.  At that point, federal OSHA officials took over, but it was not until August,  1988, that complaints about Lockheed's site began coming to OSHA, Gravitt said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR, FIRE, WATER AND EARTH  </P> <P> At the city collection of toxic wastes on Saturday, Aug. 19, in Granada Hills .  . . . I participated in a six-block-long line of bumper-to-bumper cars for at  least one hour to deliver approximately 10 cans of old paint which had been  stored in our garage for years. The 2,400 people who deposited the toxic wastes  were only a drop in the bucket compared to the many people who must be storing  similar materials. One pauses to wonder why there are not several permanent,  well-advertised, easily accessible sites throughout Los Angeles where one can  deposit wastes instead of storing them for a one-time date that may not be  convenient for all. Such a system would encourage everyone to dispose of toxic  wastes in an environmentally safe way.  </P> <P> SUZANNE ST. MARIE  </P> <P> Winnetka  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: VME Group expects return to the black VME Group, the big construction equipment producer owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, will move back into profit this year after losing Dollars 94m in 1992, said Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive. Mr Johannesson attributed the recovery partly to the devaluation of the Swedish krone, but mainly to the restructuring of the group, which has reduced the workforce by 4,500 to just 6,500 over the past two years. He was speaking on the eve of an announcement by VME and Japan's Hitachi Construction Machinery on an agreement to establish a joint venture in the rigid dumptruck business. The two companies said in March they had signed a letter of intent to form the venture, which they see as a vehicle to strengthen their strategic positions in the construction and mining industries. Today's announcement will disclose that VME will transfer its rigid dumptruck business to a new US-based company, Euclid-Hitachi Heavy Equipment. Hitachi will take a 'substantial minority stake' in the new company in two steps, starting with a 19.5 per cent holding to be implemented on December 31, a day before the new venture becomes operational. The agreement goes further than was at first suggested. Hitachi will also distribute VME's Volvo BM articulated dumptrucks and large wheel loaders in Japan. However, Mr Johannesson stressed that Hitachi and VME remained separate and were co-operating only in specific areas.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air France waits for Czech talks outcome Air France was last night anxiously awaiting the conclusion of negotiations in Prague to sell its 19.1 per cent stake in Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) to Konsolidacni Banka, the Czech state-controlled bank, for between Dollars 25m and Dollars 30m. The French airline, which acquired the stake in 1992 and is under acute financial pressure after a strike last autumn, has for weeks been embroiled in negotiations with the Czech authorities over the share sale. The two sides had originally hoped to announce terms of a final agreement yesterday afternoon, but the talks continued into the evening. Meanwhile, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which also owns 19.1 per cent of CSA, was also attempting to conclude negotiations with the Czech government for the latter to take over Air France's guarantee for 70 per cent of its stake. EBRD is understood to be hoping to hold on to its shares providing the Czech authorities agree to accept the old Air France guarantee. However, the bank, which has written off 30 per cent of the investment, may reconsider its position if the guarantee is not renewed.</p>

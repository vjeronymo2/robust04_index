			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RELIEVER DAVIS GETS STARTER CALL  </P> <P> Relief ace Mark Davis, a Cy Young Award winner at San Diego last season but a  major disappointment for Kansas City this year, is going to get a chance at  starting.  </P> <P> The Royals announced that Davis will start in Sunday's game with the Tigers,  his first appearance as a starter since June 19, 1987, when he was with the San  Francisco Giants.  </P> <P> "It's an opportunity to get him some innings in a different role," said Manager  John Wathan. "You keep looking for that right button to push for that switch to  go on, and maybe this will be it."  </P> <P> Wathan said he does not know if Davis will move into the starting rotation if  he does well. He said it would be hard to find a regular spot for him if  everybody on the pitching staff is healthy.  </P> <P> Mark Gubicza was held out of his scheduled start Tuesday and isn't scheduled to  pitch again until after the All-Star break. Storm Davis was scratched from his  scheduled start against the Tigers Thursday and he was to have a sore knuckle  on his right index finger examined today in Kansas City.  </P> <P> As a reliever, Davis' record this year is 1-5 and his ERA is an unflattering  5.40.  </P></p>

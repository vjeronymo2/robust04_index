			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS IRWINDALE;  </P> <P> 7 CAMPAIGN FOR 3 SEATS ON COUNCIL;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: CANDIDATES ARE DISCOVERING THAT VOTERS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE CITY'S  $10-MILLION ATTEMPT TO LAND THE RAIDERS.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Raiders may be bound for Oakland, but they're still casting a  long shadow over Irwindale politics.  </P> <P> As seven City Council candidates go door to door with campaign flyers and  buttons, they're learning that residents haven't forgotten about the $10  million the city paid to Raiders owner Al Davis more than two years ago in an  ultimately unsuccessful attempt to land the team.  </P> <P> "I had something to do with bringing (the Raiders) in," said Councilman Joseph  Breceda, one of three incumbents running in the April 10 election. "(Voters)  probably will blame me for trying to bring them in."  </P> <P> With only 551 registered voters in Irwindale, the candidates face another  challenge unique to the tiny city: the complex web of family alliances and  rivalries that has governed local politics since the city's incorporation in  1957.  </P> <P> The candidates for the three council seats are: Breceda; Councilman Robert  Diaz; Councilman Patricio Miranda; Fred Barbosa, whose lawsuit against the city  barred officials from working on the Raiders stadium project for more than a  year; Mike Miranda, who is Councilman Miranda's nephew; Jacquelyn Quintero,  Breceda's niece; and Joseph Tapia, the brother of former Mayor Art Tapia.  </P> <P> Breceda, a council member since 1972, refused to discuss his candidacy, saying,  "I'm not committing myself on anything. The people have a lot of respect for  me. I was born and raised in Irwindale. I belong to the VFW, the American  Legion, the senior citizens."  </P> <P> Diaz, 39, has served one term on the City Council. A teacher at Bell Gardens  Elementary School, Diaz said he is concerned about the "unnecessary legal fees"  the city paid to negotiate with the Raiders and to defend itself against  lawsuits filed to block the stadium project.  </P> <P> "For example, we have two city attorneys, in essence," Diaz said, referring to  City Atty. Charles Martin, and Orange County lawyer R. Zaiden Corrado, who was  hired to spearhead the Raiders deal and retained as a consultant on other  projects. The Raiders bid dragged on for 18 months, until March 12, when  Oakland officials announced Davis was moving his team to their city.  </P> <P> "A lot of time and attention has been diverted from more positive aspects in  the community," Diaz said.  </P> <P> Patricio Miranda, who served on the city's first Planning Commission in 1957  and has been a councilman since 1961, is running for his eighth four-year term.  While on the council, he said, he has seen development and redevelopment  transform Irwindale into a thriving center of industry and commerce.  </P> <P> "Irwindale has progressed greatly," Miranda said in a statement. "I have been  able to . . . vote for many of the projects which can be seen as you look  around Irwindale."  </P> <P> In addition to the challenge he is facing from the other candidates, Miranda  has another opponent of sorts: Fred Lyte, Irwindale's former redevelopment  consultant who was fired in late 1988 after a falling out with Miranda.  </P> <P> Recently, Lyte mailed letters to Irwindale residents in which he criticizes  Miranda and reveals details of a conflict-of-interest lawsuit filed last year  against the councilman by a resident. The lawsuit claims Miranda should have  resigned from the city's redevelopment agency when it voted in 1987 to approve  a land-lease agreement that stood to benefit him financially. Miranda abstained  from the vote and has denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Miranda said he believes voters will disregard Lyte's mail campaign. "A lot of  the things in his letters, a lot of people in Irwindale know it's not true,"  Miranda said.  </P> <P> Barbosa, 41, an operating engineer for Pomona-based Diversified Materials, is  probably best known for obstructing Irwindale's multimillion-dollar bid to land  the Raiders.  </P> <P> In 1987, Barbosa, along with Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and a  group of Irwindale residents, sued Irwindale to try to block the Raiders  stadium project. A judge barred Irwindale from further negotiations until it  completed an environmental impact report, which took more than a year.  </P> <P> In his campaign literature, Barbosa attacked the City Council for giving Davis  $10 million up front but failing to put together a viable stadium project.  </P> <P> "Residents ask me, 'How can you run if you sued the city?' " Barbosa said. "I  tell them I did it for the good of the community."  </P> <P> Barbosa said he also wants to improve emergency services during major disasters  and speed up adoption of the city's budget.  </P> <P> Mike Miranda, 26, Patricio Miranda's nephew and son of Irwindale Police Chief  Julian Miranda, is making his first run for public office. He said he's  "shooting for independent votes."  </P> <P> "I'm going to get a lot of them," he said. Miranda, who runs a professional  golf shop at the Yorba Linda Country Club, said support from his uncle's allies  may be thin because he received a $16,000 college scholarship from a private  fund set up for Irwindale youths by Lyte and others.  </P> <P> "My family knows I chitchat with Fred," he said. "People hold that against me.  They think if I'm hired I'm going to bring back Fred Lyte." Miranda added that  he has not received and doesn't expect his uncle's endorsement.  </P> <P> He said he wants to "tighten the reins" on Irwindale city government, which he  criticized as "ineffective" because some council members are related to city  employees and department heads.  </P> <P> Quintero, 31, a banker running for council for the fourth time, said she wants  to improve employee morale in City Hall and require evaluations of all city  employees. (Only police officers are now reviewed.) She also wants to tighten  code enforcement.  </P> <P> Quintero, Breceda's niece, said Irwindale's licensing procedure "has been lax  to the point of many, many businesses being without permits." As an example,  she pointed to CalMat Co., a construction materials firm that for a time  earlier this year hauled dirt from one gravel pit to another without a city  permit, prompting complaints from residents and officials in Baldwin Park,  which borders one of the pits.  </P> <P> The seventh candidate, Joseph Tapia, 65, is a park maintenance employee for  Irwindale, and the brother of former Mayor Tapia. He said he plans to retire  from the Parks Department this year. If elected to the council, he said he  would work to establish a child-care center and promote housing for senior  citizens.  </P> <P> Tapia said voters are "tired of lawsuits and stuff like that. I don't think  it's in good taste. They were spending a lot of money when they first started  with the Raiders."  </P></p>

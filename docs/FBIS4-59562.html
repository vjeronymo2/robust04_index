			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman (Petra)--The Jordanian and Syrian governments  Sunday [15 May] signed the minutes of meetings of the Joint  Jordanian-Syrian Economic Committee which concluded in Amman  earlier in the day. The documents were signed on the Jordanian  side by Industry and Trade Minister Rima Khalaf and on the  Syrian side by Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Muhammad  al-'Imadi. Ms. Khalaf told reporters following the signing  ceremony that the agreement between the two countries is  considered the first step towards tackling the imbalance in  trade between the two countries. Ms. Khalaf stressed that the  committee's meetings dealt with some problems impeding the flow  of Jordanian commodities to the Syrian market. The two  countries, she said, have agreed to the need of revising lists  of exchanged commodities. "We tackled at the committee's  meetings issues relating to transport... and banking  arrangements," said Ms. Khalaf adding that the two sides have  agreed to set up experts committee to prepare a future work plan  for Jordanian-Syrian economic cooperation.

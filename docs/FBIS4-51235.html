			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special contribution" by Kan Cheng (1626 2110: "Why Has </F> Chris Patten Been Back to London so Often")]    [Text] Hong Kong 22 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten is back in London for consultations again.  This is his ninth trip to London in the two years since he took  office in Hong Kong in July 1992; on average, once every three  months or so.    There has been much talk about Chris Patten's frequent  return  to Britain recently in the British media. For example, Chris  Patten's frequent return to Britain reflects "his obvious  restlessness with his office as Hong Kong governor," he "still  cannot forget about the British political arena," "his strong  love for Westminster (the British Parliament) has not faded,"  "he no longer brags about having no intention to return to the  British political arena," "he is picking up the topic that under  whatever circumstances it is impossible for him to return to the  British political arena," and "loves to talk about British  politics and how to govern the country with British reporters."    As usual, Chris Patten has denied these rumors about  himself.  Some political analysts in London also believe that there is  little chance of Chris Patten returning to the British political  arena at the present stage, because "he really cannot find any  way which is honorable and helpful to return to the British  political arena."    Then, how should we account for his frequent trips to  Britain? Is it really true that "he has nothing else to do in  Hong Kong," and is thus returning to Britain "to enjoy a  leisurely and carefree excursion," as some British media have  put it?    That obviously does not conform to Chris Patten's  inclination, which is unwilling to be lonely.    People notice that Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July  1992 to take office, but by mid-September, he had already taken  his first trip back to London for consultations; on his return  he delivered his government address on 6 October, in which he  presented a constitutional reform package for Hong Kong, which  consequentially sparked Sino-British polemics.    In its wake, every time Chris Patten returns to Britain,  there is some new action upon his return to Hong Kong. For  example, the gazettal of his constitutional reform package, the  termination of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for  Hong Kong 1994/1995 elections, the tabling of his constitutional  reform package to the Legislative Council...and so forth, and  every action has caused shock and has added a great obstacle to  a stable transition for Hong Kong.    Chris Patten's last trip to London was on 30 March this  year.  Shortly after his return to Hong Kong, the British Parliament's  Select Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report on  Sino-British relations, which "proposes" that the British Hong  Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and an  "organization to supervise human rights" which would continue  after 1997, and the British Government and the UN Human Rights  Commission would "jointly supervise the conditions and  development of human rights in Hong Kong after 1997."    Indeed, there may be some truth in Chris Patten planning to  sound out political conditions in Britain in an attempt to find  a way to promote himself during his current trip to London as is  being speculated, but the focus of his activities is likely to  be on consulting officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office on the issue of "setting up a human rights commission in  Hong Kong."    Noteworthy is the fact that a high-ranking Chinese official  in charge of Hong Kong affairs indicated that, just like "a  drinker's heart is not in the cup," the person who made the  proposal to set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong aims  to jeopardize the power framework established in the Basic Law,  and the proposal "will consequently form `a weird embryo'."    Under such circumstances, people wish that Chris Patten  would  really confine himself to "enjoying an increasingly leisurely  and carefree excursion with each passing day." However,  experience tells us that a storm is likely to be conjured up in  London, which will eventually attack Hong Kong again.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: New-town project hits Bangkok Land Bangkok Land, the Thai property developer owned by the Sino-Thai Kanjanapas family, has reported a 76 per cent fall in first-quarter net profits, to Bt333.6m (Dollars 13.34m) from Bt1.4bn a year ago, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The company's Muang Tong Thani new town on the outskirts on Bangkok has been a drain on resources, and there was also a foreign exchange loss of some Bt350m. Nevertheless, analysts expect the company to show a marginal improvement in full-year net profits.</p>

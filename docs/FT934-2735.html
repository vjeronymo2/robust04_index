			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Books: Across cultures HOLDER OF THE WORLD by Bharati Mukherjee Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 286 pages The idea on which this novel is constructed is sensationally good. An American woman, a 20th century operator in bankable antiquities, has developed a personal interest in a series of Mughal miniatures. These depicting the Salem-bibi, a woman from New England who travelled with a husband as far as the Coromandel coast and ended dramatically in the Court of a Hindu raja subsequently slaughtered by Aurangzeb. The Salem-bibi, whose original name was Hannah Easton, is associated with a diamond, now lost, called the Emperor's Tear. The modern American (Beigh) has a would-be client for it, every bit as piratical as the early East India Company adventurers. This in itself would be enough for a fine tale of search, identity and the parallels between different lives in different eras, but Bharati Mukherjee (ex-Calcutta, now living in California) goes far beyond such traditional fare. Beigh lives with Venn, a scientist of Indian origin who is into computers, data bases and virtual reality. Venn's Project (X-2989) is to recreate an entire day from the recent past - 'finally a use for sensory and informational overload . . . In five years, they'll be able to interpose me, or you, over the grid for upwards of ten seconds.' So, a species of time-travel. But we never hear much more about Venn because his obsession is to be a metaphor for Beigh's own recreation of Hannah Easton's life from disparate records in London, Massachusetts and India - the imaginative projection of any passionate researcher. Only at the end does metaphor elide with reality in a scene in a computer lab which should be the climax, but which instead descends into the bathos of a supernatural melodrama. There is much in this book to admire and savour. The evocation of both the New England world and that of late 17th century Madras, each with its different complement of exotic, feared Indians, is memorable. We feel the awful tension between the world of Salem, where sin is constantly to be sniffed out, and the real horrors that lie just beyond the plantations in the form of raiding, scalping tribes. We feel the appeal, to a girl raised in such an environment, of the buccaneering English imposter who carries her off; the stages by which she reaches the long, surf-tossed beach of Madras are entirely convincing - 'I watch my convoy of East Zndlamen voyage across (Venn's) computer screen, freed or space and time . . . The maiden ladies from Lancashire, caulkers and coopers, soldiers and sail-makers, gunners, cabin boys, two-headed freak dogs, horses, goats, hogs . . . plum puddings, vats of pea soup, mutton . . . lemons, rum, beer, dysentery, scurvy, compressed into a one-second long video model.' Nowhere does the author invoke Joyce, but her intentions are basically the same brave ones as the creator of Ulysses. Why then does this novel, for all its intelligence and vision, not really take off? Mukherjee seems overawed by the form she herself has imposed on the raw material available. She is a writer who has always strung her novels and stories between different cultures: the idea that an individual, by changing countries, may move through separate incarnations, runs through her work like a fable for Hindu belief. But such juxtapositions should speak for themselves, and in The Holder of the World they are not allowed to; the author is constantly at one's elbow. Having given Hannah a mother who elopes with an Indian brave, she prompts 'Her embroidery gave away the conflict . . . She knew she must deny all she'd seen on the night of her mother's disappearance' - and continues to prompt throughout the novel. Hannah's fate is so heavily flagged that all element of gradual revelation, that basis of story telling, is removed. This might not matter if we were more involved at a human level, but we are not. With a stylish assumption of scholarship, the author confines herself to what she could plausibly have discovered about the Salem-bibi from documents, but this results in a picture which, in spite of all the busy interpretation, remains one-dimensional, nerveless. Finally we cannot really care what happens to Hannah; she seems, in any case, well-equipped for the brutal circles in which she moves. Since the novel-form has to be continually re-invented in order to remain alive, I wish this spectacular example well. But, to quote the author herself, 'K-2989 is one of the discoveries more exciting in principle than in application.' What, having got this false excitement out of her system, will she write next?</p>

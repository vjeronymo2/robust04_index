The letter was passed over on Monday [21 February] by the  Russian ambassador to Riga, sources at the Russian Foreign  Ministry's press and information department told ITAR-TASS here  today.    The Russian president stressed the priority of settlement of  the citizenship problem in Latvia with a bilateral agreement.  In his words, integration of ethnic Russians with public life  of the independent Latvian Republic would open up a new chapter  in relations with Latvia, "with which Russia is connected with  thousands of ties and wants to have good-neighbourly relations  and mutually beneficial relationship".    According to the letter, the Russian and Latvian delegations  are working to achieve progress in the elaboration of a treaty  on Russian troops withdrawal, agreements on social protection of  Russian servicemen, military pensioners and members of their  families, as well as on the Russian radar station in Skrunda.    The signing of these documents would boost settlement of  other complicated issues of bilateral relations, stressed the  president's letter.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Brainwaves speak out IT may sound like something out of a science fiction film, but researchers in Australia are developing ways of using the latest neural network computer technology to analyse brainwaves in such a way that people who are unable to talk or move can still communicate. Richard Clark, a lecturer in psychology at Flinders University, in Adelaide, is using the artificial intelligence technique to interpret the electrical activity in the brain to give simple answers, such as 'yes' or 'no'. Although it is relatively easy to measure electrical activity in the brain, each person's brain waves are as individual as fingerprints. Neural networks, however, learn the various brainwave patterns for each person, so they can teach themselves to recognise the responses. Patients wearing the specially devised electro-cap, containing devices to measure brainwaves, are trained to think simple answers in response to a series of questions. Having conquered a basic vocabulary, Clark is now aiming to expand the lexicon. Flinders University: Australia, 8 201 3911.</p>

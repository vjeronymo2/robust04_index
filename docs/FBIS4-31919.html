			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Ministry Spokesman Radko Vlaykov replied to  a question from BTA regarding reports in certain mass media in  Turkey, according to which part of the Turkish contingent of  Blue Helmets is supposed to be transported to Bosnia-Herzegovina  on civil aircraft flying over Bulgarian territory.    In his reply, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman  stated  that this issue has not been officially raised with Bulgaria.  He said that all our neighbors have been repeatedly informed of  the Bulgarian position regarding the conflict in former  Yugoslavia. He recalled some of the elements of this position:  nonparticipation in the conflict, whether directly or  indirectly, including under the aegis of the United Nations, and  appeals made to neighboring Balkan states to refrain from  participation in the conflict. He said that a nationwide  consensus exists in Bulgaria on this issue, which is shared by  the political forces, the president, parliament, and the  government, and no grounds exist for altering this position.</p>

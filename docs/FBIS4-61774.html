			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Reactors To Be Peaceful"] </F>   [Text] Tomsk -- Of the five nuclear reactors at the  Siberian Chemical Combine in the city of Seversk (Tomsk-7) only  two are currently operational. They are continuing to produce  weapons-grade plutonium while simultaneously providing heat and  power for the oblast center. Shutting down the reactors would  have catastrophic consequences for the economy and everyday life  in the oblast....    A Russian Government delegation headed by V. Mikhaylov,  minister of atomic energy, recently visited Washington. Along  with foreign specialists it elaborated a plan for shutting down  reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium once alternative  sources of power and heat supply have begun to function. In  this connection an intergovernmental agreement will be signed on  ending the military use of plutonium produced after the  conclusion of the agreement.    Russia proposes modifying reactors to enable them to be  switched to a purely peaceful power generating system.  Agreements are all very well, but what is the alternative? For  Tomsk it could be four power stations burning natural gas. In  Seversk it is planned to modernize the heat and electric power  station, shutting down the gas turbines. I. Petukhov, deputy  chief engineer of the Siberian Chemical Combine, believes that  there are still plenty of weaknesses in the plan. It will cost  $250 million to bring four gas-turbine stations on stream for  the oblast center. Another $120 million will be needed to  increase the gas pipelines' capacity. And it will cost $25  million to reequip the assembly shop at the plant which would be  producing the gas turbines.    Where will these millions come from? The U.S. side has been  quite cautious about the possible economic support. Russia has  been left to rely primarily on its own resources. Consequently,  the expenditure will increase, as will the time taken to  implement the plan. That is what people in the nuclear sector  think. As a more purposeful idea they are proposing the  construction of a nuclear-powered heat and electric power  station, which will be comparable in terms of cost, but will  have the edge environmentally.</p>

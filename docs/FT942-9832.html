			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Costs and taxes restrain ADT net income to Dollars 27m ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group with operations in North America, the UK and continental Europe, yesterday reported a small increase in first quarter net income held back by higher interest costs and taxes. Net income for the the three months to March 31 rose from Dollars 26.2m to Dollars 27.1m (Pounds 18.5m) while earnings per share slipped to 18 cents (20 cents). The shares closed 20p down at 585p. The decline in earnings per share reflected a higher deferred tax charge and finance costs together with an increase in the weighted average number of outstanding shares as a result of the refinancing completed in the third quarter last year. Interest expenses jumped to Dollars 19.6m (Dollars 12.7m) while the income tax charge increased to Dollars 6.6m (Dollars 4.2m). Sales increased by 5.6 per cent to Dollars 348.8m, compared with Dollars 330.4m, fuelled by the continued growth in sales and installation of residential security systems, and increased dealer consignment business at vehicle auctions. Operating income grew 20 per cent to Dollars 55.2m with electronic security services at Dollars 32.8m (Dollars 27.4m) and vehicle auction at Dollars 24.2m (Dollars 20.5m).</p>

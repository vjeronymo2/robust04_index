			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- About 2,000 workers  affiliated with the subway trade union council held a rally in  the Chongmyo Park in Seoul on June 2 and vowed to win in the  wage-hike struggle for 1994, a Seoul-based radio reported.    Pointing to the instability of working conditions, the  workers at the rally called for the enforcement of an 8-hour  workday.    They rejected the wage hike draft agreed upon between the  subsidized South Korean General Federation of Trade Unions  (Nochong) and the general federation of managers councils and  demanded a wage hike up to a level sufficient to ensure living.</p>

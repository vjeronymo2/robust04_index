			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: JACK OF ALL TRADES WONDERS WHERE HE'LL WANDER NEXT  </P> <P> Michael Logue has sold cemetery plots, was a logger, a ranch hand, hosted a  late-night avant-garde radio show for 3 1/2 years, served in the Navy and now  works as a legal secretary.  </P> <P> "I've done a lot of strange things," he said. "I was even the weird one in my  school days."  </P> <P> Now 33, he says little has changed. "I'm only being me and I'm different," said  Logue, who uses eye makeup, wears dangling earrings to work and binds his long  hair in a ponytail. "I want to be honest with myself and honest with the  world." But he adds, "I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up."  </P> <P> For the time being, however, he said he has discovered a creative outlet in  Poets Reading Inc. of Fullerton, which he helped form last year.  </P> <P> The founding group, all from Fullerton, consists of Logue, his fiancee, Tina  Rinaldi, 23, a hair stylist; local poet Dean Hartley, a former professor at Cal  State Fullerton, and a few volunteers.  </P> <P> The reading sometimes draws a standing-room-only crowd of 100. "They come to  enjoy hearing the written word," said the Fullerton College graduate. "I have  the sense that people would rather come here and pay $2 than watch television."  </P> <P> The group meets every other Saturday in a small hall at the Fullerton Museum  Center to give poetry readings and that of other writing, sometimes in dramatic  fashion.  </P> <P> Most of all, he adds, "A lot of people really want to read their poetry before  an audience."  </P> <P> Logue said he was "scared the first time I was a reader, because I put a  dramatic flair into my reading. I felt that the greatest writers in the world  can be boring readers and I didn't want to do that."  </P> <P> Now, he said, short story and one-act drama writers, as well as poets, are  presenting their work in sometimes unorthodox readings. At times, the featured  reader is a singer who sings his poetry, and some people with drama backgrounds  give performances.  </P> <P> "The readings are not confined to poets," he said, noting that 10 to 15 people  of all types usually sign up.  </P> <P> "There are a lot more poets in Orange County than we think," Logue said. "There  are hundreds of them in the county and a lot of them are private writers who  have never shared or published their work."  </P> <P> However, he added, "not many of the poets are located in north Orange County,  and that's where we are concentrating our efforts."  </P> <P> In contrast with poets in Los Angeles County, who Logue said tend to be  competitive, there is more of a congenial atmosphere among Orange County poets.  </P> <P> "There is a different attitude in Orange County. They are not part of a  clique," he said. "It's more of an open, cooperative spirit here."  </P> <P> Logue said he hopes the group flourishes and is eventually able to provide  scholarships to creative writers. On the other hand, it may not be something he  stays with forever.  </P> <P> "I don't see myself locked into any one thing," he said. "I left home at 16 and  never looked back. It seems the more creative a person is, the more easily they  get bored doing the same thing."  </P> <P> And he doesn't plan to change his somewhat colorful exterior. "I remember  sitting by a fire in a field and this old cowboy told me, 'If you're not  hurting anyone, do anything you want to do.' I'm not hurting anyone."  </P> <P> Tat Shinno, who has taught, written books and worked as a successful flower  arranger since 1936, figured it was time to start a new career (she was  approaching her 70th birthday).  </P> <P> Now 73, the Newport Beach resident and native Californian has developed into a  nationally recognized watercolorist, having won a nationwide award from the  National Park Academy of the Arts and has exhibited at the Laguna Festival of  Arts.  </P> <P> Artwork "was what I wanted to do since grade school. I'm finally getting into  that after all these years."  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Tustin resident Ethel D. Reynolds, co-founder and chair of  "Parents Who Care," a group dedicated to education as a means to stop substance  abuse, will receive the 1989 Woman of Distinction Award from the Tustin branch  of the American Assn. of University Women. In 1985, Reynolds received an award  from the National Council on Alcoholism for her efforts to stem drinking.  </P></p>

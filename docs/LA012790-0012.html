			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOYNIHAN'S PLAN TO CUT PAYROLL TAX  </P> <P> Anyone having faith in the integrity of a government trust fund probably still  believes in the tooth fairy.  </P> <P> A government trust fund is an accounting procedure that transfers money from  the government's left pocket to its right pocket. It is meaningless.  </P> <P> We either trust our government to live up to its obligations or we don't. A  trust fund won't make the difference.  </P> <P> The payroll tax is a revenue-raising tax like any other tax and we should stop  kidding ourselves that it is different because it is earmarked for a special  purpose.  </P> <P> And why it stops at an arbitrary figure like $51,300 is something that has  never been properly explained.  </P> <P> ERNST JACOBI  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

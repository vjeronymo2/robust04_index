Excess Shelter Cap_7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) and 273.9(d)(8) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under current rules at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5), households are entitled to a deduction from income for excess shelter expenses, i.e., shelter expenses (including rent or mortgage and utilities) that exceed 50 percent of the household's net income remaining after all other deductions. For households with an elderly or disabled member (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2), all of the excess shelter expenses are deducted. For other households, only excess shelter expenses up to a limit are deducted. This limit, usually referred to as the ``shelter cap,'' is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the shelter, fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30. In FY 1994, the cap is $207 for the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia, $359 in Alaska, $295 in Hawaii, $251 in Guam, and $152 in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, enacted August 10, 1993, 107 Stat. 312), amended section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (as amended), (the Act) 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to provide for incremental increases in the shelter cap and for the elimination of the cap according to the following schedule: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Effective July 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $231 a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $402 in Alaska, $330 in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171 in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Effective October 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $247 a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $429 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300 in Guam, and $182 in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Effective January 1, 1997, the limit on the excess shelter expense deduction is removed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> According to the legislative history of the Leland Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Congressional Record, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  S10725, August 6, 1993), the changes in the shelter cap are designed to provide more food stamps to families with especially high rent and utility bills. To implement section 13912 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 7 CFR 273.9(d)(8) will be amended to add the statutorily imposed increased shelter cap amounts effective in July 1994 and October 1995 and to indicate that the shelter cap will be eliminated effective January 1, 1997. Those regulatory changes are mandated by statute and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), are therefore not subject to public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action proposes to amend the homeless shelter expense provisions of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) to eliminate the reference to the excess shelter cap. Current regulations provide that State agencies may develop their own standard estimate of the shelter expenses of households in which all members are homeless and do not receive free shelter throughout the month. State agencies that do not want to develop their own standards may use the estimate provided by the Department. The regulations provide that this homeless shelter estimate will be updated annually using the same method as is used to index the excess shelter cap. Since the excess shelter cap will be set at the amounts established by the Leland Act beginning July 1, 1994 and will be removed in January 1997, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) effective July 1, 1994 to provide that the homeless shelter expense estimate will be revised each October 1 to reflect changes in the shelter, fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the CPI-U for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30. The homeless shelter estimate will be adjusted on October 1, 1994 and each October 1 thereafter. State agencies will be notified of the amount by memorandum prior to each change. State agencies will still have the option of developing and using their own estimates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

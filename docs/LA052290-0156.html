			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> FBI RAIDS NORTHROP FA-18 PLANTS  </P> <P> FBI agents today raided Northrop Corp. plants in Hawthorne and El Segundo where  fuselage parts are built for the Navy's FA-18 fighter-bomber.  </P> <P> Northrop spokesman Ron Owens confirmed the searches.  </P> <P> "We are working with them in their search, and that is all that I can comment  upon," he said.  </P> <P> FBI Special Agent Fred Reagan said he could not comment.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas is the prime contractor for the carrier-based FA-18. Northrop  assembles the center and aft sections of the plane as a subcontractor under  what is known as a sole source, fixed-price agreement. That means only one  contractor is considered qualified to do the work, and it is not subject to  competitive bidding.  </P> <P> In April, the Justice Department sued Northrop, claiming the company had  fraudulently fattened bills submitted to the Navy for work on the FA-18. The  department decided not to file criminal charges as part of a deal with Northrop  last February involving a guilty plea in another fraud case.  </P></p>

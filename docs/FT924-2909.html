			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Tiny's hand unfrozen Lonrho's deal with Mr Dieter Bock may be a good one for Mr Tiny Rowland, its largest shareholder. That can hardly be true for other shareholders, especially the army of small investors left behind after UK institutions largely withdrew. Mr Rowland is shedding nearly half his stake at an outrageous 45 per cent premium to the market. Others, who might have liked an equal opportunity, are left to sweat it out. Where are the non-executive directors on Lonrho's board who might have looked after their interests as the deal was hatched? By underwriting the rights issue at a premium, Mr Bock could end up with as much as 19 per cent of Lonrho. The decent thing would be to make an offer for the rest at the 115p which Mr Rowland is receiving. More likely, his arrival signals an accelerated breakup of the company, especially after last night's disposal of VAG. Some of the remaining assets are attractive. Doubtless Genting would like the hotels and Gencor the South African mining interests. With net assets per share of 157p, breakup ought to enhance shareholder value. But that begs a lot of questions. Net asset value has fallen by around a quarter over the past year. Some of the cash in the group balance sheet is effectively locked up in Metropole hotels. Moreover, it is hard to see how any surplus proceeds could be transferred to shareholders. Lonrho already has an ACT problem: a higher dividend or even a share buy-back programme would make that worse. To hold on requires an enormous act of faith when Mr Bock's own origins are so obscure. More unnerving still, is that Mr Rowland, who knows all Lonrho's secrets, seems finally to be thinking of calling it a day.</p>

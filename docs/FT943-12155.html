			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Water gets political in a very dry Spain: Access is dividing regions - and the troubled Socialists Water will begin trickling today via a network of canals and aqueducts, from the nearly empty reservoirs fed by the Tajo river in central Spain to the almost dry ones served by the Segura river more than 300kms south east. After one of the longest low rainfall decades on record, the transfer of water from the baked steppes of the Spanish plain to the parched orchards on the Mediterranean has sparked a bitter debate, nowhere more so than inside the ruling Socialist party, which controls the two regions fighting for the water. The row centres on the irrigation potential, or lack of it, of the Tajo-Segura trasvase a series of canals and tunnels that links the 1,082km-long Tajo, which enters the Atlantic, as the Tagus, at Lisbon, with the 325km-long Segura, which flows into the Mediterranean south of Alicante. The issue is how water should be managed in a mainly dry country. As consumption has risen with expanding urban populations and enlarged agricultural areas under irrigation, water has become increasingly scarce - and political. People in the Segura basin, one of Spain's richest fruit growing regions, are so low on water they have warned they might have to uproot their parched trees. The only way to get water to them is from the Tajo, where people say they do not have enough to drink. Mr Jose Borrell, the public works minister who at the weekend ordered the sluice gates on the Tajo's Buenda-Entrepenas reservoir open to start filling the canal network, says he had to make the sort of decision that would have 'baffled King Solomon'. In the event he persuaded the government to agree to the transfer of 55,000 cu m of water from Buenda-Entrepenas draining this once huge inland sea among the valleys of the Montes Universales sierra near Madrid, from an already critical 14 per cent capacity to just 7 per cent. The fruit farmers to the south had wanted an emergency supply of at least 60,000 cu m to save their cash crops. The released water flow, which has taken more than three days to reach the Segura reservoirs, will only be available for irrigating the main orchards in the Alicante region on August 6. Some 7,000 cu m of the Tajo's inflow will have been lost by that time through evaporation and, when at last it reaches the table grape producing vines and the almond, orange, lemon and pommegranate trees in the area, will provide only about two weeks' worth of irrigation. This limited water injection will save some of the crops, spread over 50,000ha, that over the years had built up strong export markets in the EU. About half the area has received no irrigation at all this year, some 12m-15m trees will bear no fruit and losses are estimated to be Pta25bn (Pounds 125m). None of that moved Mr Jose Bono, premier of the Castille-La Mancha region which includes the Tajo and the depleted Buendia reservior. 'Not a drop must leave the Tajo,' he insisted and, as one of the closest of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party allies, managed to delay the opening of the Buenda sluice gates for weeks. Mr Bono claims there are some 100 villages in the vicinity of the reservoir suffering water shortages and that more than 70,000ha theoretically earmarked for irrigation by the Tajo in Castilla-La Mancha have never produced a crop because the Buenda-Entrepenas has never held enough to permit the area's cultivation. But the pressure from Mr Joan Lerma, premier of the Valencia region, which includes the Alicante orchards, proved more powerful and bent the government's ear. He says whatever Castille-La Mancha might produce by way of future crops, the existing cultivation in his region is threatened and that billions of pesetas and thousands of jobs are at stake. The two regional socialist leaders have openly attacked each other in the media and their outbursts have succeeded in further embarrassing a government already at pains to soothe over differences between the party's left wing and its moderates. Last week Mr Lerma encouraged Alicante fruit farmers to demonstrate in Madrid and this week Mr Bono is expected to support a similar march on the capital by thirsty villagers from the Tajo's river banks. The row has at least had the virtue of focusing minds on a National Hydrology Plan, dealing with water resource management and with a provisional budget - spread over 20 years, of Pta3,500bn - that is now in its final blueprint stage before Mr Borrell presents it to parliament later this year. The plan includes the construction of as many as 200 dams which will serve to bring water south from Spain's northern wetlands, and chiefly from the Douro and Ebro river basins, to the Tajo's reservoirs and on to areas such as Alicante's orchards. According to Mr Juan Manuel Ruiz Garca, a member of the National Water Council which has been consulted over the plan, the projected north-south transfer of irrigation resources could repeat the mistakes made with the Tajo-Segura trasvase. Planned during the 1930s and built during the Franco years, the trasvase, with its accompanying dams and reservoirs, was intended to provide self-sufficiency in food, water supplies for the rapidly growing big cities and the build-up of hydro-electric power. But the huge irrigation projects it prompted now produce surplus EU crops, the cities have stopped growing and cheaper power is available through natural gas. Worst of all, the all-important Buenda-Entrepenas reservoir never filled up; with a capacity for 2.4bn cu m it held just 405m cu m earlier this year and the trasvase, which was projected to carry 600m cu m annually, has never carried more than half that.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Reservoir                  Capacity           Actual                        (cu hectometres)      (July 19)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Buendia-Entrepenas          2,474              405 Arquillo de S Blas             22                3 Benagever                     228               28 Loriguilla                     71                6 Alarcon                     1,112               30 Contreras                     874               79 Cortes II                     118               99 Talave                         33               13 Fuensanta                     206                5 Cenajo                        439               21 Santomera                      26                1 Argos                          11                6 Valdeinfierno                  13                0 Puentes                        14                0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

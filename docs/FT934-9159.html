			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatPower sees heavy selling THE MARKET registered its disappointment with interim results from National Power by marking the shares sharply lower in the face of some aggressive selling pressure. NatPower's half-time profits came in at Pounds 250m, including an exceptional gain of Pounds 45m, but in 'clean' form were at the bottom of market expectations which were mostly in the region of Pounds 210m to Pounds 220m. Dealers said the profits were below consensus and therefore always liable to trigger selling pressure. They added that the market was also upset by a slightly disappointing dividend payment. 'The market was going for a dividend increase of up to 18 per cent and got 14 per cent, which means the shares go down,' said one trader. Energy specialists were not too concerned at what was viewed as a below par earnings and dividend performance and said the market was more worried as to whether the regulatory authorities would refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The stock dropped to 397p immediately the figures were published, but quickly stabilised and eventually stood a net 9 1/2 lower at 402 1/2 p. Turnover of 15m was easily the highest in a single trading session for more than two years.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIFTED RAP;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE BRINGS TOGETHER 600 OF AREA'S BRIGHTEST YOUNGSTERS  </P> <P> Twelve-year-old Jerry Landers wants to own his own National Football League  team when he grows up, so attending a workshop that teaches how to create and  manage a business sounded like a great opportunity to him.  </P> <P> "I don't just like to play the game," said Landers, a pupil at Harry C. Fulton  Middle School in Fountain Valley. "It is much more to the game than what the  players do on the field, and that's the part I am interested in."  </P> <P> Jerry was just one of more than 600 youths invited Friday to participate in  Kidscon West, a three-day conference with workshops and exhibits especially  designed for gifted and talented children.  </P> <P> The conference is being held at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim through Sunday.  </P> <P> Youngsters who attended the conference were either in gifted classes in their  schools or were recommended as academically talented by their teachers.  </P> <P> "Gifted children require a certain amount of nurturing and attention for their  various interests," said Jacqui Jeffery, coordinator of the conference. "This  is to give students and parents alike ideas on how to work with the curiosity  and thinking of these children."  </P> <P> Along with advice on entrepreneurship, children in grades four through nine  were also offered workshops on the language of computers, U.S. consumer safety,  treasure finding and Wall Street, to name a few. The workshops were taught by  professionals from each field.  </P> <P> Registration was $60 per child with an extra $25 fee for parents interested in  attending the conference.  </P> <P> Jeffery said she developed her interest in gifted children after teaching for  more than 20 years in a Santa Barbara school district.  </P> <P> "I've always felt there was not enough encouragement given to these children,  and there were certainly no programs in my teaching district aimed for this  type of child," Landers said. "Research proves that without encouragement, a  gifted child stops asking questions."  </P> <P> In 1984, she applied for -- and received -- a state grant that allowed her to  sponsor her first mini-conference with nine workshops in the Santa Barbara  area. This year's first statewide effort includes more than 80 workshops for  children and parents.  </P> <P> "As a parent, I am inclined to feel that not enough is being done to reach to  the gifted child," said Glenn Wallace, whose 12-year-old son is in a gifted  program in Agoura. "Something that deals with the boredom and lack of challenge  these kids must feel in a classroom filled with many other kids who really  don't want to learn."  </P> <P> Drew Wilson, a former teacher and creator of the video "Mr.Edison's Invention  Factory," a one-man show that encourages students to develop their own  inventions, feels that more attention on the gifted child is imperative to the  nation's progress.  </P> <P> "In Japan, children, particularly gifted ones, have been encouraged to take  their ideas a step further for years," Wilson said. "But in America, only now  are we focusing on shaping the kids' minds in this way, and we have a lot of  catching up to do."  </P> <P> Kidscon will travel to Orlando, Fla., in January and to Washington in 1991.  </P> <P> There also are plans for the program to expand to include all elementary grades  and high school students.  </P> <P> "We want these kids to realize that there are horizons beyond the classrooms  and that they are capable of reaching them," Jeffery said.  </P></p>

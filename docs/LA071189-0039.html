			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PUSH IS ON TO ATTRACT LATINOS;  </P> <P> ADVERTISERS FIND A MARKET UNDER THEIR NOSES  </P> <P> When Cox Cable San Diego initiated a campaign earlier this year to net more  cable television viewers, the company attacked on a new front -- it pitched  cable TV to the county's fast-growing Latino community.  </P> <P> Cox Cable executives handed the marketing assignment to Brenda Lovitt, the  chief customer recruiter, who greeted the task with trepidation. The cause of  Lovitt's concern: she's an Anglo.  </P> <P> "I don't speak Spanish. I don't understand the culture," Lovitt said. "How can  I put myself in the position of a Spanish-speaking customer?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Outside Help  </P> <P> So Lovitt and Cox turned to Cohen Advertising Group, a 3-year-old San  Diego-based agency that specializes in advertising directed to Latino  consumers. Since March, Cohen has developed two Cox Cable campaigns, for both  TV and radio. A third campaign, expected to air soon, will also feature a  direct-mail effort.  </P> <P> Cohen, whose other clients include Skippy, Farmer's Market, Del Taco and  Seagrams, decided to use the Spanish catchword conectate for the Cox campaign,  which means literally to connect or hook up, perfect for a cable TV company,  Lovitt said.  </P> <P> "But even better, conectate also has another meaning -- to join or to become  part of," Lovitt said, adding that the word has become a centerpiece of Cox's  Latino marketing strategy. "We used it to send a message to the Hispanic viewer  that says you're missing out unless you become part of the Cox Cable family. It  was really clever."  </P> <P> Cox's experience with Cohen illustrate's corporate America's increasing desire  to sell goods and services to an ever-increasing Latino market and has spurred  the start-up of agencies that focus primarily, if not exclusively, on creating  Spanish-language advertising.  </P> <P> The growing attention paid to the Latino market can be observed in several  regions across the nation, but such activity is most apparent in Southwestern  cities with high concentrations of Latinos.  </P> <P> San Diego County, with a Latino population of 473,800, or 17.7% of the overall  2.6 million, is a prime example. Companies are drawn not only to San Diego's  substantial Latino population but also to the potential of reaching 1.5 million  more Latinos just south of the border in Tijuana.  </P> <P> "We were never familiar with the Hispanic market, so we never really tried to  penetrate it," said Lovitt of Cox Cable. "Besides, in the past we were busy  just trying to penetrate the general or Anglo market. Since we've successfully  done that, we started looking at other markets where we could expand. The  Hispanic market was staring us in the face."  </P> <P> Although Cox Cable has been serving San Diego viewers for 25 years, the company  only began advertising in Spanish five months ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eatery Interested, Too  </P> <P> Even Rubio's Restaurants, operator of the San Diego-based Mexican eateries, had  until recently overlooked the Latino market.  </P> <P> "It's ironic," said Ralph Rubio, president of the restaurant chain. "We serve  Mexican food, but our success has been built on our ability to draw the  college-educated Anglo customer. But we want Hispanics to come to our  restaurants, too.  </P> <P> "Just like every other businessman out there, I've been seeing statistics about  the growing U.S. Hispanic population," Rubio said. "You just can't ignore those  numbers anymore." Rubio, who has teamed with Cohen, is in the midst of  preparing an advertising campaign directed at Latinos.  </P> <P> As impressive as the size of the county's Latino population is the rate of its  growth. From 1970 to 1980, the county's Latino population grew 126.5%,  according to a study just completed by the Strategy Research Corp., Miami-based  marketing and research firm that has conducted nearly 30 market studies of the  Hispanic market. The study was commissioned by a coalition of local Latino  radio and television stations and agencies.  </P> <P> During the last nine years, the number of Latinos has increased by 72.2%. But  even more important is the Latino buying power -- total spendable dollars  generated by Latinos in San Diego is projected to be $2.8 billion in 1989.  </P> <P> Although Southern California has always had a sizable Latino population,  companies have until recently failed to penetrate or recognize that market,  said Patricia Cohen, president of Cohen Advertising Group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Why-Bother Attitude  </P> <P> "Most companies said, 'Why bother advertising in Spanish?' " Cohen said. "They  believed that eventually the Hispanic immigrant would become assimilated,  become an American. They believed, then, that they could be reached with  regular English campaigns."  </P> <P> But Cohen cites recent market studies that show that nearly half of all Latinos  in the United States never become assimilated. "They never really have to learn  English . . . . It's becoming increasingly apparent that a large group can be  reached by Latino advertising, whereas an English campaign targeted at the same  group would be ineffective," Cohen said.  </P> <P> Companies' reluctance to enter an unfamiliar market left the Latino market  untapped, said Gerry Stefanko, president and CEO of San Diego-based Stefanko  &amp; Hetz Advertising and Design. A year ago, Stefanko established Salsa  Advertising &amp; Marketing, a division of Stefanko &amp; Hetz, to exclusively  handle Latino campaigns. Allie's Restaurants and XEWT-TV, the Tijuana-based  television station, are among Salsa's clients.  </P> <P> "There's the stereotype of the sleepy Mexican who has no money to spend,"  Stefanko said. "Such false perceptions have prevented American companies from  truly recognizing how lucrative the Hispanic market can be."  </P> <P> Cohen has encountered such ignorance as well.  </P> <P> "I've run into the American marketer who is used to sitting in his office and  occasionally makes a trip into Tijuana," Cohen said. "He sees people and the  way they live, and because they look different or look like they don't have  money, he decides it's a waste of time to advertise to them.  </P> <P> "What he doesn't recognize is that there are different class levels, that there  are many Mexicans who come across the border because they prefer American  products," Cohen said.  </P> <P> General agencies, as well as companies' in-house marketing units, will testify  that advertising to Latinos takes more than being bilingual; an agency must be  bicultural.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learning the Hard Way  </P> <P> Companies that have rushed ill-prepared into the Latino market have learned  that lesson the hard way. One embarrassing example: Braniff airlines attempted  to pitch their English campaign about "the luxury of riding on leather," which  was translated into "sientese en cuero."  </P> <P> "The translation in Spanish meant something like 'ride around naked in our  wonderful airplane,' " Cohen said with a chuckle.  </P> <P> "Marketing to the Hispanic community is not as simple as taking the Anglo  message and running it in Spanish," said Dick Brooks, general manager of  Phillips-Ramsey, one of San Diego's largest advertising agencies. Although  Phillips-Ramsey runs Latino advertising for a handful of its clients, it often  consults with specialized agencies for help.  </P> <P> "I don't feel that we have the expertise on staff to market to the Hispanic  community for all of our clients," Brooks said. "When we believe it's  appropriate, we'll turn to outside resources."  </P> <P> When Rubio opened his sixth and most recent Rubio's Deli-Mex restaurant in  Chula Vista, he noticed that many of the patrons were Latino. Before  advertising to lure more Latinos, Rubio says, it is critical to know which  Latino subgroup to address.  </P> <P> "A big agency is likely to treat Hispanics as the same," Rubio said. "But, in  reality, you could have an assimilated Mexican who's been educated here, speaks  English and holds a middle-management job. Or you can have a blue-collar worker  who's been here for five or six years and speaks English at work, but speaks  Spanish at home. Or you could have a Mexican who's been here just six months  and doesn't speak any English. There are subtle differences among them. And you  might have to create your advertising accordingly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for Help  </P> <P> Family Bargain Center, the off-price San Diego-based clothing retailer, has  always had a large Latino customer base. But, until last May, the clothing  chain, which now has 54 stores in California and Arizona (seven in San Diego  County), lacked an effective, unified advertising campaign. Each district  manager created his own advertising.  </P> <P> "Considering that advertising was not their area of expertise, the district  managers did a good job," said Andrew Rosenberg, who was hired a year ago as  the advertising director to unify the chain's marketing campaign. "Each  district manager was doing his own thing. Our effort, you could say, was  roughshod."  </P> <P> Rosenberg immediately set out to hire an agency familiar with Latino  advertising. He chose Salsa Advertising &amp; Marketing.  </P> <P> So, how's business been since hiring Salsa?  </P> <P> "The bottom line is, sales have gone up." (The closely held company declined to  release sales figures.)  </P> <P> Lovitt, the senior product manager for Cox Cable, reports similar success with  Cohen Advertising Group.  </P> <P> "What we found out was that the local Hispanic viewer knew very little about  cable," Lovitt said. "They didn't understand that we offered a variety of  programs. So, before we did anything, we had to teach them from the ground up  that we offered a wide range of entertainment at their fingertips."  </P> <P> The first Cox campaign created by Cohen -- primarily an "awareness" commercial  that featured the word conectate -- ran for about six weeks and ended June 10.  Lovitt declared the campaign a hit.  </P> <P> "As soon as we started running the campaign, we started getting phone calls,"  Lovitt said. "I've never seen our customer service reps so busy." Cox netted  800 new Latino customers because of the ads.  </P> <P> And, according to Cohen, opportunities to capitalize on the Latino market  should come in waves.  </P></p>

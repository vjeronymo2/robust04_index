			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Wisdom check Which still begs the question as to how Kenneth Clarke actually puts to best use the wise men he inherited from his predecessor Norman Lamont. The six have already been downgraded since the chancellor now only wishes to read two, rather than three, of their reports a year. At the same time, it is their misfortune that their sagacity was sought during a period in which the Treasury's own forecasting record has improved from dismal to not too bad. Judging by the forecasts issued at Budget time last year, the wise men have not cornered the market in economic wisdom. Cambridge University's Wynne Godley, for instance, was forecasting gross domestic product growth at 1.6 per cent for 1994, against a probable out-turn of 3.5-4 per cent. And Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was predicting an inflation rate (minus mortgage interest payments) of 4.5 per cent for the fourth quarter of 1994, when the equivalent figure for the 12 months to October this year was actually a mere 2 per cent. Meanwhile, Observer's own forecast is that the wise men will, wisely, be increasingly called upon to deliver their wisdom in the form of policy prescriptions rather than hard numbers. Much wiser.</p>

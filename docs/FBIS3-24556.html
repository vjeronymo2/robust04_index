Shchepalina, Chair of Physical  Chemistry; UDC543.544:543.51]    [Abstract] Polymeric adsorbents are now being widely used  to concentrate trace quantities of organic compounds in the  atmosphere and in water. Effectiveness depends greatly on the  adsorptive properties of the adsorbents. In a previous work a  study was made of the adsorptive properties of domestic porous  polymers obtained by copolymerization of styrene with divinyl  benzene, and Tenaks-GC (poly, para-2,6-polyphenylene oxide).  These products were found to be lacking in uniformity of  properties from lot to lot and having low resistance to heat. In  the present work a study was made of the adsorption properties  of Porolas-SG-2T, a new adsorbent prepared by copolymerization  of ethylstyrene with divinyl benzene and derivatives of  methacrylic acid. It has a specific surface of 270  m[.sup]2[/] per gram, 1.1 cm[.sup]3[/] per gram total pore  volume, and 213 angstrom units average pore diameter. It was  demonstrated that this adsorbent is more specific in interaction  with the functional groups of simple esters, ketones, and  especially n-alcohols, than Polysorb-1. This is evidently due to  differences in the geometry and chemistry of the surfaces. The  results indicate that Poroplas-SG-2T may be recommended for use  as an adsorbent to concentrate high priority atmospheric  contaminants. References 8: 4 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

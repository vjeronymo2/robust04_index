			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Line of Forte placed Shares in hotels and leisure group Forte gave a creditable performance given that institutional investors had to absorb the placing of 78m new shares at 227p a share to fund the group's purchase of an initial 57 per cent stake in Meridien Hotels. Forte has agreed to buy the stake from Air France for Pounds 131m and will eventually increase the stake to 80 per cent. The placing, which raised Pounds 175m, was carried out by Forte's broker UBS. The Forte share price closed 3 down at 233 1/2 p, the lowest of the day after turnover of 3.1m shares with UBS marketmakers keenly supporting the stock towards the close. Forte shares have performed well relative to the market recently, moving up some 11 per cent since the middle of September compared with a 3 per cent rise by the FT-SE 100 and a 1.5 per cent rise in the leisure sector. The shares rose despite widespread fears of a substantial rights issue. Mr Roy Owens, leisure analyst at Smith New Court, said 'the placing removes fears of a rights issue and it shows there is a continuing appetite for the shares'.</p>

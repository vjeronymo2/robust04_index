			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Carmen - Covent Garden From the morass of mediocrity which is the new Royal Opera Carmen (sponsors: Daiwa Europe Ltd and the Linbury Trust), a handful of rewarding performers stand apart. There is, for example, Leontina Vaduva: her Micaela, played as a milksop entirely lacking in country-girl determination, delivers nonetheless an exquisite third-act aria - the voice of the young Romanian soprano is not yet in full bloom, but the quality is lustrously fresh. There is also Gino Quilico, a bit slow on his pins for a star bullfighter, but a stylish baritone with vocal elegance and verbal wit to his credit - and native French (or rather, Canadian-French) as well, not something heard at Covent Garden very often. Christopher Booth-Jones (Morales) cuts a dash; and though often the wretchedly bad blocking of the staging contrives to deny us clear sight of the attractive persons of Judith Howarth (Frasquita) and Jean Rigby (Mercedes), at least we are not denied sound of their attractive voices. Best of all - and principal saving grace of an otherwise dispiriting evening  -is the Jose of Luis Lima. He is, as we recall from his Carlos and Nemorino on the same stage, a fine, intensely physical actor: small, trim, darkly handsome, with liquidly expressive eyes and a way of being stirred to love or violence which combines Latin volatility and acute psychological understanding (and vital, poetically accented use of words, spoken as well as sung). That the opera is Jose's tragedy was at Covent Garden on Friday clearer than ever; for on a stage clogged and cluttered by a particularly debased form of pictorial naturalism, with bits and pieces of characterisation unlinked by any discernible dramatic thread, Lima provides the single developing line of dramatic coherence and consistency. In the past he has tended to force his lean, dusky-toned tenor at climaxes, as much (one suspects) through dramatic enthusiasm as anything else. Here, some unwanted bursts of final-duet sobs notwithstanding, he sounds impressively apt to the music, neither too heavy nor too light; and while a conductor less limited in his command of French-operatic style than Zubin Mehta would no doubt encourage Lima to mould the melodies with even greater suppleness, this is in sum one of the most moving Joses of recent times. Mehta is a conductor with a gift for waking up an orchestra (and, evidently, a chorus - their form was above the recent house average). He approaches the work with energy, and a certain feeling for the beauty of detail in Bizet's scoring. What he entirely lacks is rhythmic elasticity - the Spanish metrical inflections receiving either a drum-banging underlining or a hot-handed caress - and, more seriously, any sense of unfolding dramatic impetus. Friday's was a Carmen experience of stop-starts. In a theatre larger than that for which it was written, the opera needs not flashy moments, but a clear grasp of how to keep the work moving and, above all, certainty of taste. But since the conductor insists on performing the work in the roundly discredited edition by Fritz Oeser, plumped full of those obviously ineffective short passages or repetitions which Bizet himself cut before opening night, certainty of taste is not Mehta's calling card. Can no-one at Covent Garden hear how completely those added bits of Oeserie lame the close of the 'Chanson boheme', for instance, or the final duet? Does no-one care? The blend of Mehta's stylelessness and Nuria Espert's limp production (in the tall, Goya-influenced but plasticky-looking and space-cramping single set of Gerardo Vera) is a lethal one. There are few things in opera more numbing than the meaningless operatic naturalism on offer here. The production's flubbed details and attempts at novelty are countless - the Sevillian working people doing their little cameos in Act 1, the flamenco dancer spoiling the quiet opening music of Act 2, an utterly incompetent fight in Act 3, the milling crowds plus two horses in Act 4, and so on. How so distinguished a woman of the Spanish theatre can have failed in this particular way with this particular opera is a sad mystery. Having Maria Ewing in the title role was obviously no help. Reports tell us that her attendance at rehearsals was slight; but even without that information we could probably guess as much. For this is Carmen in an hermetically sealed bubble, giving us Her Performance, unresponsive to others on stage; even her singing, with its fascinating timbre (albeit shrill on high notes) and phrase-shapes, sounds self-directed. Miss Ewing can be the most mesmerising of stage artists. Here, her presence is negative, a final drain on the vitality of the character and the opera. Indeed, one must accord the production a last benefit of the doubt: perhaps a different Carmen will make it all seem different.</p>

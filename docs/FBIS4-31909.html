			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- National Democratic  Party (NDS) Chairman Ludovit Cernak today told journalists that  Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik proposed last Thursday [9 June]  that NDS leaders run in the early parliamentary election,  scheduled for this autumn, on the slate of the Democratic Union  (DU) of which he is chairman. Cernak said that talks between  the two parties continued and a NDS leaders' solution was  expected on Saturday [18 June].    "Since cooperation with the right of center parties had  always been more important for the NDS than its cooperation with  the Christian Democrats we decided to cancel talks with the  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)," said Cernak, who as  recently as this Saturday held talks with the KDH on probable  participation of NDS candidates on its slate.    He said that the KDH's proposal did not satisfy the National  Democrats as their five candidates would gain places in  parliament only if the KDH won 16 percent of voter support,  which is unlikely.    Cernak said that the possibility of a joint slate for right  of center parties was taking shape because the right-wing bloc  of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak  Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) was also holding talks on  cooperation with Moravcik's party. Nevertheless Cernak did not  confirm that the talks with the KDH had been stopped.    According to the May poll conducted by the FOCUS agency 5.9  percent of voters would vote for Moravcik's DU if elections were  held now, which is sufficient to enter parliament, while the  potential partners of the right of center coalition would not  get in parliament independently -- the DS enjoys the support of  3.6 percent of the respondents, while the popularity of Cernak's  National Democrats did not cross the three-percent border.  (Five percent voter support is required for a party to enter  parliament according to the recently passed Slovak election law).</p>

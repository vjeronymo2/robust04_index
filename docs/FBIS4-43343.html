			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Finances Better Than </F> Government Forecasts"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Italy's public-sector deficit  should have improved by the end of 1994 to the tune of about 5-7  trillion lire, or 3-4.5 billion dollars compared to government  forecasts earlier this year, Confindustria [General  Confederation of Italian Industry], the Italian business  association said here today.    The association's bulletin of the latest economic  information, CONGIUNTURA FLASH, said that a reconsideration of  the parameters used by the Treasury recently shows a public  sector borrowing requirement of 75.4 trillion lire in the first  five months of the year, compared to 87.8 trillion in the same  period last year.    As Industry Minister Vito Gnutti told a meeting of Roman  Confindustria members that the Berlusconi government had  inherited a "dramatic" situation from previous governments,  Confindustria said a condition for turning in the better than  forecast results was that controls on expenditure should remain  severe.    According to Confindustria, the government's forecast of a  10-trillion-lire fall in the tax take due to growth of only 1.3  percent in gross domestic product should be scotched by events  since growth should be more sustained and produce a tax take  take 3-4 trillion lire higher than the government expected.    The analysis suggested that a few trillion lire in savings  might also be achieved despite the costs of getting the  railways, EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial  Company] and similar situations back onto track. According to  Confindustria, these could be offset by revenue from  privatisation.    The analysis suggested that savings on interest payments  thanks to lower rates could rise as high as 30 trillion lire,  with further advantages accruing in 1995. According to  Confindustria, the official forecast of a deficit of 180  trillion lire in 1995 would in fact leave space for a  "significant increase in public expenditure."    Confindustria pointed out that international organisations  are currently upgrading their economic growth forecasts, with  Italy moving into economic recovery "with some uncertainty."    The analysis said that industrial production rose by 1.3  percent in April, but fell again by 1.1 percent in May. Foreign  demand remained strong, and domestic demand is showing signs of  new life. But inflation was stuck at 4.1 percent, rather than  falling further as expected.    Gnutti charged that governments of the last five years had  failed to keep their promises as regards reining in the public  deficit. He also claimed that the penalty for failing to make  radical change in the way the economy is run would be to leave  the European "area of competition and growth...for a model of  underdevelopment."    He also argued against what he described as "still-born"  investments, citing the EFIM debacle which he said had run up a  consolidated debt of 20 trillion lire for 30,000 employees,  giving a final loss of 600 million lire per employee. According  to Gnutti, a large part of the public debt of 2,000 trillion  lire consists of "so many EFIMs."    Confindustria Chairman Luigi Abete told the meeting that  Italy's economic strategy must be based on:  internationalisation, with a long look at emerging countries  such as India and China; fiscal modernisation since the issue of  growth and tax equity must be resolved together; and a market in  which the rules are stronger and the lead actors stronger thanks  to improved capitalisation.    He also urged rapid privatisation as a form of value added  to  competitivity.</p>

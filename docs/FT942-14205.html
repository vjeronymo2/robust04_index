			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Can't get no satisfaction - The prospect of public rankings of European cars by owners Carmakers have been conducting their own customer satisfaction surveys in Europe for years. But their practice of sharing the syndicated results with each other but not the public is about to be challenged. An independent organisation - the leading US automotive consumer research group JD Power - has just published its own findings. If it succeeds in transplanting its expertise in automotive market research from North America to Europe - and there are still important question marks  -JD Power's work will bring new dimensions to car marketing in Europe. The results of its first survey in Britain, the 1994 customer satisfaction study, have made sobering reading for most of the leading carmakers in Europe. They show that Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, has achieved the highest level of overall customer satisfaction. Its Corolla small family car was the top individual model. The study measures car owners' attitudes to the quality of their vehicles and to the service and care they receive from dealers. The 1994 survey is based on owners of cars with a J-registration prefix, covering cars registered from August 1991 to July 1992. In the results that are made public JD Power's practice is to rank individually each brand that performs above the industry average, but to name simply as a group, in alphabetical order, all those with a below-average performance. The top half of the carmakers ranked in the 1994 study is dominated by Japanese producers with Mazda and Honda in second and third places behind Toyota, Daihatsu fourth equal, Subaru seventh, Mitsubishi 10th and Nissan in 13th place. The highest-ranked European producer is Mercedes-Benz at fourth equal, with Saab eighth, Skoda ninth and BMW in 11th position. Hyundai of South Korea was in 12th place with Proton of Malaysia fourth equal. The performances of the leading carmakers in the UK - Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover  -are all ranked below average in the study along with Peugeot, Citroen, Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Fiat, Lada, Land Rover, Volvo, Seat and Suzuki. The JD Power studies, first launched in the US in 1981, have been a driving force in improving quality in the US car industry. Greeted at first with scepticism and hostility, they eventually helped to convince the big three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - that they were lagging behind their Japanese rivals in customer satisfaction, and that they needed urgently to close the gap. According to David Power, president of JD Power &amp; Associates: 'Detroit viewed us at first as if we were on the lunatic fringe. Then we were seen as a nuisance, and then as heretics. They challenged our methodology, but we had it evaluated by outside experts. And by 1985 we had begun to convert Detroit top management to what we were about.' JD Power accepts that it now faces the same sort of uphill struggle to convince European carmakers of the value of its work, as it did a decade ago in the US. Several European carmakers, in particular PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, see JD Power as a stalking horse for the Japanese carmakers. The group has already had one false start in Europe, in 1988. Power insists that this time it will stay, but its work remains hampered by European data protection regulations. In much of Europe registration details such as names and addresses of car owners are kept confidential  - in the UK by the state agency, the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency). To overcome this barrier, the first JD Power survey in the UK has been conducted in a joint venture with BBC Enterprises and the BBC Top Gear motoring programme, which solicited UK car owners to participate in the industry-wide study. From 5m viewers more than 58,000 calls were received, which produced a quota sample of 16,250 participants. JD Power accepts that this is not ideal for obtaining a totally representative sample, and it would prefer the co-operation of the DVLA. But 'it seems to be quite bureaucratic. We met them 18 months ago and they are yet to get back to us,' says Power. Until it finds an alternative source to obtain car owner names and addresses, it will persevere with the BBC programme, and it is now actively seeking data sources elsewhere in Europe to spread the customer satisfaction gospel beyond the UK.</p>

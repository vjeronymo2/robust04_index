			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (7): Caught between a rock and a hard place  -Anne Counsell on Ankara's predicament in the conflicts of the Middle East Intently gazing westwards towards Europe in the hope of economic and political engagement, Turkey remains constantly mindful of its geographic location, regional importance and fractious neighbours. It is therefore somewhat piqued that the west appears less than sympathetic to Ankara's predicament as an 'interface' with the Middle East, quite apart from other complicating factors arising from its position abutting Central Asia and the Balkans. 'We are caught between a rock and a hard place,' says a foreign ministry official, mildly rebuking the western notion of Turkey as an area of calm in a troubled sea. Additionally, the place and relative weight of Turkey in US and European foreign policies on the Middle East is a source of both hurt pride and confusion for Ankara, which senses an often arbitrary treatment of Turkey's 'special position'. Associate membership of the Western European Union (WEU) is cited as an illustration of a perceived failure of co-operation with Europe, for it gives Turkey a seat at the table but with no guarantees. As well, Turkey is resigned to a prolonged - if not futile - wait for membership of the EU, and has felt slighted as Nordic and east European countries leap-frog the queue. There is a strong, although understated, displeasure that Turkey is considered merely a buffer between Europe and the Middle East rather than a true friend. This sentiment has gained ground as the country continues to experience the sharp end of the United Nations embargo against Iraq following the Gulf War. 'The Gulf War was not between Iraq and Kuwait and Turkey,' said Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister late last year. 'But now everyone is gone and Turkey is being penalised.' This message was taken up by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, during a recent visit to Washington where she emphasised Turkey's economic losses resulting from the continued closure of the 986km pipeline running from the Iraqi oilfields of Kirkuk to Turkey's southern coast. It has not been used since August 1990 when Turkey turned off the tap in compliance with the UN trade embargo against Iraq. About 7m barrels of crude is trapped in the pipeline, of which 3.2m belong to Turkey. Mrs Ciller put the total cost to Turkey at around Dollars 20bn, including direct revenue and royalties losses of Dollars 2bn annually. Indirect losses include the halt in supplies of cheap petroleum for domestic consumption, the steep fall in tourist numbers, pipeline construction costs and outstanding trade debts. In addition, mounting unemployment in the south-east has, in turn, created further economic difficulties and exacerbated problems of migration and terrorism. The pipeline also faces corrosion as well as attack from Kurdish groups. Turkey wants the pipeline emptied of oil and made ready for immediate use once the embargo is lifted. It has suggested a framework for doing this in co-operation with Iraq. This scheme was politely turned down by the US, which said it could only be done within existing UN Security Council resolutions. To add insult to injury, the UN sanctions committee has allowed Iraq to export 50,000 barrels a day of crude and 20,000 b/d of fuel oil to Jordan because of the kingdom's economic difficulties. 'Which side was Jordan on in the Gulf War?' asked a senior Turkish official pointedly, adding that Turkey had followed the western line to its own detriment. There are indications that Turkey is reshaping its Middle East policy. It is assuming a higher profile in Arab-Israeli relations, Iraq and in finding a solution to the region's water problems. At the same time Ankara is taking account of its domestic situation - in particular the cross-border activities of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - but it is also toeing the west's diplomatic line. Turkey has conveyed to the US its view that Ankara should resume a 'business as usual' approach with Baghdad. This does not entirely complement the US State Department's declared dual containment policy towards Iraq and Iran and the strong US line precludes Turkey from developing normal ties with either. It is an uneasy position for Turkey, which views PKK containment as more vital than the US concern of ensuring that Tehran and Baghdad do not obtain nuclear weapons. The Kurdish issue is intrinsic to Turkish foreign policy. There are significant Kurdish populations in Syria, Iran and Iraq, a factor which intermittently swings from being a binding force between the littoral states to a source of tension and disagreement. Relations between Turkey and its Arab neighbours have increasingly been governed by the Kurdish issue. Ankara is opposed to an independent Kurdish state but holds out the possibility of an autonomous area in northern Iraq if the people wish to return to 1974 autonomy or some other form of self-government. The location of PKK resistance groups in northern Iraq is a source of constant antagonism to Ankara. In January, more than 50 F16 and F4 Turkish jets attacked the PKK base at Zaleh on Iraq's border with Iran. The attack may have been carried out with the help of Iran, which closed escape routes. Aware that good relations hinge on control over PKK cells, Turkey and Iran have improved co-operation on security matters. Iran's main worry is the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq group, which has also been active in Turkey. Turkey's main 'misunderstanding' with Syria also centres on the PKK. Ankara has stated it cannot accept 'state terrorism' and cross-border PKK activities remain a sticky issue despite Syrian measures against PKK bases in Beka'a, forcing the closure of camps, which were relocated to Zaleh. The issue is complicated by disputes over the Southeastern Anatolian Project (Gap) for irrigation and dam development. Syria has been known to increase support for the PKK if it thinks Turkey is being inflexible over the water issue whilst Turkish officials maintain that water rights are not to be negotiated as a trade-off against the PKK. Under a 1987 protocol, Turkey agreed a supply of 500 cubic metres per second until the completion of the Ataturk dam. The reservoir has been filled but without agreement on 'allocation'. Ironically, Syria is negotiating the purchase of electricity generated from the dam it vociferously condemned. This deal may precede the long-vaunted idea of a Middle-Eastern power grid in concert with Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq. Syria's territorial claims over the Turkish province of Hatay in southern Turkey are largely in abeyance, for now. Large maps of 'Greater Syria' which jostle for wall space with portraits of Hafez Al Assad's in Syrian government offices, have more of a sentimental than cartographical value. The relative thaw in Turkey's ties with its Arab neighbours is somewhat of a diplomatic coup but it is muted by Ankara's awareness that the Baathist regimes in both Syria and Iraq have long exhibited antipathy towards Turkey and that Iran is distrustful of Turkey's secular, western approach. Historically, relations between Turkey and its Arab neighbours have been clouded by the conflict between the ideas represented by Arab nationalism and those of the Ottoman empire. Turks felt betrayed by the Arabs after WW1 while Arabs have long considered Turkey a less-than-benign colonial power which strangled its Arab provinces during the Ottoman empire. Turkey's policy objectives in Central Asia have been limited by its desire not be seen as a 'counter balance' to Iran. Turkey and Iran are of a similar size and population and both have an ethnic mosaic of Azeri Turks, Turkomans, Arabs. Whilst Iran's Shi'a structures have unified minorities who suffered repression under the Shah, Turkey's secularism and comparative tolerance are an anathema to Tehran. There is speculation that Iran and Saudi Arabia may be funding mosques and educational foundations which could assist the rise of Turkey's Islamic movement. The Alevi minority, a Turkish version of Shi'ism, remains a simmering issue with Iran and there are intermittent clashes between the orthodox Sunni Muslims and the Alevis, about 15-20 per cent of Turks, mostly in the centre and east of the country. The official emphasis is on economic ties. Turkey and Iran have also been discussing the extension of a pipeline to carry natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe and the proposed construction of another pipeline to carry Iranian natural gas to Europe through Turkey. Also, Turkey has shown interest in buying Iranian crude in return for Turkish goods and services. Of late, there has been a flurry of activity between Turkish and Israeli officials, accompanied by warm, even gushing, tributes. Turkey, which has long taken an even-handed approach to both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has upgraded its relations with both following progress in the Middle East peace process and has committed Dollars 52m in exports credits and cash for the West Bank if a peace accord is reached. Turkey was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Israel, and has maintained ties since 1949, balancing this with support for the committee of Palestinian rights and recognition of the state of Palestine declared by the PLO in 1988. Ankara has been involved in five multilateral working groups on the peace process, although it was largely a spectator in the initial proceedings. Turkey's ambition to construct a peace pipeline carrying water to Jordan, the West Bank and Lebanon remains on hold owing to questions of cost effectiveness - desalination of sea water is presently a cheaper option. A pilot project is also under way to ship drinking water from the Manavgat river near Antalya on the Mediterranean coast by sea to Israel, using large plastic 'bags'. Relations with Israel gained momentum with the visit of Israeli president Ezer Weizman in January. A host of agreements from double-taxation to trade were initialled including a three-way tourism pact between Turkey, Israel and Egypt. Co-operation with Israel on terrorism, however, was not rapturously received. When Mr Cetin visited Jerusalem last year, Israeli officials avoided a commitment to provide intelligence or take joint action against Kurdish rebel bases. During his visit, Mr Weizman said: 'Turkey talks to everybody.' However, Turkey is anxious not to be viewed just as a 'talking shop' or a neutral venue. It wants to ease the strains of 'living in a tough neighbourhood'.</p>

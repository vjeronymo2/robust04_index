			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Nearly 3,000 Soviet children will be tested for AIDS because of the infection  of at least 27 infants and four mothers while being treated at a Moscow-area  hospital, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said. Authorities suspect poor  sanitary conditions and the possible reuse of disposable syringes. The paper  also quoted Vladimir Pokrovsky, head of a special AIDS research laboratory, as  saying that acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spreading in the Soviet  Union, where the public is generally indifferent to the deadly disease. "The  epidemic has entered our country," Pokrovsky said. "It is gathering speed, and  we now have 146 virus carriers."  </P></p>

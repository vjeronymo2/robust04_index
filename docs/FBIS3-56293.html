Ukraine gets compensation for battlefield nuclear weapons.  "We have also secured smooth economic relations, confirmed  territorial integrity, respect for each other, and partnership,"  Kravchuk said. "That, he added, can hardly be called a  compromise because such relations are taken for granted as  absolutely normal ties, only we have been getting used to them  with difficulty so far."    Talking to an Interfax correspondent, Kravchuk voiced  confidence that parliament would ratify the accords as they  offer a good solution to this very complex world problem.    "The people and parliament of Ukraine will see that their  republic is treated with respect as a country rather than a  second rate nation and that all issues are being settled fairly."    The president voiced readiness to risk his political career.  "The career of a politician cannot compare with the global  problem we are solving. I do not put my career above this  global issue. I will do all I can so that Ukraine does not  stand in the way of nuclear disarmament," Kravchuk stressed.    He reported that Russia and Ukraine were working out a  friendship treaty that would rest on a new basis and awareness  of responsibility to people and history. "We will remove the  acute issues dividing us. We will resolve the nuclear problem  tomorrow. And then we will settle the problem of the Black Sea  Fleet," the Ukrainian president said.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEAM EFFORT ON JAILS  </P> <P> The Times calls for the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to assume control  of the jails currently operated by the sheriff ("Time Is Ripe for Supervisors  to Assume Control of Jails," Feb. 18). Nowhere, however, does The Times  indicate how such a move would solve the horrendous problems associated with  our local detention system. The Times, which also publishes editions in Los  Angeles and Orange counties, suggests this transfer of responsibility only in  San Diego. Apparently jails operated by the sheriffs of the other Southern  California counties seem to be very acceptable.  </P> <P> The principal area of concern appears to be accountability. We should not  forget that the elected sheriff is accountable to the very people that the  elected members of the Board of Supervisors are responsible to -- the people.  Accountability of elected officials is the cornerstone of a democratic  governmental system.  </P> <P> As for the board's continuous concern for financial accountability of the  sheriff, let us not forget that no one has ever asserted that the local jail  system is funded as it should be. Isn't it somewhat incongruent to demand  financial accountability on the part of the sheriff while at the same time  claiming there is insufficient money available to provide even an adequate  level of security staff?  </P> <P> If county sheriffs can operate jails in the vast majority of other California  counties, surely, with proper funding and support, the sheriff of San Diego  County can do likewise.  </P> <P> Rather than spend valuable time, effort and public money creating a new  Department of Corrections, the board, county staff and the sheriff should be  working in concert to solve our problems. The Board of Supervisors may well be  able to utilize the political power of the sheriff as an ally in its fight for  the redistribution of tax revenues to this county. It is far better to take on  Sacramento with a single focus and a unified front than a fragmented,  quarrelsome team that won't walk on the same field together.  </P> <P> A county Department of Corrections holds no promise to solve existing problems.  A well focused team effort on the part of all county elected officials is the  promise of the future.  </P> <P> JACK DROWN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P> <P>  Jack Drown is an assistant sheriff and a candidate for sheriff.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONO AND THE MEDIA  </P> <P> Re "Yoko Ono, a Decade After the 'Horrible Thing,' " May 6:  </P> <P> Interviewer Glenn Plaskin wasted little time with polite patter and dug into  the subjects that we're all dying to know about: Yoko's abortions, finances,  sexual conduct and drug history.  </P> <P> Amid all this he asks, "No matter what Yoko does, she's frequently the victim  of bad press. Any idea why?"  </P> <P> More amazing still is that Yoko somehow felt obliged to answer these inquiries.  Being famous must be a real treat.  </P> <P> ALEXANDER D. VAIL  </P> <P> Avalon  </P></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Court ruling exposes Taiwan's financial flaws: Executives at Tatung found guilty of running an illegal deposit scheme Senior executives at Tatung, a leading listed Taiwanese electronics company, are to appeal against a court ruling which found them guilty of violating domestic banking laws by taking deposits to finance expansion, writes Laura Tyson in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The company's chairman, Mr Lin Ting-sheng, and its finance manager, Mr Liu Hong-tsai, are unhappy with the verdict in a case that reveals both the shortcomings of Taiwan's state-dominated banking system and the country's historically less-than-rigid enforcement and observance of law. A Taipei district court on Thursday handed down suspended 16-month prison sentences to the two executives for running an illegal deposit scheme through the company. According to 1989 revisions to the Banking Law, non-bank entities are not permitted to take deposits, undertake trustee business or offer remittance services. The law stipulates a jail sentence of between one and seven years. The two executives, who were charged last December following a three-year investigation, were convicted of illegally accepting deposits from company employees, shareholders and nearby residents. Tatung has collected nearly Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) since 1957. Observers said the verdict was intended to 'kill the chicken to warn the monkey' - that is, to send a strong signal to Taiwan companies regarding a practice that is widespread and has been largely tolerated by the authorities. Taiwan's Central Bank of China even includes in its regularly published statistics charts showing prevailing interest rates on loans and deposits in the 'unorganised financial markets'. 'Tatung was singled out not because it's the only company which does this, but because it was so brazen,' one observer said. 'Most companies just take deposits from their employees; this is commonly seen as a type of staff benefit. But Tatung was accepting deposits from the public as well, and everybody knew they were doing this.' Mr Lin and Mr Liu contend that they were forced to seek financing from deposits because the company could not raise enough money from banks to satisfy its plans for expansion. Taiwan banks generally lend only on the basis of full collateral, partly because individual loan officers may be held personally liable in the event of non-payment. They also plan to argue in their defence that the scheme offered a return which was fair for both the company and the depositors. While employee deposit schemes often yield 2 per cent per month, Tatung offered an average annual interest rate of 8.5 per cent. Moreover, all of the 13,000-odd depositors participated in the scheme on a voluntary basis, they said. Interest payments amounted to some NTDollars 2bn (Pounds 49.4m) a year. Taiwan's underground financial markets have diminished in scale since their heyday following a crackdown in the late 1980s, but in-formal financing schemes and various other murky related activities remain. In the 1980s, dozens of underground finance companies sprang up and attracted deposits by offering interest rates as high as 8 per cent a month. The biggest underground bank, the Hung Yuan group, declared bankruptcy in 1991 after illegally attracting some Dollars 3.6bn from depositors. Tatung's share price closed at NTDollars 86.5 yesterday against NTDollars 88 on Thursday.</p>

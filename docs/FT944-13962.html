			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Landowners urge environmental farm policy Price support to European farmers is bound to fall further but it must be replaced by environmental and social funding if rural areas are to survive and prosper, according to a report by one of Britain's leading farm organisations. The Country Landowners Association, with 50,000 members from small farmers to large estate owners, calls for the Common Agricultural Policy to be transformed into a European Rural Policy. The CLA proposals, which will be discussed by its council next week, will fuel the debate on the need for further CAP reform in the light of the Gatt agreement and EU enlargement to encompass the farm-intensive countries of eastern Europe. Its contribution draws similar conclusions to a study by a group of independent agricultural experts for the European Commission last month, which recommended scrapping production quotas and payments to arable farmers for set-aside. But Mr George Dunn, CLA economist, said the organisation did not agree with that report's conclusion that member states, not the EU, should be responsible for future support for rural areas. 'We don't believe our Treasury would wear any such policy if they were allowed discretion over whether to implement it,' he said. The CLA report says agriculture remains significant to the economy and communities of rural areas and vital to environmental conservation, even if its contribution to GDP in some member states is falling. 'The context of any future CAP debate must therefore be the countryside as a whole.' Public pressure is mounting for cuts in support to agriculture, 'the last core industry to receive such a large amount of state support'. Continued support is increasingly being justified by - but confused with - other objectives such as the environment, which are targeted indirectly through agricultural payments. Yet current levels of funding for agri-environment programmes 'represent a missed opportunity.' In the UK, spending on these is only about 1 per cent of total farm support. The CLA calls for support payments to be based on the size of a farm, decoupling them from production. It says the existing system of production controls reduces farmers' flexibility to respond to changing circumstances, holds back new entrants and protects inefficient producers. It cites a recent study of the EU cereals sector by two commission officials showing that the CAP has lost Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.73bn) a year by keeping inefficient farmers in production. Hectarage payments should be reduced gradually, it argues, in step with the growth in voluntary countryside management schemes and in non-government sources of income. Further funding for forestry and non-food crops and for start-up for small businesses would be needed to help diversify the rural economy. Regional social aid would also have to be maintained in areas where an exodus from the land would create social and environmental problems. The CLA acknowledges the difficulty of selling such a policy shift. 'But it is clear that the EU is set on a course of reducing support prices. The debate has moved from 'if' there is to be a move to market prices to 'how' this will be achieved,' it says.</p>

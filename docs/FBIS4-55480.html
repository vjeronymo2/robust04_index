			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert for the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, by Laszlo Hajnal; place and date not  given: "The Central Payments Can Also Be Stopped"]    [Text] The new government will first have to make a full  inventory of the country's situation to find out where we start  from, Laszlo Bekesi has said. Bekesi, who formulated the  economic program for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also  said that, after the new cabinet comes into office, immediate  measures will be necessary to stop the further increase of the  domestic and foreign state debt. Parallel with the quick  measures, the 1995 budget will have to be prepared, and the so  far delayed reform of state administration will have to be  started, which will probably take up all of the next  parliamentary cycle.    [Hajnal] On the night of the elections, MSZP Deputy Chairman  Imre Szekeres said that the party was preparing a six-month  action plan in which the most important tasks are laid down.  Which measures will apply to the economy after the new  government is formed?    [Bekesi] We are indeed preparing a 15-point package, in  which the most important tasks are laid down: What can be  implemented or corrected this year, and how to prepare for the  next year because the draft 1995 budget will also have to be  prepared by the fall. At the same time, this six-month period  is deceptive because, in my view, the next government will not  even have one day's grace, it will have to begin to act straight  away.    First of all, we are making a full inventory of the  macro-processes because, although we are familiar with the major  indicators, we do not possess all the information. We must have  exact information on the country's economic situation and its  assets, our forint and foreign currency obligations, and the  central burdens of the ongoing processes -- for example, debtor  consolidation or privatization. When this inventory is  completed, then we will have to show it -- our starting point --  to the country. In my view, the country's increasing domestic  and foreign indebtedness is the most dangerous process, we must  not delay curbing this, and results should be achieved in this  area still in 1994.    [Hajnal] One way of doing this can be the often mentioned  and inevitable supplementary budget. However, as the  supplementary budget cannot be accepted before September, its  effectiveness may be questionable, especially if both the  expenditure and revenue sides have so far been adhered to  proportionately with time.    [Bekesi] Essentially, we can only consider changing the  expenditure side, which means the freezing of certain items. I  am thinking of the 40 decentralized funds that are kind of small  budgets within the big budget. In my view, out of the funds  that represent some 100 billion forints' state support, the  payment of almost all titles can be frozen apart from the money  given to the agricultural sector, the municipalities, and  employment. This can mean some 20 to 30 billion forints. In  addition to this, other state payments can also be stopped,  mainly the support given to governmental and political organs,  which can reduce the expenditure side by another 20 billion  forints. Naturally, these are only estimates, this is precisely  the reason we have to prepare a correct inventory and situation  assessment.    It is more difficult to change the revenue side; increasing  taxes is certainly out of the question. However, it is worth  looking at the 150 billion forints of social security demands;  according to the experts, some 50 billion of this could be  moved, however, it is undoubtedly true that many tools,  including the legal background in certain cases, are lacking for  the mobilization of these assets.    Naturally, it is only worth making a supplementary budget if  real savings can be achieved through it.    [Hajnal] In your previous statements, among the immediate  tasks, you mentioned the suspension of certain passages of the  law on cooperatives, a possible stopping of the preferential  share purchase program [KRP], and the formulation of new asset  policy principles. What concrete measures were you thinking of,  especially when the KRP is being offered to ordinary people by  the current government?    [Bekesi] In the case of the cooperatives, we have to prevent  the remaining assets from being further taken to pieces, this  has to be stopped immediately. I am convinced that the same  should be done with the KRP because this method does not mean  the inclusion of new capital and it does not really create new  owners. Of course, the KRP can also be amended but the details  of this still have to be looked at.    [Hajnal] In the meantime, the year 1995 also has to be  prepared. What are the tasks facing legislation?    [Bekesi] The majority of tax laws will certainly have to be  amended, which would mean further tax reductions and tax  allowances. These would be aimed at stimulating enterprises and  savings. Further legislative tasks would be: Drawing up the  foreign currency code and the customs law, amending the local  authority law, creating export guarantees, and many others.    [Hajnal] Implementing the reform of state administration  would be an urgent task for the new government. How long would  it take to implement this reform and what are its major points?    [Bekesi] In my view, the implementation of the reform would  take up the whole parliamentary cycle, but it certainly cannot  be delayed any more. Within this, we have to solve the  financing of the domestic state debts, on the revenue side it is  necessary to reexamine the state functions, within this, the  basic services and the proportions of distribution have to be  corrected, naturally, linked to compensation, and the  decentralized funds will also certainly have to be reduced.    [Hajnal] In the past, a number of people formulated the  MSZP's actual economic program. Is this program the one signed  by you or the one that appeared in an advertisement, perhaps,  with the influence of trade unions?    [Bekesi] I believe that it is the former because the  MSZP's congress accepted it, and this version appeared in the  party's election program. Naturally, the way this will appear  as a coalition government's program will have to be decided in  negotiations with the partners.    [Hajnal] As the person who drew up the MSZP's economic  program, what role do you envisage for yourself in the new  government?    [Bekesi] It would be far too early to talk about this  because much depends on the second round of the elections. The  question is, what kind of government will be formed, what  members it will have, what kind of program can be drawn up with  these members, and whether I actually wish to participate in it  because this is a two-way street.</p>

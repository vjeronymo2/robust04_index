			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Japanese budget to aim for austerity Japan's finance ministry yesterday signalled a shift from an expansionary to a neutral fiscal policy in 1995 by proposing the first fall in budget outlays in 40 years. The ministry's draft budget, to be submitted to parliament next month, calls for a 2.9 per cent decline to Y70,891bn (Pounds 454bn) in overall outlays for the tax year starting next April. The decline is, however, due to a fall in debt-servicing charges caused by an accounting change. General spending, a clearer indicator of the government's fiscal stance, is to rise by 3.1 per cent to Y42,142bn. Economists in Tokyo estimate this to be a smaller underlying increase than the current year after adjusting for fiscal pump-priming packages, not included in the initial budget, and spending carried over from earlier years. The proposed austerity reflected the government's 'unhealthy' fiscal position, said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister. Social security payments, representing the largest share of general spending, are planned to rise by 3.1 per cent to Y13,892bn, reflecting the growing number of elderly and a small rise in unemployment. Public works are set to rise by 4 per cent to Y9,240bn, a slight slowdown from the last budget's 4.4 per cent growth. Defence spending is to be squeezed hard, up by a mere 0.86 per cent to Y4,724bn, the lowest rise for 35 years, and a reflection of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's need to accommodate its Socialist coalition partners. Japan, the world's largest aid donor, also plans to follow other industrialised countries' example in curbing the growth in its foreign aid budget, up by 3.2 per cent to Y1,098bn, the lowest rise ever. The austerity of this budget is a consequence of the pressure on government revenues from the income tax cuts agreed earlier this year and the weakness of the economic recovery. Tax revenues next year are forecast to rise by a mere Y66bn to Y53,731bn. In line with its traditional aversion to increasing the government's debts, the ministry plans to reduce the amount of bonds it plans to issue next year by Y1,045bn to Y12,598bn, representing 17.7 per cent of government revenues, down one percentage point from the current 12 months. Most of the total, Y9,750bn, will be construction bonds, so called because they are used to fund public works and are acceptable to the ministry on the grounds that they increase Japan's assets. The Japanese government has approved plans for telephone rate increases by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the country's partially privatised telecommunications operator and the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The increases in monthly basic subscriber fees and directory assistance charges, which will be implemented next February, are the first in 18 years. The move comes after strong lobbying by NTT, as increases in public service charges have been a sensitive issue for a government faced with a slow economic recovery. Last March, the company was forced to abandon its original plan to raise its subscription fees as the government decided to freeze all utilities and public service charges to preserve consumer confidence. The rate increase, which will raise basic subscriber fees by 16.4 per cent and double the charge for directory assistance for subscribers using the service more than twice a month, follows last week's approval by the authorities.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                           BUDGET OUTLAYS  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                    1994                   1995                          Fiscal year to       Draft for fiscal                              April 1995     year to April 1996  --------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       Y73,081.7bn            Y70,987.1bn                             (up 1.0% on            (down 2.9%)                          previous year)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                             Y14,360.2bn            Y13,221.3bn National debt service       (down 7.0%)            (down 7.9%)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Tax grants to local         Y12.757.8bn            Y13,215.4bn authorities/governments    (down 18.3%)              (up 3.6%)  --------------------------------------------------------------- General expenditures        Y40,854.8bn            Y42,141.7bn                               (up 2.3%)              (up 3.1%)  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Gadaffi considers handover of bomb suspects COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, has raised the possibility of handing over to the US the agents accused in the Lockerbie aircraft disaster on condition there is an 'improvement of bilateral relations.' A report to the UN Security Council last night said this was one of the ideas that emerged from discussions last month in Tripoli between the Libyan authorities and Mr Vasiliy Safronchuk, a senior Russian official in the UN secretariat. However, diplomatic sources said that while the Libyan position appeared to be an improvement on earlier intransigence, it still was insufficient for the US, Britain and France to consider droppping the threat of further measures, including sanctions. The Security Council is expected to take up the question again after it completes considerations of the Iraqi problem next week. In two meetings with Mr Safronchuk, a special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, Col Gadaffi again argued that 'constitutional obstructions' prevented handing over for trial abroad those accused in the 1988 disaster involving Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland. But if those problems were solved, Libya 'could be inclined to consider France as the possible venue for a trial,' the UN report said. It added, however, that France had not requested that any suspects - including those responsible for blowing up a UTA airliner over Niger nine months after Lockerbie - be extradited. Referring to the possibility of handing over the suspects to third countries, Col Gaddafi mentioned Malta 'or any Arab country.' 'Improvements of bilateral relations would make it possible to hand over' the suspects in the Pan Am disaster to US authorities, he said. Washington's relations with Tripoli have been effectively, though not formally, broken off. A Libyan letter annexed to the report included other proposals. Among these was the possibility that the suspects be questioned at the UN office in Tripoli and that Mr Boutros Ghali appoint an impartial judicial committee to 'ascertain the facts and seriousness of the charges,' as well as conduct a full investigation. If the secretary-general were satisfied the charges were serious, Libya would 'not object to extradite the suspects under his personal supervision to a third party with the assurance that they will not be re-extradited.'</p>

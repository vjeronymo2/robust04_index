			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Smith firm on voting change for candidates MR JOHN SMITH yesterday set the stage for an autumn showdown with union leaders over the way the Labour party chooses its parliamentary candidates, pledging to press 'hard' and 'vigorously' for the introduction of one-member-one-vote. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, the Labour leader said he was 'very clear' the party had to 'move towards' such a selection system. 'I am strongly committed to it and I will be arguing for it forcefully,' he said. Alluding to his recent suggestion that union members who pay the political levy and who wish to participate in the selection of parliamentary candidates should be entitled to cut-price membership of the party, Mr Smith said he wanted to see 'as many trade unionists as possible taking part'. 'This is not a debate about the links between the unions and the Labour party, it is about the Labour party having a clear democratic basis for selecting our candidates,' he said. Mr Smith has turned one-member-one-vote into a test of his own political credibility but has so far failed to secure the backing of most big unions. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the 860,000-strong GMB general union, is tomorrow expected to underline his unwillingness to compromise. His views will be given in the context of a more general denunciation of Labour's failure to seize the political opportunities provided by the government's recent problems. But Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and next year's Labour party chairman, will today signal his backing for Mr Smith's position. In a speech to a joint Labour Co-ordinating Committee/Tribune conference in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett will call on those who supported Mr Smith's election as leader to 'renew their declaration of allegiance to his leadership'. Mr Smith expressed confidence that he would win the anticipated vote on the issue at Labour's autumn conference. 'I believe we can win . . . and I am determined that that is what we shall do,' he said. He made no reference yesterday to proposals to weaken or remove the unions' voting strength in electing the party leader and deputy leader.</p>

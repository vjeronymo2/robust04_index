			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bombay falls sharply as VSNL withdraws Dollars 1bn issue Individual stories coloured trading in the region yesterday, while Tokyo was closed for the Golden Week holiday. It reopens on Friday. Following the sharp correction in many of the region's markets during the first quarter, Kleinwort Benson suggested that the worst appeared to be over. In their latest global strategy report the investment bankers argued that while the rest of the year would not be easy, valuations had come down to 'historically more acceptable levels'. They continued: 'With a strengthening OECD recovery at their back, the Asian markets can expect more upward earnings revisions over the next 12 to 24 months.' Kleinworts selected Malaysia and Thailand as two of the region's markets worth buying, both being helped by export growth. BOMBAY fell sharply following the withdrawal of a Dollars 1bn Euroissue by VSNL, the country's overseas telecommunication group. The BSE index lost 47.21 to 3,673.51, with VSNL down Rs220 at Rs1,100. The Euroissue of GDRs was to have been priced yesterday, with indications of a range between Rs1,400 and Rs1,600 per share. Brokers commented that the withdrawal would probably curtail similar issues which had been planned by a number of other smaller Indian companies. HONG KONG fell 1.4 per cent, as a lack of demand continued to plague the market and any rebound was thought unlikely before the Japanese holiday was over. The Hang Seng index fell 120.57 to 8,679.13, having been as much as 220 points lower in the afternoon before technical support emerged. Property stocks remained der pressure. SHK Properties fell 75 cents to HKDollars 44.25, while Henderson Land was 50 cents down at HKDollars 37.25. AUSTRALIA lost a little ground but activity was described as lacking direction in the absence of both the UK and Japanese markets. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.7 lower at 2,044.2 in turnover of ADollars 367m. In the media sector, News Corp shed 9 cents to ADollars 9.49 ahead of its release of earnings today. BHP lost 2 cents to ADollars 16.90, although brokers commented that investors were generally unperturbed by reports that the group is to be sued for ADollars 4bn by villagers in Papua New Guinea who have alleged that the Ok Tedi river has been polluted by the company. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower, although shares of Golden Pharos were in demand amid rumours of a takeover and asset injection. The composite index closed down 12.48 at 1,042.02. Golden Pharos rose 70 cents to MDollars 9.65. A major shareholder sold its stake in the company last week, sparking speculation that a state government agency was the purchaser and planned to inject capital. SEOUL edged lower in spite of some institutional buying interest in a number of blue chips. The composite index eased 1.71 to 917.55. Most Hyundai group shares went up on the news that the founder, Chung Ju-yung, had decided to leave the business for good. Many investors believed that this would help to ease relationships between the group and government, and that it could result in a resumption of financing. Both Hyundai Engineering and Construction and Hyundai Corp went limit up, gaining Won1,600 and Won1,000 to Won41,600 and Won25,900 respectively. Samsung Electronics gained Won2,500 to Won85,500 and Goldstar Won1,000 to Won26,700 after their financial statements detailed better than expected profits. MANILA saw heavy foreign buying which drove prices 1.8 per cent higher. The composite index rose 52.49 to 2,937.93, the first time since February that the index has peaked above 2,900. Volume soared to 2.53bn shares from 1.12bn. PLDT led gainers, closing 80 pesos higher at 1,850 pesos. San Miguel A shares gained another 2 pesos to 178 pesos as it announced that it had won permission to sell or redevelop its Hong Kong brewery. SINGAPORE was boosted by demand for a number of blue chips from institutional investors, although overall sentiment remained cautious. The Straits Times Industrials index advanced 14.37 to 2,310.56. KARACHI was stronger on the last day of the account, with the KSE index adding 6.11 to 2,384.96, supported by buying of blue chips. NEW ZEALAND was slightly easier with only Fletcher Challenge, among leading shares, reversing the trend with a gain of 4 cents to NZDollars 3.40. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 10.56 to 2,085.58. Turnover was NZDollars 31.2m. COLOMBO sustained its second successive record decline, on political and economic uncertainty, the all share index losing 48.24 to 1,002.61 for a two-day loss of 8.7 per cent.</p>

The certification of air-purifying respirators under these proposed requirements would enable respirator users to select from a broader range of certified respirators that meet the current performance criteria in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Provide information on the storage and reuse of respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Expanded the general guidelines on the reuse of respirators classified as disposable and those with replaceable filters. Retained the original suggestion to refer to manufacturers recommendations concerning storage and reuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is unclear which facilities must have a respiratory protection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Clarified that facilities that do not have isolation rooms for TB, that do not perform cough-inducing procedures, and refer all potential TB patients need not have a respirator program but must perform a periodic risk assessment, have protocols for referral, and an infection control plan that is periodically reviewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> H. Cough-Inducing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received that differed substantively from those covered in other sections of the document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> I. Education and Training of Health-Care Workers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, the comments supported the concept of education for HCWs. Persons from a number of specialties noted that educational programs should be flexible and should allow for the selection of information to be included in these programs and that the frequency of training should be based on the risk of TB transmission in the facility or area. Some suggested emphasis on educating physicians in the early recognition and proper treatment for persons with tuberculosis. Because of difficulties with compliance with attendance and the time needed away from the job in the busy health care environment, concern was expressed about the increasing requirements for mandatory annual educational training sessions on various subjects (bloodborne pathogens, fire safety, hazardous exposure). A few persons suggested that CDC provide standardized training materials. A few commented on the expense of the training program, including the respirator training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Modified section to allow more flexibility in selection of topics to cover and frequency of education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

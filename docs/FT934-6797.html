			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fisons takes action after improper sales practices are shown Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment group, yesterday said it had dismissed one employee and disciplined another following the discovery of improper sales practices. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said an internal investigation had shown four examples of impropriety involving doctors who had been offered inducements to prescribe the company's products. 'The most serious allegation was the one of bribery,' said Mr Scroggs. 'Two doctors said they were offered money, while another said he was offered a book token for nursing staff books. This is clearly not acceptable.' The company had conducted an inquiry focused initially on the seven-strong West Midlands sales force, but it had been extended throughout the UK organisation, said Mr Scroggs. 'It's difficult to prove a negative, but we are as confident as we can be that we have not had widespread bribery.' Mr Rick Tiller, the West Midlands area sales manager who had been suspended, had been reinstated. He was not implicated in offering financial inducements to doctors, Mr Scroggs added. Press reports earlier this month of excessive hospitality to doctors, were unfounded, said Mr Scroggs. Any hospitality had been within the guidelines set by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Suggestions there had been a 'slush-fund' to entertain doctors were also erroneous. Promotional funds were available for local meetings, but these were not against the ABPI code.</p>

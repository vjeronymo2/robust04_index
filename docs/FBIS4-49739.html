			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping Has Informal Meeting With Persons From </F> Hong Kong Grass-Roots Social Organizations, Urges Hong Kong  Residents To Participate in Work To Achieve Smooth Transition"]    [Text] Lu Ping, deputy head and general secretary of the  Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] for the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, said yesterday (8 May) that Hong Kong is  the Hong Kong people's Hong Kong, and that "Hong Kong people  running Hong Kong" first requires the broad masses of Hong Kong  residents to run Hong Kong. With participation in this matter  by the broad masses of Hong Kong people, it is absolutely  possible to achieve a smooth transition.    Lu Ping made this remark yesterday morning when attending a  forum for people from Hong Kong's grass-roots organizations and  communities to meet the mainland members of the political and  economic subgroups of the PWC.    Lu Ping said that China has a saying that goes: "Roots are  deep and firm"; when roots are deep, a plant blossoms and bears  fruit. The masses at the grass-roots level in Hong Kong are Hong  Kong's foundation and roots. So-called "Hong Kong people  running Hong Kong" cannot be understood narrowly, as Hong Kong  being run by a small number of those in the government  departments. The meaning of "Hong Kong people running Hong  Kong" is broad, and it first means that the broad masses of  residents and those at the grass-roots level should run Hong  Kong themselves, and realize Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity in the future through "Hong Kong people running Hong  Kong."    Lu Ping said: We hope that you, and through you we can fully  mobilize the strength of Hong Kong residents, so that everyone  takes part in realizing "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong."  In particular, from now to 1997 is only a little more than  three years, and there are a lot of preparations to be made, so  it is not enough simply to rely on the PWC. There must be  participation by Hong Kong people so we really can achieve a  smooth transition.    Lu Ping said: I have said that Hong Kong is an economic city  and that I do not want to see it become a political city. I was  getting at something when I said this. Someone has tried to  turn Hong Kong into a base, in order to change the socialist  system on the mainland. They also said openly that Hong Kong  already has become a political city, and the days when it could  get along well with the mainland have gone for good. The report  by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee confessed  -- without being pressed -- openly admitting that Britain's  policy toward China, including Hong Kong, has changed already,  that is, from cooperation to confrontation, so we must see  clearly the face of the British Government.    Lu Ping continued: It is not true that we do not want you to  take part in politics; we do hope you care about the work during  Hong Kong's transitional period, that you care about politics,  and about Hong Kong's future.    Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to  cooperate with the British side in other areas, but cooperation  involves both sides. Whether cooperation can succeed depends on  whether the British side has the sincerity, but no sign of  sincerity can be seen at this moment.    Lu Ping stressed: Hong Kong is the Hong Kong people's Hong  Kong, even without cooperation from the British side, we are  very confident that relying on the broad masses of Hong Kong  residents, we definitely can achieve a smooth transition.    Among those attending the forum were 200 people from the  Hong  Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the Association of Teachers,  the Reform Club, the Public Housing Federation, the Federation  of Social Groups in the New Territories, and many district and  grass-roots organizations.    After the meeting, Cheng Yao-tang, Hong Kong deputy to the  National People's Congress and head of the Hong Kong Federation  of Trade Unions, cited Lu Ping as saying that someone recently  deliberately distorted the speech he made at a luncheon with the  five main chambers of commerce. In his speech, he mentioned  that Hong Kong is an economic city and cannot become a political  city.    When he said it could not become a "political city," he  meant  that Hong Kong must not be used as a base to change the  socialist system in China, and must not become an arena for  competition in the international community.    Cheng Yao-tang said that participants in the forum mainly  expressed opinions on the general problems of the people's  livelihood, including soaring housing prices, the youth problem,  education, retirement security, and the people's well-being in  the New Territories. Lu Ping also responded to the problem of  housing prices when he gave a summation, and said that the high  housing prices already have put houses out of reach for ordinary  residents, and if things go on like this, the law of the market  will mete out the punishment, and this will directly affect the  people's livelihood and the smooth transition. He does not want  to see such a punishment to take place on 1 July 1997. At  present, the PWC is actively deliberating a relevant housing  policy.    In addition, forum participant Yang Yao-chung, chairman of  the Association of Teachers, briefed Lu Ping on Hong Kong's  educational problem, including the proposal on strengthening  promotion of the Basic Law, and increasing educational exchanges  between Hong Kong and the mainland.</p>

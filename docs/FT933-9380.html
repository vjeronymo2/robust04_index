			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Profits, please WITH THE UK recession now over, British companies seem to have come through it in remarkably good shape. The profitability of those which have survived is much higher than at the end of the last recession. Their investment is holding up, as is their capacity utilisation. Despite higher margins, they remain more competitive in world markets than a decade ago. With a recovery under way, might it not be plain sailing from now on? Perhaps, but not necessarily. As the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin suggests, the most significant change in British commercial life over the past decade has been in the relations between employer and employee. The driving force behind higher margins has been rising productivity, combined - latterly - with surprising wage restraint. But the implied shift in the balance of power between labour and capital cannot be unconnected with the endemic rise in unemployment over the past decade, and its future direction is uncertain. Granted, the shift has benefited workers and shareholders alike. As the Bulletin reminds us, the share of profits paid out in dividends doubled during the 1980s. This did not stop the real wages of UK workers rising rapidly in the same period: the losers were those whose jobs were sacrificed in the cause of higher productivity. But the rise in dividends also meant that retained profits - that is, profits available for re-investment - were no higher in relation to GDP in this recession than in the last. Though investment was higher, it was funded by debt: a fact which may have made companies more conservative. Moreover, the rise in UK profitability over the decade owes much to the more recent inclusion of the privatised utilities. Exclude those, and the remaining companies which make up Britain's shrunken export-orientated manufacturing industry still make a meagre return by international standards. But unless more capital can be attracted to the traded goods sector, Britain is unlikely to correct its trade deficit. And unless manufacturers can make higher returns, they cannot keep both workers and shareholders happy and have profits left to reinvest. Whether the outcome is the rosy scenario - a sustained rise in export margins - will depend on how the government and wage-bargainers react to recovery. The UK government has staked the remnants of its credibility on its inflation record. The news that UK factory gate prices rose last month by 4.1 per cent may sound unsettling in a supposed low-inflation environment. If companies are to improve their margins, they must be allowed to raise their prices faster than their costs. At present, the devaluation of sterling gives British industry that opportunity. But if the government takes fright and seeks to push sterling up, or if wage-bargainers try to offset higher prices with higher wages, then it will not be plain sailing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--Sources in the Israeli  delegation taking part in the Security Committee meeting that  opened in Cairo today under the chairmanship of 'Uzi Dayan, head  of the Israeli General Staff's Planning Branch, have said that  the meeting discussed the nature of ties between the Palestinian  police force and the Israeli troops in legal terms within the  framework of a new committee called the New Legal Committee.    The sources pointed out that there is no problem concerning  the entry of the Palestinian police force into the self-rule  areas in Gaza and Jericho. They added that all matters will be  discussed with the Israeli commanders in the field once the  vanguards of the Palestinian police force enter these areas.    The same sources have said that Israel has consented to the  entry of 10,000 troops of the Palestinian force into Gaza and  Jericho and that nine of the commanders of the Palestinian force  will head for Gaza and Jericho on Tuesday to discuss with the  commanders of the southern and central zones issues related to  the deployment of the Palestinian forces and the taking of their  positions this week.    The sources pointed out that three battalions, 1,500 troops,  of the Palestinian police force will head for Gaza and Jericho  on Thursday.</p>

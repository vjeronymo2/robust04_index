			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Petrov article: "Russian Commercial Banks Ready for </F> Competition. But Only Among Themselves"]    [Text] The disputes on the activity of foreign banks in  Russia which were on the point of dying down seem to be about to  flare up again with renewed force. It cannot be ruled out that  is connected with the request of the French bank subsidiary  "Societe Generale Rossiya" and the Moscow branch of the  "Austria" bank for admission to the Association of Russian  Banks, one of the most influential banking organizations.    Let me remind you that the "Austria" bank was licensed by  the  Central Bank of Russia to set up a branch in Moscow without the  right to provide services to Russian residents back on 5 October  1992. The "Societe Generale Rossiya," with an incorporation  capital of $35 million, was given broader powers by the Central  Bank of Russia, but because it did not begin working with  residents before 15 November 1993 it fell under the effect of  the President's "restrictive" edict and has now formally lost  that right for two years.    Local Russian bankers look so self-assured and respectable  in  their TV advertisements but almost in unison plead poverty when  it comes to competing in the banking services market with  well-known Western financial institutions. So far they have  successfully used the banner of judicious protectionism to  justify raising a solid barrier against their foreign  counterparts' penetration of Russia. For example, Sergey  Filatov, director of the President's Staff, has officially  confirmed that there is no draft presidential edict on expanding  the operations of foreign banks on Russian territory in  preparation.    At the same time, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin has stated  that if bilateral agreements are signed between Russia and the  European Union [EU] or any other country on mutual preferences  in the granting of access to each other's market, the government  will ask the president to lift the prohibitive effect of his  edict on those countries' banks.    In A. Shokhin's words, the Russian Government will work for  the "gradual extension of the national regime to foreign banks."  But there are quite a few exclusions of a protectionist nature  in agreements with the EU right now. For example, foreign  banks' capital must not exceed 12 percent of total Russian bank  capital, there is a three-year restriction on their dealing in  securities, and the minimum residue in their accounts must be at  least 50,000 ECU's.    Russia's commercial banks have been given a considerable  head  start. But will they be able to use it to the benefit of their  clients?</p>

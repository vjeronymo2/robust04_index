			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusuisse's Essen plant to close permanently Alusuisse-Lonza is to make the first permanent aluminium output cut to be announced following the agreement by some of the world's big aluminium-producing countries to reduce global annual supply. The Swiss group is to shut its smelter at Essen in Germany with the loss of 400 jobs. The smelter has an annual capacity of about 130,000 tonnes but recently has been producing only between 40,000 and 50,000 tonnes. Alusuisse says the smelter has suffered substantial losses and 'even if western producing countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States can put into effect agreements on desired production cuts, no significant improvement can be expected for the foreseeable future in the situation for central European aluminium smelters'. As the market absorbed the news from Alusuisse and the overnight statement from Alcoa (the Aluminium Company of America) that it would immediately cut annual output by another 100,000 tonnes, aluminium's price on the London Metal Exchange rose to Dollars 1,310 a tonne. However, chart-based selling of most LME metals affected aluminium in quiet conditions and the price fell back to close at Dollars 1,295.50, down Dollars 5 a tonne. Analysts said metal prices were due for a correction after recent sharp rises. Also the market was quieter than usual because of the Chinese New Year. Alusuisse previously closed its Swiss smelter and is now left only with two, one in Iceland, producing about 96,000 tonnes a year, and the other in Norway, producing an annual 40,000 tonnes. It said it had no plans to cut output at these plants. Alcoa's new cuts, which will result in a first-quarter charge, affect the Rockdale, Texas, and Wenatchee, Washington, smelters. Analysts suggested that Pechiney's Venthon smelter in France, producing about 30,000 tonnes a year, was another candidate in Europe for permanent shut-down.  ---------------------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------- Aluminium           +5,025         to  2,533,250 Aluminium alloy       +240         to     47,160 Copper                -100         to    594,850 Lead                  +850         to    321,850 Nickel                +414         to    130,386 Zinc                +3,125         to  1,010,825 Tin                   +120         to     21,435  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

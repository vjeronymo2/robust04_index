			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SRI LANKA TIGHTENS CENSORSHIP  </P> <P> The government today extended tough censorship laws to foreign media and said  security forces can shoot Sinhalese radicals engaging in violence or putting up  anti-government posters.  </P> <P> "No news whatsoever can go out of this country without being censored," Foreign  Minister Rajan Wijeratne told a news conference. "If you cannot conform to  that, please leave the country."  </P> <P> "I will cancel your visas and deport you if you violate the censorship," he  told reporters, who included several foreign correspondents. "If I decide to  cancel a visa, no appeals will be considered."  </P> <P> The government blames Sinhalese militants for at least 3,500 killings since  they launched an anti-government campaign in July, 1987, to protest peace  overtures being made to separatist Tamil rebels.  </P></p>

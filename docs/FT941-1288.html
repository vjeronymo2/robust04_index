			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nestle surprises with 7% climb Nestle, the world's largest foods and mineral waters group, has reported a stronger-than-expected 7 per cent rise in 1993 net income, to SFr2.89bn (Dollars 2bn). It has also dampened recent speculation that the arrangements between it and L'Oreal, the French cosmetics group, would change soon. A 20-year contract, under which Nestle and Ms Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of the L'Oreal founder, share ownership of the 51 per cent controlling stake in the cosmetics group, expires tomorrow. Nestle said yesterday the contract provided for the continuation of the right of first refusal for both sides. It said the gain in its trading profits last year was greatest in countries outside of Europe and the Americas, giving support to the recent view in investor circles that its commitment to developing countries is beginning to pay off. Total trading profits were up 8.9 per cent, to SFr6.14bn, with those in North and South America advancing 5.9 per cent to SFr2.29bn. In Europe, they gained 9.6 per cent, to SFr2.59bn, and in the rest of the world they jumped 13 per cent to SFr1.27bn. Total sales advanced 5.5 per cent to SFr 57.5bn, in spite of a 1 per cent decline in Europe to SFr26.37bn. Sales in North and South America were up 10.5 per cent, to SFr21.24bn, while those in the rest of the world increased 14.2 per cent to SFr9.89bn. Nestle said cashflow improved 6.3 per cent, to SFr4.97bn. This helped the group reduce its net debt at year-end to SFr8bn, compared with SFr9.9bn a year earlier, following the SFr2.2bn Source Perrier acquisition. Net financing costs last year jumped 15.2 per cent to SFr885m.</p>

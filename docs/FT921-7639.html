			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bespak to spend Dollars 58m expanding US market BESPAK, a maker of specialist aerosol valves for the pharmaceutical industry, plans to increase its presence in the US through the acquisition of Tenax Holding Corp, a privately-owned moulder of plastic medical components, for Dollars 58m (Pounds 33.1m). The takeover will be funded via a 3-for-8 rights issue, the second in less than a year, at 410p to raise Pounds 25.5m. The rest of the cost will be met through bank borrowings, taking Bespak's borrowings as a proportion of shareholders funds to about 20 per cent. The shares closed up 3p at 504p. In the announcement the group also forecast that pre-tax profits for the year to end-May would be not less than Pounds 6m, against Pounds 4.42m last time. The directors intended to recommend a final dividend of 5.5p to lift the year's total from 8p to 9p. Mr Alun Hicks, finance director, said the takeover allowed Bespak to expand its range of products and customers and give it a greater presence in the US. 'All the pharmaceutical companies are addressing international markets, and we too need an international perspective,' he said. There might be some cost savings from overlap between Bespak and Tenax's North Carolina manufacturing plants. Products of Tenax are mainly used in minimal invasive, or 'keyhole', surgery. The company relied on US Surgical, a leader in the field, for more than half its sales in 1991. Tenax also makes components for devices to treat respiratory problems such as asthma. This fits with Bespak, which is best known for its aerosol valves sold with Glaxo's asthma medications like Ventolin. In the half year ended December 31 1991 Tenax recorded profits before tax and interest of Dollars 3.5m, compared with Dollars 4.1m previously. The fall was caused by start up costs on new facilities and slower sales of an anti-nerve gas injector, which had sold well to the US military during the Gulf war. Profits this year are expected to be flat, according to Mr Hicks.</p>

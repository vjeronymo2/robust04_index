			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Gardner report: "MEPs Fail To Block Vote on </F> Enlargement"]    [Text] Strasbourg -- The European Union [EU] took a  further step yesterday towards expanding its membership from 12  to 16 member states, when a series of filibusters to frustrate  tomorrow's mandatory ratification vote in the European  Parliament was defeated.    Both the plenary of the Strasbourg assembly and its Foreign  Affairs Committee beat back attempts to get the biggest ever  increase in the Euro-club postponed.    The Parliament's struggle to win more power from the member  states and the European Commission has held EU enlargement  hostage for the past two months. Two weeks ago, leaders of the  dominant Socialist and Christian Democrat blocs in Strasbourg  agreed to put through the accession treaty, in exchange for  pledges that Parliament would be closely associated with the  1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty and power-sharing in the EU.    But party managers in Strasbourg are still nervous about  whether enough Euro-MPs will turn up to ratify the enlargement,  intended to bring Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway into the  Union next January. Failure by the Parliament to ratify could  easily sabotage the four applicant countries' difficult  referendums on membership this autumn, and very possibly  complicate ratification by national parliaments of the Twelve.    A first attempt yesterday by the far-right to get  enlargement  taken off this week's agenda was easily defeated by 287 votes to  eight, with four abstentions.    The unsurprising size of this quashing of the Euro-fascists  is less relevant than the size of Euro-MPs' presence in  Strasbourg, given that a third of MEPs [Member of the European  Parliament] rarely turn up at all, that next month's elections  are set to eject up to two-thirds of present members, and that  many of those hoping to survive are on the campaign trail.    In tomorrow's vote, 260 of the 518 MEPs must approve  enlargement. The Socialists, the largest bloc, reckon they can  guarantee 130-140 votes, but there are worries about the  Christian Democrats' pledge of 100 votes, while the small groups  are less disciplined.    The two big blocs both sent their leaderships to lobby  yesterday's Foreign Affairs Committee, and to stall the infinite  variety of possible procedural snags.    Even Mr Jean Louis Bourlanges, the French Christian Democrat  who has led the campaign to hold up enlargement dismissed  yesterday's skirmishes as "procedural trickery," arguing for a  straightforward battle on Wednesday.</p>

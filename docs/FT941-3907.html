			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Flotation may value Ashanti at Pounds 1.5bn Preparations for the biggest gold mining company flotation for many years - that of Ashanti Gold Fields of Ghana - are to be stepped up this week in London. Brokers James Capel and Ashanti's merchant bank Morgan Grenfell are expected to give an indication in the pathfinder prospectus of the range within which the shares will be priced, because the Ghana Exchange, where 5 per cent of Ashanti will be sold, insists this is provided. The brokers are likely to ask for a slight premium over most South African gold mining companies, suggesting that Ashanti will be valued at as much as Pounds 1.5bn. The Ghanaian government, the majority shareholder, is to sell 25 per cent of Ashanti. Lonrho, the UK-based trading group, has indicated it will not sell any of its 49 stake. There have been some indications that Ashanti might use the opportunity to raise new capital. The group is coming to the end of a substantial investment programme, so that in 1996 it will join the handful of gold companies producing more than one million troy ounces a year.</p>

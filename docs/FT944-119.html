			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong punishes Peregrine Brokerage Peregrine Brokerage, a fully owned subsidiary of Peregrine Investments Holdings, was censured and fined HKDollars 300,000 (USDollars 38,800) by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for breaching exchange regulations, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The exchange said Peregrine Brokerage 'knowingly assisted substantial shareholders of a number of listed companies to create a misleading appearance of active trading'. This included sales or purchases of shares on behalf of substantial shareholders that involved no actual change of beneficial ownership of the shares. 'The substance of the above breaches related to the Member (Peregrine Brokerage) having provided dealing facilities to clients during the period from October 1991 to May 1992, which certain of the senior executives of the Member knew were to effect share support at initial subscription and/or in the after float market in the listed shares,' the exchange said. The Exchange noted Peregrine Brokerage 'had since the relevant period made significant changes in the management of the firm, including the appointment of a Compliance Director at Board Level and that the Member has implemented a new system of internal controls and procedures'.</p>

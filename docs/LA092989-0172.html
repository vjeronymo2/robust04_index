			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> REPAIRS UNDER WAY AS JET BLAST DISABLES AIRPORT'S LANDING SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration said today it will look into who was  responsible for the jet engine blast that knocked out John Wayne Airport's  instrument landing system, without which the airport will have to be closed  during fog or rain.  </P> <P> An engine blast from an America West Boeing 757 blew apart the small, red and  white shed at the end of the runway that contains the instrument landing system  at about 8:40 a.m. Thursday, delaying 30 to 40 departing or arriving aircraft  of various types for two hours.  </P> <P> Airport officials said the pilot failed to follow proper procedures by revving  the engine too soon, before he had taxied the aircraft to the "blue line," a  mark on the runway. However, airport officials acknowledged that the pilot had  permission from an unidentified air traffic controller.  </P> <P> "I presume that there will be an investigation, but what we're working at right  now is to return the airport to the normal status," said the FAA's Joe Fowler,  manager at the John Wayne control tower.  </P> <P> Fowler said he has no idea yet how much it will cost or how long it will take  to replace the damaged equipment. America West officials declined comment.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Yeltsin faces showdown over coup plotters: Aides suggest Russian president will ignore parliament's order to pardon rebels President Boris Yeltsin was moving towards a possible showdown with the new Russian parliament after it voted yesterday to pardon the organisers of last October's armed rebellion and the leaders of the 1991 coup. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, described parliament's decision as 'ruinous politicking'. It had 'failed to draw lessons from the bitter experience' of last October when parliament was blasted by Mr Yeltsin's tanks. Reformers in parliament said the move was a step towards civil strife and threatened the destabilisation of Russia. Presidential aides suggested parliament's order would be ignored. The vote came on the eve of a state of the nation speech Mr Yeltsin is due to make to parliament today. If he goes ahead with the speech, it will end weeks of presidential silence after last December's election triumph of communists and ultra-nationalists and the announcement by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, of 'corrections' to Mr Yeltsin's bold market reforms. One presidential aide urged Mr Yeltsin not to make the speech. But officials said two of the president's advisers were last night working on last minute changes to the draft in reaction to parliament's moves. The resolution, which was adopted in parliament by 253 votes to 67, ordered the immediate release from prison of Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president who launched last October's armed uprising, and dozens of others, including those who launched the 1991 coup attempt against then President Mikhail Gorbachev. Drafted by Mr Victor Illyukhin, a Communist who once tried to sue Mr Gorbachev for allegedly causing the break-up of the Soviet Union, the resolution was described by supporters as a step towards national reconciliation. It confronts Mr Yeltsin with a dramatic choice. Either he defies an order he has no constitutional right to veto, because it is a resolution and not a law, or he can try to compromise with parliament, risking the possibility of being forced to resign or to call early elections. Mr Sergei Yushenkov, an organiser of Russia's Choice, the anti-Communist alliance of loyal presidential supporters whom Mr Yeltsin failed to support in the December parliamentary elections, said the resolution was 'a declaration of civil war'. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the parliamentary leader of Russia's Choice, said Mr Yeltsin 'has no right to veto this extremely dangerous decision' and said he was 'absolutely convinced that this is a step towards destabilisation in Russia'. Scenting blood, Mr Gennady Ziuganov, the Communist leader who says he wants to turn his party into a social democratic organisation, advised Mr Yeltsin to resign. The resolution provides an amnesty for all the participants, whether convicted or not, of the October 1993 uprising and the August 1991 coup, as well as bloody attacks on police by Communists and nationalists last May Day.

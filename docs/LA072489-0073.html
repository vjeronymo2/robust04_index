			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENERAL FOODS, KRAFT, PEPISCO SHUFFLE FOUR TOP EXECUTIVES  </P> <P> In a food-and-beverage-industry version of the domino theory, a high-level  executive change at Philip Morris Cos.' General Foods division has led to  similar changes at Kraft General Foods, as well as Pepsico Inc. and its  Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. subsidiary.  </P> <P> Miles L. Marsh, who served as president of General Foods USA, will move to  Whitman Corp. Sept. 1 as president and chief operating officer, according to  the company. He will oversee all of Chicago-based Whitman's subsidiaries,  including food maker Pet Inc., Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Hussmann Corp. and  Midas International.  </P> <P> Marsh will be succeeded at General Foods USA by Richard P. Mayer, former  chairman and chief executive of Pepsico's Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. At the  same time, James M. Kilts has been named president of Kraft General Foods'  Kraft USA unit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Former Consultant  </P> <P> Mayer will be replaced at Kentucky Fried Chicken by John M. Cranor III, a top  Pepsico executive. Cranor, formerly president of Pespi-Cola East, has been  appointed president and chief executive of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is the  world's second-largest quick service restaurant system, with about 8,000  restaurants generating sales of nearly $6 billion. It was acquired by PepsiCo  in October, 1986.  </P> <P> Marsh previously served as a consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co. and later spent  eight years with Dart &amp; Kraft in the United States and London. He was named  president of Kraft International in 1985 and later was appointed president of  the Operations and Technology Group of Kraft, based in suburban Glenview.  </P> <P> It is hoped that his presence at Whitman will strengthen the company's focus on  consumer goods and services, the company said.  </P></p>

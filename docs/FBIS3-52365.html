			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad--Iraqi Culture and Information Minister  Hamid Yusuf Hammadi has praised the brotherly ties between the  Jordanian and Iraqi peoples. He said the Iraqi people will  always recall with fondness and appreciation the Jordanian  people's support during their calamities, both in the Iraq-Iran  war against the racist hostile current and in the Mother of  Battles when forces of evil and aggression massed and more than  30 barbaric, treacherous states assembled to strike at Iraq.    In an interview with the AKHBAR AL-USBU' editor in chief,  Hammadi said the reopening of Umm Qasr port in the Gulf will not  affect the transportation of Iraqi imports and continued  commercial activity via al-Aqabah Port. He said Umm Qasr port  was operational during the Iran-Iraq war but this did not affect  the flow of goods to Iraq via al-'Aqabah port in Jordan.    The Iraqi information minister said: The reopening of Umm  Qasr port confirms Iraq's right to make the appropriate  decisions and repair everything destroyed by war. It also  confirms Iraq's determination to break the chains of the  blockade imposed against it. The decision to allow imports via  Iraqi ports will also encourage major shipping companies to ship  directly to Iraq to unload the goods that are allowed to be  imported.    Hammadi underlined Iraq's strong desire to continue to  receive its imports via al-'Aqabah port, particularly the  imports shipped by big vessels with a load capacity of over  30,000 tonnes. He said even after repairing and expanding the  port, and overcoming the silt problem, Umm Qasr port can only  receive vessels with a load capacity between 20,000 and 30,000  tonnes, particularly those arriving from Pakistan and India.  The distance from these countries to Umm Qasr port, he said, is  shorter than that to al-'Aqabah.    The information minister said certain shipping companies are  worried about sending their vessels to Umm Qasr because they  think the area between al-Bakr harbor and Umm Qasr port is  dotted with mines and because of higher insurance costs.    Hammadi also talked about the Iraqi Government's positive  attitude toward former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and  other European figures who visited Iraq recently to secure the  release of prisoners. He said: These people who wagered on  the collapse of Iraq and who thought that its capitulation was  only a matter of time have come back to show repentance and  admit that the regime is strong and so is Iraq.    He added: We cannot turn back those people, who, we think,  have begun to understand the suffering of and injustice  inflicted on Iraq and the effect the blockade is having on its  people. We responded favorably to them on humanitarian grounds  and we hope they will make their voices heard to their  governments and to the officials and people in their countries  in the hope that awareness may move to end the injustice and  repression against Iraq.    The Iraqi information minister praised the good relations  between the Iraqi and Turkish peoples. He said: We sensed from  the brothers in Turkey -- including party, professional, and  trade union leaders and parliamentarians -- only sincere  feelings toward us. We have trade links with Turkey. We expect  an increase in trade links between the two countries through the  thousands of trucks that enter Iraq with foodstuffs. They  barter these goods for gasoline and kerosene, which they take to  sell in Turkey. We hope these convoys will continue to supply  particularly foodstuffs and medicine, to help lessen the burden  on the Iraqi people that is caused by the blockade,    Hammadi adds: Some 50,000 people live in the Diyarbakir  area. Cafes, restaurants, hotels, and resorts can be built on a  120-km stretch of road to serve drivers and truck convoys. It  is expected that between 17,000 and 20,000 trucks loaded with  goods, particularly rice and legumes, will enter Iraq daily.  Trade links with the Diyarbakir area date back more than 50  years and Iraq used to import legumes, particularly good quality  peas, from that area.    Asked about his expectations on the resumption of Iraqi oil  exports via Turkey, Hammadi said: Al-Bakr harbor, which extends  25 km into the sea, is ready to receive tankers and export oil.  The harbor was repaired and made ready for work two years ago.  As for exports via Turkey, Turkey alone can answer this  question and determine the date.    Asked about lifting the unjust blockade and Iraq's  compliance  with the UN resolutions, and whether there were still any  requests which Iraq has to fulfill, the information minister  said Iraq has implemented all UN Security Council resolutions.  He said it is time now to lift the blockade imposed on Iraq  and we expect matters to become clear in February.    Asked about recent U.S. moves to secure a UN Security  Council  resolution calling on Iraq to recognize Kuwait and stop action  against the opposition, Hammadi said: We understood from UN  envoy Ekeus that there are no appendices or new conditions to  the UN Security Council resolutions, which introduced and  maintained the sanctions against Iraq. We will have to wait and  see what they say in the next meeting which, as I have said,  will be held in February. The blockade will, God wiling, erode;  this is only a matter of time.    At the conclusion of the interview, Hammadi said he is proud  of the position of Jordan--king, government, and people. He  asked us to convey his greetings to the Jordanians, whose blood  was mixed with the blood of the Iraqis.</p>

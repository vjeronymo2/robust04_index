			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / French give ground over access to Orly The French government, which is under strong pressure from European governments and airlines to allow access to Orly airport in southern Paris, said yesterday it would bring forward the date on which it would allow landing rights. The transport ministry said that carriers from European Union member states would be allowed to launch services from January next year. The French government had previously said that the services could not start before the spring. The European Commission has ordered France to open up Orly, which is the main hub for domestic French flights and closer to central Paris than Charles de Gaulle, the other main airport in the French capital. But in spite of this ruling and strong pressure from European carriers, including British Airways and KLM of the Netherlands, the French government has resisted the opening of Orly. It has argued that it needs time to prepare for competition and to take measures to prevent disturbance to inhabitants of the Orly area. Yesterday's announcement coincided with the latest test of strength between the French government and a foreign carrier seeking access to Orly. After a protracted wrangle, Mr Niki Lauda, the former Formula 1 motor racing champion and founder and chairman of Lauda Air, the Austrian airline, yesterday landed his inaugural flight at Charles de Gaulle airport. He then pressed for rapid access to Orly. Mr Lauda had threatened as late as Monday evening to fly to the airport in southern Paris, in spite of the refusal by the French authorities to grant his airline landing permission. He said yesterday that he had been given permission to fly to Orly from the beginning of next year. Lauda Air said it had been awarded landing slots for Orly in the summer. Six weeks ago, however, the company claimed it had been told by the French government that it could not start services as planned. Instead, the airline said it was offered landing slots at Charles de Gaulle, but the timings were inconvenient. In June, France was forced to allow British carriers to fly to Orly from London after a confrontation with the British government and the Commission and a threat by the airlines that they would take off for Paris without landing authoris-ation. The start of services by European carriers to and from Orly airport is set to coincide with the launch of flights between Orly and Marseilles and Orly and Toulouse, which are the most profitable routes in the French domestic market. A ruling last month by the European Court of Justice upheld a decision by the European Commission that competition should be introduced on the two routes.</p>

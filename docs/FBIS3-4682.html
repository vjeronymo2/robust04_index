			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Both Japan and the United States have been  discussing the resumption of vice ministerial negotiations on  the automobile and auto parts sector to be held under the  Japan-U.S. framework talks. A senior official in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, however, made clear on 28  February that it has become difficult to hold the vice  ministerial negotiations.    Japan has asked the United States to hold the vice  ministerial negotiations when U.S. Commerce Undersecretary  Jeffrey Garten visits Japan on his tour of Asia, but it has  replied to Japan that "he would have no time to hold the  negotiations."</p>

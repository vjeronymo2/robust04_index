			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement" of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine on </F> the situation in the Republic of Crimea]    [Text] As has become known, Crimean Republic's President  Meshkov is planning to hold a conference of leaders of the  autonomy on 20 May 1994, whose agenda includes: the introduction  of separate Crimean citizenship and dual citizenship; the  organization of Crimea's Armed Forces; the removal of Ukraine's  Armed Forces from the peninsula; and joining CIS by the Crimea  as an independent state.    Russia's high statesmen and politicians are taking a lively  part in anti-Ukrainian activities. Special landing units of  Russia's Armed Forces are being transferred to the Crimea.  Crimea's population, as well as all the Ukrainian people are on  the eve of a tragedy.    This threat ensued as a consequence of the capitulative,  indecisive, and incompetent policies of Ukrainian President  Kravchuk who demonstrated his inability to carry out his oath --  which he swore on the Holy Scripture when assuming his high post  -- to protect state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of  Ukraine. The irresponsibility of Ukraine's highest statesman in  this fateful moment is striking -- instead of safeguarding  national interests, peace, and stability in the Crimea, Mr.  Kravchuk pays a visit to Donbass in his search for support for  canceling presidential and local legislative elections.    Today, history gives Mr. Kravchuk the last chance to restore  people's trust in him: He must defend the law in the Crimea,  prevent Ukraine's citizens from terrible consequences of  political adventurism of Crimean Zhirinovskiy's, and stop the  escalation of the anti-Ukrainian campaign which will inevitably  lead to bloodshed, violence, and a breakdown of the state.    [Signed] The Central Council of the Christian Democratic  Party of Ukraine</p>

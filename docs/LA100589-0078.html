			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMERGENCY ROOM FILLS 2-YEAR GAP;  </P> <P> FIRST ONE SINCE '87 OPENS IN CENTURY CITY; WILL SERVE 100,000  </P> <P> Bucking the trend, Century City Hospital has opened an emergency room, not  closed one -- the first to open in Los Angeles County in two years.  </P> <P> The new emergency room brings to 93 the number in the county licensed by the  state to receive paramedic and ambulance traffic -- one fewer than the region  had at the beginning of 1989.  </P> <P> Officially opened Monday at a ceremony that included quiche and comedians, the  facility offers 24-hour emergency services to an estimated 100,000 people in  the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Dream Emergency Room'  </P> <P> Until now, the closest emergency rooms were at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in  West Los Angeles, UCLA Medical Center in Westwood and Beverly Hills Medical  Center. Even people who regularly visit the 195-bed hospital for other reasons  had to seek emergency care elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We have everything you would want if you were able to build a dream emergency  room," said James Pagano, medical director for emergency services at Century  City Hospital.  </P> <P> The staff was involved in planning the facility, Pagano said, and recommended  such features as placing the nurses' station where the nurses could watch both  the door used by incoming paramedics and patients and the monitoring equipment  at the beds reserved for the critically ill. The emergency room will be staffed  by nine full-time physicians, he said.  </P> <P> The 4,400-square-foot facility cost $1.5 million, hospital Executive Director  Joel Bergenfeld said. Century City is a private, for-profit hospital, owned by  National Medical Enterprises of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As Pagano pointed out, the new emergency room is not a trauma center; it lacks  the in-house surgeon and anesthesiologist that are among the requirements for  licensing as a trauma center. Nor is the opening of an emergency room in a  private hospital in affluent Century City expected to be more than a Band-Aid  on the county's faltering emergency care system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers Have Dwindled  </P> <P> Barbara Pavey, an official with the county's emergency medical services agency,  said the number of emergency rooms in the county has slipped to 93 from 100  since 1987. Only 13 of the 23 trauma centers linked in 1983 remain in  operation. Pavey said she doubted that the Century City facility will be "a  high-impact ER" as would a new facility in Inglewood or another under-serviced  area of the city.  </P> <P> But Century City Hospital officials and observers agree that the facility will  at least provide paramedics with an additional option on those increasingly  common occasions when busy emergency rooms are "on diversion," or temporarily  closed to them.  </P> <P> At such times, paramedics often have to drive far longer than the requisite 10  minutes from the pickup point, making several stops before they find an  emergency room that will accept an ill or injured individual.  </P> <P> "It just gives one more place for paramedics to go if the midtown hospitals are  on diversion," said Kathleen Belkham of the Hospital Council of Southern  California.  </P> <P> Bergenfeld said the new emergency room will probably receive three or four  ambulance transports a day.  </P> <P> Century City Hospital staff carefully studied the demographics of health care  in the area before opening the facility, he said.  </P> <P> Most emergency-room closings are attributed to economics: The facilities, which  are required as a condition of their licensing to treat anyone who walks  through the door, say they cannot afford to care for growing numbers of  uninsured, indigent patients.  </P> <P> But Century City Hospital believes that it can make a go of it, in part,  because it expects the majority of its clients to be insured or able to pay.  Bergenfeld pointed out that a good emergency-room experience can turn a  single-occasion patient into a regular client of a particular hospital. "If we  didn't think this would be a profitable operation, we wouldn't have proceeded,"  he said.  </P> <P> The emergency room is still a gamble, Bergenfeld said. More emergency room and  trauma closing centers in Los Angeles could alter the new facility's patient  population and its economic viability. "There are a lot of factors that are  completely and totally out of our control," he said.  </P> <P> But hospital staff are confident enough about the facility's chances for  profitability to laugh about it. At Monday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, which  included the inevitable speech-making and mini-quiches on the brunch buffet,  the Groundlings improvised Westside hospital comedy.  </P> <P> "Isn't this a bank?" asked a comic playing a confused patient. "No, it isn't a  bank per se," the comedy doctor answered.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> GOOD AS GOLD: Claiming a county organization larger than those in some states,  Orange County's Republican Party is a potential gold mine for U.S. Sen. Pete  Wilson -- if he can overcome some conservatives' hesitancy toward him (A3). . .  . County party officials say Wilson's gubernatorial campaign should be able to  raise more than the several hundred thousand dollars President Bush generated  in Orange County in 1988. . . . Orange County's generosity for Republican  candidates is so abundant that GOP candidates from other states hold  fund-raisers here. Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today's meeting of the Russian Government presidium  was accompanied by an unpleasant surprise for journalists. They  were told that the press, with one exception, will no longer be  admitted to these meetings. Here is what our observer, Valeriy  Kiosa, says:    [Begin recording] [Kiosa] The decision by the Russian  Government's chief of staff to bar the press -- except for the  government's own ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- from these meetings also  took the government's own press service by surprise. It had  taken all the usual steps to ensure that journalists accredited  with the government could get on with their normal work today.    So, how did the participants in the meeting react to this  decision? Here is what economist Pavel Bunich thinks.    [Bunich] I don't think this is the right way of going about  things. There are some individual issues which the press is not  allowed to cover, and that is understandable.    [Kiosa] But those are classified subjects. Today's issue was  agriculture.    [Bunich] No doubt there is some scandal here which they  don't  want to come out. The present situation in agriculture is the  biggest scandal of all. We have come up against a brick wall.  How can you bar the press from government meetings?    [Kiosa] Here is what Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime  minister's analysis and planning group, says.    [Illarionov] I think this is absolutely intolerable. It  undoubtedly closes off the most direct and clear channel of  information by which the public and the mass media can learn  about what the government is deciding and doing. Unquestionably  this can only worsen relations between the government and the  mass media.    [Kiosa] Naturally we were all interested to hear the views  of  Vladimir Kvasov, the Russian Government's chief of staff. Here  is what he said.    [Kvasov] Work is done at government meetings. Therefore, the  only elements of the media who will be allowed to attend these  meetings are those which are accredited with us, so to speak. I  am referring to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the government newspaper.  All their correspondents will be admitted. Other  representatives of the media will be admitted to the opening of  these meetings so that they can take photographs. After the  meetings are over, news conferences on the results will be held,  if so wished. In other words, there will be plenty of objective  information for the press and for the radio.    [Kiosa] You mentioned ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Will agencies  like, for example, TASS -- which is also regarded as an official  government agency -- be barred from the meetings?    [Kvasov] It all depends on what subjects are being  discussed.  Various different subjects are discussed at these meetings. If  it's a question which interests a narrow circle of specialists,  media access will of course be restricted. However, full  information will be provided.    [Kiosa] The last point I would like to make is this: I am  not of course disputing the government's right to decide for  itself who will attend or not attend these meetings. However, I  would emphasize that the moment which was chosen for this  decision was not altogether auspicious, to put it mildly. As  you know, many government actions are being sharply criticized  at the moment. It was at this precise moment, when you might  expect the government to have an interest in the fullest and  most objective reporting of what it is really doing, that the  government's chief of staff suddenly decided to bar journalists  from the meetings -- for good, or so it seems from his words.  This is the first time such a thing has happened for two years,  I stress. [end recording]</p>

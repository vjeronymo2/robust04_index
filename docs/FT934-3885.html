			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Japanese stocks fall 3.5% after stimulus plan is shelved The Tokyo stock market fell 3.5 per cent yesterday - its second-biggest slide this year - after the Japanese government shelved plans for economic support measures it had hoped to announce this week. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, tried to reassure investors by saying the government would simultaneously work out the stimulus package and the budget for the 1994 fiscal year. That would follow the passage, still under way, of a supplementary budget to finance previous economic measures launched in September. The country's seven-party ruling coalition is struggling to enact political reform by a year-end deadline as well as pull the economy away from recession. However, it is becoming increasingly stricken by internal disagreements, has been tripped up in parliament, and bureaucrats from the powerful finance ministry are at odds with leaders of the Social Democratic party, the largest of the partners, over proposed changes to the tax system. A number of cabinet members have pledged a further general economic stimulus including an income tax cut and an easing of land transaction taxes. However, the coalition is divided on the extent to which these should be offset by a rise in indirect taxes, as the finance ministry wishes. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, additionally depressed by poor bank earnings and the arrest of a property company executive, fell 618.97 points to close at 16,840.38, some 20.4 per cent below its September peak for the year. The decline was its first in five trading days, after shares rallied last week on hopes of an economic stimulus. In early trading today, stocks gained strength with the Nikkei up more than 200 points. The Tokyo market has been fluctuating wildly on fears over a financial system burdened by bad debts and government attempts to reassure investors with promises of additional measures to secure a so far elusive economic recovery. Some analysts fear the Nikkei might fall to 12,000 because of the lack of a clear commitment to help ailing banks.

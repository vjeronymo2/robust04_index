			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Observer: Bonus time When it comes to new ideas on performance-related pay, it's hard to beat the Americans. Take yesterday's Sunday Mirror exclusive about a Californian high school football team which suddenly started to fire on all cylinders after the coach introduced a new bonus scheme. Although details of the bonus scheme have still to come out in court, it is alleged that the coach's wife gave the team an incentive by rewarding them on a sliding scale. A good pass deserved a kiss and a cuddle, tackling the opposition quarterback got heavy petting, and so on. The team's assistant coach says the team got carried away because of his boss's obsession with victory. By contrast, GKN executive chairman Sir David Lees' bonus scheme, revealed in the latest accounts, seems rather tame. Sir David has waived his performance related bonus of Pounds 42,750 and agreed that it will only become payable when GKN's earnings exceed the Pounds 100m mark - provided this occurs prior to 1997. Given that GKN earned Pounds 48.4m last year, it sounds a rather demanding target, until its remembered that GKN earned Pounds 120m in 1989.</p>

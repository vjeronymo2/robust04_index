			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT;  </P> <P> STAY HEALTHY ON PLANES  </P> <P> While waiting for your plane to take off, suppose you notice that red blotches  stand out on the face of the person sitting next to you or some other visible  sign of a condition that you think might be contagious? Or the passenger looks  ill or disoriented?  </P> <P> What can you or the flight attendants do?  </P> <P> Recently, a passenger sitting next to a child on a flight about to leave  Frankfurt, West Germany, for the United States complained to a flight attendant  that the boy had rashes on his arms.  </P> <P> The attendant asked the boy's parents, who said the rashes came from mosquito  bites. Subsequently, the attendant determined that the parents didn't have a  doctor's note indicating the child could fly with his "condition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pilot Makes Decision  </P> <P> Rather than risk the plane and all of its passengers being possibly quarantined  in New York City, the attendant consulted with the captain and gate agent, and  the decision was made to ask the parents and child to get off the plane and  obtain a doctor's note. After seeing a doctor at the Frankfurt airport, the  family was able to catch a later flight.  </P> <P> "Each situation involving the condition of a passenger can be different," an  airline spokeswoman said. "The captain and gate agent are informed. The  passenger is questioned, with a determination then made on whether the  passenger is fit to fly and whether there is any danger to other passengers and  flight personnel. In most situations, no action is required."  </P> <P> If a medical question about a passenger arises after takeoff, the captain can  radio ahead to the next airport if the matter is considered serious enough.  Health authorities would then take a look at the passenger in question (and  possibly other passengers as well) before the plane is cleared.  </P> <P> "Cabin personnel have to apply a test of reasonableness in such situations,"  said a spokesman for the Air Traffic Assn., a trade association for airlines.  "The flight report is an internal document and covers anything that happened  during the flight, even a coffee maker that doesn't work."  </P> <P> The general policy is that before the door to the plane closes, "it's the gate  agent's judgment," the spokesman said. After the door closes, it's the  captain's responsibility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advice From Doctor  </P> <P> Though time is an obvious factor, the gate agent and captain can seek medical  advice from the airline's medical staff or advisers, either by phone or in  person. Similarly, flight personnel may find a doctor on board who could give  an opinion.  </P> <P> If you are the person in question, getting a doctor's note is your  responsibility. Whether you receive any amenities, such as meals and hotel  accommodations, is up to the airline.  </P> <P> In the future, airline personnel may have to exercise even more caution in how  to handle such situations, especially where deplaning and refusing service are  involved, according to Matt Finucane, safety director of the Assn. of Flight  Attendants.  </P> <P> "Passengers who are suspected of a serious communicable disease may have  certain protection under new rules regarding handicapped passengers being  proposed by the Department of Transportation," Finucane said.  </P> <P> "Such passengers would be considered to be handicapped and protected against  discrimination by carriers. If an airline deplaned a passenger who didn't have  a communicable disease that could be transmitted during the flight, they might  have a legal case on their hands."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bring Note Along  </P> <P> If you have a condition that could arouse some attention, it might be prudent  to carry a doctor's note. You can be refused service at check-in, and airline  personnel have the discretion to ask for a doctor's note if your appearance  creates doubt.  </P> <P> Once you board the flight, it can be similarly useful to alert flight  attendants immediately of any special circumstances or conditions.  </P> <P> Several years ago I flew from New York City to Bombay, India, with a  non-contagious but highly visible shaving/skin irritation that required  frequent applications of an ointment prescribed by my dermatologist.  </P> <P> The medication was both greasy and quite noticeable, so I casually explained  the situation to the passenger sitting next to me, who initially didn't look  overjoyed at my presence. There were other seats available, but he chose to  stay put.  </P> <P> If I were taking that flight today I would make sure I had a doctor's note  explaining my condition/medication, to avoid any problems at check-in or during  the flight.  </P> <P> If a situation arises during flight, you can ask for another seat. But such  relocation depends, obviously, on the availability of other seats and the  degree of inconvenience or danger.  </P></p>

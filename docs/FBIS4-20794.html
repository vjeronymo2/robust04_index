			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23. With the petroleum companies  having achieved a significant improvement in performance,  central public enterprises recorded a 44 per cent increase in  net profits during 1992-93. The scenario would have been far  brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public  enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. 4,000 [rupees] crore.    This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for  1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil  Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings,  with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rastriya Ispat Nigam  is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568  crores.    The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to  reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as  usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores  but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial  increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore.    The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall  performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that  the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104  companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores.    In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which  are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits  of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous  year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of  very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of  sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a  competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are  mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises  as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the  manufacturing and service sectors.    The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment,  in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen  only marginally from 2 per cent in 1991-92 to 2.43 per cent in  1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital  employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 per cent to  18.02 per cent.    According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the  background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public  enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In  order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to  take into account the obligations of public enterprises which  transcend the concepts of production and profits. The  performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in  view the contributions made in discharging socio-economic  obligations, development of backward regions, provision of  public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at  administered prices.    The Survey which had taken the performance of 245  enterprises  into account, notes that the investment in these companies had  risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 per cent.  Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807  crores, a 9.5 per cent rise. Value added in production  enterprises also rose by 8.24 per cent, from Rs. 35,212 crores  to Rs. 38,114 crores.    Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey  are, the 13.67 per cent rise in gross internal resources. These  have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723  crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have  also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during  the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate  tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend  increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the  previous year.    The company with the highest investment during the year is  the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment  of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs.  10,508 crores.    In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises  during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 per cent  increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores.    The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital  employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of  any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 per cent in 1992-93,  compared to 104.78 per cent the previous year. Group-wise  analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement  in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services,  contracts and construction textiles and consumer goods. Another  13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium and light  engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing.    Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various  industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses  had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the  fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564  crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs.  313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector  had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had  registered some increase in profits are coal, financial  services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows  a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for  the services sector.    On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98  enterprises entered into such agreement with their  administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were  rated as `excellent,' and 35 `very good.'    The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest  Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during  the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public  participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of  Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting  around five per cent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In  the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight per cent  of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs.  3,038 crore.    Another significant development during the year was the  identification of 44 central public enterprises as being sick  following the amendment to the Sick Industrial Companies  (Special Provisions) Act 1985. Of these, 40 have been registered.</p>

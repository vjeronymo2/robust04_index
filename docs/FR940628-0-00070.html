			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.8&blank;Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal to replace the word ``he'' with ``the Secretary'' to remove any implication of gender is not adopted in this rulemaking. Instead, this proposal will be handled in an omnibus rulemaking to make minor clarifications and error corrections covering all the pipeline safety regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.50&blank;Reporting accidents and &sect;195.52 Telephonic notice of certain accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 195.50(f) and 195.52(a)(3) require operators to prepare reports and give telephonic notice of accidents, respectively, when the estimated property damage due to an accident exceeds $5,000. RSPA discovered from its regulatory review and previous enforcement cases that a significant amount of confusion exists among pipeline operators as to which cost estimates must be included in calculating the ``estimated property damage to the property of the operator or others *&blank;*&blank;*'' Frequently, when reporting accidents, pipeline operators fail to include as ``property damage'' the fair market value of the product released or those costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts. RSPA believes these costs should be included when reporting accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the $5,000 reporting requirement requires the reporting of minor accidents, RSPA proposed amending &sect;&sect;195.50(f) and 195.52(a)(3) to increase the reporting threshold to $50,000, the same level as required in 49 CFR part 192 and to include as property damage the value of the product released and the costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts. The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5 members did not vote). Two of those favoring the proposed changes recommended that RSPA modify the final rule to limit property damage to fair market value of the lost product and initial clean-up and product recovery costs. One member said that clean-up and recovery costs should not be included in total property damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters disagreed with the proposed changes and recommended that the rule be withdrawn. One complaint was that the statistical base would be discontinuous because, in the future, RSPA would not receive information on accidents costing between $5,000 and $50,000. Another complaint was that the change could affect the development of environmental protection requirements. RSPA understands that a change in reporting levels will cause a slight skewing due to truncation of the data, but believes requiring operators to report accidents based solely on the $5,000 property damage criterion is unnecessary and burdensome. Significant accidents will still be reported because the other criteria (especially those that are environmentally related) requiring reports will be unchanged: (1) Explosion or fire, (2) loss of 50 barrels of liquid, (3) escape of five barrels a day of highly volatile liquids, (4) a death, (5) bodily harm, or (6) resulted in the pollution of any stream. Because these requirements remain unchanged, those operators with more frequent small releases will still be identified. As to a skewing of the data, those organizations that keep track of such statistical data should be able to make adjustments to account for such changes. Also, as explained in the NPRM, this change will make the liquid safety reporting requirements consistent with the gas safety reporting requirements which will eliminate confusion. The rule change should have little, if any, effect on the environment because the same spill volume reporting criteria remain in effect. Only the dollar level of the reporting criterion is being changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters supported the rule changes as they were written. Five others favored the changes, but proposed modification of the rules to explain more fully the meaning of ``estimated total damage'' in order to spell out the items that must be covered. They said that ``estimated total damage'' is ambiguous and confusing and subject to interpretation. One commenter stated that the costs of subsurface restoration should be excluded from property damage because it is nearly impossible to estimate the subsurface restoration costs within the time allowed to report the accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees that early estimates of the costs to clean-up a liquid spill may not be exact; however, the operator should, at a later date, submit a revised report that provides more reliable cost figures for the clean-up. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA is clarifying the issue by amending &sect;195.50(f) to read: ``(f) Estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000'' and &sect;195.52(a)(3) to read: ``(3) Caused estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

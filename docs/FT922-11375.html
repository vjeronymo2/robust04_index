			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Fewer platitudes, more cash - Off the Wall ROBERT KEY, David Mellor's number two at the Ministry of National Heritage, performed badly - platitudes galore  - at his first appearance before the arts community on Thursday night at the National Art Collections Fund Awards ceremony. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, sponsors of the event, summed up the reaction by calling for more money for the arts - and fewer platitudes. He spoilt his case by announcing that, after six years, Slough was withdrawing its sponsorship. The Awards were the swansong for Sir Peter Wakefield, who is retiring as director of the NACF. He leaves an impressive record - a trebling of the membership to 35,000 and a rise from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 2m a year in NACF's contributions to save works of art for the nation. This years winners were Whitechapel Gallery for its community education programme; The Arts Newspaper; Art in Albany Prison; the Homerton Hospital Art Trust; and the Fan Museum at Greenwich. If David Mellor wants to get his new Ministry for the National Heritage off to a spanking start he should quickly find the Pounds 500,000 needed to beautify the new British Library nearing completion (phase one anyway) in the Euston Road. The crassest decision of his civil servants when he was at the Treasury was to cheesepare over the commissioning of art to set off the Pounds 450m building. Since this is the most expensive national monument of the century, mooted at one time as Margaret Thatcher's permanent memorial, there is a case for spending a full 1 per cent of the building costs on art. With Pounds 45m, you could have created something to put all the recent Parisian monuments in the shade. Instead a miserly sum was earmarked - and then withdrawn, even though artists like RB Kitaj and Eduardo Paolozzi had been commissioned to produce a huge tapestry and a large sculpture. The Library was told to raise the money for art from sponsorship, a time-consuming task in a recession, and hardly its first priority. Now Mellor can make good his lapse. He had better hurry. An imaginative scheme has emerged which should tempt a sponsor to find the Pounds 250,000 needed for the Paolozzi monument. The sculptor has agreed to give the sponsor a free second casting of his 12ft high sculpture, which is inspired by Newton. To make such an offer irresistible there are other benefits - the sponsor will be immortalised by having their name inscribed on the plinth; receive an invitation to next year's opening by the Queen; and doubtless qualify for a tax benefit. A final incentive is that a recent Paolozzi sculpture has just been insured for Pounds 1m. Such a commercial deal to dress up a national monument should be enough to embarrass the Government into action. The phone has hardly stopped ringing at Sotheby's since it wrote to members of Lloyds last week reminding them that, to ease their current financial woes, they might like to cash in their art collections. Some felt that the auction house was taking on the character of a vulture, feeding off the discomfiture of hard-pressed Names. In the event, the offer of a free valuation of their works of art, and the promise of a cash advance of a third of Sotheby's valuation if the owner felt obliged to sell at auction, struck a chord. There have been more than 50 calls, with the first valuation taking place today. Sotheby's has been surprised at the quality of the antiques, which include important Impressionist and modern British pictures. One problem is the weakness of the art market - many modern British pictures are worth less than what their owners paid for them during the 1980s boom years. But needs must, and the auction house thinks that demand is picking up, fuelled by post-Election euphoria. It will recommend that some Names sell at auction in the next few months to release the cash needed to meet the bills from Lloyds when they land on their mats around July. GLYNDEBOURNE opens next Saturday with a new production of Peter Grimes. And for once, this most traditional of English Festivals will be different. Not as different as next year, when there will be no Festival at all, nor as 1994, when the audience will gather on May 28 for The Marriage of Figaro in a new Pounds 33m auditorium, in a new Glyndebourne. But different enough. Since last August, Glyndebourne has been a building site. The development has stormed ahead. The shape of the new theatre is clearly visible. The old walled garden and the tennis court have been demolished too, but there has been a temporary reprieve for the auditorium, where this summer Glyndebourne is holding a shortened Festival, starting four weeks earlier to allow for total destruction in August. Apart from the work in progress, which does not impinge on the traditional pleasure grounds, and the possibility of nippy picnics at the early May performances, there is one more change this year. Glyndebourne was unable to find a company prepared to put up Pounds 100,000 to sponsor Peter Grimes. It is not too surprised, nor too perturbed. Since launching the appeal for funds to build the new theatre, chairman Sir George Christie has extracted money from big business with a charm and facility unmatched in the history of British artistic philanthropy. In two years, companies have pledged almost Pounds 25m - the bulk of the Pounds 28m so far raised. The total contributed by sponsorship to performing arts is only Pounds 57m a year, such is Glyndebourne's importance as a mecca for culture and hospitality. And this is just the start. By pledging money now, corporate members earn the privilege of paying yet more money in the future: for annual subscription and the purchase of guaranteed tickets. General director Anthony Whit worth-Jones admits that Glyndebourne got in just in time, weeks before the recession really began to bite. It has still not achieved its target from the corporate sector, but as the new building shows off its qualities, it hopes to should round up the backsliders. Although the facts of life force the Festival to embrace the corporate sector, they keep it firmly in its place. The new theatre adds 320 seats, making 1,150, but businessmen will be confined to 35 per cent, with the bulk, around 50 per cent, going to individual members, and the remainder to the general public. And there will be cheap standing places at every performance. Glyndebourne is not nearly as exclusive as its reputation suggests. There are still a few May tickets going for speedy callers.</p>

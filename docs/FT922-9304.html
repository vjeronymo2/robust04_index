Directors said that in the light of the announcement in February of a possible management buy-out, the results had been published at the earliest opportunity. The management team was still in discussions with potential financiers with a view to making an offer, the company said, but the committee of independent directors had yet to receive a definitive proposal. The Prontaprint division showed a marginal advance from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.2m, but profits from the business forms division slipped by Pounds 213,000 to Pounds 537,000. Bank debt grew to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 1.92m) and the group has access to a Pounds 2.5m term loan, of which Pounds 2.25m was drawn at the year-end, as well as additional working facilities. Earnings per share declined from 5.13p to 4.18p; the final dividend is cut to 1.6p (2.8p) making a total of 2.4p (4p).</p>

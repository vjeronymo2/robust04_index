			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Multi-tier rate puts Iran in reverse The decision by Iran's government late on Wednesday to re-introduce a multi-tier exchange rate is a backward step for President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafasanjani. Mr Mohammad Adeli, governor of Bank Markazi (the central bank) has said state banks will sell dollars at 50 rials below the open market rate for certain imports from tomorrow. He has not specified to which imports the new rate would apply. The official floating exchange rate set by Bank Markazi is about 1,750 rials to the dollar but the rial has weakened on the open market since the beginning of the year to 2,800 yesterday because of low oil prices and high demand for foreign exchange. Reintroduction of a new rate undermines the difficult decision the government made last year when it unified three different rates in favour of a single floating rate in line with International Monetary Fund recommendations. At a stroke, the rial was effectively devalued from 70 rials to the dollar to 1,540. At the time, Mr Adeli hoped that the currency would strengthen to IR1,000=Dollars 1. The rial has steadily declined and Bank Markazi has been following behind, re-pegging its floating rate to reflect the open market value. The devaluation has fuelled price rises and inflation is thought to run much higher than the official 22 per cent. The price of utilities and transport all rose steeply earlier this year but the Majlis (parliament) has vetoed moves by President Rafsanjani to reduce the expensive burden on the state of fuel subsidies because of fears of a public outcry. Last month, transport workers in the southern city of Shiraz went on strike demanding pay increases. Falls in the price of oil towards the end of last year have meant Iran earned only Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 9bn) in the Iranian year recently ended (March 21) instead of a budgeted Dollars 17bn. This has increased its debt burden, although Dollars 5.5bn of its estimated Dollars 14bn short-term debt has been refinanced since February with its main trading partners, including Germany and Japan.</p>

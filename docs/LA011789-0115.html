			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY JUDGE UNDER FIRE TO RESIGN;  </P> <P> CARTER ALLEGEDLY GRANTED DEFENDANTS PREFERRED TREATMENT  </P> <P> Orange County Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter, who has been under investigation  by the state Commission on Judicial Performance for allegedly giving  preferential treatment to defendants in his courtroom and accepting favors from  prostitutes, has submitted his resignation, it was learned Monday.  </P> <P> Judge Russell A. Bostrom, who until two weeks ago was presiding judge in the  Harbor branch of Orange County Municipal Court, said Carter told him Monday  that he would resign as of Feb. 19.  </P> <P> Bostrom, who said Carter gave him no reason for his resignation from Harbor  Court, declined to comment on whether the state investigation played any role  in the decision.  </P> <P> A source close to Carter told The Times that Carter sent a letter to Gov.  George Deukmejian on Friday tendering his resignation. The commission, which  generally operates in almost total secrecy, announced in October that it would  hold formal hearings on allegations against Carter and Municipal Judge Calvin  P. Schmidt, who is facing similar accusations. Schmidt also is a judge at  Harbor Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Carter, 62, was first placed under investigation by the Newport Beach Police  Department and the Orange County district attorney's office in 1984 when he was  overheard in a tape-recorded phone conversation arranging a rendezvous with a  prostitute.  </P> <P> In another taped conversation, Carter agreed to help a former client and  golfing partner who phoned him after being arrested on drug charges.  </P> <P> The commission has announced no date for its hearings on the allegations  against Carter and Schmidt, and commission officials have said no decision has  been made on whether the hearings would be made public.  </P> <P> Carter could not be reached for comment Monday night. His wife said she had no  comment on her husband's resignation. Carter's attorney, Byron K. McMillan,  also declined to discuss it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denied He Would Resign  </P> <P> Late last week, Carter vehemently denied rumors that he planned to resign.  </P> <P> Carter has denied any wrongdoing in connection with any of the allegations  against him. But he has refused to discuss any of the details of those  allegations.  </P> <P> The 1984 investigation began after Della Christine Johnson was arrested by  Fullerton police on suspicion of prostitution. She told police after her arrest  that she was an acquaintance of Carter and that he had hired her as a  prostitute.  </P> <P> She also said she had performed an act of prostitution in exchange for a debt  owed to Schmidt.  </P> <P> In statements later filed in court, Johnson said she had been told that Schmidt  would fix a traffic ticket for her in exchange for sex, and that she agreed.  But when it came time to pay off the judge, she said, Carter called her and  said he was going to collect the debt.  </P> <P> Schmidt has refused to comment.  </P> <P> In 1987, a former client and golfing friend of Carter, Jeffrey John Harbison,  called Carter from the Newport Beach City Jail and told him he was being held  on suspicion of possession of cocaine and needed the judge's help.  </P> <P> Carter, in a taped conversation, told Harbison that he would do what he could.  </P> <P> Harbor Court Judge Selim Franklin later told The Times that Carter called jail  officials and arranged to have Harbison's bail reduced from $25,000 to $5,000.  </P> <P> Carter also has been accused of giving preferential treatment to Harbison and  his girl friend, Susan Marsha Edwards, in the handling of several traffic  tickets.  </P> <P> The handling of Edwards' traffic tickets reportedly created friction between  Carter and Harbor Judge Susanne Shaw after Carter allegedly had a bailiff  retrieve tickets from Shaw's court and bring them to his courtroom. Shaw  allegedly complained about the incident to other judges.  </P> <P> Although the state Commission on Judicial Performance refuses to discuss  details of its investigations, sources say the panel's inquiries into Harbor  Court go beyond just Carter and Schmidt.  </P> <P> Bostrom reportedly is under investigation because of a meeting he had with  Newport Beach city officials in which he and Franklin are accused of trying to  apply pressure to end a police investigation of Carter and Schmidt. Bostrom has  denied any wrongdoing in connection with his dealings with city officials.  </P> <P> The commission has the authority to privately admonish a judge, ask the state  Supreme Court to publicly censure him or her, or ask the high court to remove a  judge from the bench.  </P> <P> Carter was appointed to the Harbor bench in 1982 by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown  Jr.  </P> <P> He was in private law practice before that.  </P> <P> Sources say that the state Commission on Judicial Performance received  complaints about Carter several years ago but backed away from an investigation  after learning that the district attorney's office was conducting its own  inquiry.  </P> <P> But apparently more than a year ago, county prosecutors decided that they had  insufficient information to file any criminal charges against Carter. The  commission then asked for the county prosecutors' investigative files and the  prosecutors complied.  </P> <P> Sources close to the district attorney's investigation said that its  investigators had difficulty getting cooperation from some witnesses, including  prostitutes and some people accused of attempting to peddle influence in Harbor  Court.  </P> <P> Bostrom's only comment on Carter on Monday was: "As his presiding judge for 2  years, I can certainly confirm that he was a very hard-working judge. I think  that's about it, really."  </P> <P> Schmidt's only public comment so far has been: "I hope I am a very good judge.  I hope I am a fair judge. Let's get it all out in the open (by having the state  judicial commission hearings).  </P> <P> Carter has said in interviews with The Times that the publicity over the  investigation upset him greatly at first, but that he has since grown numb to  it.  </P> <P> "It's like getting shot," Carter said. "It hurts when the bullet enters, but  after they've taken it out the trauma settles down."  </P> <P> On Friday, Carter told The Times that he had no reason to resign and that he  intended to fight whatever charges were raised against him at the formal  commission hearing.  </P></p>

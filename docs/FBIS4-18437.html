			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic  Populist Party [SDPP], state minister, and deputy prime  minister, has said that the economic stability package envisages  an equal share of the burden by all the sectors of the  community, and that there will be no freeze on salaries.    Replying to a journalist's question during a meeting of the  SDPP Central Executive Council, Karayalcin said that the  economic stability package will not place a burden on the  working people. You will see, he said, that all the sectors of  the economy will share an equal burden.    Addressing the meeting, Karayalcin said that organizational  readjustments will be made within the SDPP soon. We are also on  the threshold of a new period in government activities, he said.  He denied that the SDPP wants the government protocol to be  changed.    [Begin Karayalcin recording] However, we consider it  necessary that a new priority list be drawn up about the issues  the SDPP is sensitive about. This list will indicate when these  issues will be implemented, or when they will be submitted to  the Turkish Grand National Assembly. [end recording]    Karayalcin announced that he will work on whether or not to  start a negotiation process toward the unification of the  leftist parties. He pointed out that he came together with  Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal on Turkish Radio  and television's "Firing Line" program today. The SDPP leader  pointed out that he will meet with Baykal as soon as possible to  assess the situation.    Karayalcin said that the SDPP does not posit any  preconditions or expectations for the unification of the leftist  parties. He said: I believe that no political project is as  important as the unity of the left.    Asked if he would give up the SDPP leadership for the unity  of the leftist parties, Karayalcin replied: Both as an  individual and as a party we are ready to make every kind of  sacrifice.    Replying to another question, Karayalcin said that the SDPP  will work on the issue of possible changes in the SDPP wing of  the cabinet. He added that the decision to be reached will not  be his own personal decision.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PERU;  </P> <P> MAOIST REBELS SUSPEND FIGHTING  </P> <P> A Maoist rebel faction said it is suspending military action in Peru while it  reviews its anti-government struggle, but it vowed to resume its armed  insurgency. In leaflets found in the Andean city of Ayacucho on the 10th  anniversary of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) uprising, rebels who claim  to represent a splinter faction said they will lay down their arms to "evaluate  all our brilliant actions of the decade and then return with new impulses and  ideas." Three bombs rocked Ayacucho, birthplace of the Maoist movement, and a  10-year-old boy was injured, police said.  </P></p>

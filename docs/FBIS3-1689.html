The co-chairmen said in a statement that "the presence of  six  military jet aircraft detected and engaged by NATO aircraft this  morning was a violation of United Nations Security Council  Resolution 781."    "The action by NATO was clearly authorised by UN Security  Council Resolution 816 which was aimed at ensuring compliance  with the ban proportionate to the specific circumstances and the  nature of the flights," said the statement.    "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be  used  by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to  negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"  they stressed.    On 6 October 1992, the U.N. Security Council passed  Resolution 781 which banned all unauthorised flights over  Bosnia-Herzegovina. A week later, on 13 October, the Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic gave his assurance, in a meeting with the  co-chairmen in Geneva, that Bosnian Serb fixed-wing aircraft  would not violate the U.N. ban, according to the co-chairmen's  statement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zabirko] </F>   [Text] There can be different attitudes toward the  suspension of political activities by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman  of the Political Committee of the Socialist Party of Ukraine,  who has decided to focus on issues of the state at large. It is  common knowledge that foreign parties' leaders do not act in  this way. Apparently, this is why a news conference began with  the reading of a statement issued by the political committee,  and only then did Sergey Kiyashko -- who is acting as chairman  until another Socialist Party Congress -- brief attendees on the  first weeks of the new parliament's work, and in particular, the  socialist faction's activities, as well as answer questions from  journalists. He said that Oleksandr Moroz does not intend to  drop out of the presidential race. In his opinion, the election  should be held in June.    Later, Yuriy Boldyrev, member of the "Yednist" parliamentary  group which unites entrepreneurs, also appeared at the House of  Public Organizations' conference room. On property issues, the  group sympathizes with the right wing, and on cultural ones, as  Boldyrev said, it is ready to cooperate with the left wing. In  general, the answers could give the impression that the division  and search for compromises in the parliament are still  continuing. Members of the Labor Party, for example, have joined  various factions. Judging from all signs, fruitful legislative  work will begin no time soon.    The presence of regular party members at the news conference  was unusual. So was the presence of Donetsk Oblast Council  Chairman V. Chuprun, who enjoys the socialists' support in the  election for oblast leader. V. Chuprun reported that a regular  session of representatives of 10 bordering Russian and Ukrainian  oblasts will be held in Donetsk on 27 May.</p>

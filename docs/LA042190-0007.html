			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY  </P> <P> In response to "Listen to Your Grandmother" (Editorial Page, April 7), I agree  totally with David Blankenhorn's observation that the nation's "quality of  family life" is deteriorating. His explanation that the cause is "Reagan closed  the bathrooms," made me laugh out loud and say a dirty functional word!  </P> <P> I guess I spent too many years in PTA not to be terribly concerned about the  future of our children. Single-parent households simply cannot meet the needs  of the children, as hard as they try. Though we observe a burning need for  child care supported by government and the workplace, the responsibility is  with the parents. Nothing will replace a two-parent family unit, even if it is  not a Ozzie-and-Harriet ideal group.  </P> <P> Do we really want a governmental agency teaching American values? Who will  determine what those values will be? I remember being part of a group of  parents and teachers attempting to get a sex education unit into the 7th grade  20 years ago. Numerous people came before the school district committee to  protest. These are "family issues," they said, to be determined by the  individual family's religion, the ideals the parents want to promulgate, the  individual child's maturity and social development. Teachers were uncomfortable  with the subject matter, believing, too, these were matters, like many others,  to be taught in the home.  </P> <P> The grandmothers are right, Mr. Blankenhorn. Listen to them.  </P> <P> NINI CUTTER  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

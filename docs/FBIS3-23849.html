Hopes, doubts, alarms -- these are feelings very familiar to  every grain grower as spring approaches. Most of the regions  sown to winter crops, even the non-fallow predecessors from  fall, have good moisture reserves in the soil, and after all, it  is they which in many ways determine the growth and development  of the crops in the first two months after the regeneration of  the spring vegetation.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average Moisture Reserves in a Metric Layer of Soil Sown to Winter Crops for |  |Nonfallow Predecessors (mm)                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |Norm                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belgorod                 |169                      |110                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Voronezh                 |164                      |106                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kursk                    |188                      |113                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lipetsk                  |149                      |125                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tambov                   |179                      |115                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volgograd                |102                      |67                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Samar                    |148                      |91                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Saratov                  |146                      |106                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ulyanovsk                |217                      |108                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stavropol                |86                       |68                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rostov                   |131                      |62                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tatarstan                |160                      |135                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bashkortostan            |169                      |129                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Orenburg                 |166                      |73                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      At the same time, the soil's content of nutrients is  extremely meager. Last year's negative balance of them, when the  removal with the crops and weeds exceeded the intake with  mineral and organic fertilizers by a factor of three, had its  effect. According to the data of soil diagnosticians, the  already small reserves of nitrogen were washed from the top soil  to deeper layers. In virtually all the areas, the winter grain  had to be given supplementary feeding with nitrogen fertilizers,  and in intensive farming -- double supplementary feeding with  complex fertilizers cut into the soil with grain seeders.    Predictions are that root rot will be widespread in spring,  and to combat it, in addition to fungicides, we widely recommend  the use of liquid complex fertilizers, phosphorus and potassium  solutions. This not only reduces the damage to the plants due to  fungus disease, but also increases the stalk's resistance to  lodging.    For more productive use of ground equipment and agricultural  aviation, it is advisable to make wide use of tank mixtures of  fertilizers, pesticides and retardants.    The moisture reserves in the soil make it possible to  predict  the high efficiency of local use of fertilizers when spring  wheat and corn crops are planted: each kilogram of nutrients  will make it possible to obtain an additional 5-7 kilograms,  converted to grain, of products. Last year, despite the sharp  rise in prices for mineral fertilizers, every ruble spent for  their application became 1.5-2 rubles net profit.    Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties and a lack  of money in the rural commodity producers' accounts, the  warehouses of the farms and Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations  stand empty. Many chemical combines suspended production in  December-January for the same reason. There is no clarity with  respect to the supply of aviation gasoline -- and time is not  standing still.    One recalls the sad experience of last year. When the  agricultural producers rushed to look for fertilizers in  April-May, the jobbing demand for them began. Things got to the  point where the government was forced to forbid the export of  fertilizers outside Russia for two months, but, despite the  measures taken, the chemical industry could not, just like that,  fully satisfy the peasants' demand.    One way of getting out of the situation that has been  created  can be seen -- to come to an agreement with the chemical  enterprises on shipping mineral fertilizers and pesticides to  the warehouses of the Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations, without  pre-payment, for responsible storage. This will make possible  fuller use of the production capacities of the Selkhozkhimiya  supplying enterprises and storages, and the agricultural  producers will gain the possibility of carrying out agrochemical  and protective work in the necessary amounts and in better  agrotechnical periods.</p>

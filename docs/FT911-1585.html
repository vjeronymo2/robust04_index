			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Bush rejects charges over Iranian hostages PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday angrily rejected allegations that he visited Paris in 1980 to help the Reagan presidential campaign strike a deal with Iran to delay the release of American hostages until after the election that November. Mr Bush's denial - the first time he has specifically addressed the issue - came amid calls in the US press and among Democrats in Congress for an inquiry into the persistent but unproven allegation that the Reagan team manipulated the hostage issue to ensure President Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1980. The story has gathered momentum since Mr Gary Sick, a senior Carter administration official, set out the case for an inquiry in a lengthy article last month in the New York Times which drew on interviews with multiple sources in eight countries in four continents. Journalists, historians and politicians alike have never been able to show that Iran's agreement to release the 52 Americans in Tehran, just minutes after the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan in January 1981, was anything more than coincidence. This week, the State Department fuelled speculation by denying a visa to Mr Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, former Iranian president, who wanted to visit the US to promote his book which repeated the allegations. The department reversed itself yesterday, and Mr Bani-Sadr was said by his US publisher to be taking the next available flight from his exile home in Paris. Mr Bush sounded testy when confronted with reporters' questions that he brokered the deal with Iran to delay the release of the hostages in return for later arms sales from Israel. He called the stories 'rumour mongering' and 'sickening', denying point-blank that he visited Paris. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary, sought to kill the story by calling Mr Sick, a respected Middle East expert who served in both the Ford and Carter administrations, 'the Kitty Kelley of foreign policy' - a reference to the controversial biographer of Mrs Nancy Reagan. Although respected newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post have expressed support for an inquiry, the mood among Democrats appears mixed - particularly in the absence of the proverbial 'smoking gun'. Mr Tom Foley, House speaker, said the accusations merited investigation. But Mr Lee Hamilton, an influential member of the House foreign affairs committee, said after an informal meeting with Mr Sick this week that 'we have reached no conclusions about what (he) said, and certainly no conclusions about what follows.' Privately, someDemocrats worry that some of the sources of the allegations are Israelis who say they used to work for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. Foreign policy observers in Washington note that the allegations have resurfaced after the Gulf war - the very time when the Bush administration would like to exert pressure on Israel to be more co-operative in the Middle East peace process.</p>

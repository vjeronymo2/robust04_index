			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ABOUT-FACE INTO FAST-GROWING FIELD;  </P> <P> DIGITAL EQUIPMENT UNVEILS DESKTOP COMPUTERS  </P> <P> After years of largely ignoring the personal computer market, Digital Equipment  Corp. on Tuesday announced a broad lineup of desktop machines designed to give  the nation's No. 3 computer maker a share of the industry's fastest-growing  segment.  </P> <P> The three new lines unveiled in Boston represent a significant about-face for  Digital, whose chairman and founder, Kenneth Olsen, just six months ago  reportedly dismissed the powerful desktop workstation as "a tiny little machine  on a desk."  </P> <P> Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., has been best known for its powerful  minicomputers that can serve many users at once. With its new offerings,  however, the company is entering the single-user desktop markets that generated  more than $50 billion in worldwide sales last year.  </P> <P> Desktop computers typically fall into one of two categories: personal computers  made by companies such as International Business Machines and Apple Computer  that commonly are found at the home or office, and more sophisticated  workstations generally used by engineers and scientists.  </P> <P> These markets are dominated by two of the company's most formidable competitors  -- longtime nemesis IBM and a more recent workstation foe, Sun Microsystems.  Once the talk of Wall Street, Digital now faces an uphill battle. In trading on  the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Digital fell 50 cents to close at $98.  </P> <P> Analysts, however, generally were positive.  </P> <P> "It's a significant announcement," said Jeffrey Canin, a technology analyst at  Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco brokerage. "It's important for Digital's  future to take advantage of the general migration of users to desktop  computers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Resolution to Problem  </P> <P> Although the new products represent a major change in Digital's strategy,  analysts said they may not solve the company's biggest recent problem: a  slowdown in sales of its most profitable product, the most advanced VAX  minicomputer.  </P> <P> "Back in November Ken Olsen said the problem with sales was at the high end of  the line," said Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.  "They are adding additional machines at the low end, but that offers no  resolution to the main problem."  </P> <P> The new products include:  </P> <P> * A family of sophisticated desktop workstations. At the low end is the  VAXstation 3100, which will be fully compatible with the company's line of VAX  minicomputers. Prices will start at under $8,000, and shipments are expected as  early as March.  </P> <P> At the high end is the DECstation 3100, the company's first machine to be based  on the new, speedy reduced-instruction computer chips. Digital claims that the  model, priced at $11,900, is the world's fastest desktop workstation.  Deliveries are scheduled to begin in April.  </P> <P> * A line of personal computers built by Tandy Corp., ranging in price from  $2,630 to $4,960, which will be available this month. The personal computers  will use the MS-DOS operating system and will be able to work with other MS-DOS  computers, such as the popular IBM and Compaq models.  </P> <P> * New software, called DECwindows, which allows the new desktop models to share  information with other Digital machines.  </P> <P> Analysts said the new products show that Digital finally has understood what  business customers want: groups of small computers linked together rather than  a single computer driving and supplying information to a host of terminals with  no processing power of their own, the type of systems Digital traditionally has  supplied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outside Designs  </P> <P> Digital's move also represents several significant breaks from the company's  tradition of doing things its own way. Not only did Digital introduce desktop  computers made by Tandy Corp., but some of the models will use operating  systems and designs, or "architectures," developed outside the company and  popularized by its primary competitors.  </P> <P> For example, the MS-DOS operating system in the personal computers was written  by Microsoft and was first adopted by IBM. Its top-of-the line DECstation 3100  will use a version of the UNIX operating system, developed by American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Bell Laboratories and popularized by Sun  Microsystems. An operating system acts as a computer's traffic cop, directing  the flow of data in the machine.  </P> <P> Analysts said Digital's suggested prices for the new machines show that the  company is serious about making a quick dent in the desktop market. They said  the company could be firing the first shot in a new round of price wars.  </P> <P> "This marks the start of the desktop wars," said UBS Securities analyst Marc  Shulman in New York.  </P> <P> However, analyst Canin said Digital's low prices probably mean that the  company's profit margins are slim and high-volume selling will be required for  Digital to recoup its investment. If the high volumes aren't realized, he said,  the company's profits will be squeezed.  </P></p>

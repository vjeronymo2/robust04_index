			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Rotar under "Tajikistan" rubric: "More </F> Casualties on Tajik-Afghan Border. Opposition Seems To Have  Launched Big Offensive"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To all appearances, a new  sharp spiral in the escalation of tensions in Tajikistan is in  the cards. According to information received from sources close  to opposition leaders, as many as six Russian border guards, not  one, were killed in the recent clash along the Tajik border, and  eight were wounded with two of them being in serious condition.  The opposition contend that their like-minded associates were  firing from Tajik territory. According to information from the  same source, Tajik militants are arriving in great numbers from  Afghanistan in the Pamirs. Tajik opposition members who live in  Moscow cannot clearly explain what is happening in their own  country because communications with their associates from  Afghanistan have been broken. They think, however, that leaders  of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan in Afghanistan have  decided that Dushanbe has breached the understanding reached  with the opposition by starting to discuss a new constitution  before the second round of talks, and has clearly gambled on a  military solution of the question. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent has come to learn that Tajikistan leaders have  been urgently summoned to Moscow.</p>

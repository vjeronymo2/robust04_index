The  ailing city of Detroit -- with its bare economic and social  wounds -- offered an eloquent background for the frightening  consequences that may result from neglecting social and  employment problems.    This conference should set a signal for the more than 30  million unemployed in the industrialized countries and the many  millions employed who fear for their jobs day after day: Those  who bear political responsibility for the first time want to  make it clear at an international stage that they are aware of  people's fears and of the dangerous effects high unemployment  has on the social structure of our societies.    Even politicians such as Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who  had taken a skeptical view on the American idea of a G-7 jobs  conference, finally said that including structural problems in  the G-7 process did make sense; nobody can afford the political  controversy between financial and social policy any longer. The  American hosts even spoke euphorically of the most important  turning point in the dialogue between the industrialized  countries.    So much for rhetorics. No tangible results were achieved.  Still, it would probably be wrong to conclude from that that the  conference was a failure. From the very beginning the American  hosts' only intention was to learn from one another through an  intensive exchange of opinions on the shared problem of  unemployment and to take home new ideas or impulses.    Even before the beginning of the meeting, all participants  knew that microproblems such as unemployment cannot be overcome  through international coordination but only through domestic  reforms. All of them also knew that all possible solutions are  not interchangeable at will but have to be tailored to the  individual conditions in the national economies.    Progress cannot be measured by joint promises for action but  only by better understanding for the diversities and common  features of employment problems in the seven countries. In this  connection it is again and again surprising how little the  individual responsible government officials are aware of the  situation and particularities in the partner countries.  Although the problem of unemployment was presented, analyzed,  and compared with foreign conditions in all participating  countries, there is still a great deal of ignorance and much  reason for misunderstanding. Time and again, the politicians  succumb to the temptation to measure the partner countries with  their yardsticks and the very conditions in their countries.    One example of the lack of differentiation is the nasty and  trite controversy over German interests that are said to be the  obstacle to global growth. The simple American formula that the  Bundesbank only has to cut its short-term interest rates to  promote growth in Germany and in Europe so that more American  products can be sold there was wrapped in diplomatic language at  this conference and cloaked with the concern for jobs. However,  the fact that the special German situation is being ignored has  not changed as far as the formulation of the demand for interest  cuts and stimulating the demand in the name of creating more  jobs are concerned.    Yet it may be seen as success of the one and a half days of  exchange of opinions that the American Administration now seems  to understand that even the Germans would have absolutely  nothing against higher growth rates, but that the incorporation  of the eastern laender and the responsibility toward East Europe  are constituting such a great burden for Germany that the  current conditions do not permit an additional stimulation of  demand. Moreover, the Clinton Administration now even accepts  the German argument that the deep structural reasons of  unemployment cannot be overcome by a substantial stimulation of  the economy either. How long such insights will last will be  seen at the earliest at the spring meeting of the G-7 finance  minister in Washington in April.    A different thing is how the better understanding of the  individual problems of the partners' labor markets will  translate into concrete steps to fight unemployment. The list  of measures regarded as necessary is impressive: making labor  markets more flexible, deregulation and privatization, life-long  learning and permanent modernization of qualification, better  preparation of those leaving school for integration into the  labor market, greater innovative strength and more modern  organizational structures of enterprises, innovative wage  policy, compatibility between social benefits and labor market,  and specific promotion of medium-sized enterprises as driving  forces for employment.    Even before the meeting, critical voices remarked that in  all  industrialized nations the reasons for unemployment had been  sufficiently studied and the necessary measures were widely  known. The problem is the implementation of the measures,  because those who bear political responsibly lack the courage  and the enterprises and trade unions were clinging to outdated  patterns of thought. Should the conference of Detroit break up  rigid behavioral patterns and political positions it would  indeed have been something like a turning point. However, one  should not expect any miracles even from cross-border political  learning.</p>

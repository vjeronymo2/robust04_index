He added: Radio News will begin work on the occasion of the  blessed 10 Days of Dawn [anniversary of the revolution during  the first ten days of February].    Mr. Hashemi said with regards to the need for the creation  of  Radio News: Because news tends to be generated constantly and  because current bulletins are broadcast at specific times, Radio  News was felt to be needed, and work on the planning and  implementation was set into motion. As a result, this radio  will begin work soon.    According to this report, Radio News will broadcast three to  five minutes of political, economic, sports, scientific, and  cultural news every 15 minutes. Radio News will broadcast  between 0630 in the morning and 2100.    The Voice and Vision chief added: At the beginning, Radio  News will be received within the boundaries of greater Tehran;  efforts will be made to increase its range in the future. Our  aim is that much of the news we cannot use in current bulletins  because of time limitations will be broadcast on this radio  station for the information of our compatriots.</p>

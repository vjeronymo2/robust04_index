			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will take good care of economic  development to ensure the stability and prevent bubble economic  growth as happened six to seven years ago. Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says that at present the  country's export sector has extended significantly. During the  first five months of this year, Thai export increased by 20  percent against 14 percent as predicted earlier. The deputy  prime minister attributes the expansion in export sector to more  agricultural exports during the period, especially rice and  frozen shrimps. Some high-tech products such as computer parts  and electronics have also enjoyed high export growth, especially  to ASEAN market.    Mr. Suphachai says the government will be cautious about  credit extension for the real estate sector and about the stock  market. It will ensure that private investment will be  diversified into all regions of the country. He says the  government has set a balanced national budget so that the  country's economy will not expand at an excessive rate.</p>

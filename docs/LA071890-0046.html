			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY FIGHT, AND BOOKSHOP WON  </P> <P> To the devoted book lovers who browse its endless, dusty shelves in search of  the obscure and out-of-print, Acres of Books in downtown Long Beach has long  been a beloved landmark. Now it is about to become an official one.  </P> <P> Despite misgivings on the part of the city's planning and redevelopment staff,  the Long Beach City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to designate as a  local cultural heritage landmark the 1920s, Streamline Moderne building that  houses Acres, one of the largest used bookstores on the West Coast.  </P> <P> The landmark designation gives an extra -- though hardly indestructible --  layer of protection to the sprawling bookstore that sits in the middle of a  run-down block ripe for redevelopment.  </P> <P> "It's not going to save us forever," conceded Jackie Smith, who helps manage  the family-owned business, home to an estimated 750,000 volumes that lure book  buyers from around the country.  </P> <P> "It just added another layer of bureaucracy for developers to go through and  buys us time. We're very grateful for that," said Smith, who was going to pick  up a bottle of champagne on her way back to the Long Beach Boulevard store.  </P> <P> The bookshop was nominated months ago for landmark designation, which can be  used to delay demolition of a building for as long as a year but cannot  ultimately stop it. The nomination was stalled when local planning and  redevelopment officials fretted that the landmark ordinance should not be used  to save a business in an architecturally mediocre building. Even Smith, who is  married to a grandson of shop founder Bertram Smith, once described the former  food market and dance hall as "not all that wonderful."  </P> <P> Ruthann Lehrer, the city's neighborhood and historic preservation officer,  nonetheless prevailed, arguing that the 13,000-square-foot bookstore not only  provides a worthwhile example of an architectural style but also serves as a  unique cultural asset.  </P> <P> No development project is currently proposed for the Acres block. Lehrer said  that if one emerges, the redevelopment staff has agreed to either try to  incorporate the 1924 Acres building into the project or find a new home for the  shop, which has been at its present location for 30 years.  </P> <P> Dark, huge and deliberately unchic, Acres has a style of its own that breeds  strong loyalty among bibliophiles who journey through its dim recesses like  pilgrims in Mecca.  </P> <P> "Please save Acres of Books. It is a holy shrine for book lovers nationwide,"  Cal State Long Beach Prof. Ben Cunningham said in a telegram he sent to City  Hall just before the council vote.  </P> <P> The shop holds 500 categories of books, stacked in towering homemade  bookshelves and old fruit cartons. Readers who walk the torn linoleum floors  can find the "Tragedies of Shakespeare" cheek by jowl with "Freeze With Ease,"  along with books on subjects as diverse as UFOs and horses.  </P></p>

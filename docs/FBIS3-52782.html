In statements to the Qatari press reported by the QATARI  NEWS  AGENCY [QNA], Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that the program of his  foreign tour included a visit to Yemen, but the current  conditions that Yemen was experiencing did not allow this visit.    He added "when these conditions end and disappear I will  visit Sanaa."    The first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs expressed regrets over current events in Yemen. He also  expressed regrets and astonishment for the rumors implicating  Kuwait in the rift and dispute between north and south Yemen,  saying that this is void of truth and a mere fabrication.    He pointed out that Kuwait is very far removed from the  dispute that the state of Yemen is currently experiencing and  this matter "hurts us very much." [passage omitted]</p>

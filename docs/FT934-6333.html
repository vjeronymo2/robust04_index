			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BPP shares tumble after profits warning Shares in BPP yesterday plunged to their lowest level for almost three years as the language and professional training company warned annual profits would lower than expected due to increased rationalisation costs and a substantial property write-down. The market marked the shares down 90p to 215p, their lowest since February 1991, after the group announced it expected profits to be at least Pounds 6.3m before the write-down. Analysts had expected profits, scheduled for March 21, of about Pounds 7.8m. The group also said it expected to take a charge of about Pounds 5.3m through the profit and loss to account for a Pounds 7.5m reduction in the value of its properties. The rest would be charged against reserves. BPP issued the warning following its decision to pull out of language training in Belgium and Japan at a further cost of Pounds 300,000. This followed the company's warning in August that it would incur Pounds 650,000 in charges for reducing its exposure to the depressed Japanese market. Mr Richard Price, chairman, said yesterday trading had become particularly tough both in Japan and continental Europe in the last three months. The language division was expected to incur a loss of Pounds 400,000 ' against profits of Pounds 857,000 last year ' of which Pounds 200,000 was attributable to the Belgian and Japanese businesses. Mr Price said he expected trading in the language division to be difficult through 1994, due to the increasingly depressed climate in France and Germany. However, he emphasised that profits continued to move ahead at the group's three other divisions - publishing, and academic and professional training - albeit less rapidly than expected in the first two cases. He said confidence in these three businesses reinforced the decision to forecast an increased final dividend of 5.8p (5.3p), for a total of 8.8p (8p).</p>

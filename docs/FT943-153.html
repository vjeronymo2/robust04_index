			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ruberoid up 3% to Pounds 2.2m Ruberoid, the roofing company spun off by Tarmac last year, yesterday announced a 3 per cent increase in interim profits, in spite of a sluggish UK construction market. Mr David Watson, finance director, said the wettest spring in more than a century had delayed the completion of many contracts. In addition the long-awaited recovery in the UK construction market had been slow to materialise. Cost-cutting and lower interest charges helped produce pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.16m). Sales fell to Pounds 108m (Pounds 114m). Mr Watson said Ruberoid was on track to meet full-year expectations, helped by the acquisition of a US business and the outstanding interest in a UK joint venture. In the first half, Ruberoid cut some Pounds 500,000 from on-going costs and expects a further Pounds 500,000 in savings during the latter part of the year. A Pounds 300,000 charge was taken to pay for the rationalisation. The dividend, Ruberoid's first interim payout since flotation, was 1.8p. Earnings were unchanged at 3.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with unidentified Rwandan Patriotic </F> Front Representative in Brussels by unattributed correspondent;  date not given: "Rwandan Patriotic Front Launches Siege of  Kigali"]    [Excerpts] At least 4,000 RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  rebels are fighting their way from the north to Kigali. For  what purpose? This time does the RPF want to do what it says it  has never seriously tried in four years of war: To take the  capital? "Yes," says the RPF spokesman in Brussels bluntly. "We  are going to take Kigali in order to restore order and  neutralize the extremists who are terrorizing and murdering our  people." [passage omitted]    "The new government consists exclusively of Hutu hawks," the  RPF spokesman in Brussels said. "People who were on [former  President] Habyarimana's side and who always boycotted the  Arusha peace agreement. These are the people who have decimated  the opposition. This is a government which is based on terror.  We continue to stick by the three basic principles of Arusha:  The goal of a state based on the rule of law, power sharing in  a transitional period, and the merger of the two military forces  into one army. In the interests of the peace agreement we are  trying to take out the anti-Arusha forces. Indeed, we are doing  that with arms in hand. Just as the Belgians and French are  rushing to help their fellow countrymen, we are trying to save  our people. And by our people, we do not just mean Tutsis by a  long shot. The terror of recent days was directed against all  those who were not extreme Hutu hawks. We are going to end this  regime's potential to kill." [passage omitted]</p>

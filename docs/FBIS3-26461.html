The mission to initially  establish a socialist market economic structure by the end of  this century, as proposed by the party's central committee, is  magnificent and achievable through hard work.    After 14 years of market-oriented reform and opening up, by  and large, we possess the basic conditions for moving over to a  socialist market economy. Some localities in Fujian, Quanzhou  City for instance, which have been advancing at a faster  development pace, have positively conducted comprehensive  experiments with reform and opening up with markets as an  orientation for many years, gradually smashed the bonds of the  traditional planned economy, and initially presented the  embryonic form of a socialist market economic structure. To sum  up, it has been propped up by the following six basic pillars.    First, economic sectors have become diversified.  An economic structure, with the sector under public ownership  as a main body and the multiple sectors coexisting, is a  prerequisite for the development of the socialist market  economy. Public ownership is the core of the socialist economic  system. Practicing a market economy under socialist conditions  should and must always stick to the principle of taking the  public sector as a main body and properly combining public  ownership with the market economy. However, it is impossible for  a unitary ownership to develop into a market economy. If there  is only one ownership by the whole people, or there is only one  owner -- the state then, in the entire economic operation, there  will not be real commodities, exchange of commodities, and  markets in a strict sense. Hence, in practicing a market  economy under socialist conditions, it is a correct direction to  stick to the principle of having multiple economic sectors with  the public sector as the main body. Since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, people in Quanzhou  have aimed at one principle -- they will courageously experiment  on and put into practice everything that is beneficial to the  development of socialist productive forces. They took the lead  in breaking through the model of unitary public ownership,  explored the possibility of practicing the ownership structure  with the public sector as a main body and the coexistence of the  multiple sectors, and encouraged the simultaneous development of  state-owned, collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded  economic sectors so that its economic pattern has undergone  gradual changes. In the industrial area, township and town  enterprises have sprung up everywhere and foreign-invested,  individual, and private enterprises of nonpublic sectors have  emerged in large multitudes. In 1992, there were 27,807  industrial enterprises with 847,200 employees throughout the  city, their total output value reached 15 billion yuan, and  their taxes handed over to the state totalled 1.268 billion  yuan. In the commercial area, they have also broken through the  situation wherein business was monopolized by state and  cooperative commercial sectors and individual business  households and urban and rural trade fairs have been flourishing.    Second, markets are holding an increasingly important  position in economic operations. Market mechanisms have  exercised the role of a foundation in the allocation of  resources, which is a major content of the socialist market  economy. The market economy takes market as a foundation, a  center, as well as an orientation. It calls for all economic  activities to be directly or indirectly related to markets and  regulated by market mechanisms. Fundamentally speaking, the  transition from a planned to a market economic structure is a  change in the pattern of resource allocation. Under the planned  economic structure, the allocation of resources was achieved by  a series of mandatory administrative plans. Under the  conditions of a market economy, however, production is decided  by social demands and the rational allocation of resources is  achieved by markets in conjunction with production, circulation,  distribution, and consumption. In the reform which takes the  market as an orientation, Quanzhou paid attention to exercising  the regulatory role of market mechanisms and gradually reduced  the scope and changed the mode of planned management. In  particular, as soon as township and town enterprises were set  up, they were guided by markets, their essential elements  including funds, technology, raw and semifinished materials,  labor power, and so on were allocated and regulated through  markets and their operational activities were targeted at  markets. At present, the industrial products produced under  mandatory planning in Quanzhou have been reduced from the  previous 60 to two categories -- cigarettes and salt, and those  produced under guidance planning have been reduced from 23 to  eight categories.    In agricultural production, planning according to different  varieties and seasons has been canceled except for the control  of total demand and supply. The price formative mechanism was  generally based on markets. Except for a small number of  important commodities and labor services the prices of which  were set by the state, most of the other commodities and labor  services were regulated by markets. The prices of agricultural  and sideline products, except for some traditional Chinese  medicines, were all set by the markets, the control of grain  prices was completely lifted, and the prices of industrial means  of production were unified. In 1992, the portion of prices set  by the state only accounted for 2.7 percent in the retail volume  of social commodities, while the portion regulated by markets  was 97 percent.    Markets are carriers [zai ti 6528 7555] of the operation of  market mechanisms and the perfection of market mechanisms  depends on a sound market system. In the market system, all  commodities and production factors including land, funds, labor  power, and technology must all enter the markets. Without a  well-developed commodity market and a perfect market of  production factors, there will not be a modern market economy.  For many years, Quanzhou persisted in proceeding from the  reality, mobilized the strength from various quarters in  society, and dedicated itself to the cultivation and  construction of markets. The commodity markets are being  perfected day by day and a number of large-scale, powerful, and  well-known specialized markets have been formed one after  another, which have registered an annual transaction volume of  several hundred million yuan and held a certain share in both  domestic and foreign markets. Greater progress has also been  made in the growth of markets of production factors including  labor services, technology, information, funds, real estate, and  so on. A fair, competitive, and orderly market system is being  established deliberately.    Third, enterprises are operating more and more  independently. Enterprises are the main body of a market  economy and the independent operational activities of  enterprises are an internal requirement for the development of a  socialist market economic structure. Under the market economic  structure, each enterprise is an independent producer and  operator, which is a legal person that breaks away from its  dependent relations with the government, operates independently,  assumes sole responsibility for its own profits and losses, and  effects self-development and self-constraint. All the principal  parties which participate in market competition are equal.  While giving a free hand to developing nonstate economic  sectors, Quanzhou has positively promoted the transformation of  operational mechanism in state-owned enterprises, further  straightened out the relations between ownership and management,  and enabled enterprises to enter the "ocean" of markets from the  "embrace" of the government so that they will really become the  main body of markets, operating independently and assuming sole  responsibility for their own profits and losses. The city  authority selected a large number of state-owned enterprises and  pushed them into commodity markets, production factor markets,  and property rights trading markets through contracts, leasing,  auctions, grafting together by means of foreign capital, and  transformation of operational mechanisms, thereby initially  changing the situation whereby the government took up all  responsibility for the state-owned enterprises. Up to now, 90  percent of the state-owned enterprises throughout the city have  practiced a contract system; 729 state and cooperative  commercial enterprises have put into effect the policy of  relaxing government control over operation, pricing,  distribution, and employment; 21 enterprises have adopted the  management methods of foreign-invested enterprises and township  and town enterprises; 10 state-owned enterprises have practiced  the system under which shares are held by staff and workers as  well as legal persons within the enterprises; and 48 enterprises  have become joint-ventures, of which 41 state-owned enterprises  took the lead in the country in undergoing package  transformation to have foreign capital grafted unto them. In  this way, they have blazed a new path of transforming  operational mechanisms for state-owned enterprises.    While exploring ways to establish a modern enterprise  system,  Quanzhou also positively explored effective organizational forms  for state assets suited to the market economy, in accordance  with the principle of separating government administration from  enterprise and separating ownership from management. The city  authorities have set up a state assets management committee and  its working body, led by the mayor as committee director and  participated in by various economic departments. Besides, a  company to carry on the business of state assets has also been  set up, so that a new-type state assets operation and management  system has been initially established.    Fourth, the economy is advancing in the direction of  indirect macroscopic regulation and control. Exercising  macroscopic regulation and control by the government through  economic policies and levers is a necessary means to guarantee  the orderly and healthy growth of the market economy. The  development of the socialist market economy calls for  governments at all levels to conscientiously change government  administrative functions and to change from: Relying mainly on  direct to mainly on indirect regulation and control; relying  mainly on management by mandatory planning to mainly on guidance  planning; relying mainly on the use of administrative fiats to  mainly on economic policies; relying mainly on the  self-development of markets to mainly on the cultivation and  organization of markets; and from relying mainly on divisions of  money, resources, and targets to mainly on provision of  guidance, consultancy, and services. On the basis of  understanding market laws, the government should better use such  economic levers as prices, interest rates, tariffs, and others  as well as legal means to exercise macroeconomic regulation and  control. In the course of market economic development, Quanzhou  has seriously heeded economic laws and conscientiously brought  about the transformation of government functions while pushing  enterprises into the markets. It has defined the government  functions as "planning, coordination, supervision, and service"  and vividly summarized the government's relationship with  enterprises as "welcoming their investment, collecting taxes for  their profits, checking and acting upon their lawbreaking  activities, and offering sympathy whey they become bankrupt."  The government has provided services to enterprises chiefly in  the areas of policies, infrastructure facilities, soft  investment environment, and the building of spiritual  civilization. In the course of separating government  administration from enterprises, the city authorities have  delegated administrative powers to lower levels, adopted the  practice of making policy decisions and exercising regulation  and control at different levels, returned powers to enterprises,  let grass-roots units enjoy certain powers, and expanded the  limits of authority for counties and townships in their economic  management. Meanwhile, it also streamlined the administrative  structure and diverted personnel to other jobs in light of the  requirements for the development of the market economy. Across  the city, 193 nonstanding bodies have been dissolved, more than  20 government departments and institutions have set up entities,  and 494 people have been dismissed from government organs or  institutions to work elsewhere. While transforming government  functions and streamlining the administrative structure, the  city has established 37 intermediary organizations including  technical and vocational training centers, offices for lawyers,  accountants, and auditors, and so on. In addition, it has paid  attention to exercising the role of chambers of commerce,  associations of foreign entrepreneurs, and 160 trade  associations, strengthened and perfected the management of  trades, and provided enterprises with all kinds of services.    Fifth, the economy is oriented to exports.  Openness is an essential characteristic of the market economy.  The development of the socialist market economy must  unswervingly practice the national policy of opening to the  outside world, link the domestic market with the international  market as quickly as possible, effect a two-way flow of various  natural resources, let enterprises participate in international  competition of their own accord, fully take the comparative  advantage of international division of work and international  exchanges, and form an extensively open pattern characterized by  multiple levels, channels, and directions. Since reform and  opening up, Quanzhou has fully exploited the advantages of being  a well-known hometown of Overseas Chinese and its extremely  close relations with foreign countries. It widely opened the  gate and paved the way to attract foreign investors from Taiwan  and other places through the help of Overseas Chinese, tapped  both internal and external resources, combined foreign capital  with foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation, vigorously  developed the export- oriented economy, and blazed a new trial  that "started from the path of three forms of import processing  and compensation trade, got onto the way of township and town  enterprises, embarked on the road of foreign-invested  enterprises, proceeded to open up stretches upon stretches of  land development, and finally led to a magnificent blueprint of  a regional economy." By the end of 1992, a grand total of 2,398  foreign-invested enterprises had been approved throughout the  city, with a total investment amount of 12.615 billion yuan and  a contract foreign investment amount of $1.888 billion. The  scope and areas of foreign investment have been repeatedly  expanded, the channels for absorbing foreign capital have  continuously increased, township and town enterprises that have  foreign capital grafted onto them have grown rapidly, and a  major breakthrough has been made in the transformation of  state-owned enterprises using foreign capital. In the course of  increasing the use of foreign capital, relatively great  development has also been attained in foreign trade. In 1992,  the city's total value of export goods amounted to 3.11 billion  yuan, representing an increase of 37 times as against 1979. The  proportion of total export value in the city's GNP has been  elevated from 6.61 percent in 1979 to 27 percent today. There  are a dozen categories of products with export value exceeding  100 million yuan, including garments, packing materials, shoes,  umbrellas, ceramics, knitwear, plastic articles, electronic and  electrical appliances, leatherware, gloves, stone products, tea,  among other things. Quanzhou's export-oriented economy accounts  for over 50 percent of its national economy as a whole and its  economic activities depend more and more on the international  markets.    Sixth, the process of standardized social management  has begun. A market economy is, in essence, an economy of  laws. A complete legal system and a perfect social insurance  system are reliable guarantees for the institution of a  socialist market economic structure. Ruling by law is an  inherent requirement as well as an organic component of market  economic order. In the arena of markets, the authority and  responsibility of enterprises and individuals should be  confirmed and protected by laws, the market order should be  standardized and maintained by laws, and the state's regulation  and control over markets should also be achieved on the strength  of laws. At present, a legal system that is adapted to the  socialist market economic structure has not been completely  instituted, the market rules are far from sound, and there is  even a total blank in some areas. In developing the socialist  market economy, Quanzhou has experienced a development course  from a confused to orderly and from an unstandardized to  standardized progress. According to the principle of giving  consideration to "development first and standardization later,  relaxation first and perfection later, and support first and  profit later," the city has persisted in making experiments in  everything, conscientiously summing up experiences, correcting  mistakes in good time, standardizing measures in an appropriate  manner, and deliberately bringing the market economy into the  orbit of standardization and legalization.    The institution of a social insurance system is an  objective requirement of the socialist market economic  development. Without a sound social insurance system, it will be  difficult to bring about unity of efficiency and fairness. In  the course of developing the socialist market economy, Quanzhou  has always taken the institution of a social insurance system as  an important task. In 1986, it started insurance for job  awaiting and retirement for enterprises and, on this basis,  gradually expanded the social insurance business to radiate in  all directions and at deep levels. At present, the city's  insurance business has a coverage of 131 items in three major  categories including the insurance of job awaiting. A total of  1,672 state-owned, collective, and foreign- invested enterprises  have offered unified social retirement insurance to 105,000  personnel, 108,700 staff and workers from 1,248 enterprises  participated in job awaiting insurance, and 12,500 staff and  workers from 313 foreign-invested enterprises participated in  employer responsibility insurance. There are 10 insurance  companies in the city. The social insurance system has  gradually solidified and is advancing in the direction of  socialization and standardization.    Quanzhou's courageous exploration into the direction of the  socialist market economy has initially broken a path for the  development of this economy and, at the same time, remarkably  augmented its economic strength. During the past 14 years from  1978 to 1992, the city's GNP and total industrial and  agricultural output value increased by 5.59 and 7.01 times  respectively and its national income and financial revenues  increased by 5.2 and 11.68 times respectively, showing a yearly  average increase of 14.42, 16.02, 13.92, and 19.89 percent  respectively. The city's GNP quadrupled that of 1978 in 1992.  Since 1993, particularly since the implementation of the  important central measure of intensifying macroeconomic  regulation and control, the city has focused its attention on  expediting development by deepening reform, opening wider to the  outside world, transforming mechanisms, optimizing structures,  and enhancing economic results, with a view to continuously  maintaining the vigorous development momentum in the national  economy. Today, the people throughout the city are full of  confidence in their advance toward the goal of moderate  prosperity by 1995 and the strategic objective of further  quadrupling the GNP by the year 2000.    As a national comprehensive experimental reform and opening  up zone, Fujian has conscientiously summed up the successful  experience obtained in Quanzhou and other localities in  exercising the role of markets. After audacious experiments and  explorations, it should and can accelerate its pace in  establishing the socialist market economic structure. We are  now seriously studying and implementing the guidelines of the  "Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; stepping up formulation of an overall plan  for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure  in the province; concentrating efforts on furthering reform;  expediting the transformation of operational mechanisms;  positively cultivating a unified, open, competitive, and orderly  market system; conscientiously changing government functions;  pushing forward organizational reform; taking proper control of  instituting a legal system and a social insurance system; and  vigorously intensifying the building of spiritual civilization  suited to the socialist market economy, to lay down a solid  foundation for initially establishing the socialist market  economic structure in Fujian by the end of this century.</p>

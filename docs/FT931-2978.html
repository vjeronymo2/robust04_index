			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: S Korea to face chip curbs THE European Commission and the US Commerce Department both acted yesterday to prevent dumping of South Korean-built semiconductor memory chips. In both cases, Korean chip manufacturers were found to have sold Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) chips below fair value. In the US, dumping duties were set at 0.74 per cent to 7.19 per cent with Hyundai facing the highest duties. The EC, however, has secured an agreement on minimum prices from the three leading Korean manufacturers of Dram chips, heading off the threat of extended anti-dumping duties. Goldstar, Hyundai and Samsung have offered undertakings on future minimum prices as part of a new self-policing Korean producers' regime on memory chips, similar to an EC arrangement with Japanese producers. Other Korean producers face anti-dumping duties of 24.7 per cent. Korean industry and trade officials had tried to secure a similar arrangement with the US but were rebuffed. However, the final dumping duties determined by the Commerce Department are far lower than its original estimates, which had ranged from 6 to 87 per cent.</p>

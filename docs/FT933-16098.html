			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Wise men' say recovery will be slow BRITAIN FACES a 'slow and patchy' recovery with demand held back by the prospects of increased taxation, says to the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers. In the panel's first report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the seven economists say subdued growth of money and credit is a 'cause for concern'. Weakness in key export markets in the rest of Europe may also hold back an upturn, says the report. More positively, the panel is relaxed about the prospects for inflation and thinks Britain has a good chance of relatively strong growth without unacceptable price pressures over the next few years. Four out of seven on the group say public spending cuts or tax rises, beyond the tax increases already announced for next April, are needed to curb the rising budget deficit. A majority also says credibility of monetary policy would improve if the government switched responsibility for setting interest rates from the Treasury to the Bank of England, assuming a consensus exists 'on the need for low inflation'. The panel was set up in January as part of a Treasury effort to widen the economic debate. It says 'prospects for recovery remain fragile', partly as a result of high consumer debts and weak house sales. The risk of increased inflation may make it necessary to reduce demand by raising interest rates. On a more bullish note, the full effects of the 4 percentage point cut in interest rates since sterling's devaluation last September 'have yet to be felt'. Economic reforms during the 1980s may have increased labour-market flexibility, increasing productivity and the potential for output gains. The panel says any steps to cut public spending should protect investment. 'Within public spending the balance should be shifted towards those elements which support competitiveness - including education, research and development, training and transport infrastructure,' it says. Prof Tim Congdon, Prof David Currie, Mr Gavyn Davies and Mr Andrew Sentance want a fiscal tightening adding up to about 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product to 'provide greater certainty that the debt position will become sustainable'. The measures could to be phased in over several years. The panel is less pessimistic than the Treasury about the likely gap between government spending and income this financial year. While the Treasury thinks this will be about Pounds 50bn, the average forecast from the advisers is Pounds 45.5bn. The group thinks GDP will grow 1.6 per cent this year, followed by 2.6 per cent in 1994. It reckons the year-on-year change in the retail prices index excluding mortgage payments - the government's chosen measure for underlying inflation - will be 3.3 per cent at the end of next year, comfortably inside the Treasury's 4 per cent target. The group is gloomy about unemployment, thinking this will come down only to 2.5m by 1996, from just under 3m. The majority view expressed in the Treasury report is 'wrong headed', Professor Patrick Minford, one of the study's authors, said yesterday. Prof Minford of Liverpool University, a leading monetarist, is the only one of the seven advisers arguing for an immediate reduction in interest rates from 6 per cent to 5 per cent. He also wants a further 1 percentage point reduction by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lloyd's agents seek more control of capital Leading agencies at Lloyd's of London are examining the creation of a type of corporate investment fund which would give them more control of their capital. Agencies will continue to rely heavily on Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, for the immediate future, but the creation of so-called 'dedicated' funds would make it easier for them eventually to become - in effect - limited liability insurance companies. Unlike the dozen Lloyd's investment trusts created last year, which raised more than Pounds 800m and support a range of agencies and syndicates across the Lloyd's market, the new vehicles would supply capital exclusively to insurance syndicates managed by one particular agent, giving the agent more control. The Hiscox Group, headed by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman, is the only agency so far to have formed a so-called 'dedicated' vehicle, but both Brockbank, an agency which manages one of the market's biggest marine syndicates, and Kiln, another highly rated agency, said they may follow suit. Lawyers and financiers advising Lloyd's businesses on their capital-raising plans say that many other managing agents are now examining this option. Mr Cliff Hampton of Phoenix, the specialist securities house, said that managing agents were becoming more concerned to secure their sources of capital, at a time when another year of large losses at the market is likely to lead to a reduction in the amount of capacity supplied by individual Names. Lloyd's expects to report a loss of more than Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year next week, in accordance with its three-year accounting system. Mr Hampton also said that 'from an investors' point of view there may be more interest in backing a business where they can more closely assess the record of management'. Mr George Stevens, managing director of Brockbank, said: 'Any agent worth his salt is looking into this at the moment.' Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams, a director of Kiln, said: 'More and more people are coming to the conclusion that capital is going to be grouped around managing agents rather than being brought in wholesale. I am sure that this is the way it is going to go.' Interest in this type of structure is likely to lead to pressure on the Stock Exchange to lift its restrictions on listing such vehicles. At present they cannot be listed either because they have no trading record as limited companies, or because their spread of investments is too narrow for them to be awarded investment trust status. Unless the rules are changed, backers could seek to list these funds outside the UK, one agent predicted. Lloyd's suggested last week that Names might at some future point be able to exchange their participations in syndicates for shares in new 'corporate syndicates', which would draw all their capital from the same corporate investor. Mr Stevens said that by the end of the century the market would be dominated by between six and 10 agents, all controlling corporate vehicles. Letters, Page 16</p>

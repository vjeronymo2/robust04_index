			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Aleksandr Shkirando, </F> including recorded remarks by Uzbek President Islam Karimov on  recent visit to Russia, date and place not given; from the  "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Shkirando] It is rather difficult to say something  specific about the results of a visit by the Uzbek president  which has just ended, especially as on the eve of the visit some  kind of nervousness could be felt in Russian-Uzbek relations.  This was caused by the issue of protection of the  Russian-speaking population and also by the fact that Uzbekistan  is, in some way, drawn towards Turkey, Iran and Pakistan.  However, the large package of documents signed in Moscow shows  that Uzbekistan nevertheless wants closer ties with Russia  practically in all spheres.    [Karimov] This is a new step in relations between Russia and  those states which were created after the disintegration of the  Soviet Union. And I want to say that in this Russia acted  honorably.    [Shkirando] The Uzbek leader made some critical remarks  concerning some issues, above all economic problems. It seems  to me that not only the Russian commercial structures should  think about this.    [Karimov] Russia is a great power. It should not lose the  markets which it had on the territory of the former Soviet  Union. If Russian enterprises do not export their production to  these regions, other corporations and companies will come. They  are waiting for just one thing -- to quietly infiltrate these  regions and these markets, and to gain these markets through  credits, sometimes credits given on preferential terms. Who in  this world would give up their positions voluntarily as far as  the markets are concerned?</p>

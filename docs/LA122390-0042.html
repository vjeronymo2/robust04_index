			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: WINDS OF CHANGE BLOW THROUGH L.A'S HARBOR AREA;  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO: EVEN AS FISHING AND CANNING INDUSTRIES HAVE DECLINED, NEW RESIDENTS  HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO COMMUNITY'S LOCATION BY THE SEA.  </P> <P> Bill Olesen was 8-years-old when he arrived by train at San Pedro's waterfront  in 1912.  </P> <P> His eyes sparkle as he recalls the steam locomotive puffing to a halt at the  water's edge on the very spot where the Los Angeles Maritime Museum now stands  and where Olesen now volunteers as harbor historian.  </P> <P> "My mother and I came to join my father who was a lumber ship port captain  here," said the former shipbuilder and commercial fisherman, whose home on  Barton Hill was purchased by his Danish-born parents in 1919.  </P> <P> "San Pedro in those days was a quaint place largely populated by seafaring  immigrants, and I was fascinated with the dockside activity," Olesen said.  </P> <P> The fascination with San Pedro (called simply "Pee-dro" by longtime residents)  holds true as well for newcomers to the seaside community where wood-framed  bungalows and small Spanish and English Tudor homes nestle on the slopes of the  Palos Verdes hills at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, caressed by a  nearly constant on-shore breeze.  </P> <P> Named for St. Peter, the bishop of Alexandria in the 2nd Century, San Pedro is  the end of the Harbor Freeway and about 25 miles from downtown Los Angeles -- a  distance that provides welcome isolation from the urban center for an estimated  76,000 residents.  </P> <P> Karen Lemons, an advertising executive who made a career move from Kansas in  1985, settled in San Pedro because it was where she could afford to buy. She  owns a condo unit in the Vista del Oro area but is now looking for a small,  older home as a way of trading up.  </P> <P> Lemons may have to pay between $250,000 and $400,000 for a house, depending on  location. "I've put my condo on the market, but it's been slow to sell because  the condo market in San Pedro is currently oversupplied," she said.  </P> <P> Her reason for buying another property in San Pedro has now less to do with  affordability and more to do with living in a pleasant environment with its own  individuality.  </P> <P> "San Pedro is a melting pot where you find all kinds of ethnic cultures," she  said. "I like the mixture of architectural styles that you find here and the  fact that the community is built on a hillside and has more view property than  any other beach city in the South Bay area."  </P> <P> The area's history is rich with accounts that date back to 1542 when explorer  Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first entered its bay, and with romantic tales of  mission settlers in the 1700s, of pirates and smugglers who used San Pedro Bay  for illicit trade, and later of catalysts like Phineas Banning, who sparked  early development of the present harbor.  </P> <P> San Pedro, which enjoys the lowest crime rate of any community in the city of  Los Angeles, was incorporated in 1888, but its residents voted for annexation  to Los Angeles in 1909 to facilitate management of the port. Shortly after the  construction of Angel's Gate breakwater in 1912, military protection was added  with the establishment of Ft. MacArthur.  </P> <P> Shipbuilding and canning -- traditional local industries that played a major  role at the turn of the century and through the 1930s -- have declined over the  past two decades. At San Pedro's recent Fisherman's Fiesta, it was apparent  that its commercial fishing fleet had also dwindled dramatically -- from 300 to  30 boats.  </P> <P> Even so, the waterfront remains the domain of real-life fishermen who daily  tend their nets after a night at sea, filling the air with the pungent odor of  freshly caught fish.  </P> <P> At Cabrillo Beach Marina -- the new focus of the community -- idle pleasure  crafts await their weekend sailors, and beyond, cruise ships signal their  tugboat escorts for entry to Worldport L.A., one of the world's busiest  harbors.  </P> <P> Bob Bradarich, the 39-year-old president of the San Pedro Board of Realtors and  owner of RE/MAX Seapoint, grew up in San Pedro during the 1950s and '60s.  </P> <P> "It was a bit different then," he recalled. "It seemed as if every other person  in town was either an uncle or a cousin. The most fun was when my granddad took  us kids sardine fishing. He was a commercial fisherman from Yugoslavia who  settled here in the early 1900s."  </P> <P> Yugoslavs and Italians, fishing families most of them, have been close-knit and  have intermarried, Bradarich said. They still form the bulk of San Pedro's  population mix.  </P> <P> "I'M YUGO," seen on the license plate of a passing car attests to a competitive  pride among groups that make up the ethnic diversity in the community --  Yugoslavs, Italians, Serbo-Croatians, Portuguese, Scandinavians, Russians,  Greeks, Britons and Latinos.  </P> <P> The small homes built by early settlers on the hillside folds above San Pedro  Bay provide the primary source of housing.  </P> <P> Frank (Ray) Falk of Anchor Realty, who's been selling homes in the area for  almost 27 years, has seen housing prices soar in San Pedro. But he adds that if  one compares them with prices for comparable properties in nearby seaside  communities, San Pedro's homes are still affordable.  </P> <P> "One can still find a small home for $180,000 or $190,000, on the northeast  corner of town, even though in some areas, it's gotten a bit ridiculous. But I  believe prices will flatten out," Falk said.  </P> <P> Real estate sales figures for the past 12 months show about a 15% decrease in  property prices.  </P> <P> Another trend seen during the past seven years, has been an onslaught of  condominium construction of three- to 300-unit projects. The reason is that too  many developers rushed in to build apartment projects just before a moratorium  went into effect last year to curb the indiscriminate tearing down of older  homes and landmark buildings.  </P> <P> Rentals in San Pedro range from $750 to $1,200 for two-bedroom condominiums and  $800 to $1,500 for two-bedroom homes.  </P> <P> Marci Petrich, a first-time home buyer as a single parent, recently purchased a  two-bedroom condominium in an area adjoining Rancho Palos Verdes, where units  in her building are priced from $200,000 to $250,000. High-end prices are  usually for hillside properties with views.  </P> <P> "My roots are here, so I can appreciate how the housing picture in San Pedro  has changed," she said. "In 1974, while I was still married, my husband and I  bought a three-bedroom home in the Vista del Oro area for $40,000. That same  house is now worth six times as much."  </P> <P> Florence and Bill Culpert built their home in San Pedro 40 years ago. "The cost  of construction in 1950 was $8 a square foot." said Culpert, a former yacht  broker. "Current building costs now run anywhere from $60 to more than $100 a  square foot."  </P> <P> The Culperts live in the Palisades, a neighborhood once surrounded by Army and  Navy installations. Today, the only remaining military presence at Ft.  MacArthur is the U.S. Air Force, Culpert said.  </P> <P> "When Florence and I moved here, San Pedro was the pits. There were no stores  or restaurants to speak of. People like us moved here because the land values  were so low. San Pedro was never a fashionable place to live, but that too is  changing," Culpert said.  </P> <P> The Palisades, Point Fermin, Southshore and Vista del Oro today are considered  the preferred neighborhoods of San Pedro.  </P> <P> Other identifiable neighborhoods include Vinegar Hill, where an effort is under  way to save post-Victorian homes built during the heyday of that district a  century ago; Barton Hill, one of the earliest residential areas; the Latino  barrio that has developed below Pacific Avenue, and a corridor commonly known  as Shoestring Strip, that links San Pedro to the rest of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Largely untouched by the surge of coastal development in the '60s and '70s, San  Pedro's older business district fell into decay in the 1950s, though in the  past 10 years it has undergone a slow but continual revitalization.  </P> <P> The increased interest by investors in San Pedro's potential for development  has been a matter of concern to members of the San Pedro Bay Historical  Society, who were moved to take inventory of the community's historical and  cultural landmarks after entire blocks in the center of town had been leveled  for redevelopment.  </P> <P> "We have so much history worth protecting," said Flora Baker, a past president  of the group and well-known local historian.  </P> <P> "We don't want to see picturesque or valuable old homes and buildings being  replaced with blocks of condominiums. There has to be some care in where these  projects are built so as not to overshadow the aura of Old San Pedro that is so  precious to our heritage."  </P> <P> Gary and Lynn Larson, owners of the San Pedro Bay Co., and Marylyn Ginsburg, a  former art teacher turned real estate developer, have invested boldly in the  renovation of several older structures.  </P> <P> The 70-year-old Arcade Building on 6th Street, built by an Italian fishing  broker and patterned after a "galleria" in Naples, has been painstakingly  restored by the Larson family and is 100% leased by small businesses.  </P> <P> Ginsburg's Grand House restaurant with its garden patio and adjacent  bed-and-breakfast cottages on Grand Street is another creative example of  adaptive reuse of one of the vintage residences. Both developers have been  singled out for preservation awards by the Los Angeles Conservancy.  </P> <P> Fran and Sam Botwin, 40-year residents of San Pedro, care a great deal about  the quality of life in San Pedro.  </P> <P> "We've been seeing some very positive signs everywhere," said Fran Botwin. "In  my wildest dreams I never thought we'd see a high-rise in this town. But we  have it now (the 11-story Pacific Place office tower), plus several new  hotels," she added.  </P> <P> A new Sheraton Hotel opened in the spring in the Beacon Street area, once the  rough haunt of sailors on leave that now also houses the World Cruise Center,  second only to Miami in passenger ship traffic.  </P> <P> Waterfront attractions are numerous. Ports O'Call Village brings in more than 1  million visitors a year and the new Compri Hotel in the marina will soon be  joined by a 250-room Doubletree Hotel when Phase 2 of Cabrillo Beach Marina is  completed. The expansion, currently under development will add another 2,000  boat slips and three new major restaurants.  </P> <P> Sam Botwin, who is honorary mayor of San Pedro and one of the organizers of the  San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners' Coalition, singled out traffic congestion as  the No. 1 problem for the town:  </P> <P> "We have an increasing number of the people on the Hill (Palos Verdes  Peninsula) who come down through the southern part of town into Western Avenue  to get on to the Harbor Freeway. But with some cooperation, we should be able  to alleviate that problem."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1990 estimate: 77.068  </P> <P> 1980-90 change: 18.5%  </P> <P> Median age: 31.4 years  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: 15,623  </P> <P> Median household: 37,696  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 19.0%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 21.1%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 24.2%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 20.4%  </P> <P> $75,000 +: 15.1%  </P></p>

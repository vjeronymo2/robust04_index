			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Queen mother with tusk disappoints: Saleroom A 'staff god' from Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, submitted for identification at Sotheby's front counter, sold for Pounds 220,000 at the auction house yesterday. The staff is presumed to have been carved before 1820, when missionaries destroyed the local religion. It has a stylised human head and other figures and was probably treated as an object of worship. The price was at the lower end of the estimate. Sotheby's tribal art sale was much concerned with queen mothers, important figures in the culture of what is now Nigeria. The two main lots failed to sell. A 14 1/2 in-high Benin brass memorial head of an Oba (or queen mother), out of which extended a carved ivory tusk more than 5ft long, was bought in at Pounds 85,000. The tusk was created around 1814 as a memorial to Ose by her son, the king Obanosa, even though he had had her executed after she plotted against him. A Benin bronze head of an Oba, dated around 1600, was also unsold at Pounds 90,000. At Christie's an affectionate letter written by Mozart to his wife Constanze in 1789, once owned by the soprano Jenny Lind, sold for Pounds 60,500. The price was above estimate: letters from Mozart to his wife rarely appear at auction. The top price in a musical manuscript sale was the Pounds 297,000 paid for Schubert's working manuscript of his quartet in B flat major written for his family to perform in 1814 when he was 17. Chopin's autograph manuscript of his Grande Valse Brillante was on target at Pounds 60,500, while Beethoven's first jottings for his overture The Consecration of the House made Pounds 33,000. The 50 lots brought in Pounds 612,000 and marked Christie's most successful sale in this market for many years.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Exporters angry at cost of cover THOUSANDS of British jobs are at risk and hundreds of millions of pounds in exports are being lost because of the high cost and limited availability of export credit cover, says a group of leading British exporters. Recent examples include a Pounds 40m contract to build a urea complex in China that will now be bid for by Snamprogetti in Italy instead of the company's Basingstoke subsidiary. That is because an export credit insurance premium of 2.1 per cent was offered by Italy's state insurer compared with the 5.6 per cent premium required by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Exporters are inflamed by a letter from the ECGD this week telling them that 'as a result of recent business success in the (Indonesian) market, ECGD cover is now fully committed and therefore we cannot currently accommodate' cover for more business. The letter arrived days after an intensive and strongly supported export-promotion seminar on Indonesia in London by the Department of Trade and Industry. Evidence was presented this week to the Commons trade and industry committee by a group of 10 leading UK companies active in construction, power plant and engineering. They said the high cost of UK export finance presented exporters with 'one of two unpalatable alternatives: to abandon the business altogether, or to try to move as much work as possible offshore to countries whose export credit authorities are more accommodating'.</p>

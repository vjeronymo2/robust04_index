			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: GA disappointment The third-quarter figures season for the insurance composites ended with a whimper of disappointment as General Accident's results included shock paper losses from its market investments, particularly in the US. The group has invested heavily in US long bonds, the area of government debt hit severely by growing concern over inflation. In spite of underwriting profits up at Pounds 321.6m from Pounds 206.5m previously, GenAcc revealed its investment portfolio had fallen by between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m over the third quarter. Those unrealised losses were primarily responsible for pushing GenAcc's net asset value down to 410p from 545p at the end of last year. And with no news of a Fed Rate rise in market hours to dampen down inflationary concern, the shares were trading at an unsustainable premium of around 38 per cent at the start of business yesterday. They were marked down 19 to 565p by the close. Cable group BICC put on 2 at 355p in heavy 7.4m turnover following a 3m-share agency cross by broker James Capel. Mobile communications group Vodafone added 3 1/2 at 221p as a powerful institutional two-way pull in the shares ahead of next Tuesday's interim results triggered turnover of 14m. Leading diversified industrial group BTR was the second most heavily traded Footsie stock, with 27m shares dealt on the back of a powerful institutional two-way pull. BTR gained 5 1/2 at 311p. Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, put on 3 at 159 1/2 p in turnover of 8.7m, adding to the rise over the past two weeks since joint chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland announced his departure. British Gas jumped 9 to 303 1/2 p ahead of third-quarter figures due today. Turnover in Eurotunnel hit 7.1m shares in Paris - 5.5m more than its nearest rival in the French activity charts - and generated enough excitement to push the stock a further 14 higher in London to 284p. London turnover was 4.1m. The shares have risen by more than 40 per cent in five weeks. BOC added 10 at 720p after the company released full-year results at the high end of analysts' forecasts. Hoare Govett lifted its current year forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 395m and moved from a hold to a buy. Mining group RTZ rose 20 to 859p in the registered shares, with dealers saying Cazenove, which never comments on market talk, had issued a buy note to clients. SmithKline Beecham was restrained initially by news that its acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services was being examined by the Federal Trade Commission. However, the shares recovered to close 6 better at 426p. PowerGen advanced 8 to 559p after a better than expected 26.6 per cent increase in the interim dividend. Many anticipate that PowerGen will announce a share buy-back scheme soon. Sentiment in PowerGen boosted shares in National Power, which reports interim figures tomorrow. The stock appreciated 7 1/2 to 503p. A recommendation by James Capel supported Southern Electricity, which moved forward 5 to 822p. Among drinks stocks, Scottish &amp; Newcastle benefited from a Nomura recommendation, adding 11 at 513p. The Boots buy-back prompted the return of speculation that Great Universal Stores would make a similar move. GUS rose 17 to 571p. Turnover in property group Hammerson jumped to 17m after Smith New Court carried out a bought deal in which it placed a 3.2 per cent stake owned by life assurance group AMP Australia with a variety of institutions. The shares closed 5 off at 341p. Elsewhere in the sector, a sharp increase in interim profits boosted Great Portland Estates 6 to 189p. Unlisted Ramco Energy, which services the petroleum and marine industries, jumped 35 to 255p after announcing that an agreement with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan had been ratified.</p>

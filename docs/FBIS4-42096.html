			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Barzanti, member of the Italian </F> progressives and vice president of the European Parliament, by  Roberto Cassigoli in Florence; date not given: "Barzanti:  `Europe? We Want Solidarity'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA  introduction]    [Text] Florence. The elections for the European Parliament  [EP] seem to coincide with a difficult phase in relations  between Italy and the European Union [EU]. A phase marked by  the concerns that the new majority and the new government have  brought about not only in the EU but also in the single member  states. We discussed this with vice president of the Parliament  in Brussels, Roberto Barzanti, a candidate representing the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] in the European elections.    [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that Italy is drifting away from  Europe?    [Barzanti] This is quite a widespread conviction. We have a  government that appears to relaunch the idea of developing a  hyper-free trade and whose relations with Europe are thought of  as a contract, in market terms only. Instead I think we should  confirm our desire to build a democratic, united, and solid  Europe. In this sense the 1996 deadline that provides for the  revision of the Maastricht Treaty is important. The Parliament  that will be elected will, in fact, have the great  constitutional task of creating a real policy of unity in which  the interests and needs of Italy must have a positive outlet.    [Cassigoli] Competition only at an economic level is not  sufficient then?    [Barzanti] Today a country like Italy can obtain results  only  if Europe is founded on the basis of solidarity, which implies  distributing resources on the basis of territorial imbalances.  A Europe that is not founded on wars of interest or on opposing  areas, but that can rediscover a vocation that is authentically  federal and united in full respect of autonomies and differences.    [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that public opinion is  demonstrating indifference toward elections that seem to count  more because of their internal power relations?    [Barzanti] This is true. Also because of an incorrect  interpretation of the law on proportional representation that  should be reflected with a Parliament in which all the  tendencies of a composite European political panorama are  represented. If these elections and this law are used as a  simple tool for revenge or for numbers as an appendix to the  national political elections, this depreciates European  competition. I am thinking of Berlusconi, for example, who is a  candidate in five constituencies when, as prime minister, he  will not be able to sit at the European Parliament because this  will not be compatible. Evidently a person who is used to  having three television networks and some interests in three  pay-TV networks in addition to supervising three public  nationwide networks, felt the need to present himself in five  constituencies.    [Cassigoli] What relationship could Italian federalism have,  as it is viewed in a national context, with the idea of European  federalism?    [Barzanti] Let us reaffirm the objective of constructing a  federal Europe, even if the inclusion of Norway, Sweden,  Austria, and Finland will probably occur without serious  guarantees of institutional reform, democratization, and  transparency. There is a risk, therefore, of laying claim to a  federal Europe that is looking for an increasingly larger  economic space, but without an efficient government. We cannot  accept this drift. For Europe, federalism is a means of  balancing the autonomy of the single member states and joint  policies. From the Italian point of view federalism has been  carried out in an unfruitful manner. Italy can stay in Europe  if it remains a nation, even though its various autonomous  regions must have their own relations with the European  Community.    [Cassigoli] [European Commission President] Delors' white  paper talks of employment. What relationship is there between  the Italian problem and the promise made by Berlusconi to create  1 million new jobs?    [Barzanti] With the proposal launched in Delors' so-called  White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment Europe  and Italy can achieve important goals. This will certainly not  occur if entrusted to simplistically thaumaturgic concepts or to  old free trade visions, but requires a policy that I would  define as being of the Keynes type. The white paper therefore  does not seem to be in harmony with the affirmations made by  Foreign Minister Martino or the economic ministers in this  government. Of course, the 15 million new jobs forecast in  Europe between now and the year 2000 can be obtained by playing  around with deductions and with an increased market flexibility,  but also by focusing a great deal on training, professional  profiles, innovation, new strategic sectors, the information  society, which are still to come in Italy.    [Cassigoli] Can you give an example?    [Barzanti] Of course. The white paper forecasts 4 million  new jobs in the audiovisual field. If we consider the fact that  a cable system does not even exist here, and that the  technological level of our system is among the most backward in  Europe, we can see how far away we are from this prospect.    [Cassigoli] What will the trends be in scientific research,  an essential field for relations with Europe?    [Barzanti] They are worrying. The EU, and Commissioner  Ruberti himself, have greatly expanded research resources. In  the Fourth European Framework Program, scientific research will  be allocated an overall budget for 1994-98 amounting to ECU12  billion (the figure was only ECU2 billion under the third  program) equivalent to 22 trillion lire. However, the situation  is serious because little is being spent on scientific research  (2 percent of GNP) and because the countries spend too much  singularly. The objective is to reach 3 percent of GNP and to  spend at least 5 percent of this on joint research.    [Cassigoli] Europe is also shocked because a businessman  with  enormous interests in the information sector has become a prime  minister without any rules.    [Barzanti] It is one of the elements that is creating the  most anxiety. It is unthinkable for Hersant or Bertelsmann, the  head of the largest European communications group, or others to  be ministers or prime ministers in France or Germany. It is a  South American-type anomaly or perhaps even worse. To have more  weight in Europe, the person representing the country must be  capable of speaking without any suspicion that he is defending  his personal interests.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Strong April at Bangkok Bank Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial bank, has taken the unusual step of issuing a four-month financial report soon after reporting an unusual decline in first-quarter earnings. The latest report shows a 12 per cent advance in net profits against a year ago. Bangkok was the only one of Thailand's leading banks to report a decline in first-quarter net profits, down 5 per cent at Bt3.45bn (Dollars 136.7m). 'We think they wanted to set the record straight, having lost face with their first-quarter results. They seem to have had a colossal April,' said HG Asia's country manager, Mr George Morgan. The quarterly profits fall was blamed partly on the fact that Bt1.5bn of unaccrued interest receivables were injected into the first-quarter 1993 result. The bank's executive vice-chairman, Mr Damrong Krishnamara, said net profits for the first four months of this year were Bt5.5bn, compared with Bt4.87bn a year ago. This shows the bank made profits of Bt1.92bn in April alone, representing 65 per cent year-on-year growth for that month. It suggests the bulk of Bt806m in unaccrued interest receivable from a motorway contract was taken in April. Mr Damrong said the bank's total deposits were 10.2 per cent higher than a year ago, at Bt568.3bn, at the end of April. Early this year, the bank's president, Mr Vichit Surapongchai - number four in the bank's decision-making hierarchy - left suddenly.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> GRETZKY IS THE SPARK IN CAMPBELL'S 9-5 WIN;  </P> <P> KING CENTER IS SELECTED MVP ON HIS OLD ICE  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky was nervous before the National Hockey League All-Star game  Tuesday night. It was his ninth All-Star game, but it was special. Not like  those games of the past, the games he played for fun.  </P> <P> This game was being played in the Northlands Coliseum, on the ice that was his  during 10 years with the Edmonton Oilers. This game was being played before a  sellout crowd of 17,503 that rocked the building with a stirring ovation when  he was introduced.  </P> <P> This game gave him a rare chance to play on the same line again with his old  Oiler teammate Jari Kurri. With Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr in the net. With Oiler  defenseman Kevin Lowe on the team. With Oiler Coach Glen Sather behind the  bench.  </P> <P> Gretzky really wanted to win this game.  </P> <P> So he did. He charged the Campbell Conference team with the same kind of spark  he has used to jolt the Kings to life this season.  </P> <P> Just like old times, he and Kurri raced down the ice to combine for a goal with  a little over a minute played in the game. And the Campbell Conference was on  its way to a 9-5 victory over the Wales Conference.  </P> <P> The crowd went wild when Gretzky skated up the right side and slid the puck  across to Kurri on the left side, and Kurri put the puck in behind goalie Sean  Burke of the New Jersey Devils.  </P> <P> Gretzky scored the second goal himself at 4:33, picking up the puck that fellow  King Steve Duchesne had floated in front of the goal for him. Gretzky put his  stick down to stop the puck in his path to the left of the goal, then quickly  scooped it around to the right of Burke.  </P> <P> There was no mistaking the pure joy Gretzky felt at pleasing this crowd again.  </P> <P> And when he was named most valuable player of the game, he was moved. It had  not been an automatic choice. As Gretzky pointed out: "No one player dominated  the game."  </P> <P> Gretzky had a goal and two assists. Joe Mullen of Calgary had two goals and an  assist. Jimmy Carson of the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Mark Messier of  the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Luc Robitaille of the Kings had a goal and  an assist. Kurri had a goal and an assist. Gary Leeman of Toronto had a goal  and an assist. Duchesne had two assists.  </P> <P> For the Wales Conference, Walt Poddubny had two goals.  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer and the man who stole this show a year  ago with six points for the Wales Conference, had just one assist and really  wasn't a factor.  </P> <P> Maybe he will be next year, when the game is played on his home ice at  Pittsburgh. This night belonged to Gretzky.  </P> <P> Gretzky figures that having the crowd behind him was worth a couple of votes,  at least, for the MVP honor.  </P> <P> "I had a great time tonight," he said. "I don't think I stopped smiling all  night."  </P> <P> Explaining that it felt just like old times, he said: "I don't think it really  hit me that I'd been traded until after the first period tonight."  </P> <P> Yes, he admitted, he said that with a touch of longing.  </P> <P> "I've never denied that I miss Edmonton," Gretzky said. "I've never denied that  I miss my teammates. I won't ever deny that. We won four championships in five  years. We grew up from being a bunch of kids to being the best in the league. I  miss them a lot.  </P> <P> "But I'm in a situation now with an owner (Bruce McNall) who is just  outstanding, and I'm with a fine organization. Maybe we can build something  there. I'd like to do that for him.  </P> <P> "It would have been easy to sit back here, maybe even win another two or three  Stanley Cups. But I'm also enjoying the pressure and the challenge that I have  now."  </P> <P> On this night, though, he relived some of the old glory and allowed himself to  show the emotion he feels for the players he misses.  </P> <P> "Ten or 20 years from now, when I look back on my career, there will be times  that stand out," Gretzky said. "The first time that I was back here with the  Kings is a time I'll always remember. Tonight will be extra special. . . . I  think I'll go home and watch the tape."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in the Campbell Conference's locker room, there were a lot of other  guys who didn't stop smiling all night.  </P> <P> Sather was, of course, very pleased to coach his first All-Star victory. He was  0-4 before Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Duchesne was happy for Gretzky and thrilled with the victory.  </P> <P> "Ecstatic," said the French-Canadian defenseman. "I'm ecstatic. Ecstatic.  That's a new word I learned today. That means very, very happy. That's what I  am. Ecstatic. I learned it from watching TV today. I'm ecstatic and everyone in  this room is ecstatic."  </P> <P> Getting a little more specific, Duchesne said that he was ecstatic to get the  assist on Gretzky's goal.  </P> <P> The game wasn't wrapped up at that point, though. The Wales Conference tied it  on goals by Cam Neely of Boston and Poddubny of Quebec before the end of the  first period.  </P> <P> Then the Wales Conference went up, 3-2, just 1:16 into the second period on a  goal by Glen Wesley of Boston. But the Campbell Conference scored three  straight for a 5-3 lead at the end of the second period.  </P> <P> It was 3-3 when both teams changed goalies at the game's midpoint (Rejean  Lemelin of Boston relieving Burke and Mike Vernon of Calgary relieving Fuhr),  and then Steve Yzerman of Detroit and Leeman scored just 14 seconds apart.  </P> <P> Poddubny scored his second goal of the night early in the third period to cut  the lead to 5-4, and Mullen answered with his second to make it 6-4. Then Mike  Ridley of Washington scored the last goal for the Wales Conference before  Robitaille, Carson and Messier ran up the score.  </P> <P> NHL All-Star Notes  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky said that he would give the car he won for being named most  valuable player of the game to a former Oiler teammate, Dave Semenko. "I think  the car should stay here in Edmonton," he said. "Dave was one of the guys who  really helped me in my career." . . . With his goal in the first period,  Gretzky tied Gordie Howe's All-Star career record of 10 goals. Howe scored his  10 in 23 games. Gretzky has scored 10 in nine games. . . . The Campbell  Conference's nine goals tied the All-Star record for most goals by one team in  a game, set by the Campbell Conference in a 9-3 victory in 1983. And the 14  goals set a record for most goals by both teams, breaking the record of 13 set  in the Wales Conference's 7-6 victory in 1984.  </P> <P> The Edmonton Oilers announced Tuesday night that they have acquired right  winger Dave Brown from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for center Keith  Acton and a future draft pick. Brown, 26, has played all five years with the  Flyers. He has three assists and 100 penalty minutes in 50 games this season.  </P></p>

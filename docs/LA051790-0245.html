			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JOHNNY CASH SLAMS HATE HUMOR  </P> <P> Country music singer Johnny Cash wrote a letter to the editor saying he's  worried about what he called obscene, violent, racist and sexist humor favored  by some new comedians.  </P> <P> The deep-voiced singer known for such hits as "I Walk the Line" and "A Boy  Named Sue," said in the letter published today in the Tennessean that children  are getting the wrong idea about what is funny.  </P> <P> He lamented the influence "anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-immigrant jokes,  obscenities directed at all women in general and the desecration of traditional  values will have upon the young minds in this country."  </P> <P> Cash wrote in response to last week's appearance of comic Andrew Dice Clay on  NBC's "Saturday Night Live." Clay has been criticized for his coarse humor,  which includes comments that disparage women and homosexuals.  </P> <P> Cash said he didn't see the program, but was alarmed about such humor in  general.  </P> <P> "There is an undercurrent of violence in this new obscenity," Cash wrote. "It  will shatter the hopes and dreams of many who hoped and prayed and worked for  brotherhood and racial tolerance."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E WITHDRAWS FROM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, upset by the Greater San Diego Chamber of  Commerce's active opposition to the utility's proposed merger with Southern  California Edison, will not renew its long-running membership in the business  and civic group, SDG&amp;E's chief operating officer said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Opposition to the merger, which SDG&amp;E officials believe will benefit San  Diego's business community, is "inconsistent with the chamber's goal of  supporting causes that enhance the economic well-being of this city and  county," Jack E. Thomas said. The chamber's steadfast and highly public  opposition to the merger makes it "awkward" for SDG&amp;E to remain in the  organization.  </P> <P> Chamber President Lee Grissom said SDG&amp;E has been a "very good and  supportive member of the chamber" since joining in 1913.  </P> <P> "While the withdrawal disappoints us, it was not a surprise," Grissom said. "It  was one of the considerations we had to (weigh) when we made the decision to  take an opposing position to the Edison merger."  </P> <P> Grissom described SDG&amp;E's decision to leave the chamber as proof that  Rosemead-based Edison has largely taken control of the local utility. Since the  merger surfaced, local utility managers have "done a corporate Chernobyl,"  Grissom said. "They just melted down inside."  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E's absence will help to strengthen the chamber's opposition to the  proposed merger, Grissom said. The chamber won't be hurt financially by  SDG&amp;E's withdrawal because several chamber members have already volunteered  to donate the equivalent of SDG&amp;E's dues, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E would  have been assessed $23,000 in corporate dues for 1990.  </P> <P> The chamber had a $2.7-million budget during 1989, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E's  dues were equivalent to about two weeks' worth of the chamber's payroll,  Grissom said.  </P> <P> He maintained that SDG&amp;E's management is out of step with the mainstream  San Diego business community on the merger issue. According to results of a  September poll authorized by the chamber, 56% of its members oppose the merger  and 11% favor it. The remainder are undecided, according to the poll.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E's withdrawal from the chamber, "if anything, puts starch into our  resolve," Grissom said. "It makes us stronger than before."  </P> <P> Thomas, who will leave the chamber board of directors at the end of this year,  maintained that SDG&amp;E "doesn't have a war with the chamber. . . . We intend  to maintain a strong position in the business community with organizations that  share our vision of the future."  </P> <P> "While we respectfully acknowledge the stand the chamber has taken, we in good  conscience cannot support it," Thomas said in a letter Tuesday to Pat Crowell,  the chamber's chairman-elect. "The chamber should be, as it always has been,  allied with SDG&amp;E. But it is not."  </P> <P> "This is an interesting estrangement, in all honesty," Grissom said. "It's not  a personal issue, because I have great respect for (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom  Page. And we just reinvited (SDG&amp;E board member) Clair Burgener to be on  our board. So it's not a personal issue."  </P></p>

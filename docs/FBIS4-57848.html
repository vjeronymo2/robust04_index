			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 24 May.    Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas has  reported that the Inter-American Development Bank has formally  notified the Panamanian Government that it has complied with all  requirements for the first disbursement of a $180 million loan.  The funds will be used to repair and build roads. A delegation  from the Planning and Health Ministries is also in Washington  negotiating a $25 million loan from the World Bank for the  health sector. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 1)    In the first four months of the year, the Panama City  Construction and Projects Department issued 940 permits for 99  million balboas worth of projects, compared to 854 permits for  64 million balboas worth of projects in 1993. This amounts to a  more than 34 million balboa increase in construction  investments. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 22 May 94 p 6)</p>

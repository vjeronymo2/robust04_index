			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Personal View: Myths of the British labour market Much of the discussion relating to unemployment in the UK places heavy emphasis on the growth in part-time, temporary, service-sector and female employment. The popular argument is that 'good' jobs (well paid and full time) are being replaced by 'bad' jobs (low paid and part time) and that unskilled men in particular are put at a disadvantage by these trends. Many observers have argued that men without significant educational qualifications could in the past secure full-time manual jobs at reasonable levels of pay, but that the demand for such employment has declined sharply. Employment growth has come in either professional or managerial occupations, which demand significant educational qualifications, or in lower-level service jobs, which demand few skills or qualifications but which are low paid and often part time. In general, there is a worry that economic recovery will fail to benefit many disadvantaged groups in the labour market. Much of this debate is based on false assumptions. Either the purported trends are not taking place at all or have been ongoing over the whole post-second world war period. Consider the following 10 facts which the data* do establish: 1) Women have been entering the labour force and increasing their share of employment at a steady rate for more than 40 years. Female labour force participation rose fastest in the 1960s. 2) Part-time work in the UK has also been on an upward trend for more than 40 years and in the last decade grew more slowly than in the previous three decades. 3) There is no evidence at all that temporary employment is increasing in importance. 4) Unemployment rates for men and women were very similar during the 1980s. Only after 1990 did male unemployment increase sharply relative to female unemployment. This was due mainly to a sharp fall in male self-employment during the Major recession. 5) Unemployment among young people and the ethnic minorities is very sensitive to the cycle: unemployment for these groups rises most sharply in recessions but falls most sharply in recoveries. 6) The long-term unemployed appeared to benefit at least proportionately from the Lawson boom in the late 1980s, even taking into account the effects of programmes like Restart. 7) The relative labour market position of less well-qualified men did not deteriorate sharply when looking at the whole period 1979-93. 8) The proportion of manual jobs has been declining for four decades, but the decline for both men and women did pick up in the 1980s. 9) These jobs are being supplanted in importance by generally high-paid, high-skill, professional and managerial jobs. 10) The proportion of low-paid, low-skill, service-sector jobs is not increasing. These last three facts are replicated in the US labour market. The US economy has not been disproportionately creating low-paid, low-skill, service-sector jobs; it is high-skill, professional and managerial jobs that have been generated. So one explanation for the US having a lower unemployment rate than Britain in the last 10 years - that the harsh American benefits system forces people to take the jobs which are mainly being created in establishments like McDonald's - is not borne out by the evidence. This suggests the UK welfare state does not need to be dismantled in order to generate lower unemployment, though the details of how the tax and benefits system could be improved should continue to be examined to enhance employment opportunities. The strong growth of professional and managerial employment puts the focus on whether the British education system is producing enough qualified manpower. The answer, at least since the late 1980s, seems to be yes. Between 1988 and 1993 the enrolment rate for young people into higher education in Britain doubled from 15 to 31 per cent. Through the 1990s this ought to ensure that plenty of qualified manpower is available to meet the needs of the UK labour market. So why is UK unemployment so high? It is not because of the changing nature of the jobs on offer, but is the consequence of an absolute shortage of jobs. The growth in employment has been held back by tight macroeconomic policy, conditioned by fear of inflation. Changes in the institutions of pay bargaining, including greater decentralisation and the abolition of incomes policy in the private sector, have probably contributed most to the worsening of the inflation constraint on employment growth. This, then, is the irony. Labour market deregulation has exacerbated the free-for-all in pay bargaining and, alongside tight financial policies, this has left Britain with high levels of unemployment as the price for containing inflation. The key problem facing the British economy is that of ensuring that steady growth in aggregate demand and employment is not brought to a halt by fear of an accelerating spiral of pay and prices. We should not be diverted from this debate by a focus on trends in the structure of employment or unemployment which are either not occurring or have been occurring for decades.

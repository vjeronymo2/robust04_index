			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: REQUIEM FOR AN ABSENTEE  </P> <P> The guy spends entirely too much of his life on the road, and on this  particular night he found himself waiting backstage in an ornate old theater,  checking his watch every few minutes and tapping his right foot on the wooden  floor, waiting to make his speech.  </P> <P> He does this a lot -- flies into an unfamiliar town, makes a speech, then flies  out in the morning -- and he has gotten the routine down pretty well. If it's  an evening speech, like tonight's, he rests at the hotel in the afternoon,  skips dinner to avoid a jumpy stomach, has some room service afterward and gets  the first flight out the next day.  </P> <P> Usually the speeches are in stark convention centers or soulless meeting rooms;  tonight the speech is scheduled for this grand old movie palace. If he had to  guess, he would say that the movie house was built in the 1920s. Its ceiling is  high, and there is intricate painting and detail work up near the balcony. He  can peek between the heavy curtains and see the audience arriving; the movie  palace has been refurbished -- repainted and re-upholstered -- so it is nearly  as beautiful as when it was new.  </P> <P> "We almost lost this place," someone had told him. During the '60s and '70s,  the person had explained, the theater had been allowed to become decrepit. At  the time, no one thought there would ever again be a need for a grand old  downtown movie palace. Just when things looked the worst, though, a committee  had been formed, money had been raised and the theater had been saved --  resurrected not for the display of new movies such as the ones in mall  multiplexes, but for concerts and speeches and civic events. The theater once  again was the architectural pride of the town.  </P> <P> "The last movie they showed here before we knew we had to save the theater. .  ." the man from the town started to say. . . .  </P> <P> The guy who would be making the speech knew how the sentence was going to end.  </P> <P> "The last movie they showed here before we knew we had to save the theater was  'Deep Throat,' " the man from the town said. "That just seemed too sad."  </P> <P> Which made sense. For some reason, it seems that every grand old movie palace  in every American downtown had been reduced to "Deep Throat" before the civic  leaders had decided to rescue it. The guy who would be making the speech  thought that the saving of all the old movie palaces in all the old downtowns  was a fine thing -- and this old theater was especially lovely.  </P> <P> The guy wandered around the backstage area. There were ropes and sandbags and  metal stairs, like remnants from vaudeville. And, back near the dressing rooms,  there were photographs hanging on the walls.  </P> <P> The photos -- autographed -- were from the performers who had appeared on this  stage in the years since the theater had been saved. The guy looked at the  glossies: Chuck Mangione, Bill Cosby, Charlie Daniels, Tammy Wynette, Itzhak  Perlman, Eddie Rabbitt. The juxtaposition of some of the photos made him smile  -- there was a photo of the Ohio Express, and there was a photo of the Vienna  Choir Boys -- and some made him wonder. There was a photo of Bob Hope, for  example. The guy thought: What inner drive, at this point in Bob Hope's life,  keeps him on the road, brings him backstage to old movie palaces, perhaps makes  him look at his watch in the moments before going on?  </P> <P> All these people in the glossy photos -- they spend so much of their lives on  the road, away from their homes and families, performing for strangers, then  moving on to perform for more strangers the next night instead of sleeping in  their own beds. There was once a haunting song written about this very thing,  with a short but memorable refrain: "God bless the absentee."  </P> <P> The guy overheard some people talking. They were students in the local high  school's jazz orchestra, who would be providing music to open the program. One  of the students, looking at the photos, said: "Is Dizzy Gillespie still alive?"  Someone said, "I think he may be dead." And someone else: "No, he's alive.  Count Basie is dead."  </P> <P> The guy who would be making the speech stood in the wings. Out front, the  audience was still arriving. A man named Fred Lewis was playing the old movie  palace's "Mighty Wurlitzer" organ. Fred Lewis would play and then the jazz  orchestra would play and then the guy would step in front of strangers and make  his speech. God bless the absentee, he thought, looking at his watch one more  time.  </P></p>

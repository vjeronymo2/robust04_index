			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Bonds: GECC's return to D-Mark sector brightens dull day Renewed downward pressure on European government bond markets restricted the volume of new issues in the eurobond market yesterday. Among the day's meagre offerings was GECC's first appearance in the D-Mark sector since December 1992. It raised DM250m through an issue of five-year eurobonds. Lead manager SBC Frankfurt said the bonds were mainly targeted at cash-rich investors in Switzerland and the Benelux region, since the higher yields on offer in the German domestic bond market limited their appeal to investors there. GECC is believed to have swapped the proceeds of the offering into fixed-rate dollars. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 20 basis points over the Treuhand's 5 3/4 per cent notes due 1999, was thought to be fair. However, syndicate managers said the fall in German government bonds caused some problems during the launch. In the afternoon, the bonds were trading around 99.70, down from a re-offer price of 99.77, while the spread widened slightly to just over 21 basis points. GECC's deal follows a similar offering from Rabobank last Friday, via CS First Boston, which was also targeted at Swiss retail investors, who face heavy D-Mark redemptions in the next few months. Rabobank's five-year bonds were launched at a yield spread of 17 basis points, but were trading at a spread of 21 basis points yesterday, partly reflecting the market's weakness. Argentina is due to launch its widely-expected D-Mark offering today or tomorrow, via Deutsche Bank. The three-year issue is likely to raise around DM500m. Syndicate managers involved in the offering reported good demand for the deal which, they said, was unlikely to be adversely affected by any further futures-driven weakness in the bund market. The stream of euroguilder issues continued yesterday with the launch of a Fl 250m offering of nine-year bonds from NIO, the Dutch government-guaranteed development aid agency. Lead manager Nibstrating Financial Markets said the unusual maturity partly reflected the over-hang of 10-year paper in the market. The bonds, which were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 6 1/4 per cent Dutch government bond due 2003, were placed mainly with Dutch investors. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened out slightly to 22 basis points. Vaesteraas, Sweden's sixth-largest city and the home of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group, raised Dollars 50m through an offering of five-year floating rate notes. The discounted margin on the notes was 26 basis points over Libor at the launch, which narrowed to 25 basis points when the notes were freed to trade. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the notes were sold mainly to investors in Belgium, though there was also some interest from Sweden and the UK. It is believed the proceeds of the offering were swapped into floating-rate Swedish kronor. Standard &amp; Poor's has revised the outlook on its A-plus implied long-term rating on the Republic of Korea, to negative from positive. The outlook revision has been prompted by the heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula as North Korea refuses to comply with demands for inspection of its nuclear facilities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The controversy among Socialists continues and  Armando Vara, a Socialist Party leader, has contributed to  fanning the flames. He is the author of newspaper commentary in  DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. He believes that President Mario Soares is  acting as an opposition force and not as an organ of  sovereignty. His opinion mirrors that of Jorge Lacao.    [Correspondent Sandra Sousa] Jorge Lacao's criticism of  President Soares has inflamed the Socialist rank and file, who  immediately shied away from the stand taken by this  distinguished member of the party's national secretariat.  Armando Vara, a socialist leader, however, fanned the flames of  this controversy. In an article published today in DIARIO DE  NOTICIAS, Armando Vara says President Soares is acting not as an  organ of sovereignty but as an opposition force. He says that  in this way, Soares is diminishing the role of the Socialist  Party. Without beating about the bush, he said it is legitimate  for the Socialist Party to feel its territory has been invaded.  And just like Jorge Lacao, he asked the president to let them  work.    [Announcer] Socialist Party Secretary General Antonio  Guterres continues to distance himself from this controvery.  Guterres, who declined to react publicly to Jorge Lacao's  article, is doing the same with regard to Armando Vara's  article. [passage omitted]</p>

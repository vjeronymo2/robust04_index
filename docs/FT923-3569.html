			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Bush sets 'agenda for American renewal' PRESIDENT George Bush claimed yesterday that a 1 percentage point across-the-board reduction in US personal income taxes was achievable if Congress agreed to his proposed cap on mandated federal spending. Presenting in a speech in Detroit what he called his 'agenda for American renewal', Mr Bush acknowledged that the country felt 'uneasiness' about the current state of the economy. The answer, he insisted, lay in 'the power of regeneration' inherent in individual initiative and the benefits of a freely trading global economy. What he branded as 'the mirage' fostered by Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, that government should accumulate capital and redistribute it, was no solution. Mr Clinton promptly dismissed Mr Bush's plan as 'really just more of the same' in its promises of large tax cuts for the wealthy (Dollars 14,000 for someone on Dollars 200,000 a year) and little for anybody else. He said it would mean a bigger deficit and lower growth. Mr Bush's speech mostly consisted of a recitation of existing policy proposals, with two or three new twists - including an aim to reach trade agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, an offer to cut the White House budget by one third if Congress did the same and a recommended 5 per cent pay cut for all federal employees earning more than Dollars 75,000 a year. It was intended to lay out an economic and social programme for a second term to combat what is widely seen as the weakest element in his bid for re-election. Wall Street stocks rose sharply as some investors drew comfort from the speech. the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.77 points at 3,305.16. But the speech's impact may have been diluted only hours before Mr Bush delivered it as the White House sought to play down his own commitment of the day before not to raise taxes again 'ever, ever'. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this 'wasn't a pledge' never again to raise taxes, but only to acknowledge he made a mistake in accepting the 1990 tax increase. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the democrats' chief spokesman, pointed out that if Mr Bush's notorious promise of 1988 - 'read my lips, no new taxes' - was null and void his new commitment could hardly be taken seriously.

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FYI: THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN  </P> <P> Have you seen "The Guys?" They're little face sculptures by L.A.  artist-turned-jewelry designer Robert Lahaye. In brushed gold or antiqued  silver with tie-tack backs, they are seen in the best company.  </P> <P> Janet Jackson wears them all over a vest in her "Miss You Much" music video.  They cover a bustier worn by Gloria Estefan. But "The Guys," with names like  Tiki, Spike, Ziggy and Razor, aren't just for girls. Rod Stewart wears all  seven of them on his lapel. The collection of tiny faces, each less than an  inch wide or an inch high, looks good grouped together on a jacket shoulder.  Individually the pins can be tie-tacks or lapel pins. Each one is signed by the  artist. At $25, they are a way to begin collecting Lahaye art. They are  available at Ice in the Beverly Center and at Fred Segal, Santa Monica. JOANNA  DENDEL  </P></p>

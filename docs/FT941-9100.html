			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Kop posts third consecutive loss Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, reported its third consecutive annual loss yesterday and said it was set to remain in the red in 1994. However, it said it was past the worst of its difficulties and should be back in profit next year. The 1993 pre-tax deficit fell to FM2.66bn (Dollars 484m) from FM3.66bn a year earlier due to higher income and a drop in lending write-offs. The group would have met its target of halving the 1992 loss but for a FM900m provision to cover future risks in the Finnish corporate sector. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, Kop chief executive, warned there would be no instant improvement in the bank's figures in 1994 because bad loan volumes were still high. 'This year we cannot realistically expect a return to profitability, but the situation is much more under control than last year,' he stated. The 1993 performance benefited from a 21 per cent increase in income to FM4.89bn and a 32 per cent drop in credit losses to FM2.91bn.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Successful auction spurs US prices US Treasury prices rose sharply across the board yesterday following an unexpectedly successful auction of 30-year securities. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105 13/32 , yielding 7.176 per cent, a substantial turnround from earlier in the day when the 30-year issue had been  3/16 lower. Prices at the short end of the market also received a substantial boost from the auction, with the two-year note up  3/16 at 100 1/8 to yield 4.166 per cent. After Wednesday's unexpectedly poor 10-year auction, dealers and investors began the day in a cautious mood, wary of getting caught by a disappointing 30-year sale. Consequently, prices at the long end of the market were lower until midday as participants held off until after the sale. The auction, however, subsequently proved to be a big success, with the bid-to-cover ratio (the measure of demand) on the 30-year issue coming in strongly at 2.63:1, the highest since November 1987. The new securities were eventually tendered at an average yield of 7.22 per cent, which was also the highest yield at which the securities were awarded to bidders. UK government bonds fell up to half a point yesterday on sterling weakness, inflation worries and fears that further interest rate cuts may be delayed. Long-dated gilts fell half a point, while short-dated paper lost a quarter point yesterday. Dealers said market sentiment was not helped by comments from Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, who warned against further cuts in interest rates. The March gilt futures contract settled  9/16 down at 100 15/16 on volume of 43,328 lots. ITALIAN government bonds experienced another volatile day as rumours circulated in the market that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato was under investigation on corruption charges. The bond market started on a strong note, gaining about three-quarters of a point, but then tumbled as the rumours circulated, although they were later denied. Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, was forced to resign on Wednesday when it emerged that he was under investigation. On Liffe, the March BTP contract ended 20 basis points down at 95.60. ELSEWHERE in Europe, German government bonds edged higher after trading in a narrow range. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 93.31 and traded between 93.28-93.48 before ending at around 93.42. Spanish government bonds ended little changed, but dealers said attention would be focused on today's repurchase tender to see whether there was an easing in interest rates. JAPANESE government bonds rose in London trading as the yen strengthened against the US dollar. Although the Tokyo market was closed for National Foundation Day, bond prices climbed in London trading with the yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moving from 4.235 per cent to end at around 4.215 per cent.</p>

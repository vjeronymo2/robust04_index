			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- A meeting between the  Slovak and Hungarian environment ministers which included  discussion of the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project ended without  concrete results today.    On the controversial subject of the division of the Danube  waters, Slovak Environment Minister Juraj Hrasko said he and his  Hungarian counterpart Janos Gyurko had agreed to recommend that  their governments prepare themselves to discuss the approval of  a political decision.    "We did not bind ourselves to any conclusions. However, we  both said the tone of the meeting was much friendlier than in  the past," Hrasko said, adding that he was ready to continue  negotiations with the aim of improving the state of the drying  out branches of the Danube.    Hrasko confirmed that in the dispute over the dividing of  the  Danube waters between the old river course and the Gabcikovo  canal he had proposed negotiations without the participation of  experts from the European Union (EU), but declined to give  further details.    Gyurko, however, rejected the offer of bilateral  negotiations, thus sticking to Hungary's demand that talks take  place with the participation of EU experts. However, he  appreciated the change for the better in the atmosphere of the  negotiations. If the Slovaks were to send more water into the  old course than before -- and this would mean a fall in the  output of electricity from Gabcikovo -- the Hungarians would  support any request made of Slovakia by a third party for  compensation for these losses.    "We were assured that no standpoint from the Hungarian  Parliament or Government had to be definitive in the search for  an agreement," said Hrasko, who used to be chairman of the  parliamentary committee for Gabcikovo.    "A mare is never sold at a market for the asking price, but  nor is the first offer paid," he added.    The compromise proposal by Western experts on the division  of  the Danube waters was approved conditionally by Hungary, but  Slovakia rejected it. However, the Hungarian Parliament then  went against the recommendations of both the experts and its own  government, and decided that the drying out branch of the Danube  would be supplied with water by pumps, not by the building of a  dam.    Nonetheless, Hungary recently invited Slovakia to resume  talks forthwith, to which Slovakia replied that it was still  prepared to negotiate.    Hrasko said today's talks also concerned broader issues of  cooperation in environmental protection and improving the  quality of contacts between the two countries. Concretely, they  discussed the creation of a joint national park on the border  area and an agreement on a common approach to the pollution of  waters.</p>

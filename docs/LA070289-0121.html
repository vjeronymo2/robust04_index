			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HAIR RESTORER FALLS SHORT OF MARKETING HOPES  </P> <P> When Rogaine was unveiled last September by the Upjohn Co. as the first  scientifically proven hair-loss remedy, financial analysts envisioned desperate  balding men running to doctors for prescriptions.  </P> <P> Today, those analysts and many consumers are disappointed, and Upjohn is  preparing a new, more aggressive marketing campaign aimed at men whose  embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss may have prevented them from  trying the drug.  </P> <P> Upjohn says it is pleased with Rogaine's performance and blames drug industry  analysts -- some of whom predicted that 1989 U.S. sales would top $300 million  -- for unrealistic expectations.  </P> <P> "Any new product that saw the sales that Rogaine did in the first few months  would be deemed an outstanding success," said Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett.  "We expected to succeed in the long run, while the analysts thought it would be  a runaway success."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unrealistic Expectations  </P> <P> Disappointed consumers also may have set unrealistic expectations by ignoring  Upjohn's warnings that Rogaine would not work for most men.  </P> <P> Although Upjohn does not release sales figures for specific products, drug  industry analyst Ronald Nordmann of Paine Webber Inc. estimated that domestic  sales for Rogaine accounted for $11 million of the Kalamazoo-based company's  $755 million in net sales for the first three months of 1989.  </P> <P> While Rogaine's sales were more than double those for the fourth quarter of  1988, Nordmann said he interpreted the figures as disappointing.  </P> <P> "The product has certainly been slow out of the starting gate," he said.  </P> <P> There are many reasons for Rogaine's sluggish sales, researchers and hair-loss  specialists say. Among them:  </P> <P> * Upjohn's 8-month-old, $20 million advertising campaign, featuring a man  walking along a beach with the "see your doctor" phrase, may have been too  low-key and vague.  </P> <P> * The price, about $50 for a one-month supply and the necessary lifelong  commitment to its use.  </P> <P> Once you stop using Rogaine, any hair you may have grown back will fall out. If  the drug has stopped your hair loss, you will make up for lost time as soon as  you quit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baffling Result  </P> <P> Most baffling, however, is that companies featuring bogus baldness remedies on  late-night television continue to outsell Rogaine by a ratio of about 10 to 1,  said Mike Mahoney, president of the American Hair Loss Council.  </P> <P> "The biggest deterrent to Rogaine is that the man has to go to his doctor and  admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss. With the others, he can  call an 800 number from the privacy of his own home," said Mahoney, whose  nonprofit organization provides consumer information on hair-loss treatments.  </P> <P> Upjohn's new marketing campaign, beginning in mid-May, will feature a toll-free  number. The consumer will be connected with a hair-care specialist to discuss  Rogaine and then will receive information on Rogaine via mail.  </P> <P> Like the previous ads, Upjohn's still will not refer to the drug by name. U.S.  Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit companies from advertising  prescription drugs by name unless there also is a full disclosure of any  warnings and potential side effects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Release Few Details  </P> <P> The company has released few details about its new marketing strategy, but says  it is designed to identify and target the market for the drug, which was  approved by the FDA last August.  </P> <P> Though analysts see the new campaign as Upjohn's reaction to slow sales, the  company insisted that the more aggressive campaign always was part of its  marketing strategy.  </P> <P> Some of the blame for disappointment with Rogaine's results also lies with the  consumer, who may have been expecting too much. Upjohn warned consumers from  the start that the tonic would not work at all for most men.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cite Limitations  </P> <P> Rogaine, the trade name for a substance called minoxidil, is recommended for  men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for 10 years or less and who have  an area of baldness 4 inches in diameter or less on the crown of the head.  </P> <P> Clinical trials showed that about 39% of men suffering from male-pattern  baldness will either grow some new hair or stop losing hair after six to eight  months on the drug.  </P> <P> "If you're going to use this stuff, you've got to be patient and use it for a  year," said Dr. David Whiting, medical director of the Baylor (University) Hair  Research and Treatment Center in Dallas. "Otherwise, you'll never know if it  would have worked."  </P> <P> </P> <P> He Saw Results  </P> <P> Bert Camp, a railroad engineer in Mineola, Tex., saw results after about three  months on Rogaine.  </P> <P> "Since I started using it, I've definitely seen some new hair growing," said  Camp, 46. "And for 10 years, I've been using everything that I could get my  hands on to stop hair loss."  </P> <P> Still, Camp said, Rogaine was "too expensive, especially since I'm going to  have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years."  </P> <P> At the 2,270-store Rite Aid pharmacy chain in Harrisburg, Pa., spokeswoman  Suzanne Mead said Rogaine sales had been slower than expected.  </P> <P> Rogaine may almost double its market if the FDA approves it for use by women.  Of the 50 million Americans losing their hair, 20 million are women, and  clinical trials have found the drug to be slightly more effective on women,  Bennett said.  </P> <P> Upjohn also is working on advanced application methods for the alcohol-based  solution, which tends to be messy to apply, as well as teaming up with Procter  &amp; Gamble Co. on new ingredients designed to increase efficacy and create  new minoxidil products, such as a cream.  </P></p>

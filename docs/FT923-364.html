			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Attorney-general sets sights on Brazil's president: Collor could be adding criminal charges to his troubles THE political future of Brazil's President Fernando Collor will be decided by a historic vote in Congress, scheduled for today, on whether to begin impeachment proceedings against him for corruption. In the capital yesterday both sides claimed to be confident of victory. But amid all the suspense surrounding the vote it has been easy to lose sight of what Mr Collor is actually accused of. Even if he survives today's vote he may soon face criminal charges. One person who has not forgotten is Mr Aristides Junqueira, the attorney-general. He told foreign correspondents yesterday: 'My work is currently being overshadowed by the political process but once that is out of the way the criminal process will move to the forefront.' Mr Junqueira has sent 15 questions to Mr Collor to answer by the end of this week and expects then to recommend criminal charges against the president and 14 other people. 'I have extremely strong indications that crimes were carried out by the president,' he said. While politicians have been trying to muster votes, the federal police have been hard at work calculating the assets of Mr Collor and Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, his former campaign treasurer and alleged frontman, and attempting to piece together how the alleged corruption scam worked. They have already recommended that Mr Farias be charged with nine offences, including running a crime-racket. Estimates of how much money was involved range from the Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 3.8m) found by a congressional inquiry to have been illicitly funnelled to Mr Collor, to upwards of Dollars 1bn a year. The 87-day inquiry and police probe have investigated property in Paris, millions spent on replenishing the First Lady's wardrobe, and cheques to Mr Collor's advisers and relatives, including his ex-wife. Mr Benito Gama, the pro-government head of the inquiry, says he was 'profoundly shocked' by what it uncovered: 'I never imagined we would find such a network and we probably only touched the surface.' When the inquiry into Mr Farias began in May, Brazilians expected a cover-up. Many leading Brazilian politicians are tainted with corruption accusations and no important figure has ever been jailed for corruption. But the testimony of Mr Collor's former driver led the congressional inquiry to use subpoena powers to request 40,000 cheques. Helped, ironically, by a regulation brought in by Mr Collor's government to make all cheques carry the name of the payee, they found what appears to be an astonishing web of corruption. The scheme, as pieced together by the inquiry, was simple. First Mr Farias arranged a network of people in strategic positions in ministries and state companies. Police inquiries show that money was extorted through various means, such as overpayment on government purchases, commissions on licences and authorisations, rigged bids and kickbacks from contractors. The latter were given receipts by Empresa de Participacoes e Consultos (EPC), one of Mr Farias's companies. The inquiry obtained cheques showing that 32 large private companies had paid some Dollars 15m to EPC in the last two years for services they could not explain. Many details of the operation were kept on computer disk, which even listed the preferred hobbies, restaurants and holiday destinations of ministers and the favourite perfumes of their spouses. Most of the money detailed by the inquiry that stayed in Brazil went to EPC and BrasilJet, a private jet leasing company that never leased any aircraft. Some was then allegedly funnelled into the accounts of Collor family members and aides through phantom bank accounts whose signatories were found by graphologists to be EPC employees. Bank documents show that Dollars 2.37m was deposited in the account of Mr Collor's secretary to pay the president's household expenses. Police are also investigating the First Lady who, as head of a government charity, awarded contracts to family members and allegedly channelled funds to a phantom institution sharing the address of her family home. They have also announced investigations into the possible manipulation of state pension funds, interference in the running of Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, use of insider information for commodity trading, such as Brazil's suspension of coffee exports for a few days last year, and the renegotiation of Dollars 86m debt owed by Alagoan sugar refiners. Mr Collor and Mr Farias had made little attempt to hide their wealth. Having stayed in his own house rather than move to the official presidential residence, to prove his 'commitment to austerity', Mr Collor then spent Dollars 2.5m landscaping his gardens, according to the company which carried out the work. Mr Farias, a former trainee priest turned tractor dealer, spent Dollars 3m building a heavily guarded mansion overlooking the bay in Maceio in 1990, a year when his declared income was Dollars 24,000. He bought a Dollars 2.7m apartment in Paris, mansions in Sao Paulo and Braslia and a black Lear Jet named the Black Bat. While denying he has had any contact with Mr Farias for two years, Mr Collor has made no attempt to answer the allegations point by point. Mr Claudio Vieira, the president's former personal secretary, said monies unearthed by the inquiry were the residue of a Dollars 5m campaign loan from Uruguay, but the inquiry rejected his documents as not credible and the operation unsuitable for an aspiring president. Mr Collor claimed on national television that he had no idea where the money came from for his personal expenses. Mr Junqueira snorted at this yesterday: 'Can you imagine living in a house and seeing new cars appear, expensive refurbishing undertaken, millions of dollars appearing in accounts and just saying 'how nice' without knowing or wondering where the money came from?' However, despite his certainty that crimes were committed, he cautioned: 'I think it is very difficult in Brazil for someone to go to jail for corruption.'</p>

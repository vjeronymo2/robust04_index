			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (1): A head above the crowd - While Portugal may be the last to fall into the recession that has gripped most of the European Community, it is determined to be the first to climb out / A look at the prospects of its catching up with richer EC partners so that it can take full advantage when recovery comes PORTUGAL has a history of arriving late for recessions. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Portuguese economy boomed when the rest of Europe suffered. But then it sank into crisis, just as its peers began to celebrate recovery. This time round, Lisbon's centre-right Social Democratic government is determined not to repeat the pattern. As a small, open economy, Portugal is being tinged by the recession that is gripping most of its European Community partners. But the government is convinced that however low growth in Europe dips, Portugal can keep its head above the crowd. Portugal may again be the last to fall into recession, government officials say, but it is determined that it will also be the first to climb out. Why in past decades did Portugal feel the full brunt of recession when other countries were enjoying an economic comeback? The answer, according to Mr Jose Braga de Macedo, the finance minister, is that profligate governments threw money at problems and lost control over budget deficits. This time round, he says, things will be very different. Structural measures have been taken to stimulate the competitiveness and product- ivity of the economy, a tightly- controlled public spending programme focuses on investment and keeps budget deficits from eating into economic growth, and a social pact should help keep wage rises moderate, he argues. 'We have the resilience and the policies to hold on until the recovery comes and then take full advantage of that recovery,' he says. Portugal today is working to a markedly different set of economic and business rules than when it was dragged down by recession in the 1970s and the 1980s. EC entry came in 1986 and with it the support of a massive inflow of structural funds and later a strong commitment to economic and monetary union. This goal led to the development of a 1992-95 convergence plan, Quantum II, that set annual targets aimed at bringing inflation, public debt and budget deficits down to EC averages. The election of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva as prime minister of a majority government in 1987 brought political stability and business began to be able to plan medium and long-term strategies. Low wages and high growth rates, well above the EC average, attracted an important inflow of direct foreign investment. The late 1980s were rosy years of expansion for Portugal when gross domestic product growth peaked at 5.2 per cent and capital investment climbed at rates of more than 15 per cent a year. But, at the same time, as Portugal became more tightly locked into the EC - the Community today accounts for 75 per cent of Portugal's foreign trade - so the risk of being caught up in Europe's misfortunes grew. Recession began to cast its shadow across Portugal as darkly as elsewhere in Europe. Shaken by the aftermath of the Danish vote against ratifying the Maastricht treaty, some economic commentators in Portugal began to predict disaster, warning that their country was too small and too exposed to escape the recession afflicting their neighbours. The government originally forecast 3 per cent GDP growth for 1993 but has since revised that figure down to 1.75 per cent. This contrasts sharply with what some independent analysts predict. Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist at Banco Portugues de Investimento, for example, estimates growth at zero to 0.5 per cent. But this is a numbers game in which the finance minister refuses to get tangled up. 'What is important is not exactly how much we grow but that we grow more than rest of Europe, to ensure that we are continuing the catching up process,' he says. 'As long as we are growing faster than the rest of the Community, we are dampening the effects of the foreign recession,' he continues. 'If the EC grows 2 per cent and we grow by 3 per cent, that is one thing. But if Community growth is zero, then reaching just 1 per cent is much, much, harder. If EC growth is negative by, say, 0.5 per cent then just reaching zero growth would be absolutely wonderful.' But in the bleak climate currently facing Europe, what makes Portuguese officials so sure they can escape all but a smidgeon of recession this time and come up smiling as soon as European growth re-establishes itself? Lisbon believes it has learned from the mistakes of some its EC partners and put the right structural measures in place at the right time. 1992 brought tax harmonisation, placed the escudo in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and saw the beginning of the reform of the public administration. Last December the escudo become fully convertible when the Banco de Portugal, the central bank, lifted all restrictions on currency transactions. Risk capital funds to support private investment are being made available by both the public and private sector. Competition in a newly- liberalised financial sector has been stimulated by a new banking law and the virtual completion of a sweeping privatisation programme. The result has been a drop in corporate interest rates and more attractive and flexible cash-management services. The government has sharply cut its borrowing needs, raising a considerable amount of funds abroad and freeing up credit for the productive sector. Earlier this year, the government announced a series of EC-supported packages worth more than Es1,100bn (Pounds 4.81bn) to support housing, agriculture, export diversification and other areas. 'These are structural programmes that are exactly the opposite of throwing money at problems,' insists Mr Braga de Macedo. He says they are contained within medium-term plans for control of budget spending. Their aim is help the Portuguese economy pick up quickly when the European recovery comes. The government is confident that it can take the European recession in its stride. But there is ample room for it to stumble. 'If there is a breakdown in one economic policy, all the interlocking architecture of the govern- ment's macro-economic policy could come tumbling down,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist of Banco Comercial Portugues. The commitment to a strong escudo, preventing lower interest rates, in a context of a marked deceleration of economic activity, is considered the weakest link in the policy chain. How well could the government withstand a recession? Low unemployment, currently less than 5 per cent, would help lessen the shock and the threat of unemploy- ment would almost certainly moderate wage claims. Politically, the government is in a strong position. While it could suffer losses in local elections scheduled for December, the next general election is not due until October 1995. The opposition Socialists do not appear to have the strength to force an early poll, even if the economic situation seriously deteriorates. Were Portugal to escape the recession, that would be a boon as it struggles to catch up with its richer EC partners. Ironically, the know-how for doing so may come from peering quietly over the fence to see where the country's more advanced partners have gone astray.  --------------------------------------------------------------- Real term growth rates (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                1985-90   1991   1992*   1993****  --------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product             4.3    2.5    2.3    1.75 Private consumption                4.3    5.2    4.0    4.0 Public consumption                 5.1    3.5    2.0    0.0 Gross fixed capital formation      8.5    2.8    4.0    5.0 Exports of goods and services     10.7    1.8    5.0    5.0 Imports of goods and services     14.0    6.1    8.0    6.0 Current account (% of GDP)         0.8   -1.0   -0.3   -1.0 Government deficit (% of GDP)      7.2    6.8      -      - Total employment                   1.6    3.0      -      - Unemployment rate                  6.6    4.1    4.4    4.7 Inflation rate**                  12.7   11.4    8.9*** 6.0  --------------------------------------------------------------- *Estimate ****Forecast **Consumer price index ***Actual  --------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Bank of Portugal and Ministry of Finance  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

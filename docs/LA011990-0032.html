			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: Wednesday night's party for the Renaissance Theatre Company, the  British repertory troupe that is presenting "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and  "King Lear" at the Mark Taper Forum. After a performance of "A Midsummer  Night's Dream," guests drove or walked the few blocks to the Wells Fargo  building, where a buffet reception had been set up at the City Club on the 54th  floor. Thanks to this week's rains, the clear cold night and spectacular view  of the city lights made L.A. look almost livable.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Theatergoers seemed excited that a rep company of such international  stature had landed in town for two months before going on to Tokyo and  Australia. And the entire run was sold out last week, proving that Angelenos  will go to the theater to see something besides adults dressed as giant felines  or French revolutionaries.  </P> <P> Who Was There: RTC director Kenneth Branagh and producer David Parfitt joined  the cast and actors Lloyd Bridges, Jane Carr, Michael Crawford, Jessica Harper,  Amy Irving, Dale Kristien, Rue McClanahan, Vincent Price, Lynn Redgrave, Brenda  Vaccaro, and Alfre Woodard. Also there were officials from the Center Theatre  Group board of directors and AT&amp;T, which underwrote the party (and took a  lot of teasing for the fact that its long-distance systems went haywire on  Monday).  </P> <P> Dress Code: Somewhere between corporate and gala. Cast members showed up midway  through the party in nice suits, looking freshly scrubbed and hungry.  </P> <P> Chow: Shish kebab, ravioli, mushroom caps, fresh vegetables, fondue, champagne,  and, in deference to British tastes, winter ale and hot tea.  </P> <P> Noted: The fur coat, that politically incorrect garment of the '90s, was in  scant evidence, despite Civic Center temperatures in the low 40s. Since  Wednesday was one of the few nights of the year when Angelenos might really  consider wearing mink or sable for practical rather than aesthetic reasons,  perhaps fur coat owners are now the real endangered species.  </P> <P> Quoted: Gordon Davidson explaining away AT&amp;T's long-distance problems on  Monday: "I have absolute verification of the fact that these were all people  calling L.A., trying to get tickets for the Renaissance Theatre Company."  </P> <P> Triumphs: The Mark Taper Forum, in its never-ending search for downtown  locations for its after-parties, found a good one at the City Club. It's close,  comfortable, and elegant enough to host CTG supporters.  </P> <P> Glitches: A dining room had been set up down the hall from the party, but it  went unused all evening as guests ate standing near the buffet, shaking hands  while they tried to balance plates and drinks.

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft steps up sales drive in South America Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to boost its operations in Latin America, the fastest growing market for personal computer software. The company will open a regional office in Miami, and double the number of employees dedicated to marketing and support of Microsoft products in Latin America. Microsoft's sales there rose 174 per cent last year, making it the fastest growing market for the company, said Orlando Ayala, senior director of Latin American operations. Microsoft plans to establish manufacturing partnerships in Brazil and Mexico in May. This will allow it to produce products locally for these and neighbouring countries. By increasing the level of product support to customers, Microsoft's moves may help to combat rampant software piracy in Latin America. According to data released this week by the Software Publishers Association, Latin American countries have some of the highest rates of software piracy in the world. Illegal copies of PC software represent 89 per cent of software in use in Brazil, 82 per cent in Mexico, and 95 per cent in other Latin American countries, the industry group said. Microsoft also announced management changes in its European operations, in line with its recent re-organisation of worldwide marketing. Regional executives have been reassigned to reflect the increasing segmentation of the software market into corporate, individual and computer industry customers. The company is also focusing more on the emerging central European market, where it sees potential for sales of Dollars 1bn over the next few years. Microsoft employs more than 2,500 people in Europe, where its retail sales were Dollars 1.2bn in fiscal year 1993, up 26 per cent over the previous year.</p>

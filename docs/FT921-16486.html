			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Sears sells last US business for Pounds 22m SEARS, the UK retailing group, yesterday announced the disposal of its last remaining interest in the US and reported a 'very good start' to its sales season in the UK. The company has sold Miss Erika, its US women's fashion wholesaling business, at book value for Pounds 22m in cash. Miss Erika has been bought by a group of investors including members of the management team. The company, which sells to more than 3,000 retailers in the US, made operating profits of about Pounds 5.9m in 1990-91 although it has encountered worse trading conditions in the current year in the face of the severe US retail recession. Sears has been steadily pursuing a policy of disposing of peripheral assets to concentrate on its core European retailing interests. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said: 'We have been planning to sell Miss Erika for the past 18 months. The business depends on only three people and there was a lot of capital tied up in it. We wanted to put the money into areas where we could sleep at night.' Sears is not planning any further disposals apart from the Galliford housebuilding business. Commenting on current trade, Mr Maitland Smith said the first three days of the New Year sales had been better than expected. But he warned: 'I think when you get a strong start it peters out very quickly. People may have worked out what they wanted to buy beforehand and have gone out and done it.' He said women's fashion and men's suits had been selling well, although areas such as furniture had remained depressed. 'As for Scotland it's as if there is no recession,' he added. He said Sears' sales in the run-up to Christmas had been running about 2 per cent to 3 per cent higher and that the company had achieved better margins than a year ago. 'Christmas was very late to come and was not bad but we are comparing it with a miserable time last year,' he said. Mail order sales had been particularly good in London, he said, perhaps reflecting fear of incendiary devices in high street stores. However, he foresaw no quick upturn in consumer confidence in 1992 and expressed concern about business levels after the seasonal sales had finished.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Time to help Nigeria Nigeria is gripped by a crisis that threatens to become a catastrophe, not only for Africa's most populous nation but for the region that it dominates. Only Nigerians themselves can resolve the most serious challenge to their country's stability since the Biafran war, but their deepening predicament also calls for a constructive and imaginative response from the international community. A strike by oil workers in support of jailed opposition leader Moshood Abiola has already cut the country's petroleum exports by a fifth, the first time production has been disrupted since the Biafran conflict. This is due to become a general strike today, deepening the confrontation between the military government of General Sani Abacha and supporters of Mr Abiola, victor in last year's annulled presidential election. It will be backed by many other Nigerians driven to despair by mismanagement, corruption and falling real incomes. The presidential poll was deeply flawed. The two participating parties were created by the military government, which also wrote their manifestos. Mr Abiola, whose qualifications for the job are dubious, only emerged after the government had banned earlier candidates. Yet western governments did not object during the run-up to the poll, and enough Nigerians supported the election to give it some credibility. Mr Abiola, despite his faults, thus has a key role to play in efforts to resolve the crisis. Failed mediation So far western mediators such as Rev Jesse Jackson, who went last week at President Bill Clinton's request, have had little impact. Although Mr Jackson's warning that violence could be imminent underlines the severity of the crisis, his threat of increased sanctions is unwise. The only effective measure would be to embargo Nigeria's oil exports, which at best is a policy of last resort; at this stage it could well do harm. The most serious danger Nigeria faces is that of a power vacuum. The military regime could be toppled by a combination of protesters taking to the streets and army officers prepared to hand over to a civil authority. The trouble is that there is no credible alternative government waiting to take over: not even the current crisis has been enough to bring together an opposition divided by ethnic, regional and personality differences. Nigerians opposed to military rule need to understand that neither sanctions nor any other form of external intervention can on their own rescue them from their predicament. Before the international community can assist, opposition members must set aside their differences, while Gen Abacha and Mr Abiola must realise that their country's survival depends on a modicum of co-operation between them. Coalition government South Africa may provide a precedent. If that once bitterly divided country could lay a foundation for renewal through a coalition government of limited duration, so can Nigeria. Mr Abiola can claim a right to lead such an administration, but it cannot exclude Gen Abacha, or another senior officer, for the military's role in maintaining law and order will be essential. To overcome opposition from the north, Mr Abiola, whose stronghold is the Yoruba dominated south, should limit the transition to no more than two years. At the end of that period Mr Abiola should stand down, and agree not to run for re-election. Key portfolios - finance, the central bank, the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation - should go to technocrats. As a condition for debt relief, the accounts of these institutions must be monitored by resident officials from the World Bank and the IMF, who would assist Nigeria implement the country's lapsed economic reform programme. If Nigeria is prepared to help itself, western creditors must be ready with their support, offering a debt write-off and rescheduling which reduces Nigeria's annual servicing commitments to no more than 20 per cent of export earnings. There can be no guarantee that such a proposal would succeed. But Nigerians, like South Africans, may come to realise that the alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.</p>

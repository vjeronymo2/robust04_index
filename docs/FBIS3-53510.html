			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. </F> President Bill Clinton in Geneva with unidentified reporters;  Clinton speaks in English -- live]    [Text] [al-Asad] At the conclusion of the important and  constructive talks today between President Clinton and me, I  would like to express my deep satisfaction with what these talks  reflected in terms of the United States' determination to do its  best in order to get the peace process to its aspired  target--the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in  the region by implementing Security Council Resolutions No. 242,  338, and 425 and the land-for-peace principle. In this regard,  I believe that despite the great importance that President  Clinton attaches to domestic affairs in his country, he has  given special attention as a full partner and honest broker in  order to help the parties achieve a comprehensive peace that  concerns not only the people of the region, but all world  nations.    Today's meeting between me and President Clinton crowned a  series of correspondences and telephone calls between us during  the last year. I hope that our meeting today will contribute to  achieving the aspirations of the region's peoples that this new  year be a year for the establishment of a just and comprehensive  peace that puts an end to the tragedies of violence and wars  from which these peoples have been suffering for several decades.    During our meeting, I had the opportunity to emphasize to  President Clinton Syria's firm commitment to the bases and  principles of the peace process and our strong faith that peace  cannot be real and lasting unless it its comprehensive and based  on the principles of international legitimacy and justice. This  means serious work for a just solution on all tracks. Current  and historical evidence proves that separate peace deals and  partial solutions cannot secure a real peace in the region. In  this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction that  President Clinton is personally committed to the objective of a  comprehensive peace. Accordingly, we agreed to work together in  order to render successful the efforts aimed at putting an end  to the Arab-Israeli conflict and reach a comprehensive and real  peace that enables the region's peoples to concentrate on their  development, progress, and prosperity.    This meeting also gave us the opportunity to exchange views  on a number of issues, including those related to bilateral  relations, and we agreed that the noble objective we are working  for together requires a qualitative step toward better  relations. We also discussed issues related to the regional  situation and all that would contribute to security and  stability in the Middle East.    Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace with Israel as a  strategic option that guarantees Arab rights, terminates the  Israeli occupation, and enables all the region's peoples to live  in peace, safety, and dignity. We fought honorably, negotiate  honorably, and make peace honorably. We want an honorable peace  for our people and for hundreds of thousands of those who  sacrificed their lives in defense of the homeland and its  rights. There is almost no house in Syria that has not lost a  martyr in defense of the homeland, nation, and Arab rights. For  the sake of all those and for the sake of their sons and  families, we want the peace of the brave, a real peace that  thrives, continues, guarantees the interests of all, and gives  rights to their owners. If the leaders of Israel have enough  courage to respond to such a peace, a new era of security and  stability and normal peaceful relations among all will emerge in  the region. Thank you. [applause]    [Clinton] In pursuit of that priority I have always viewed  Syria's involvement as critical. That is why from the outset of  our administration, I have engaged President al-Asad in a  regular correspondence by telephone and letter, and why I am now  pleased to have had this opportunity to hear personally  President al-Asad's views about how best to make this a year of  [words indistinct] to produce real peace. The accord between  Israel and the PLO marks a first step to lay the groundwork for  a solution to the Palestinian problem. I have said that I  believe Syria to be the key and that its role is critical for  achieving a true and lasting peace between Israel and its  neighbors. As you have heard, President al-Asad shares with me  the goal of achieving a comprehensive peace with Israel and  peaceful relations between the neighbors. Israel and Syria will  have to make crucial decisions to achieve peace. Hence,  al-Asad's call for a peace of the brave. You have heard him say  that now, and I support this. Today we worked together to bring  the peace talks that began in Madrid two years ago to a  successful conclusion. There are important problems that need  to be solved. There are problems related to withdrawal, peace,  and security. We will try to solve the issues that are  connected with peace, withdrawal, and security. But I am  confident that we have laid the foundations for real progress.  The heads of delegations will begin again talks in Washington  next week. We also discussed the state of relations between the  United States and Syria and agreed on the desirability of  improving them. This requires honestly addressing the problems  in our relationship. Accordingly, we have instructed the  secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister to establish  a mechanism to address these issues in detail and openly. For  too long, the Middle East has been denied the benefits of peace,  and yet it is within our power to create the conditions that  will enable Israeli and Arab -- Muslim, Christian, and Jew -- to  live together in peace. Today's meeting was an important step  for fulfilling that vision. We have a lot of work to do, but we  are closer to our goal. Thank you. [applause]    [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: Do you feel that you  have a firm commitment from President al-Asad to normalize  relations with Israel, and by that I mean open borders, free  trade, and diplomatic relations?    [Clinton] The short answer is yes. I believe that President  al-Asad has made a clear, forthright and very important  statement on normal, peaceful relations now. In order to  achieve those relations, a peace agreement has to be negotiated  in good faith and carried out. But this is an important  statement, the first time that there has been a clear expression  that there will be a possibility of that sort of relationship.    [Reporter, in Arabic] Mr. President: All the separate  agreements have proved a failure, the most notable examples  being the 17 May agreement in Lebanon and the Gaza-Jericho  accord. UN resolutions on Iraq have been applied firmly. To  date, Resolution 425 on Lebanon remains unenforced. When will  we see a commitment to UN Resolutions, including 425?    [Clinton] First of all, as to the specifics of the  implementation, that will be part of the process of negotiation.  But let me answer the first, and more important question, I  think. I think all the parties in this process recognize that it  cannot succeed unless all the tracks are brought to a successful  conclusion. That is, I think President al-Asad was very  eloquent in our meeting today about the question of Lebanon, and  Jordan, for that matter, in saying that even Syria may feel  fully satisfied with its differences with Israel if they could  be worked out, there would still have to be a comprehensive  peace in which the issues affecting Lebanon, the issues  affecting Jordan, and the issues relating to the PLO would, in  addition to the Syrian issues, would all be resolved. We are all  committed to that.    [Reporter, in English] Mr. al-Asad. President Clinton is  the fifth, the fourth American President you're meeting now. Do  you think you can afford to wait for a fifth one or have you  decided to sign the peace now?    [Al-Asad] Yes. We are ready to sign peace now.    [Reporter, in English] President Clinton. Beyond the broad  assurances that you and President al-Asad have spoken of here  about the willingness to seek peace and to negotiate it. Do you  have, Sir, as a result of these meetings, any of the kinds of  specific detailed concessions or a sense of willingness to make  concessions that might make a successful negotiation possible?  And if so, can you tell us in what areas they are?    [Clinton] Well, as you know, I have a very strong conviction  that the specifics of this agreement will have to be negotiated  by the parties themselves. And even though I have in mind  several things, I think that it is very important that those of  us who are trying to facilitate these discussions not discuss  the details of them. The parties are going to have to work that  out.    Let me say that an indication has been given here by the  very  important statement that President al-Asad has already made,  stating clearly that it is time to end the conflict with Israel,  make peace with Israel, that peace can be, should lead to normal  and peaceful relations. I would hope that this would provoke a  positive response in Israel and that the parties would get  together and work these details out. That is not for the United  States to dictate.    [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton. Despite the peace  talks since the Madrid conference, Israel continues to build  settlements in the occupied Arab territories which, according to  all international standards, are considered illegitimate and a  violation of UN resolutions. Moreover, at a time when Syria  signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has demanded  over the years that the Middle East be a region free of weapons  of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological  weapons--Israel still refuses to sign the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and continues to stockpile weapons.  Mr. President, do you not think that these Israeli stands and  practices contradict the concept of peace for which you are  working? Thank you.    [Clinton] First, sir, I believe the question of settlements  in disputed areas is one of the things that clearly will have to  be resolved in connection with this peace process consistent  with United Nations resolutions and the concept of territory for  peace. I said that in my opening statement. I expect that to  work, to be worked through.    Secondly, on the question of weapons, I believe the best  chance we have to stop the spread of weapons of mass  destruction, that includes not only nuclear but also biological  and chemical weapons, and indeed to slow the sophisticated  conventional arms race in the Middle East is to finish this  peace process successfully. I think that is, as a practical  matter, the only way to do it. And we're going to, the United  States will work as hard as we can toward that objective.    [Reporter, in English] President al-Asad: Are you clearly  stating unequivocally today that in exchange for a full Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Syria would be prepared to  establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel, including  open borders, including tourism, the same kind of peace treaty  that Israel established with Egypt?    [Al-Asad] All of us, foremost the United States and  President Clinton, are trying to make peace comprehensive in  order to make it lasting and just. Within this framework, we  are trying to achieve a real peace that will secure rights for  everyone and secure a stable life for everyone. In such a  solution, all the region's peoples, as well as all the world's  nations, have an interest. President Clinton and I were in  agreement regarding our views. We will respond to peace  requirements. This matter, as you know, is a subject to be  tackled at the negotiating table, not during this conference.    [Reporter, in Arabic] This question is posed to President  Clinton: The United States has proposed itself as a full  partner and an honest broker. Syria welcomed this and  cooperated with this for the sake of a peace process that is of  concern to the entire world. Despite this, the United States  still deals with Syria in a way which is different from the way  it deals with Israel, particularly in the field of financial and  military aid. What is your explanation of this? Thank you.    [Clinton] [words indistinct] ... with Syria over a number of  issues, including our differences over questions relating to  certain groups, PKK [Kurdish Workers Party], Hizballah, the  Jibril group [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command], others, other issues. We talked  about these differences for about an hour today without any view  toward trying to resolve them. We agreed on two things, and I  think this is very important. One is that if we can maintain  one another's confidence working toward a peaceful solution in  the Middle East, that that would do a great deal for our  bilateral relations and for a better future. And the second is  that we needed to have a process that had integrity, established  by the secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister. That  would go beyond public exchanges to a very specific delineation  of the differences between us and an honest effort to resolve  them or to make progress on them. So, sir, I think the best  answer to your question is that we think that the progress  perhaps can be made. We've set up a mechanism to deal honestly  with the differences between us, and we believe maintaining each  other's confidence by a good-faith effort in the Middle East  peace process is the most important thing we can do at this  moment in our history.    [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: If the subject is so  close to your heart, but you evaded answering whether you  thought that Israel could sign a Non-Proliferation Treaty, my  real question is: Did you discuss and set a timetable for  Israeli and Syrian troops to come out of Lebanon?    [Clinton] We did not have any discussions today about the  details of any face of the Middle East peace process because the  other parties are not here present, and it would not have been  an appropriate thing to do.    [Reporter, in Arabic] [words indistinct]    [Clinton, interrupting] Excuse me, I got one of those  helpful little hands from one of my staff members down here. I  apologize to interrupt you. I want to be perfectly forthright  because I don't want to leave a false impression that might be  adversely interpreted against President al-Asad. We did discuss  the importance of having the Lebanese peace process go on  parallel to the Israeli-Syrian process. I reaffirm my support  for the al-Ta'if accord, and President al-Asad agrees that there  should be a successful conclusion of a peace process which left  Lebanon free and independent as a nation. So, there was no  difference between us on the objective. And I didn't want  anything I said to be read unfairly against him on that score.  We actually, I think, reached complete meeting of the mind.    [Reporter, in English] In my interview with you, on 13  September at the White House, you called for a bigger Syrian  role in the peace process, and you called personally on His  Excellency President al-Asad to play a personal role in forging  ahead a breakthrough in the peace process. Now that you've met  President al-Asad face to face for the first time, what is your  impression about President al-Asad? And how do you view his  personal role in achieving that breakthrough?    [Clinton] Well, first of all, you know I had heard a lot  about President al-Asad's legendary stamina in these meetings.  [laughter] And when we called a break four hours and 20 minutes  into our meeting, I can tell you that his reputation does not  exceed the reality. He deserves every bit of it. Secondly, we  had the opportunity, because we did talk for so long, we had the  opportunity to exchange not only our views about the issues in  play at present but also I had the opportunity to learn  President al-Asad's perspective over a period exceeding 20 years  now on some of these issues. And it reinforced my belief, as  expressed in September, that there would be no comprehensive  peace in the Middle East unless he were willing to take a  leadership role, and that he has decided to take the risks that  all these leaders, if they really want peace, are going to have  to take. And so, I guess, I would have to say that that is the  most important thing to me. The thing that was most impressive,  I believe, that he is committed to trying to work through this  as quickly as possible, and I think others will see that  commitment and will respond in an appropriate way.    [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton, if peace is an  international need, and the U.S. Administration is seriously  seeking to achieve it, providing that it is also a U.S.,  Israeli, and Syrian need, then why does the peace process  stumble every now and then? How will the U.S. Administration,  taking into consideration that it is the most important  cosponsor, tackle the obstacles that might emerge on the road in  the future? Thank you.    [Clinton] Of course, it stumbles every now and then because  it's difficult to do. If it were easy to do, it would have been  done before. The parties have been at odds with each other for  a long time, there was a lot of mistrust to overcome, there are  a lot of details to be worked out. And, I think whenever there  is any ambiguity at all, or uncertainty, then that is likely to  lead to other problems down the road. So, there are lots of  reasons why it happens. What the United States is trying to do  is to take advantage of what I think is an appropriate moment in  history, where you have leaders committed to getting this  done--leaders who understand that the interests of their people  will be served over the long run by comprehensive peace. And so  what we can do, I think, is to try to keep the process going,  keep the trust level up among the parties, try to be an honest  broker and work through the problems, and when these  difficulties do arise, as they have as you implied in the  aftermath of the PLO-Israel accord, to try to help and work  through them as quickly as possible and get things back on track.    [Reporter, in English] Thank you.    [Clinton] Thank you very much.</p>

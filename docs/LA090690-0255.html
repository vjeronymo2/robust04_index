			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM SILENT HUGHES, 84; INVESTMENT BANKING EXECUTIVE  </P> <P> William Silent Hughes, former president of the independent investment banking  firm Wagenseller &amp; Durst Inc., has died. He was 84.  </P> <P> Hughes died Sunday at his San Marino home of degenerative heart disease and  complications of old age.  </P> <P> He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1966 to 1969 and a  governor of the Pacific Stock Exchange from 1978 to 1984.  </P> <P> Hughes also was a governor of the National Assn. of Security Dealers, a  governor of the Investment Bankers Assn. and an adviser to the New York Stock  Exchange on regional firms.  </P> <P> The Wagenseller &amp; Durst firm, which Hughes headed from 1948 until 1979,  changed ownership in 1979, with Hughes becoming vice chairman and a director.  </P> <P> "We have never been interested in selling our company to a large national  organization," Hughes said at the time, "so this combination of new ownership  and younger management will permit Wagenseller &amp; Durst to remain  independently active in this field."  </P> <P> Hughes, a Los Angeles-area resident since infancy, was graduated from Los  Angeles Polytechnic High School and UCLA. He was a founding trustee of the UCLA  Foundation.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Marion; two daughters, Dorothy Matthiessen and  Adele Berwanger, and eight grandchildren.  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday in the Freeman Chapel of  the Pasadena Presbyterian Church.  </P> <P> The family has requested that memorial donations be made to the UCLA  Foundation.  </P></p>

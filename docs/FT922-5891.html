			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The New York raw SUGAR market rallied in early trading on technically driven fund buying, boosting the London raws and whites markets. Buy-stops were triggered, forcing dealers to cover short positions, as the New York July contract shot up towards the crucial 10 cents a lb resistance level. 'Funds really came in above 9.65 and every 10 points it went up found stops - the locals kept buying it, funds kept buying it, and then trade had to cover shorts,' one dealer said. Substantial buying by UK trade houses was reported. 'We thought we might get a blip on the upside but not the activity we've seen,' said one London dealer. In contrast COCOA came under further pressure in both London and New York, where by midday July had hit Dollars 855 a tonne - a contract low and the cheapest level for the market in 19 years. Limited offtake from manufacturers has combined with the prospect of further producer sales to depress the market, dealers said. On the LME base metals were mainly influenced by the dollar-sterling exchange rate. ALUMINIUM was most affected by the dollar's firmness and its likely dampening impact on consumer interest.

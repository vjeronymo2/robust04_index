			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Improvement at RH Macy RH Macy, the US retailer struggling to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it was encouraged by the steady improvement in its underlying performance in the third quarter, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The department store chain, which is expected to submit a reorganisation plan to a federal court at the end of this month, announced a 32 per cent jump in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to Dollars 34.9m for the three months to the end of April, against Dollars 26.5m a year earlier. However, the net loss was Dollars 157.3m, or Dollars 97.28 a share, against a Dollars 227.9m deficit recorded in the year-earlier quarter. For the nine months, Macy posted a net loss of Dollars 217m, or Dollars 132.82 a share, against a shortfall of Dollars 354.9m, or Dollars 219.49, a year earlier.</p>

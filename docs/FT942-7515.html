			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Inchcape shares shed 21p after profit warning Shares in Inchcape fell 21p to 499p yesterday after the UK-based motors, marketing and services group warned that profits in the first six months of this year would be below last year's. Sir David Plastow, chairman, said that - as in 1993 - the group was suffering from the strengthening of the yen and the Japanese recession, the downturn in continental European motor markets and austerity measures in China. He told yesterday's annual meeting: 'Not much has changed since then and, in particular, we have yet to gain any significant respite from the yen's strength.' Nonetheless, the chairman was cautiously optimistic that Inchcape could achieve sufficient progress in the second half to be able to maintain the group's record of year-on-year profit growth. Last year Inchcape made pre-tax profits of Pounds 272m. Analysts downgraded their forecasts to between Pounds 255m and Pounds 270m. Sir David said the group's performance in the early months of this year had varied. Motor imports and distribution continued to suffer from the strong yen and the depressed continental car markets. 'However, the Asian businesses generally continue to perform well although, as previously announced, we no longer benefit from the joint venture in Hong Kong, exporting Toyota vehicles into China,' he said. This joint venture came to an end at the turn of the year, having contributed Pounds 14m to group profits in 1993, of which nearly Pounds 11m was earned in the first half. The group's marketing business stream had improved its performance in 1994 and the remedial action taken, particularly in Malaysia and Taiwan, were paying dividends. However, Japan, in spite of signs of improvement, continued to be a challenging economy for most of the group's marketing businesses. 'Insurance services, shipping services and testing services have continued to make good progress, and although the western retailing environment is still depressed, buying services is recovering,' said the chairman. Last month Inchcape made a Pounds 176.6m agreed bid for Hogg Group, which it hopes to merge with its own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson, to create the seventh largest insurance broker in the world.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Overseas building orders increase OVERSEAS orders won by British construction companies rose by 29 per cent last year to Pounds 2.9bn, figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show. The increase was due mainly to additional work in North America and Hong Kong, the department said. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said the rise in orders from the Far East, one of the world's growth regions for construction, was particularly encouraging.</p>

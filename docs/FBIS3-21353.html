			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Amin in Jeddah: "Kingdom's Balanced Budget </F> Is Not A Contraction"]    [Text] At a time when most countries of the world, both  developing and advanced, are suffering laggard economic  performance, high inflation and unemployment rates, and lower  standards of living as a consequence of continued world economic  recession, preserving the high standard of living enjoyed by the  Saudi citizenry in face of these world challenges is considered  a grand medal that adorns the chest of this noble motherland. It  is also an accurate indicator of the extent to which the  leadership of this country, may God save it, is keen on paying  the utmost attention to whatever is of interest to citizens in  their daily lives.    At a time when the currencies of many advanced nations are  tumbling, such as the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and  the collapse of the exchange rate of European currencies last  August following the decline of the French franc and the pound  Sterling--that collapse which prompted the Italian lira, the  Spanish peseta, and the Portuguese escudo to leave the European  exchange system....    At a time when all this is happening, maintaining the Saudi  riyal's value vis-a-vis the dollar and other world currencies is  irrefutable proof of the strength and solidity of the Saudi  economy in spite of all international and regional challenges.    At a time when budget deficits are widening in many  countries  of the world--one such country is suffering a $200 billion  deficit as a result of world economic recession--there was  earnest intent to prepare a balanced Saudi budget without a  deficit for the first time in five years. Revenue and  expenditure estimates balance at 160 billion riyals [R],  reflecting our astute government's insistence on positioning our  economy at the head of the economies of the region and of the  world as far as strength and rate of growth are concerned. It  also reflects our astute government's care to preserve the high  standard of living of citizens and residents, and [to protect it  from] all inflationary measures or additional burdens on  citizens.    Comparative cost of living figures in the Kingdom indicate  that it continues to be low. The annual increase in the last  month of this past year did not exceed 1.8 percent in comparison  with the same month a year earlier [as published]. This rate [of  increase] is very minuscule in comparison with most countries of  the world, as the Ministry of Finance and National Economy  pointed out in its statement accompanying the budget. Doubtless,  there is no comparison between this rate and the high rates of  inflation, exceeding 20 or 30 percent in most cases, that are  scorching numerous nations of the world around us.  <H5>  R160 Billion For What? </H5>   [This is the] climate in which the Kingdom's general budget  for 1414/15H [1993/94] was issued. One may wonder why budget  estimates settled at R160 billion and no higher. The answer is  summarized in the remarks made by the Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques in the recent extraordinary session held by the Council  of Ministers to ratify the budget.    He said, may God save him: "When preparing and debating this  budget, care was taken, as it is every year, to take into  consideration services to citizens and [to look after] their  interests in all areas of administrative, educational, and  health services."  <H5>  This Is No Contraction </H5>   World economic conditions and increased petroleum supply  have  [adversely] impacted world [oil] prices and depressed our  country's [oil] revenues even further.    There was considerable softening of oil prices last year.  [Oil] is considered the main source of state income and accounts  for 75 percent of total state revenues.    This past fiscal year closed with crude prices at an average  of $13.20, or a 40-percent drop from $22.00 at the beginning of  last year. That was its steepest rate of decline in the past  five years.    It follows, therefore, that this factor would influence our  revenue in the new budget. This is not to be construed as a move  towards contraction, since development appropriations were not  affected.    Our astute government has been keen on preserving the  strength of the national economy within the limitations of  available resources, and according to the dictate of acumen and  discernment, without encumbering citizens with tax burdens as  other countries do, and without impeding the course of  development in this blessed country.    The state had the option, and the right, to impose taxes or  fees on citizens, residents, and businessmen, or on the services  it offers gratis, in order to boost revenues, or at least to  make up for this year's shortfall in public revenues. But our  leadership is always insistent on lightening the burden of  citizens in order that they may enjoy a high and stable quality  of life. It insists, at the same time, on providing the private  sector with an opportunity to contribute effectively to the  development process without limitations, impediments, or  restrictions.    This discerning state perception of the private sector's  role  is in harmony and in tandem with five-year plan objectives of  allowing this sector effective participation in the development  process, as well as with world trends in this direction.    Preliminary estimates of private sector performance last  year  indicate that it rose up to expectations and accomplished close  to a 5.1-percent rate of growth from a year earlier. That rate  confirms the continued expansion of the national economy's  absorptive capacity thanks to private investments over the past  few years.  <H5>  Solid Infrastructure </H5>   These private sector accomplishments did not come out of  thin  air, but are rooted in the solid infrastructure developed by the  state over the past 20 years at a generous expenditure of $900  billion (R3.375 trillion). This means that our economy is  maturing.    The state continues to make interest-free soft loans  available in the new year to citizens and to investors in the  fields of industry, agriculture, real estate, and lending,  having appropriated $7.870 billion to the three development  funds.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table Shows State Budget Development Over Past 5 Yearsfigures in billion riy-|  |als                                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                     |Expenditures             |Revenues                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1994                     |160                      |160                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993                     |196.95                   |169                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                     |181                      |151                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                     |143                      |118                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                     |143                      |118                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Actual expenditures in the years 1990 and 1991 are estimated at 472.360 bill-|  |ion because of additional costs incurred for the war to liberate Kuwait.     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

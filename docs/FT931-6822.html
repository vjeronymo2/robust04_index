			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks and Small Companies: Blaming a bank when all goes sour  -The relationship between banks and small businesses is in upheaval. With 80,000 company failures last year and a similar number forecast for 1993, lenders are seeking a fresh approach to overdrafts, loans and equity finance. FT reporters assess the lending pressures on companies and banks BILL BOWLING'S world disintegrated in January. He lost his construction business and now faces losing his home. Like many businessmen who have called in receivers, the former chairman and majority shareholder of Clayton Bowmore blames a bank. He says National Westminster's decision to cut the overdraft limit for his Yorkshire-based company from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 250,000 created a cashflow crisis it could not survive. NatWest denies its actions were precipitate. As far as it was concerned Clayton Bowmore was another casualty of the recession - a victim of over-expansion and poor cashflow. The bank says: 'We asked accountants KPMG Peat Marwick to prepare two reports on the company last year. The second concluded the company was insolvent. An independent insolvency practitioner, already working with the company, said that the business would require more money to survive.' Mr Bowling says the bank pulled the plug even though the company had negotiated sales that would have enabled it to repay Pounds 400,000 of its Pounds 2.2m borrowings. Mr Bowling, who had given a personal guarantee of Pounds 200,000 against bank loans, argues the company's gearing was no worse than many publicly owned construction companies. 'The book value remained marginally greater than the bank debt even after the savage write-downs recommended by KPMG, which have been appointed receivers,' he says. The rise and fall of Clayton Bowmore mirrors the experiences of many companies during the recession. It was formed in November 1975 with just Pounds 100, a Morris van and a lot of optimism. Within four years annual turnover had reached Pounds 3m. During the 12 months to the end of March 1992 the group made a Pounds 250,000 pre-tax profit on a Pounds 16m turnover. The seeds of its destruction, however, were sown with the move into housebuilding in the late 1980s. For a while all went well. House prices and sales remained stronger in northern England than in the south. NatWest, however, was concerned and asked KPMG to prepare its first report, which included a substantial write-down on book values. Work in progress was valued at zero, debtors were included at 50 per cent of book value and property and land values were cut, according to Mr Bowling. KPMG reduced its estimates even further in the second report. Mr Bowling says such treatment could be justified only if the company had already been judged unviable. KPMG says Mr Bowling's reaction is understandable, but stands by its judgment. The accountants say the recommendations on ways to reduce overheads were largely ignored by the company, which underestimated its likely losses for this financial year. The countdown to collapse started on September 15 when the government raised base rates to 15 per cent. 'That day we lost five houses worth a total of Pounds 250,000,' says Mr Bowling. The company, which had been expecting a sale a week, has made fewer than six since Black Wednesday. On the morning of January 15 the company received a payment for more than Pounds 300,000. It immediately posted cheques worth more than Pounds 150,000 to suppliers. 'At 4.15pm the bank rang to say it was reducing our overdraft facility by the exact amount of the payment we had received,' says Mr Bowling. NatWest says it warned the company that it retained the right to reduce the overdraft limit by the amount of any cheques receive. Mr Bowling says: 'NatWest refused to honour the cheques we had sent out. Word got round and the client stopped the Pounds 300,000 cheque before it had time to clear. So nobody gained.' On January 27, with insufficient cash to pay wages, the receivers were called in.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to acting Treasury Minister Luis Javier  Grisanti, there is no reason for panic buying of foreign  currency. This is in concurrence with a document issued by the  Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Venezuela on the need  to maintain monetary stability. The exchange rate, however,  closed yesterday at a purchase rate of 128.20 bolivares to the  dollar and a selling rate of 129.50.    The bank's communique also lists the main points of the  economic plan, as presented by the executive branch, under  President Rafael Caldera's solidarity promise. The plan is based  on five basic premises which are: The development and  consolidation of macroeconomic management; the general  dissemination of tax reforms, which is intended to gain  permanent balance for the government's finances; national and  foreign investment incentives; and consolidation of trade  opening by way of integration agreements, among others. Based on  the above, Grisanti says there is no reason for any speculation  in the currency exchange rate. Here are a few of his statements:    [Begin Grisanti recording] For these reasons there is no  justification for an increase in currency speculation which  would be harmful to our national currency. The population can  rest assured that the executive branch has taken, and will  continue to take, necessary steps to maintain the economic  balance and that the exchange rate will stabilize.

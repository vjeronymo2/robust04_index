			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-ROAD PATROLS BEEFED UP  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council this week approved paying the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department up to $2,800 to add off-road motorcycle patrols to  its enforcement program on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> The figure is about 60% of the cost of the program; the remainder has already  been allocated by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates, which also contract  with the Sheriff's Department for police protection.  </P> <P> The off-road program, which was implemented about a month ago, was added  because of an increase in illegal off-road use and dumping, said officials. A  sheriff's spokesman said numerous citations have already been issued.  </P> <P> Nine deputies have been trained for the program, which is similar to one at the  Sheriff's Malibu Station.  </P></p>

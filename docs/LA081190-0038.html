			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSLIMS CONDEMN KUWAIT INVASION  </P> <P> The Islamic Center of Southern California condemned the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait this week as "alien" to Muslim principles.  </P> <P> Dr. Maher Hathout, spokesman for the center, said Iraq may couch its goals in  religious language but "there is no Islam in that mess. The Islamic stand, as  stated in the Koran, is quite clear that disputes should not be solved by  violence."  </P> <P> Salam Al-Marayati, spokesman for the Muslim Political Action Committee in Los  Angeles, said, "It is a very common tactic in the Muslim Middle East for  dictators to exploit Islam to maintain power."  </P> <P> In New York, Mohammed T. Mehdi, Iraqi-born president of the National Council on  Islamic Affairs, also condemned the Iraqi invasion as violating Islamic  principles.  </P></p>

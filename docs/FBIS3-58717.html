			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Owen Bowcott and David Sharrock in Belfast: </F> "Peace Statement Not Enough, Says Adams"]    [Text] The president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, yesterday  gave the strongest indication to date that the Downing Street  declaration was not enough for the IRA to give up violence and  allow his organisation to enter the mainstream political process.    In statements that amount to a rejection of the joint  British  and Irish declaration as it stands, Mr Adams made clear that  without clarification there could be no end to the IRA campaign.    "Up to now I do not have any political package with which to  approach the IRA," he said. "It is clearly the responsibility  of the two governments to produce such a package.    "They cannot, however, argue that they have a basis for  peace  unless they can produce and explain what it is. I will not  mislead the IRA neither will I mislead others about the IRA.    "The London government demands an IRA surrender as a  precondition to dialogue with Sinn Fein. Yet for over three  years the government was involved in contact and dialogue  without such preconditions."    But his demand, repeated yesterday, for immediate and  unconditional dialogue with the British and Irish governments on  the declaration was rebuffed by the Prime Minister.    John Major told the Commons: "The joint declaration is not  in any way an invitation for renegotiation. The only acceptable  response from Mr Adams is for him to call for an end to IRA  violence. The only question that needs to be asked is of Mr  Adams: will he stop the violence and enter the democratic  process or not?"    Reports in Dublin yesterday that Irish government officials  are to meet senior Sinn Fein members were dismissed by the  foreign affairs minister, Dick Spring. "There has been no  change in government policy in relation to negotiations or  direct contact with organization which are engaged in or support  violence," he said.    In a lengthy statement, Mr Adams set out for the first time  the differences between the Downing Street document and the  Hume/Adams agreement--the result of months of talks between  himself and John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and  Labour Party, which preceded the London-Dublin talks that  resulted in the declaration.    His claims will be a direct challenge to Mr Hume, who has  backed both agreements and implied that the gap between them is  marginal.    Mr Adams said that his and Mr Hume's proposals, agreed in  September, were known to both governments. They contained a  basic set of principles:    1. The Irish people as a whole have the right to  selfdetermination.    2. An internal settlement is not a solution.    3. Unionists cannot have a veto over British policy.    4. The consent and allegiance of Unionists is crucial to any  agreement.    5. The British government must join the persuaders (to such  an end).</p>

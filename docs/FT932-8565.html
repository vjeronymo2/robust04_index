			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Money Markets: BoE bulletin awaited STERLING interest rate fut-ures declined yesterday as dealers took the view that the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, due out today, will take a firm line against allowing inflation to rise, writes James Blitz. Sterling's strong performance on the foreign exchanges last month meant that the April producer prices showed a fairly low level of underlying inflation. However, the Bank is this week expected to stamp down on suggestions that the government's recent political difficulties will bring another interest rate cut. The June short sterling contract reflected those expectations, opening 5 basis points down at 93.89 yesterday morning. It later edged up to close at 93.91 as sterling performed fairly strongly against the D-Mark on the currency markets. The three-month sterling deposit rate firmed slightly yesterday amid similar expectations, finishing at 6 1/16 per cent compared with a previous close of 6 per cent. That rise in three-month cash came in spite of a cheap flow of daily funds. The overnight lending rate fell as low as 3 per cent at one stage, following a shortage of Pounds 1.35bn. If yesterday's dealing was quiet, it was probably because dealers are waiting for a raft of data due out later this week, including the unemployment figures and the retail prices index. That mood of expectation also dominated in Europe, where dealers were waiting for the Bundesbank council meeting which, this week, is due tomorrow because of the German holiday on Thursday. The outlook for German rates this week is very mixed. Dealers are anticipating another 25 basis-point cut in the discount rate, and there has been some talk of the rate coming down by  1/2 percentage point. Call money edged higher yesterday, touching 8 per cent and reflecting the tight conditions that remain in the German cash market following a significant net drain of funds last week. There are some expectations of a rise in the repo rate. Euromark futures were slightly weaker, reflecting that mood. The June contract closed at 92.84, down 3 basis points on the day. The June Pibor contract, however, finished 4 basis points firmer at 92.68.</p>

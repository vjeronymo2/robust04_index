			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave defends service choice VOTING FOR those who run public services is not necessarily the way to make the services properly accountable and responsive, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, argued yesterday. In a lecture to the Public Finance Foundation Mr Waldegrave insisted that the key points in the delivery of responsive services were providing choice, information and redress. His speech is a direct attack on the criticism of government reforms by some academics, who say changes reduced the role of elected representatives, such as councillors, to make way for government appointees. They have argued that this has created a 'new magistracy' made up of people appointed to unaccountable organisations such as quangos and trusts. Mr Waldegrave did not deny the shift away from giving responsibilities to those who had been elected, but said that the constitutional changes proposed by those who wanted to inject more democracy were irrelevant to the delivery of public services. 'There is no guarantee - indeed there may not even be a sporting chance - that by periodically expressing his or her democratic decision at the ballot box, the citizen will necessarily obtain efficient, properly accountable, responsive public services,' he said. He went beyond rejecting the idea that reforms in areas such as education and health had created a 'democratic deficit', saying that the government had strengthened accountability, by providing clearer structures and better information. The arrangements for the national curriculum enabled parents to be better aware of how responsibilities were divided between central government and individual schools. In the national health service the changes had brought out the role of the management in individual hospitals, providing a better focus for public reaction.</p>

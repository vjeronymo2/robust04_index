			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A FLOW OF IRONY  </P> <P> Ah, yes, the irony was flowing strong like sap in the spring through Mike  Madigan's March 12 commentary ("Local Control Key Issue in Controversy Over  SDG&amp;E Merger"). Here we have a senior executive from the Los Angeles-based  Pardee corporation waxing eloquent on the importance of "local control." Yes,  that is the same Mike Madigan -- local boy bought by outside interests -- who  was principal spokesman against growth controls during last November's election  (shades of Howard Allen).  </P> <P> And yes, that is the same Pardee that spent the single largest sum -- close to  half-a-million dollars -- to defeat not only the citizens' growth-control  initiatives but the City Council and Board of Supervisors plans as well.  </P> <P> And, in the final irony, Mr. Madigan takes a knock at Edison's full-page  propaganda ads extolling the virtues of the merger. Mr. Madigan chooses to  forget, of course, those huge blue-and-yellow billboards screaming "NO ON D AND  J" above our freeways that Pardee (and Fieldstone) paid for.  </P> <P> PETER NAVARRO  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> Prevent Los Angelization Now  </P></p>

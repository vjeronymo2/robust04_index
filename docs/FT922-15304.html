			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Labour silent on cash aid to Jubilee Line THE LABOUR party yesterday expressed support for extending London Underground's Jubilee Line to Docklands. But it stopped short of offering to provide funds if Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, failed to provide its share of the finance. O&amp;Y agreed under a proposal announced by the Department of Transport in 1989 to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of the Pounds 1.3bn project, with the rest coming from the government. There is also thought to be a smaller contribution due from British Gas. Ms Joan Ruddock, a shadow transport minister, said: 'We are not seeking any variation of the proposals. The plan (for the extension) is there ready to start. We want O&amp;Y to come up with the money.' O&amp;Y, which is holding debt-restructuring talks with its banks, failed on Tuesday to make its first scheduled contribution of Pounds 40m to the project. Ms Ruddock would not be drawn on any detailed response to reports that O&amp;Y and its banks might seek to reduce their contribution to the project - a move that would almost certainly shift the onus to the Treasury. 'We still expect Olympia &amp; York or its bankers and British Gas to honour their financial commitments to this scheme,' Ms Ruddock said. 'Clearly we want to see whatever is on offer and see how best the contract can be drawn up.' She added that, if O&amp;Y came up with its share, there was 'no reason why the extension should no go ahead within the original timetable'. Last week Mr John Prescott, Labour's senior transport spokesman, said the project would be thrown into the hands of the public sector because the private sector had failed to live up to its agreement. The cautious line adopted by Labour yesterday is based partly on the hope that O&amp;Y and its bankers will eventually rally round the project because failure to do so might jeopardise the future of the company's Canary Wharf development. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and Labour's campaign co-ordinator for London, said yesterday: 'The growing doubts over the Jubilee Line are only one symptom of the wider failure of Conservative policy in the nation's capital.'

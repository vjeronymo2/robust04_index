			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GATES SURE RECORD BUST WILL DRAW ANTI-DRUG RESOURCES TO SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl F. Gates told the City Council on Wednesday that he is  certain the federal government will increase its drug-fighting resources in the  Los Angeles area in light of the discovery last week of nearly 19 tons of  cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse.  </P> <P> "I think we will begin to see a buildup of the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration), the FBI, Customs and even an enhancement of the Coast Guard in  this area," Gates told council members during a briefing on the Sept. 28 record  drug seizure.  </P> <P> Gates said, however, that help may not come immediately and cautioned against  expecting it at the expense of other significant narcotics distribution areas  in the country, such as Miami.  </P> <P> "We don't want to take resources from one area where they are doing a minimal  job," he said, "and spread them so thinly that we're not doing a good job  anywhere."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest Seizure  </P> <P> The Sylmar seizure, which included more than $12 million in cash, is the  largest anywhere, authorities said. Initially, the DEA said 20 tons was found  stashed in the Sylmar warehouse, but after weighing the contraband the agency  said the correct figure is just under 19 tons.  </P> <P> Gates and other local and state officials have said the large amount of drugs  was evidence that Los Angeles has become one of the nation's major narcotics  distribution centers.  </P> <P> Even before that seizure, members of California's congressional delegation and  others had called on the federal government to immediately designate Los  Angeles an official "high-intensity drug trafficking zone," making it eligible  for federal aid.  </P> <P> In Washington, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said Wednesday that he will ask  members of a House-Senate conference committee working out a national drug  spending plan to hurriedly give the designation to Los Angeles, San Diego and  the other border communities in California.  </P> <P> Levine's move was identical to one by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Monday  asking that the conferees compel the Bush Administration to name the areas as  drug zones by Nov. 1. Under current law, the Administration has until February  to make the designations. It has steadfastly refused to move up the date.  </P> <P> Don Hamilton, a spokesman for Bush's drug policy czar, William Bennett, said  last week there were no plans to send aid to Los Angeles immediately. "We  believe we need to approach the question of high-intensity drug trafficking  areas seriously, soberly, systematically," he said.  </P> <P> Gates told the City Council on Wednesday that he had talked to Bennett  immediately after the Sylmar seizure and was left feeling confident that Los  Angeles would eventually get the designation.  </P> <P> Separately, DEA agents in Texas, using search warrants, raided five El Paso  homes belonging to suspects in the case -- including that of Hector Tapia  Anchondo, 38, son of Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, of Juarez, the alleged leader of  the cocaine-smuggling operation. Both men were arrested in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The search of Anchondo's home yielded what agents described as an inventory  list documenting receipts for hundreds of kilos of cocaine in September. They  also found a half pound of marijuana and a small handgun.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Cathleen Decker in Los Angeles and Louis Sahagun in El  Paso, Tex., contributed to this story.  </P></p>

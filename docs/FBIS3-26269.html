Governor He Zhiqiang relayed the  instructions of the provincial government's seventh executive  meeting and arranged work for the first quarter of this year.    He Zhiqiang said: On the morning of 31 January, the  provincial government held the seventh executive meeting to  discuss work for the first quarter of this year. The basic  principle for the work in 1994, under the guidance of Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, is to  comprehensively implement the instructions of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, speed up the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure, maintain sustained, speedy, and  healthy development of the national economy, preserve political  stability, and promote overall social progress. According to  this basic principle, in the first quarter of this year, we  should focus on eight tasks.    First, we should seriously sum up our work in 1993, fully  confirm our achievements, find out shortcomings, and proceed  with our work in 1994 enthusiastically with a scientific  attitude.    Second, we should continue to combat corruption in  government  institutions. Yunnan has made certain achievements in combating  corruption. [passage omitted]    Third, we should serious resolve new situations and new  problems since the introduction of reform measures. The  provincial government has formed 14 special groups on housing  and price system reform, the salary of retired personnel, and  other issues, to discuss the relevant problems and resolve them  as soon as possible.    Fourth, we should do a good job in the construction of  irrigation projects and in late autumn crop management to reap a  good harvest.    Fifth, we should ensure market supplies and maintain price  stability.    Sixth, we should pay close attention to arranging the lives  and production of the people in disaster-stricken areas.    Seventh, we should make a success of industrial production  and communications development, bring about a comprehensive  balance in funding, power supply, and transportation, and ensure  power supplies for the people during the Spring Festival.    Eighth, to usher in the upcoming second session of the  eighth  provincial people's congress and the second session of the  seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, we should make all necessary  arrangements.    Zhang Baoshan, member of the provincial party committee's  Standing Committee, as well as Vice Governors Niu Shaoyao and  Wang Bingsheng attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei makes modest gain on arbitrage EQUITIES moved in a narrow range ahead of talks between the Group of Seven finance ministers, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher in quiet trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed up 45.96 at 16,953.35, fractionally lower on the week, after moving between 16,884.82 and 16,985.55. Share prices were led by futures trading, rising at the close on arbitrage buying. Volume remained flat at 250m shares against 258m. Gains led losses by 490 to 459 with 188 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.01 to 1,284.21. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.34 to 1,033.23. While some uncertainty remains over the currency markets and direction of the yen after the G7 meeting, traders said that the stock market is likely to remain around 17,000 for another two to three weeks. Exporting companies, recently hit by the rising yen, gained ground on bargain hunting, while some dealers started to select beneficiaries of the proposed additional emergency fiscal package. Leading electronics makers firmed. Hitachi rose Y17 to Y691, NEC advanced Y14 to Y638 and TDK rose Y100 to Y3,230. Aids-related stocks, which had been sold on liquidation of margin positions, rebounded on bargain hunting. Green Cross rose Y20 to Y1,170 and Okamoto Industries advanced Y24 to Y1,000. Showa Shell Sekiyu, the most active issue of the day, fell Y24 to Y801 following Thursday's resignation of the company president, Mr Takeshi Henmi, taking responsibility for its Y125bn foreign exchange losses. Property companies lost ground on reports of lower profit estimates. Mitsui Fudosan fell Y10 to Y980 and Mitsubishi Estate lost Y1 to Y899. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.72 to 18,105.61 in volume of 70.3m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets generally continued their firm performances. HONG KONG moved strongly ahead in heavy trading as hopes of a resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's future brought strong demand from foreign investors. The Hang Seng index rose 148.11 - 2.4 per cent higher on the day and 2.9 per cent on the week - to 6,351.99 in turnover that rose to HKDollars 4.57bn. HSBC Holdings, HKDollars 1.5 higher at HKDollars 65, and Hang Seng Bank, HKDollars 2 ahead at HKDollars 63, which will be among the first companies to announce annual results next month, led the active list. TAIWAN was also a strong performer as investors gave a broad welcome to the new cabinet and the market rose 2.9 per cent to a seven-month high. The weighted index added 121.75 to 4,278.63 or 9.3 per cent on the week in turnover of TDollars 68.5bn, the heaviest since May 1991. Financial shares were actively sought on the view that the new finance minister Lin Chen-kuo would resist efforts to resume privatisations in the banking sector. AUSTRALIA was revived after a quiet start by the expiry of almost 52m options, which helped the All Ordinaries index to pick up from an early decline to close 2.7 higher at 1,609.6, 0.9 per cent higher on the week. Among issues in which options were exercised, News Corp and TNT each closed 1 cent lower at ADollars 7.46 and 73 cents respectively, while Fletcher Challenge rose 2 cents to ADollars 1.82. SINGAPORE retreated after three record sessions as investors awaited details of the budget which came after the market closed. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 16.46 to 1,664.50, 1.5 per cent higher on the week. Inchcape, which announced on Thursday that it was selling its timber business, fell 85 cents to SDollars 6.25 in volume of 2.96m shares.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Investors may lose corporate perks Under the new rolling settlements system private investors in dozens of British companies risk losing their corporate perks - which range from the sublime to the ridiculous and include discounts on air travel, beer, dry cleaning and jewellery. According to Mr Justin Urquhart Stewart, marketing director at Barclays Stockbrokers, the threat arises because many companies refuse to extend the perks to shareholders who use so-called nominee accounts to hold their shares. Under the new rolling settlements system private investors will find trading far easier if they place their shares with a nominee company of their stockbroker, which will ensure that shares and payments are delivered on time. Mr Urquhart Stewart said his firm, which has more than 100,000 clients in nominee accounts, is peeved about the matter. It has prepared a list of companies which will not extend perks to nominee account shareholders. Alexanders Holdings, owners of a string of Ford dealerships, gives holders of 2,000 or more shares a 2 per cent discount plus negotiated cash discount on motor vehicles. Bellway, the housebuilder, gives those who hold 1,000 shares for a year a discount of Pounds 600 per Pounds 25,000 off the price of a new home. Holders of at least 100 shares in Bentalls, the department store chain, are entitled to up to Pounds 25 in discount vouchers for use at its outlets. British Airways gives investors with 200 or more shares discount vouchers on flights. Discounted beer and wine are available to investors in Greene King and Sons, Allied-Lyons, Eldridge Pope, Merrydown and Whitbread. More esoteric perks are available from Sketchley, allowing investors to take advantage of a 25 per cent discount on dry cleaning, World of Leather, which gives its shareholders a 10 per cent discount on furniture, and Specialeyes, which gives a 10 per cent discount to shareholders who arrange to buy two pairs of spectacles. London International Group, the condom maker, offers what it delicately describes as 'a small box of the company's products' to all those attending the annual meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Let's go to Guido Dell'Acquila at the parliament  building in order to get the first political reactions to the  government list.    [Dell'Acquila] Even before the list of ministers was  officially released, Roberto Maroni from the Northern League  agreed to comment on his appointment as interior minister. He  said that it was not a victory for the Northern League, but one  for the entire ruling coalition. He added that the Northern  League had asked for those ministries which were essential to  carry out its plan for reform.    Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance, said that  the Berlusconi government signals the end of the First Republic  and the beginning of an ideological swing to the right. He  added that the government's priority objectives are the relaunch  of the economy and social solidarity.    The comments of Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Party of  the Democratic Left, were scathing. He said that the contents  of the letter which President Scalfaro sent to Silvio Berlusconi  revealed that the country's democracy has reached an alarming  state and its safeguarding -- as underlined by Scalfaro --  should not be consigned to the vacuous reassurances of  Berlusconi, but to permanent vigilance.    That's all for now.</p>

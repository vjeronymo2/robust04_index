The organization said that  it would temporarily suspend its activity pending the High  Court's ruling.    Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that in its  announcement, the Kakh movement asserted that all its activity  had been carried out within the framework of the law.    Justice Minister David Liba'i said that the Justice Ministry  was currently preparing an amendment to the Antiterror Act  according to which the judiciary, and not the Israeli  Government, would be made responsible for declaring which groups  constituted terrorist organizations.    Here are some reactions to the cabinet's decision to declare  the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements terrorist organizations: PLO  official Abu-al-'Ala' said that although this constituted a  positive step, it was too little in relation to the enormity of  the Hebron massacre. Likud Knesset Member [MK] Mikha'el Eytan  said that the decision came too late. Such a decision, he said,  should already have been made by earlier Likud governments.  Mikha'el Eytan added that many people had been led astray by  these movements.    The Committee of Arab Local Councils welcomed the decision  but said that it was not enough. The settlers should be taken  out of Hebron and those capable of harming the fabric of  relations between Jews and Arabs should be disarmed.    Uri Ari'el, the secretary general of the Council of Jewish  Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, said that  the decision should have been made by a court and not by the  executive level.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'YOU GUYS' DRAWS ICY REPLY  </P> <P> An appearance before the state Supreme Court caused momentary embarrassment for  an embarrassing note for an Orange County prosecutor Wednesday. Deputy Dist.  Atty. Thomas J. Borris, arguing in a drug-related death case, at one point  addressed the justices as "you guys."  </P> <P> "When you say, 'you guys,' to whom are you referring?" Chief Justice Malcolm M.  Lucas asked icily.  </P> <P> Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the lone woman on the court, asked, "Does that  include me?"  </P> <P> The prosecutor quickly apologized and the court returned to the issues at hand.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER COMES BACK  </P> <P> Referring to Peter Greenberg's June 17 article on tourism in the Prince William  Sound ("Visitors Begin to Return to Alaska After Spill"), Whittier is an  isolated community. Indeed it is true to its claim to be "unique even to  Alaska."  </P> <P> And yes, several buildings in Whittier are in shabby disrepair or simply  abandoned.  </P> <P> However, your article gave complete disregard to some outstanding efforts by  individuals in Whittier to make the town an attractive and pleasant day-trip  for tourists. The quayside is lined with several quaint shops -- gift shop and  visitors center, not to mention a small fish-and-chips shop that produces the  best seafood dinners in the Sound. The Kayak rental agency accommodates the  most adventurous groups. There are also some very beautiful and challenging  hiking trails.  </P> <P> The town does not pretend to be sophisticated, but your comments on Whittier  gave scant regard for the positive claims of this rather unusual little town  and its enterprising residents.  </P> <P> INA HAWKINS  </P> <P> Whittier, Alaska  </P></p>

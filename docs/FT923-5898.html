			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Modest recovery for sterling STERLING recouped  3/4 pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, following the Bank of England's most aggressive intervention on the foreign exchanges since 1986, writes James Blitz. After an extraordinary day of trading on the sterling/ D-Mark cross, the pound closed at DM2.7950, nearly two pfennigs above its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. Some dealers estimated that the Bank had bought around Pounds 1bn in sterling in the morning, more than has been spent in any previous daily interventions to support the dollar by the world's central banks. But many believed that the UK authorities still faced the prospect of raising interest rates. In the first hours of London trading, the pound was supported by a statement from the UK chancellor that there would be no devaluation. Aggressive intervention followed. The pound rose above the DM2.7900 level, but fell sharply after a Bundesbank council member said a realignment of the ERM was possible.

Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, believes the pound is suffering from a fundamental restructuring of currency portfolios by pension funds. 'A few institutions are now hedging themselves against the possibility that there will be a realignment,' he said. The dollar held its ground against the German currency in spite of a larger than expected fall in US durable goods orders of 3.4 per cent. It lost nearly  1/2 pfennig in early US trading on the news but closed at DM1.4065 in London, up 65 basis points on the day. In New York the dollar finally stood at DM1.4067. But Mr O'Neill said central banks had missed a good opportunity to rally the dollar through intervention after the Swiss franc had lost ground in the morning. 'Intervention would have bid the dollar up,' he said, 'but it never came.'</p>

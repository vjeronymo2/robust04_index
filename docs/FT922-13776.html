			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Chevron freezes pay levels CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, yesterday said it had frozen the pay of Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman and chief executive, and other officers and personnel as part of the company's cost-cutting programme. Mr Derr said the pay freeze, at 1991 levels, took effect on April 1 and would remain for at least three months. In addition, bonuses tied to Chevron's annual performance were significantly lower. Chevron, which had a difficult fourth quarter, said it would cut capital and exploratory spending by 11 per cent this year to Dollars 4.7bn. Cost-cutting is expected to reduce operating expenses by at least Dollars 600m by the third quarter of 1993. In addition, Chevron is shifting the focus of its upstream activities overseas. 'The oil business is mostly moving overseas, partly by choice, but mostly because we have no choice,' said Mr Derr. 'High potential areas for finding new reserves are now off-limits to us.' Mr Derr said the company expected to raise as much as Dollars 700m from the sale of existing oil and gas fields in the US. On Wall Street, shares in Chevron fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 64 7/8 in a declining market.</p>

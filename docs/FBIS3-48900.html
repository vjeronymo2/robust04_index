			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 29 (ANTARA) -- Finance Minister Mar'ie  Muhammad said Saturday the government's step to secure U.S.$400  million worth of external standby loans is not related to the  collapse of crude price.    "Neither is it needed to strengthen the position of the  country's foreign exchange reserves which currently stand at  U.S.$12 billion," the minister said after a meeting with  President Suharto.    The Indonesian Government is now seeking foreign funds as a  standby loan that can be cashed any time when needed.    The central bank, Bank Indonesia, (BI) has given a mandate  to  six foreign banks to provide the syndicated loan.    The six foreign banks are Chase Manhattan, the Industrial  Bank of Japan, the Bank of Tokyo, Banque Nationale de Paris,  Dresdner Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank.    Mar'ie Muhammad said that the government's effort to get  standby loan is just a normal thing so that there is no need to  kick a fuss about. Explaining the background of the need to  secure a standby loan, the minister said that a government -- or  state-owned project -- usually gets export credits about 80-85  percent of the project's total value only.    "The remaining 15-20 percent should be covered by the  government itself," he said, adding that "We can use our own  funds but they could reduce our foreign exchange reserves."    The external export credits are never enough to finance  government's projects, he added.    For the first two-year period, the interest rate of the loan  is set at 0.75 above the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR)  and in the third year the rate will be increased to 0.875  percent.    Carrying a five-year gcece period, the loan will be repaid  in  five phases in every six months.    The agreement on the loan will be signed in March.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC's Financial Operations Department (``FOD'') will have primary responsibility for the new debt collection procedures in this rule, including applying amounts recovered by administrative offset to multiple debts, requesting offset by other agencies, and processing requests for offset from other agencies. However, ascertaining the indebtedness and providing notice to the debtor and administrative review will continue to be handled by the organizational unit with functional responsibility for the type of claim involved, including, where applicable, review by the Appeals Board (see &sect;2606.1(b) (5) through (9)). (Applicable assignments of responsibilities are set forth in the mission and functions statements issued by the Executive Director and included (along with organization charts) in the PBGC Directives Manual as section 30&hyph;1 of Part GA (General Administration).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26467), the PBGC proposed to add part 2609, Debt Collection_Administrative Offset, to its regulations (29 CFR part 2609). The PBGC received no comments on proposed part 2609. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of this final rule are identical to those proposed. However, in the near future the PBGC expects to issue an interim final rule on tax refund offset (as anticipated in the agency's semiannual regulatory agenda (59 FR 58424, 58429, November 14, 1994)). Because the PBGC plans to add its tax refund offset procedures to part 2609 (as subpart C), it is designating all but the definitions section of the proposed administrative offset regulations as subpart B (and substituting ``subpart'' for ``part''). (The terms in &sect;2609.2 are included in a general subpart A.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in response to a letter from the Small Business Administration, the PBGC is reiterating its certification that sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) do not apply to this action, with an expanded explanation of the reasons for such certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E.O. 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866 because the rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. The purpose of the rule is to enhance the PBGC's debt collection ability. The procedures will be triggered only by a failure to pay a debt already owed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

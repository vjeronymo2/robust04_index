			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kemira prepares to fulfil ambition - Sell-off plans are nearing completion Ten years ago Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, asked to be privatised. This autumn, after considerable political hesitancy and a few market hiccups, it hopes finally to achieve its ambition. The company, Finland's eighth largest by sales, wants to raise up to FM2bn (Dollars 361m) in what would be the biggest issue in the country's accelerating privatisation programme. The bulk of the shares will be offered to international and Finnish institutions (although there will also be a retail tranche), cutting state ownership from 100 per cent to as little as 68.4 per cent. The launch date has still to be finalised, but October looks the most likely month following publication of the group's eight-month figures. Much will depend on the state of the markets. Given recent bond and equity market volatility, some analysts fear the group may be forced to compromise on the size of the offer or price. They note a sudden rush of big Finnish share issues - Nokia, the telecommunications group, and Outokumpu, the mining and metals group, are currently seeking up to FM4bn between them - which may sap international demand for Finnish shares. If Mr Heimo Karinen, Kemira chief executive, is nervous about unsettled markets, he is not showing it. He argues that Kemira has done a lot to put its house in order and a cyclical upturn in its main businesses is imminent. The group embarked on a ambitious acquisition programme in the late 1980s, buying many companies at high prices, just before the market headed downwards. The impact on the balance sheet has been stark: net debt has soared to FM8bn and the group's equity-to-assets ratio has sunk to 17 per cent. The sell-off is designed to strengthen the company's capital structure, as it and not the state will garner the proceeds. The main aim is to get the equity-to-assets ratio above 30 per cent. But Kemira also wants access to equity capital. Inability to do this in the 1980s forced it to borrow heavily and explains today's balance sheet weakness. If the issue does go ahead, investors' main concern is likely to be the company's Agro division, which accounted for 48 per cent of 1993 sales and has not made a profit since 1990. In common with other leading fertiliser manufacturers, Kemira has been badly hurt by market overcapacity and a flood of imports from eastern Europe. West European fertiliser demand is still declining by an average of 2 per cent a year. Mr Karinen admits that Agro will make another loss this year, but he says there are clear signs of a market upturn in Europe, helped by a reduced flow of imports from eastern Europe. In any case, Agro's relative importance is dwindling fast. Kemira's growth areas are speciality chemicals and titanium dioxide (a pigment used primarily to make paint), where it has strong market positions. Two particularly strong niches are water treatment chemicals, where it is Europe's number one, and pulp and paper chemicals. Kemira says many of its businesses are starting to benefit from cyclical economic recovery, mainly through higher volumes. But it also believes the strength of its competitive position has been enhanced following heavy rationalisation, currency depreciation and a sharp cutback in capital expenditure. These factors helped the group to record a FM149.5m net income after taxes in 1993, after two years of heavy losses. Mr Karinen says Kemira's cost-cutting has been more vigorous than any of its main European competitors, partly because it had more to do than its rivals following its acquisition programme but partly because it acted earlier. The group has cut around 28 per cent of its workforce since 1990, bringing staff numbers down to 11,000. Currency factors have also assisted the group's revival as more than half of its production is based in Finland, Sweden and the UK. The currencies of all three countries have depreciated sharply over the past two years. The group has also learned from past mistakes. Its heavy acquisition and investment programme means cash flow after investments was negative from 1984 until 1991. Only in the past two years has it been positive, following a sharp reduction in capital expenditure. The target is to achieve a positive cash flow after capital expenditure of at least FM500m a year, which the company says should be sufficient for further investments.</p>

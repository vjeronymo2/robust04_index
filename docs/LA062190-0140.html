			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME;  </P> <P> SALAZAR REPLACES JARAMILLO FOR NORTH  </P> <P> Jose Salazar, an offensive lineman from Servite High School, has replaced  Valencia's Paul Jaramillo on the North roster for the Orange County all-star  football game, North Coach Tom Meiss said Wednesday.  </P> <P> When Meiss learned that Jaramillo had decided on Wednesday not to play, he did  not hesitate to call Salazar, 5 feet 10 and 190 pounds.  </P> <P> "Earlier this year, Jose read in the paper that he had been nominated for the  team and wrote me a nice note thanking me," Meiss said. "It broke my heart when  I called him and told him he was only nominated for the team and hadn't  actually made it. I told him if anyone dropped out, he would be my first  choice."  </P> <P> The North team started practicing Monday for the all-star game, which will be  July 6 at Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. The South team will begin  practice Monday.  </P> <P> "We're just out there in shorts going through blocking drills," Meiss said.  "The kids are looking good and have a good work attitude. The only thing I'm  disappointed with is some kids are saying at the last minute that they can't  play."  </P> <P> Meiss said Los Alamitos' Erik Mitchell has been practicing at cornerback as  well as running back, his usual position. Mitchell, 5-10 and 165 pounds, has  signed a letter of intent to play at Colorado next season.  </P> <P> "We want the kids to experiment at other positions," Meiss said. "Erik said he  wanted to try it."  </P></p>

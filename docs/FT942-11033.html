			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Still in a deep hole It is a year since Mr Kenneth Clarke confessed that the government was in a 'dreadful hole'. The chancellor, who was home secretary at the time, was reflecting on the dismal Conservative performance at last May's local elections. Those contests enabled the electorate to express an opinion on the ejection of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. Voters indicated their deep dissatisfaction with the performance of the administration that was elected in April 1992. Labour did well, but the most significant beneficiaries were the Liberal Democrats. Following this year's local elections, all the change - from the government's point of view - is for the worse. The hole that threatens to engulf the prime minister and perhaps his party with him is deeper. On Thursday the Tories came fourth in Scotland, and only just matched the Liberal Democrats in the rest of the country. They were trounced in and around London. Their estimated share of the total popular vote, at some 27 per cent, reflects recent opinion poll results. This is the most unpopular Conservative government in post-1945 history. The expectation is that there are worse shocks to come. The Liberal Democrats are favourites to take Eastleigh from the Conservatives in a forthcoming by-election. If this week's performance in the local contests is repeated at next month's European elections, the Tories could face a wipe-out of Canadian proportions, with Labour winning a preponderance of seats and the Liberal Democrats mopping up most of the rest. Since the Conservatives remain deeply divided about Britain's proper place in the European Community, this is possible. British sovereignty There are in effect two Conservative parties. One believes that Britain must, in the last resort, adapt to the continental consensus. The other regards such a strategy as surrendering British sovereignty. These convictions are ultimately irreconcilable. For the moment the Conservative coalition is being held together by thin rhetoric. Decisions on intractable matters such as a single currency are postponed, while on everyday affairs the governmment asserts that it will 'stand up for Britain' while remaining 'at the heart of Europe'. In short, today's party may be unleadable. Yet Mr John Major's leadership is once again under question. If it could be demonstrated that the prime minister was personally responsible for the loss of public support for the Conservatives, and that one of his colleagues could do the job better, he might reasonably conclude that he should step down. This is not, however, the case. None of the contenders for the job - not Mr Michael Heseltine, nor Mr Michael Portillo, nor Mr Kenneth Clarke, would guarantee a permanent end to internecine strife. The government is out of favour for a variety of reasons, only one of which is the well-known list of misfortunes and inept decisions for which Mr Major alone may be said to be responsible. Prolonged recession The Tories' counter-inflation strategy, which has been effective, brought about a prolonged recession. Recovery is slow. The statistics are pointing to better times, but the resurgence of growth is not being felt by a sufficient number of people to make a difference. The housing market is recovering, but only gradually. Real incomes, net of tax, are rising imperceptibly, if at all. Taxation, which Mr Major promised in 1992 would not be increased, has been raised by the largest amount in peacetime memory. Yet the performance of the opposition is not quite as threatening as it looks. The Liberal Democrats will have to be taken more seriously if they win in Eastleigh and do well in the European elections, but they have a long way to go. Labour's tally on Thursday, at about 41 per cent of the vote, fell short of its opinion poll ratings of 47 and 48 per cent. The party's leader, Mr John Smith, is apparently content to watch the Conservatives tear themselves apart. This could be a fatal error. On Thursday it worked in places like Croydon, but not everywhere. When the next general election comes, southern voters will want a reason, and one they can believe, for trusting Labour. Meanwhile, Mr Major should slow down. If he reshuffles his cabinet in July he should do so without appearing to panic. Competence should be preferred to party balance. Mr John Patten has run out of rope at education, and may not be suitable for any other department. Mr Michael Howard has not been a successful home secretary, but he is too big a player to be relegated. Mrs Virginia Bottomley is no longer useful at health. Mr Portillo should be tried out in a department, while Mr Stephen Dorrell, Mr Brian Mawhinney, Mr David Davis, and Mr Jonathan Aitken should be brought in to the cabinet. Beyond that, the government would do best to try a period of quiet, competent, administration. It is counter-productive to invent a new wheeze every other Tuesday. When in a hole, it is advisable to stop digging.</p>

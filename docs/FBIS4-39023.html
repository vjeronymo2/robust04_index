			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Panov said  that the treaty between the ex-USSR and Russia [as received]  evidently was not in line with the present realities and could  no longer exist as it was. He said that the treaty would expire  in two years. "In accordance with this document, one party must  notify the other on its intention to extend or not to extend the  treaty. This means we still have a year," Panov stressed.    Panov said that Russia had already proposed to North Korea  to  review the treaty. "That is to say the message to Pyongyang has  already been sent," he concluded.    Moscow does not rule out that the issue concerning sanctions  against North Korea could be submitted for consideration of the  UN Security Council, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry First  Asian Department Mikhail Beliy said in an interview with  Interfax today.    Bely said that the matter was becoming serious since  Pyongyang was refusing to negotiate with the International  Atomic Energy Agency on reloading the nuclear reactor.    Bely pointed out that sanctions were the last resort. "In  principle, sanctions could be imposed. However, all other  political opportunities must be exhausted before this," he  remarked.    Bely believes that not every method has as yet been applied  to influence Pyongyang. "After the talks between North Korea and  the U.S.A. failed, the Russian initiative on an international  conference on security and non-nuclear status of the Korean  peninsula was high on the agenda. I think the time has come to  try to settle this issue on the whole," he underlined.    Commenting on the future of the treaty between ex-USSR and  North Korea (since Russia was the legal successor of the USSR),  Beliy said, "The first provision of this treaty providing for  assistance to Pyongyang in case of an aggression against it is  not really in force. Only in case of a non-provoked aggression  against North Korea will we establish how much it conforms with  our understanding of the treaty. We will be thinking how to  amend the document."</p>

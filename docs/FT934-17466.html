			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Changeover at the Bundesbank: Tietmeyer - high priest of hard money / FT writers report on the significance of today's handover of the Bundesbank presidency. For the guests gathered amid the dignified surroundings of Frankfurt's Palm House, the key issue can be summed up in one word - power IN A grandiloquent ceremony of speech-making and chamber music in Frankfurt today, Mr Hans Tietmeyer takes the helm of the institution which has become the dominant force in European economic policy-making. The audience for his inaugural address as president of the German Bundesbank will include Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a dozen foreign central bank governors, and top names in German business and finance. In attendance, too, will be several of Mr Tietmeyer's eight surviving brothers and sisters from his clannishly Catholic birthplace in Westphalia, on the north German plains. For many of the 750 guests in the dignified botanical surroundings of the 19th century Palm House in Frankfurt, the key issue can be summed up in one word: power. As Germany struggles with its deepest post-war recession, and the EC weathers the aftermath of the summer monetary crisis, how Mr Tietmeyer deploys the Bundesbank's might is a question that occupies the whole of Europe. Of massive build and earnest countenance, Mr Tietmeyer, 62, a one-time altar boy, aspired in his youth to become a priest. Mr Tietmeyer believes that the Bundesbank's authority is spiritual as well as temporal. It stems from moral prowess as well as economic muscle. At present, however, Europe is experiencing pain rather than salvation from the Bundesbank's crusade to stem the inflationary consequences of German unification. At the pinnacle of a 30-year career near to the apex of German policy-making, Mr Tietmeyer has acquired a fearsome reputation for tireless intellect and missionary zeal. He knows that, today, his words will be weighed with unusual attention well beyond united Germany's borders. Those expecting significant changes from the Bundesbank are, however, likely to be disappointed. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, the Dresdner Bank chairman, sums up the general feeling: 'I expect the continuation of a solid monetary policy aimed at preserving stability.' Mr Tietmeyer has been a member of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats since 1960. He joined the Bonn Economics Ministry in 1962, the penultimate year of the stewardship of Mr Ludwig Erhard, the economics minister during the post-war 'economic miracle'. He served for eight years as state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry when Mr Kohl took over from Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1982. He went to the Bundesbank in 1990, and in August 1991 he became Bundesbank vice-president under Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who officially bows out at today's ceremony. A man who can appear in turn both outspoken and enigmatic, Mr Tietmeyer displays the best-known characteristic of his native Westphalia: stubbornness. He prefers, however, to call the quality 'steadfastness' or 'persistence'. And he can combine it, where necessary, with subtlety, eloquence and flexibility. His true feelings are often a mystery. Professor Karl Schiller, economics minister between 1966 and 1972, who built up a good relationship with Mr Tietmeyer, calls him 'an extrovert'. On the other hand, one Frankfurt banker who knows him well calls him humourless and impersonal - 'a cold fish'. In negotiations, he switches character depending on whether he is speaking compliantly, in English, or aggressively, in German. Perhaps because of this, the verdict of Mr Anthony Loehnis, a former international director at the Bank of England  - who converses with Mr Tietmeyer in English - is flattering. 'Unlike many Germans,' says Mr Loehnis, 'he has a sense of humour.' Mr Tietmeyer combines Mr Schlesinger's economic expertise with the political skills and international experience of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the previous president, who resigned in 1991 after a row with Mr Kohl over financing German unification. An adviser from a large US investment fund who knows Mr Tietmeyer well says: 'He is much more internationally and politically sensitive than Schlesinger, with a clear sense of the inter-connections between Germany and the rest of Europe and the rest of the world . . . He has a sense of things which Schlesinger never talked of except when referring to Tietmeyer speeches.' So far at the Bundesbank he has been highly cautious. In contrast to both Mr Schlesinger and Mr Pohl, he has not so far upset the foreign exchange markets through careless remarks on the D-Mark - an achievement in which he takes some pride. On the other hand, Mr Tietmeyer is well known for his penchant for lecturing people (including, on occasion, Mr Kohl) and for bluntness in international gatherings. He shows most irritation when Italian officials reprimand the Germans over excess government spending. During the ERM crisis meetings two months ago in Brussels, he announced sarcastically that the French appeal for unlimited intervention to save the franc was tantamount to asking for the Bundesbank to be closed down. He finds his belief in the virtues of free enterprise best expressed by Mr Erhard's doctrine of the social market economy - where a capitalist state, with a controlled 'safety net' for the underprivileged, is held as the best method of maintaining social stability. There is a touch of piety in an autobiographical note written for his leaving examination in 1952 at the Catholic high school he attended in Munster not far from his birthplace. The young Tietmeyer declared himself 'interested in public life' and eager 'to build up the state (of the federal republic).' As a 22-year-old, he started to study theology before switching to philosophy and economics. Dr Wilhelm Schmulling, aged 80, Mr Tietmeyer's former class teacher, remembers him as 'hard-working' and 'co-operative' but adds: 'I never thought he would become Bundesbank president.' Mr Tietmeyer likes to stress a strong ethical dimension to Bundesbank policies. Comparing the differences between the UK's relatively settled history, and Germany's past vicissitudes, Mr Tietmeyer once said: 'You have the House of Lords, the Queen and your established traditions. . . We have the Bundesbank as our pillar of stability.' Mr Heinrich Tietmeyer, a younger brother, himself a priest, says the new Bundesbank president believes that 'keeping the D-Mark stable is part of keeping people stable'. Mr Tietmeyer has the reputation and the appearance of a quintessential hard money man; the Bundesbank's traditions, indeed, allow him little doctrinal leeway. But if Germany's 3.6m unemployment continues to rise, his personal dilemma over the need to cut interest rates may be more acute than generally recognised. However, as a sign of Mr Tietmeyer's relative flexibility on interest rates, he suggested a  1/4 point cut in the German discount rate at the crucial meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council on July 29. This was designed to help counter pressure on the French franc. Mr Tietmeyer's proposal, backed by several other members of the council, was turned down, however, by Mr Schlesinger. As this example illustrates, Mr Tietmeyer faces a formidable array of tasks. He must bring down Germany's unusually high 4 per cent inflation rate and keep the D-Mark stable, at a time when many economists believe German industry's competitiveness problems warrant a lower currency level. He must use his influence with Mr Kohl to help restore order to Germany's public finances, and at the same time attempt to build EC monetary co-operation. He must also win co-operation from the Bundesbank's sometimes fractious 16-man policy-making council, where each member has the same one vote as the president. Mr Otto Schlecht, a former state secretary at the Economics Ministry, says Mr Tietmeyer's capacity for hard work can be a weakness. 'He has a problem in working in a team. . . He doesn't delegate.' He warns Mr Tietmeyer against trying to 'dominate' the Bundesbank council. 'Otherwise, they will become obstinate.' He does not come to the job untrained or without connections. Among his former political proteges are Mr Johannes Ludewig, the economic adviser to Chancellor Kohl, Mr Horst Kohler, his successor as state secretary in the finance ministry - who now presides over the German savings bank federation  -and Mr Gert Haller, the ministry's present state secretary. He played a leading role in drawing up Bonn's policies on economic and monetary union (Emu) during the past two decades. His work on early EC plans for Emu in 1970-72 convinced him that monetary union would only be feasible if Community states showed far more convergence, not just in economic policies and performance, but in economic structures. In 1982, he was the main author of a strategy paper by the then economics minister, Mr Otto Lambsdorff, which warned that welfare spending under Mr Schmidt's government was threatening to run out of control. This paper contributed to the collapse of Mr Schmidt's coalition. In 1988, he escaped an assassination attempt outside his house in a Bonn suburb. In 1990, he was chosen by Mr Kohl to lead negotiations on the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany. By prompting the collapse of industry east of the Elbe, necessitating massive fiscal transfers to eastern Germany, the terms of the 1990 accord greatly contributed to the sharp rise in the German budget deficit which the Bundesbank now so abhors. He has since admitted that mistakes were made in the unity deal - but adds that, if Bonn had pressed for full disclosure of the east German economic malaise, the political will for unity would have ebbed. Mr Tietmeyer's former actions in Bonn have an echo in other policy areas, too. Mr Kohl's latest appeals for 'solidarity' to finance German unity bear marks of Mr Tietmeyer's thinking from the late 1960s, when he consistently argued for 'social dialogue' between the forces of capital, labour and politics. On the international economic circuit, Mr Tietmeyer has been almost equally active. 'He is one of the big men of his time,' says one senior international economic official. Since 1990, Mr Tietmeyer has chaired meetings of the so-called 'working party three' of central bankers and treasury officials at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. According to Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, 'he was one of the best chairmen I remember', although he could occasionally be 'a bit harsh'. Over the EC's negotiations on Emu, Mr Tietmeyer will be 'extraordinarily vigilant', according to one top Bonn official. One area in which, embarrassingly for the Bank of England, he was proved right concerned Britain's entry to the ERM in October 1990. At the outset, Mr Tietmeyer - like Mr Pohl - forcefully told the UK government that the pound's level against the D-Mark was too high. When sterling was forced out of the ERM in September 1992, his argument seemed to have carried the day. His relationship with the main advocate of Emu, Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, is adversarial - partly reflecting Mr Tietmeyer's period in 1984-87 as chairman of the EC monetary committee, when Mr Delors would undermine positions taken by the committee. Over the 'convergence criteria' laid down to guide the path to Emu under the Maastricht treaty, the Bonn official says: 'He will be very, very attentive to any deviations from the path of Islam. . . He is completely humourless on the subject of Emu.' His concern about monetary union is that only the 'right countries' should join, the official adds. Despite the summer upheavals, the EC still plans to go ahead with the so-called stage two of Emu next year, under which a new European Monetary Institute will be set up to co-ordinate EC monetary policy. However, Mr Tietmeyer's basic aim is to ensure that stage two will not water down the Bundesbank's autonomy to set German monetary policy as it sees fit. Although he sees the advantages of exchange rate stability, he said recently his main commitment is to internal rather than external monetary stability. Of crucial importance will be Mr Tietmeyer's relationship with Mr Kohl. Mr Tietmeyer acted as the chancellor's 'sherpa' preparing economic summits during the 1980s. But, partly because of his propensity for sermonising, the chancellor got on better with Mr Tietmeyer's successor as finance ministry state secretary, the more emotional Mr Horst Kohler. Hopes - or fears - that Mr Kohl will have an undue influence on Mr Tietmeyer are, however, unlikely to be realised. 'It is accepted by everyone that he is a Bundesbank man,' says one central banker. Mr Kohl knows that any attempt to put overt pressure on Mr Tietmeyer is likely to be counter-productive. None the less, there remains a lingering feeling that the relationship between Bonn and Frankfurt will be closer than in the past. According to a top Bonn official who is close to both Mr Kohl and the new Bundesbank president: 'Tietmeyer will forget his Bonn past - but only as much as he needs to.'</p>

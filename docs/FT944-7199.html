			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: BASF sees further strong growth BASF, the German chemicals group, expects a 50 per cent increase in pre-tax earnings to DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.03bn) this year, after profits more than trebled in the third quarter. Forecasting further growth for the coming two years, Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, said he expected his main objective - a 10 per cent return on capital - to be achieved in 1996. After that, he was counting on less pronounced expansion and increased competition in the closing years of the decade. Mr Strube yesterday announced a 99 per cent rise in earnings for the first nine months, to DM1.2bn, on sales up 7.6 per cent at DM32.4bn. Although the sharpness of the recovery was gratifying, he said he was not satisfied with profitability, and would press on with cost reductions. This would entail a further 4,000 job losses during 1995, following more cuts in the current year. Mr Strube said fixed costs had been cut by DM1.4bn in the past three years, and further economies worth DM100m had been made in the nine months to the end of September. Group payroll costs in the review period had fallen 3.3 per cent. He said the company would reinforce its less cyclical businesses - including pharmaceuticals, natural gas, plant protection and fine chemicals - as he noted continuing pressure on producer prices while raw material costs continued to rise. Pharmaceuticals sales are expected to rise by a third to DM3bn when negotiations to buy the drugs operations of Boots, the UK group, are concluded. Mr Strube said he expected the talks to be completed by the end of the year, and be followed by an integration programme. Apart from the geographical synergies between the two groups' drugs operations, he said Boots' blood pressure and diabetes treatments were especially interesting. Addressing workers' concerns over possible job losses, he said adjustments would be required on all sides. According to an interim report published yesterday, operating profits rose in all divisions except oil and gas, although earnings were once again reduced by extraordinary items, especially write-offs of plastics, fibres and consumer products plant in the US. North American sales rose 3 per cent in the review period and, while European sales increased 8.5 per cent, turnover in Germany fell 0.6 per cent. Asian, Australian and African sales showed the strongest growth, up 12 per cent.</p>

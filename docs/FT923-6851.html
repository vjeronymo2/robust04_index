			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Management: For Sir, a potato and a mineral water - Alan Friedman eats his way round Manhattan, where the in crowd is picking at its food The lavish lunch is less a part of doing business in New York these days than it used to be. Chalk it up to recession, to the new austerity of the 1990s, or to the need executives have for belt-tightening of the paunch-avoidance variety. This is not to say the era of business lunching is over. One merely needs to calibrate one's selection of restaurant and menu according to status and strategy. Many New Yorkers, starting with Wall Streeters, consider lunch an irritating interruption in their day. Hence, the uncivilised habit of having sandwiches or salads sent in, and scarfing them down in five bites with a can of Diet Coke. Deal makers in Manhattan are far more likely to favour a power breakfast, so don't be surprised if you are offered muesli, orange juice and watery coffee at 8 o'clock. At breakfast or lunch, it is perfectly acceptable, even desirable, to plunge right into the subject of your meeting. Remember: Americans are invariably more direct than their European counterparts and most have few qualms about spitting out their life histories in the first thirty seconds of a meeting. They also eat too fast, refrain from the filthy habit of smoking, and prefer mineral water to wine at midday. Different rules apply as one moves up the socio-economic ladder. The mid-level investment banker or industrial executive is still happy to tuck into decent nosh at a mid-town eatery. A chic, but not overly ostentatious, restaurant is The China Grill, a spacious venue furnished in Early Yuppie at 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue. If you want more ambience and really good northern Italian cuisine, try Paper Moon (58th Street between Madison and Park) or Sfuzzi (65th Street, just east of Broadway). Both are discreet places where you need not worry about being overheard - and they offer excellent focaccia, seafood and dry white Pinot Grigot. If, on the other hand, you want a statesman-like meeting place for a big deal or a little chat, the least known and most pleasant new venue in town is the roof bar and restaurant of The Peninsula (corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street). At the top of the power pile, and rather too fashionable for most businessmen except media and publishing types, are The Four Seasons and Le Cirque. These are the places to take a New Yorker if you wish to impress, but reservations should be made well in advance and the bill will make serious inroads into your expense account. As important as the venue, however, is the need to show your New York contact that you are wise to the health-conscious ways of contemporary American capitalism. Do not be shocked, therefore, if your luncheon companion sticks to a glass of Perrier and some grilled vegetables, followed by black coffee. Some British colleagues seemed taken aback recently when they sat in the Grill Room of The Four Seasons and watched their guest order and consume a glass of water and a single, lonely baked potato. One alternative, although available only by invitation from your host, is to sample some truly awful food along with masses of prestige in New York's version of St James's. If your contact proposes lunch at the Metropolitan Club, the University Club, or, better still, the Century, you must accept with pleasure and prepare for a meal that will make dining at the Reform Club seem like an epicurean treat. Finally, if you are with a good, old friend, and just want to combine business with fun, pop down to the venerable Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station for no-nonsense nosh. And, if you find yourself in the downtown area of the World Trade Center or Wall Street, there are three great, but little known, eateries in the SoHo and Greenwich Village districts. Garibaldi (corner of Mercer Street and Washington Place) is one of the best downtown Italian restaurants to have opened recently. Mezzogiorno (corner of Sullivan and Spring Streets) is also unpretentious and consistently good, although no credit cards here. Nor is plastic accepted at Felix (corner of West Broadway and Grand Street), a French-owned and managed bistro, newly opened in the heart of SoHo. So, armed with this briefing, head for New York, don't forget to make an obligatory remark about the dreadful state of the property market, speak unabashedly about business well before the coffee comes, and, above all, when ordering, just remember to keep it light.</p>

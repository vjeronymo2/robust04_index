			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian negotiator and East Jerusalem lawyer  Ziyad Abu-Zayyad says that Palestinians naturally view East  Jerusalem as the capital of the state they hope to establish.    [Begin recording] [Abu-Zayyad] East Jerusalem is a symbol  of the Palestinian nationality, of the Arab dignity, and of the  Islamic belief and faith. And, of course, it is viewed by us as  our future capital.    [Correspondent Mark Weiss] Can you confirm that the PLO is  engaged in efforts to continue moving national institutions to  East Jerusalem?    [Abu-Zayyad] Well, I think that the issue of Jerusalem is  supposed to be on the negotiating table in the second phase of  the negotiations, and I believe that this thing will be  discussed through negotiations. I don't think that the PLO will  move its offices to Jerusalem without negotiations and without  coordinating with the other side because at the end we need to  find a solution for Jerusalem which will be for the satisfaction  of all parties.    [Weiss] Israeli leaders, at the moment at least, insist that  Jerusalem will remain the united capital of Israel. Do you  believe Israel will eventually compromise on this issue?    [Abu-Zayyad] Well, of course yes. Of course I do, because  anyone who wants peace he knows deep in his heart that he cannot  have peace and have Jerusalem only under the Israeli  sovereignty.

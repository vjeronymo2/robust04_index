			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / GE Capital may control GPA for less than Dollars 300m GE CAPITAL may be able to exercise its option to take control of GPA Group for less than Dollars 300m (Pounds 194.8m), according to lenders of the troubled aircraft leasing company. GPA yesterday made the first payments due to bondholders after it received Dollars 100m in the form of a bridging loan from its core lenders. The group's board, which met yesterday, is confident that key shareholders will underwrite an additional loan worth up to Dollars 150m, which would be partially convertible into equity, enabling it to make payments to bondholders due by the end of June. Its banks have also agreed to extend their waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until the end of next month. The group still has to agree the price of the option allowing GE Capital to take 65 per cent of its equity, with the possibility of purchasing 80 per cent if certain conditions are fulfilled. Several of the group's lead bankers yesterday said that negotiations are currently being conducted within a price range of Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m. GPA would not comment. However, one of its advisers said the company believed GE Capital could be persuaded to pay more for a controlling stake. The final figure will not be paid until GE Capital exercises its option, which under the terms of the deal could be as late as March 31 1997. GE Capital is not expected to exercise its option in the short-term. GPA's bankers believe its agreement to purchase 45 aircraft for Dollars 1.35bn may be enough to guarantee its survival for up to 18 months. Up to Dollars 350m of the total amount GPA is receiving for the aircraft is in the form of progress payments or deposits that it forwarded to manufacturers when ordering the aeroplanes. If the deal with GE Capital goes ahead, this will now be repaid to GPA, bolstering its balance sheet. The group's banks have made it clear that they will not consider writing off any of their borrowings in the immediate future. One of GPA's lead bankers said: 'Any attempt to make the banks take a haircut would jeopardise the whole deal.' GPA's 138 lenders may agree to a further restructuring of the group's Dollars 5.23bn borrowings if the deal with GE Capital is completed.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECT ORDERS MEMBERS INTO BOMB SHELTERS;  </P> <P> SURVIVAL: CHURCH LEADERS SAY THEY NEEDED TO CONDUCT A PRACTICE RUN. TRAFFIC AND  SEWAGE PROBLEMS KEEP COUNTY OFFICIALS IN MONTANA BUSY.  </P> <P> Thousands of members of the controversial Church Universal and Triumphant, who  have been gathering in a Montana valley just north of Yellowstone National Park  in preparation for what they believe to be an impending nuclear attack, stunned  neighbors and kept law enforcement officials busy Thursday night and Friday  morning when they disappeared into about 45 newly constructed underground bomb  shelters.  </P> <P> Church members, who believe a nuclear strike from the Soviet Union could occur  between now and the end of April, flocked into the shelters Thursday night from  nearby Bozeman, Livingston, Gardiner, Corwin Springs and the member-owned  community of Glastonbury, after they got telephone calls from church leaders  asking them to go underground within three hours, church officials and  sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> In cars, buses and trucks, the church members, who make up about a third of the  12,000 residents of Park County, streamed down Highway 89 to a main shelter  that holds 750 members of the church's inner circle and to an estimated 44  other individually owned shelters, each of which holds from 6 to 125 people.  They were in the shelters by midnight and remained there until Friday morning,  officials said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> "The highway was filled with cars going into church property," said Park County  Undersheriff Lee Keto. "By 20 minutes after twelve, you could have shot a  cannon through there and not hit anything."  </P> <P> The exercise was the latest in a series of incidents that have fueled rumors  and fears among local residents and relatives of church members that the  organization is preparing to go underground indefinitely. Church members have  been stocking the shelters, closing bank accounts, selling off their personal  belongings and buying large quantities of clothing, bedding and medication.  </P> <P> Church leaders, however, have said they are preparing for an event they hope  never occurs and that members will go underground only if there is a nuclear  assault.  </P> <P> Church spokesperson Murray Steinman said Thursday night's exercise was a only a  surprise, practice run.  </P> <P> "Our goal was to see whether or not we could get everybody into the shelters by  midnight," Steinman said. "We didn't announce it because by having a surprise  drill we approximate realistic conditions. You have to work out the logistics  in practice. Everybody was back at work in the morning."  </P> <P> Local officials have been concerned that the church members are planning to  occupy the shelters without proper waste water treatment and sewage systems,  threatening to contaminate the environmentally sensitive area and possibly  prompting an outbreak of disease among residents, livestock and wildlife.  </P> <P> Ken Anderson, director of the Environmental Health Department, checked several  shelters this week, including the main shelter, a massive facility located in  the Gallatin Mountain Range just outside of Yellowstone National Park, and  reported that none had proper waste treatment equipment.  </P> <P> "There are articles that say in he event of nuclear disaster, they will occupy  their shelters and let the waste spill on the ground," Anderson said of church  literature. "If a bomb goes off, I don't care what they do with their sewage.  But as far as some calamity in terms of Mother Nature, or an economic  catastrophe, the rest of us are going to be concerned with what they do."  </P> <P> By spending the night in the facilities with no waste water treatment, church  members violated county codes, Anderson said. He said if they repeat the  exercise, the county will pursue legal action.  </P> <P> In response to admonitions from Elizabeth Claire Prophet of a possible nuclear  war, nearly 2,000 church members from all over the country have been flooding  into Paradise Valley to join the 2,000 church members who are already  residents.  </P> <P> Prophet, known as Ma Guru to her followers, claims to be the reincarnation of  Marie Antoinette and Queen Guinevere and to talk directly with "Ascended  Masters," which include Jesus, St. Germaine and her deceased husband, Mark  Prophet. She has warned members that March and April are a dangerous period and  that members should liquidate their holdings and prepare for a possible nuclear  assault.  </P></p>

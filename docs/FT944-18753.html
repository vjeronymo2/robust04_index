			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Song and celebration at the Wigmore - Hvorostovsky, Gritton and the Vogler Quartet It has been a busy week at the Wigmore Hall, fulfilling for the listener, not without complications for the management. Dmitry Hvorostovsky stepped in to save Tuesday's recital when the American diva June Anderson cancelled her eagerly anticipated appearance - in the process breaking the tyrany of IMG Artists whose singers were to have dominated the whole of the Wigmore's International Festival of Song. The young Russian baritone, no stranger to London, was impressive. His special achievement was to maintain interest in a programme predominantly dark and melancholy (only one song in the entire evening, Rakhmaninov's 'Spring Waters', was at all uplifting). Hvorostovsky is the definition of a 'soulful' Russian singer, with dark, burnished tone, beefy top notes and a strong lower register. His voice is spread so seamlessly that his performances can lack variety, but here he found the measure of each song in his all-Rakhmaninov first half, right from the lilting lines of the opening 'You, my field'. The pianist Mikhail Arkadiev proved an equal partner in songs like the intimate 'How fair this spot', in which voice and piano are evenly integrated. After interval, the mood got progressively darker, through two of Shostakovich's Spanish Songs and the 'Fragment' from his Four Monologues, to a dramatic account of Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death. Hvorostovsky has sung them widely, in concert and on CD, and his interpretation has deepened: slow, deliberate tempos underlined the nightmarish 'Lullaby', and he found the malevolence in 'Trepak' before concluding with a terrifyingly intense 'Commander-in-Chief'. As a generous - though not very idiomatic - gesture, he switched in his encore to English for Purcell's 'Music for a While'. On Thursday it was the turn of the young British soprano Susan Gritton, winner of this year's Kathleen Ferrier Competition, here giving the London recital that is part of the prize. Her programme - Mozart, Schubert, Strauss, Britten, Falla and the premiere of two songs by Roderick Williams (b. 1965) - revealed a useful versatility: in her opening Mozart concert aria ('Voi avete un cor fedele', K. 217), Gritton's sound was bright and interesting, and her voice grew as the evening progressed. She caught the intimacy of her Schubert selection (helped by Eugene Asti's crystal clear accompaniments), and found the lustre demanded by her Strauss group: 'Ruhe, meine Seele' was perhaps the highlight of the evening. Words are not Gritton's strength. In her German songs there were distracting, over-exaggerated consonants, and even WH Auden's lines in On this Island came across intermittently. The soprano caught the mood of Britten's 'Nocturne', but the 1930s idiom of 'As it is, plenty' eluded her. Roderick Williams's Two Songs to Cope (Wendy Cope settings) were effective in their way - Gritton was playful in 'Reading Scheme' - but his music would not have challenged the 'Hecklers'. Gritton coloured Falla's Seven Spanish Folksongs well. The previous evening brought Michael Collins as soloist in 'The Romantic Clarinet', the second concert in the Wigmore Hall's Celebration of the Clarinet, a series devised by Collins himself. We heard two works central to the instrument's 19th-century repertory, Clarinet Quintets by Weber and Brahms. Weber's was written for Heinrich Baermann, the leading clarinettist of his day, and the programme also acknowledged him by including his Adagio. Collins, joined by the Vogler Quartet and the double bassist Mary Scully, poured out a stream of marvellously even, melting tone. The Weber gave full rein to Collins's expressive powers, and also scope for buoyant humour. The work is like a chamber concerto, and rapport between clarinet and the 'orchestra' of four strings was excellent; this was music making of the highest order. The Brahms, in which all five players caught the lyricism of the Adagio and the transparency of the sublime Andantino, gave the evening a warm, autumnal glow. The Celebration of the Clarinet continues at the Wigmore Hall.</p>

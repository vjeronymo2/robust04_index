			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek May 5 TASS -- Negotiations between lawmakers  from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and representatives  of Nagorno-Karabakh have gave no result, because the Azerbaijani  party refused to sign the final protocol on Thursday. [sentence  as received]    "We worked day and night to put together the two-page  document, but failed to reach an agreement," Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the Federation Council (Russian parliament's upper  house), who led the Russian delegation at the talks, told  ITAR-TASS despondingly as he walked out into a corridor inside  the Bishkek governmental palace, where the talks were held.    The participants in the talks refused to talk with the  journalists.    Next time, they will tackle the Nagorno-Karabakh issues in  the St. Petersburg-based headquarters of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly.    They are to leave Bishkek for their home countries on  Thursday.</p>

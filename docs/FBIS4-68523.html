			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akram Sirojiddin: "The `Art' of Elections"] </F>   [Text] Elections in Uzbekistan found expression in the  Constitution and numerous laws, and laws on freedom,  multipartyism, opposition candidates, freedom of thought were  published in the press. But, in fact, in order to evaluate how  the election was held, one can divide it into three parts. The  first was the election during perestroyka, the second was the  presidential election, and the third, elections free of  democrats. If we examine this electoral process in three parts,  we may predict the results of the elections to parliament in  1994.  <H5>  `BLACK FORCES' </H5>   When the democratization of elections in the former Soviet  Union began, Uzbekistan did not like this road. But, under  Moscow's influence, it was compelled to pass a law on democratic  elections.    The months of February-April 1990 were designated for  parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan. The Central Committee of  the Communist Party viewed this seriously. The communist  administration ordered that a list of candidates for obkoms be  submitted well beforehand. By the time the list of candidates  was scrutinized at the Central Committee, a special pattern had  taken shape. According to this pattern the percentages of  workers, kolkhozniks, intellectuals, and nonparty members were  brought into correspondence. Then the list was turned over to  the KGB administration and was examined once again. In this  period the obkoms filled in the places of the changing  candidates. It was thought necessary that questions such as age,  sex, origin, and nationality fit into the pattern. After all  this was arranged, the list was scrutinized at the Central  Committee bureau. Then, meetings were set up, and candidates on  the list began to be viewed.    Names on the list were broken down into three categories. A  "red category" candidate means that he will be a candidate under  any conditions. Electing a "blue category" candidate on an  opposition basis could certainly be permissible. The possibility  of a "black category" could be permitted on the basis of his  age, nationality, or profession. Candidates within the red  category have been ordered to back up Central Committee members  and oblast leaders in their electoral districts and, as far as  possible, do what they are told. The oblast party committees who  have supported the blue category candidates on the list make  them responsible to the oblast leadership. Black category  candidates are responsible to the rayon leaders.    Fifty percent of the candidates are red category, 25 percent  blue, and the rest black. Appearances in the press, propaganda  and publicity for meetings, the demonstration of respect for the  candidates are all permitted on the basis of these categories.  This has mobilized a great deal of power.    At the time the minds of the people had begun to open  because  of glasnost and a degree of press freedom. In fact, the  democratic movement in Russia was the trigger for this. Thus,  although this was considered to be "arbitrariness" by the  Central Committee, the people began to indicate their own  candidates. The fact that the voters were not counted at  pre-election meetings and a few mistakes were permitted on the  documentation, these candidates were not put on the list. In  some places where the voters met three or four times, their  candidates were put on the list.    What is interesting is that the majority of the candidates  designated by the people were communists. Only they were  slightly more conscientious and closer to the people than the  candidates selected from higher.    Now a second barrier was put in place. "Work" began with the  "arbitrary" candidates first in the rayon, then the oblast, and  finally in the Republic Communist Party administration. They  demanded that their own candidates be taken because they had  left their jobs, been arrested, or given a promise. A number of  candidates were easily caught in this trap.    Those who had entered into the fight were on the list,  despite the barriers mentioned above. First the KGB, then the  Ministry of Internal Affairs studied them. Complaints about them  were compiled at the workplace, negative articles about them  began to appear in the press. Additional forces were mobilized  in the districts where "arbitrary" candidates had declared  themselves. To this "battalion" was given the role of spreading  rumors among the people, and fighting with any kind of  impermissible means.    Possible candidates for deputy positions were subjected to  intense scrutiny again. Eight or nine candidates would come to  the fore immediately. The goal was to eliminate the  "arbitraries" from the "game." When election day arrived, close  to two hundred of a few thousand "arbitrary" candidates  remained. The question was what to do about them? As usual,  names were compiled by electoral district and precinct. These  lists were submitted, and then posted. Thus, commission members  familiarized themselves with the names of the candidates on the  list. The commission chairman was the representative of the  executive branch of the government. In the villages teachers  were mobilized for the elections.    For years the people showed no interest in the elections. As  a result, 30 percent of the population did not cast a vote.  Three or four persons in the electoral districts were moved  "higher" on the ballots. This experience was frequent. Of the  "arbitrary" candidates, who were under strong scrutiny and not  permitted to do this, more than thirty won their elections and  became candidates.    If you take a look at the composition of delegates to the  12th session of the High Assembly, you would see that the  majority were leading cadres and communists. They were  essentially elected without competition or opposition; that is,  they were "reds." There were representatives of all sectors in  the group of those who never tired of voting to satisfy  everything, namely, the "blues." The "arbitrary" delegates,  primarily intellectuals, were added to the list of the "black"  category. The majority did not know that the phrase "black  forces" was applied to this group in Uzbekistan.  <H5>  `ENEMY FORCE' </H5>   In Uzbekistan the presidential elections are not a natural  movement. At the first session of the Supreme Council the deputy  Toiba Tolaganova, considered one of the "black forces," said:  "Among us, those who want to hold a presidential election are  advocates of one-man rule and dictatorship. We are still not  done with being subservient to a leader. If we elect a  president, he will certainly turn into a Shahinshah."    I. Karimov denigrated the deputy and said: "this is not  Tolaganova's idea, but an idea of the black forces." Karimov,  himself, had become president by decree from the Supreme  Council. In the course of a year he took all the power of the  government into his hands. By the time the Soviet empire had  crumbled, presidential elections began to be held on a  democratic basis in the republics which had become independent.  Criticism in the foreign press and domestic relations worried I.  Karimov significantly. He prepared a draft law on presidential  elections. At the 7th session of the Supreme Council the "black  forces" considered this draft to be anti-democratic, and did not  allow it into the agenda. The president, "fully recognizing" the  mistakes, made a few changes in the draft, allowed it to be  presented again at the 8th session and announced presidential  elections for 29 December 1991. According to the draft,  individuals backed by parties, or who had collected 60,000  signatures could become candidates for election.    There were two parties, the Erk Democratic Party, which had  not yet been removed from the list, and the former Communist  Party, renamed the People's Democratic Party. The Communist  Party nominated Islom Karimov, and the Erk Democratic Party  nominated Muhammed Solih.    They also collected 60 thousand signatures or made an effort  to do so. The Central Electoral Commission did not allow these  under various pretexts.    At first Islom Karimov did not take Muhammed Solih's  candidacy seriously. Because of the nomination of opposition  candidates, he silenced world public opinion. He had calculated  that he could persuade the voters to vote for him. Thus, Islom  Karimov did not prepare a pre-election plan for himself. But  every morning officials of the KGB -- now called the National  Security Committee -- began to bring him disturbing reports:  "Muhammed Solih has prepared his presidential campaign. He  intends to announce it," "From secret talks with intellectuals,  it has become clear that they are moving to his side," "Interest  in Muhammed Solih in the villages is great," "Youths, especially  students, have openly gone over to his side," "The number of  those joining Muhammed Solih's party in rayons and oblasts is  climbing..."    This and similar information made the president cautious. He  rapidly organized an "election staff." The staff was divided  into three sections: those working in the open, those working  from outside, and those controlling the election commissions.  Those working openly included the faithful representatives of  the president. Those working from outside included state  advisors, members of the government, oblast and rayon leaders,  the KGB and the MVD.    Control of the election commissions was turned over to I.  Jorabekov, first deputy chairman of the Ministers' Court, M.  Umrzokov, state advisor, Sh. Yoldoshev, chairman of the Supreme  Council, K. Ahmedov, chairman of the election commission, and  the oblast governors. T. Alimov, presidential advisor, prepared  guidance with the Security Committee. As far as the form and  content of this guidance was concerned: " it spread rumors,  primarily among the Russian-speaking population, i.e, confusing  Muhammed Solih's name with that of the Mufti of Central Asia  Muhammed Sodik Muhammad Yusuf, it maintained that "he intends to  veil the women and drive representatives of other ethnic groups  out of Uzbekistan;" in the villages it claimed: "Muhammad Solih  is russified and sold out the nation to Russia; among students  and intellectuals it claimed that "Muhammad Solih is a poet and  has never worked anywhere and does not understand leadership;  famine and poverty will come to Uzbekistan."    Many such orders were handed down. Chief editors of  newspapers and magazines, and television and radio heads were  burdened with harassing Muhammad Solih because he was worrying  President Karimov, and Karimov ordered that Solih's platform not  be published. KHALK SOZI chief editor, Ahmadjon Mukhtorov,  published Muhammad Solih's pre-election platform. From that day  onward Ahmadjon Mukhtorov was persecuted. Finally, he was driven  out of his job and has fallen on bad times.    Preventing voters from gathering at pre-election meetings in  the oblasts was given special consideration. When Muhammad Solih  arrived in an oblast, meetings were scheduled for a specific  hour at four different locations. People would go to those  gathered at the four different locations and say "the candidate  did not arrive." Lights would be extinguished at the meeting  places, repair work would begin, and similar peculiar actions  would occur. Although television was devoted to Karimov for the  entire day, Muhammad Solih was given the opportunity to appear  only once. He was essentially "cut off" from expressing his  opinions.    According to the law, the government had to allocate money  for propaganda work to trusted representatives. At the time when  unaccountable funds were dispersed for Karimov, none of the  funds were allocated to the campaign of Muhammad Solih.    Instead of a platform, the president issued a massive appeal  which began by praising him to the skies. His meetings were  turned into a major occasion in every oblast. He made promises  like "I will not raise the price of bread," "I will do  everything for the state." Despite this, the people knew who was  who. Karimov knew the nature of the people. Thus, the experience  of balloting, i.e., the experience of parliamentary elections  began to operate.    Ballots were stolen in some places, and in some places votes  were counted ten times over. In places where Erk was under  strong control, such "miracles" were not contrived. Oblast and  rayon governors unable to falsify the election results were  removed from their positions. For example, the Khorazm oblast  and rayon leaders were removed for this.    The students were suddenly given a vacation during the  presidential elections. They had voted a week before the  election, and had gone house to house. "We locked the ballot  boxes," they said, but they had been opened. Basically, the  students had voted for Muhammad Solih. This put Islom Karimov's  future in great jeopardy. He looked for a way to eliminate this  force. Some 20 days after the election there was an uproar in  the student town. The students were fired upon...    From this day on, the feeling that he had a major competitor  in Uzbekistan did not leave him. Thus, he thought that the  competitor had to be eliminated by any means. He concentrated  all his strength and energy not on Uzbekistan's national  development, but on implementing this intention. He knew that  Muhammad Solih was his most dangerous enemy.  <H5>  `THE FORCE OF SCANDAL' </H5>   At the first session of the Supreme Council in 1990 Shovrukh  Rozimuradov, a deputy from Kashkadaryo, said: "Why did we elect  a president without an opponent at the Supreme Council? When  Karimov worked in Kashkadaryo, I knew him well and I do not want  him to become president." A short time later he was arrested.  Sh. Rozimurodov, although he was a people's deputy, was  imprisoned for several months. At the 7th session, after strong  criticism of this illegality by the "black forces" deputies, Sh.  Rozimurodov was released from prison. But he no longer performed  as a deputy.    At this session national representative Inomjon Tursunov,  who  showed documents and said "Karimov covered up the Ferghona  tragedy," and "when Karimov was first secretary of the  Kashkadaryo Communist Party two million rubles were written  off," was arrested by the militia shortly thereafter. At this  point, changes were made in the laws on fraud by people's  deputies; now a people's deputy is forbidden to speak against or  criticize the government. As for these "changes," they made it  possible to be free of the "black forces." On the basis of  letters organized in the name of the "people," it was made known  that Inomjon Tursunov was invited to step down as a deputy.  Meetings with voters were not permitted, and he was kept under  house arrest. On the day of his recall, cheaper prices were  announced in his electoral districts. Articles were published  with the intent to establish his malfeasance. His responses to  intrigues such as this were not published anywhere.    Because the people had not voted, Inomjon's trusted  representatives did not go into his electoral districts. While  there was some talk about this in the world public opinion and  in Uzbekistan, it was quickly forgotten. This was the easiest  way for this government...Soon a campaign began calling for the  resignation of Shukrullo Mirsaidov, Uzbekistan's former  vice-president. Polat Abdurahmonov, the governor of Samarkand  Oblast, and his deputy Alisher Mardiyev were ordered to fire  Deputy Jahongir Muhammad. On the day that Muhammad was going to  meet his voters, he was prevented from leaving Tashkent;  subsequently, he was kept under house arrest in Samarkand.  Ninety people who had voted for him got together saying "we are  going to complain to the president" but they were imprisoned for  several days.    On election day the ballots were counted under the  leadership  of responsible representatives of the president, and a document  was prepared showing that 93 percent of the people had voted  against him. Then it was Murod Jorayev's turn. Since he was a  member of Erk, in other words, one of the "black forces," he had  to sing the same song. The rooting out operation continued. The  Supreme Council committee was ordered to fire Erk Party member  Otajon Polvonov from his deputyship. This was done in the same  way as the others.    Finally, it was the turn of Erk Party member Samandar  Kokunov. Voters in his district did not go along with the  government's "game." Thus, Samandar Kokunov was suddenly  arrested. Pictures were taken of other people's houses, and it  was announced that "the deputy has a number of houses." He is  now being kept in jail without a trial.    Erk Party member and secretary of the Bukhara Oblast council  Nasrullo Saidov was also put under house arrest and forced to  step down from his deputyship. The documents responsible for his  resigning the deputyship are so poorly done that everyone who  has seen them think they are forgeries.    The fate of all the deputies who have been forced to or will  be forced to resign is being resolved in this way. On one hand,  new parliamentary elections have been announced. The fact that  deputies who are members of Erk or the "black forces" will not  participate in the new elections will not stop a frightened  government from persecuting them.    Not only astrologers, but even you can predict the results  of  the 1994 elections. And you would not be wrong.</p>

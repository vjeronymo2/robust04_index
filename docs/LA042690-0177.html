			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP NOTES: POPULAR GHERKIN RAUCOUS TO PERFORM FAREWELL SHOW TONIGHT  </P> <P> After two years as one of the most popular draws on the Orange County original  rock scene, Gherkin Raucous is playing its farewell show Friday night at Foul  Play in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Drummer Miles Gillett's decision to return to his native New Zealand next month  is the immediate cause of the breakup, although the other members said that  musical differences and the band's inability to land a recording deal played a  role in Gillett's departure and in their own decision not to continue.  </P> <P> Besides, guitarist Warren Fitzgerald, bassist Dan Wallis and singer Darren  McNamee said, auditions for a new drummer proved fruitless.  </P> <P> "It would have been hard to go back to square one," Fitzgerald said, "so we  decided it would be better to let it lie."  </P> <P> Gherkin's calling card was metallic hard rock delivered with unpredictable,  often ribald theatrics that made the band something of a heavy metal parody.  Gillett, who previously had played in El Grupo Sexo, wasn't always happy with  the unruly performing approach of front men Fitzgerald and McNamee.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald said that "things started falling apart" for Gherkin after the band  had an unsuccessful recording audition for Sire Records last year. Plans to  regroup from that setback by releasing an album on an independent label fell  through as instability set in.  </P> <P> Wallis is playing bass now in local rock band Twisto Frumpkin. Fitzgerald will  continue performing and recording with the Vandals, the long-running punk rock  band, but he said he is also thinking about starting a new band or joining an  established hard rock act. McNamee said his next step will be an acoustic rock  project with a revolving crew of side players.  </P> <P> "We're going to make a big production" out of Gherkin Raucous' finale at Foul  Play, McNamee said. "We're going to have a big ceremony: bye bye to Miles."  </P> <P> KZLA radio (93.9 FM), one of the two country stations accessible to Orange  County listeners, has added "Lift Your Leg" by Costa Mesa-based Chris Gaffney  &amp; the Cold Hard Facts to its regular airplay rotation.  </P> <P> What's encouraging about that development -- besides the fact that the song is  good -- is that it's a case of a radio programmer following his own instincts,  instead of kowtowing to the mass-marketing surveys and major record company  promotional pressure that typically drive commercial radio nowadays (Gaffney is  a virtual unknown who records for ROM, a tiny Los Angeles-based label with  little, if any, clout to land a song on a major station).  </P> <P> KZLA's operations manager, Bob Guerra, said he made a point of listening to  Gaffney's "Lift Your Leg" single after reading favorable reviews of the  singer-accordionist's recent album, "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts."  </P> <P> "It knocked me out," Guerra said. "I decided there's no reason in the world we  shouldn't be playing it. It's great to see these local artists do so well."  </P> <P> Upcoming shows added to the Coach House schedule in San Juan Capistrano include  Michelle Shocked and John Wesley Harding on May 29 and Todd Rundgren and his  band on June 23, 25 and 26. Leo Kottke's upcoming Coach House date has been  shifted from May 27 to May 31. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London and M'chester raises pay-out London and Manchester Group, the life assurance and financial services group, yesterday increased its interim dividend by 9.4 per cent from 5.12p to 5.6p for the first half of 1994. A sharp fall in in new managed fund investments left premium income down from Pounds 220.6m to Pounds 171.0m. In other respects, premium income was generally flat. Mr Martin Jackson, group finance director, said that the dividend level was not directly related to premium income on a year-by-year basis. He said that new business was at least in line with industry trends, and on a longer-term basis the group was able to show that it could afford the transfer to the shareholders out of the life fund. L&amp;M is the only insurer which the Department of Trade and Industry allows to distribute part of the long-term investment return on the shareholders' interest in the life fund. New managed fund business fell to Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 84.7m) after the company's investment performance had slipped from the high levels achieved in 1992 and 1993. There was a slight fall to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.7m) in annual premiums collected through the industrial branch business, where premiums are collected weekly from customers' homes, but this was less than the sharper fall in this area experienced by the life insurance industry as a whole. L&amp;M said there were signs that the volume of business could be built up from these levels. Within the consumer finance arm, levels of new unsecured lending were significantly ahead of the first half of 1993 and hire purchase lending had been buoyant. The estate agency, including four firms and 85 offices, increased its number of house sales by 3 per cent and was the most productive appointed representative of the life company. Mortgage arrears showed continuing improvement, with a significant reduction in the proportion of serious arrears.</p>

The 750-seat theater will also have a new name -- the Irvine Barclay Theatre  -- in honor of Richard H. and Marjorie Barclay of Newport Beach, who pledged $1  million to help complete construction. Barclay, a Southern California  developer, concedes there is "probably a little ego" in his donation. Mark I.  Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] THAILAND told the United States yesterday that  by April it would improve its offer for foreign companies to  gain access to the Thai financial market under the Uruguay Round  of world trade talks.    April is when the Uruguay Round agreements are due to be  signed formally in Morocco. Thai Finance Minister Tharin  Nimmanhemin said he told visiting US Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen that the new offer to be submitted in April would  include allowing foreign brokerages to own up to 49 percent of  Thai securities companies once these have been separated from  finance companies.    The new foreign ownership rule has already been agreed by  the  Cabinet. Its importance in the Uruguay Round deal would be the  commitment under a new General Agreement on Trade in Services  not to backtrack.    Thailand's previous offer, which also covers banking,  insurance and other services, did not make the 49 percent  ownership commitment for securities companies.    Other revisions could also be included in the new offer,  such  as permission for US banks to set up automatic teller machines  around the country. But Mr Tharin told reporters yesterday that  this would have to be considered before a commitment is made.    Mr Tharin stressed yesterday that the discussions with Mr  Bentsen were under the multilateral umbrella of the Uruguay  Round and were not bilateral.    The question of financial services liberalisation was one of  four major topics discussed when Mr Bentsen met Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai, Mr Tharin and Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit  Suphinit yesterday.    The other three were a request from Mr Bentsen for ideas on  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group's finance  ministers meeting in Hawaii in March, bilateral negotiations on  a double taxation treaty, and a US request for Thailand to enact  a law against money laundering -- the latter a less  controversial issue according to Thai ministers.    In the morning he visited the Stock Exchange of Thailand,  but  SET president Seri Chintanaseri said the question of access to  the Thai market for foreign stock brokers was not raised.

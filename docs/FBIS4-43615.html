			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cemil Bayik, head of the Military Council of </F> ARGK, People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan, by KURD-A; place  and date not given]    [Text] [KURD-A] The crisis-ridden Turkish economy was  paralyzed with the "5 April Measures." Many banks have gone  bankrupt. Thousands of workers are being laid off. The trade  union leaders are saying that the workers might work for free to  save the economy. The need is felt for employers to make  sacrifices. The government is getting more reaction than  support at home and abroad. In view of this, based on which  forces are Ciller and Karayalcin able to remain in power?    [Bayik] Everyone agrees that Turkey is in an insurmountable  crisis, which is not solely economic. One could also speak of  crisis in the economic, political, social, cultural, military,  diplomatic, and all other areas that feed each other. In  addition to surmounting the crisis, the adopted measures have  further deepened it. Most importantly, though the pro-regime  parties are continuously stressing that things are going bad,  they are not proposing any solution. The events starkly show  that the regime has reached the brink of bankruptcy and it has  no way to avert it. Each day brings the growing realization  that the increased cost of war in Kurdistan will further  aggravate this bankruptcy and will bring an end to the regime.  The war is the main source of all the problems. The Turkish  Republic, which insists on waging the war, will not be able to  extricate itself from the situation it has fallen into. It will  certainly erode even further with the loss of foreign trust.    The reasons for the survival of Ciller-Karayalcin government  should be sought in this helplessness we try to portray. It is  a matter of the regime's bankruptcy. A government change would  have been easier had the problem not been at the dimension  portrayed. The lack of an alternative makes a change of  government costly for the regime. This plays a role in the  survival of the government. Another factor is that this  government enjoys the army's support. The Ciller government  meets every demand of the generals, and fulfills each demand  promptly. It has plainly handed the initiative to the army.  The army feels the need to be in power at a time when war is  determining every aspect of life in Kurdistan and Turkey. The  army is supporting the present government which uncritically  complies with its demands.    An army unsuccessful at war has no tolerance for government  changes or criticisms. It needs a government that does  everything it says. The Ciller-Karayalcin government is doing  just that. The army will not accept the change of a government  with which it is in full harmony. If, despite this, a  government change is insisted upon, then the generals might  intervene.    [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic finds itself in a logjam in  foreign policy. It is unable to exert influence on Southern  Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan]. It cannot exploit the KDP  [Democratic Party of Kurdistan] and other forces as it has in  the past. Its military operations are without result. Its  attempts to reopen the oil pipeline is facing obstacles. It is  being forced to make concessions on the Cyprus problem to  international organizations, primarily by the UN. In view these  developments, what sort of a connection exists between Turkey's  increased attacks on Greece and the Cyprus problem? What could  you say other than those already known to the public?    [Bayik] Efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have  intensified. Pressure on the Turkish Republic to end the Turkish  occupation has intensified. Now, practical results are needed.  But, the Turkish Republic insists on being an occupationist and  is avoiding taking steps. To counterbalance the pressure on it,  Turkey is trying to drag Greece into artificial tensions because  the latter is taking the Cyprus problem to the international  arena and is intensifying its efforts for a solution. The aim  behind creating tension and fomenting problems between Greece  and her neighbors Albania and Macedonia, is to rein Greece in on  the Cyprus problem. With its provocations, Turkey could  aggravate the problems between Greece and her neighbors Albania  and Macedonia. It could also organize provocations using the  "Western Thrace Turks." If these prove insufficient, Turkey may  aggravate the tension by some de facto moves of its own.  Turkey's ultimate aim is to bring about the capitulation of  Greece by encircling it externally and internally.    It is likely that Turkey will step-up its pressure on  Greece. One of the aims is to neutralize Greece on the Cyprus  problem, and the other is to prevent an alliance between the  Greek people and the Kurdish people, which has launched a war of  liberation under the guidance of the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan].    Presently, Greece has won a strong ally against the constant  threat posed by Turkey in the war-waging Kurdish people. The  Turkish threat has been weakened as a result of our struggle.  The alliance of the Kurdish and Greek people is the main factor  capable of preventing the aforementioned threat. With the  attacks described above, Turkey wants to prevent the development  of this alliance. If Turkey succeeds, it will not only deprive  Greece of a strong ally, but will also neutralize one of the  Kurds' principal allies, which could take the Kurdish people's  cause to international platforms and strengthen it with  multisided support.    Turkey's efforts in this direction produced some results in  the past because of a lack of solidarity and mutual support  among people facing the Turkish threat. If the same failings  are not repeated and a strong alliance is forged, this threat  will vanish never to rise again. The success of the Kurdish  people fighting under the guidance of our party will bring  success to the Greek people. The support given by the Greek  people will bring our people's success closer.    [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic is unable to achieve any  serious results with its military operations. It also could not  stand up to ARGK guerrillas during its "cross-border  operations." Despite that, statements are being issued at home  to the effect that "PKK is on the verge of extinction." The  Turkish Army and state are calling for the surrender of ARGK  guerrillas and asking people to help bring about this surrender.  Why does the Turkish Republic feel the need for this?    [Bayik] The Turkish state's endurance is waning in the face  of problems generated by the war. The filthy war waged by the  army is constantly eating up Turkey's resources. Even a day's  war expenses is enough to aggravate the crisis into which the  regime has fallen. The Turkish Republic has channeled all its  strength and potential to the service of war. Yet, it is unable  to obtain any result. Failure would mean disappointment for it.    It declared 1994 a successful year. The state and the army  tried to convince themselves of this. Despite the passage of  time, no success has come their way. On the contrary, they were  further weakened. The army's morale has plummeted drastically.  There was a drop in the intensity of the operations. The blows  dealt by our guerrillas have plunged the army into  disintegration. Not only is the army disintegrating, but also  other state institutions. The guerrilla force, which has taken  the initiative, will henceforth escalate and amplify its  attacks. We will henceforth witness rapid disintegrations.    Faced with this situation, the state and the army are  drawing  up deceptive pictures of success claiming to have attained goals  which they have not. The psychological aspect of the war is  given prominence to avert a disintegration, to prevent further  aggravation of the crisis in which the regime finds itself, to  weaken our people's participation in the struggle, and to  prevent international recognition and support for the PKK. At  first they adopted the strategy of dealing a blow to the  guerrilla force and bringing about its dissolution. They wanted  to inflict heavy blows on the guerrilla force and then force it  to disintegrate. They thought then they could do away with the  whole problem. These strategies did not succeed. Their attacks  were repulsed by the guerrillas and their offensive potential  was broken by counterattacks. For that reason they are now  partially changing their strategy. They have now chosen to  bring about disintegration and destruction of the guerrilla  force by undermining the morale of the guerrillas and the people  through propaganda. Let us state that their efforts will be in  vain. Such tested and failed strategies have no chance of  success. The Turkish Republic is in a situation of completely  losing the war. No war strategy will save or bring success to  it.    The morale of the ARGK guerrillas is being strengthened with  new successes won daily. No call could undermine its morale;  rather, our people and young men will redouble their  contribution by taking heart in our successes. ARGK's strength  and initiative is making more decisive clashes possible. I am  asserting that the course of the war will rapidly run counter to  the Turkish Republic.    [KURD-A] You had once expressed your position on thestance  of the West and of the United States towards the Kurdish problem  and their move to occupy South [Iraqi] Kurdistan. Has any  change occurred in your policies since then? What is the latest  situation in the South? Why is Turkey mediating?    [Bayik] Both the United States and the West are losing hope  that Turkey could be successful in the war. They are also  admitting that policies denying the existence of the Kurdish  problem are impractical. Hence they find it meaningless to  press ahead with the war based on these policies. Therefore  they are trying to persuade Turkey to make changes in its  policy. Where their advice is not heeded, they are launching  certain initiatives. But all these are being done to ensure  Turkey's existence. The United States and UK are looking at the  issue within the framework of the Kurdish problem, whereas the  Turkish Republic is not even admitting the existence of the  problem by claiming that "there is no Kurdish problem, but a  problem of terrorism." This is where contradictions exist  between them. Again, whereas the United States and the Western  powers are pressuring Turkey to introduce certain reforms, the  Turkish Republic insists on a policy of denial and annihilation.  This is the second point of contradiction. It appears that the  United States and the Western powers will intensify their  efforts to make Turkey accept their position. Where persuasion  fails, they will use warning measures, and if those also fail,  limited measures might be considered.    All this does not mean that these powers have forfeited  Turkey. It also does not mean recognition of our people's will.  But, nevertheless they imply a change. The further development  of our war might speed up this change and bring us to the point  of a federal solution, and the recognition of our people's will.  But this will not come easily; there is a need to strengthen  the struggle and exert intensive effort, and a need for time.    There is no serious change in the position of the  aforementioned powers towards South Kurdistan. The U.S.-UK duo  are inclined to freeze the problem at the stage it is now in and  to safeguard the existing situation. They did not take sides in  the clashes; rather, they did not show much interest in them.  Their involvement is through the Iraqi National Congress. They  do not want to be a direct counterpart. We could state that  compared to the past, their interest in South Kurdistan has  waned. Barring serious developments, this waning interest could  go as far as embracing Saddam. Germany and France are after a  solution that would not eliminate Saddam. They appear to have  reached an agreement on this issue with the Turkish Republic and  Iran. They are exerting efforts to revive the KDP-based  autonomy and Iraq's sovereignty over Kurdistan. Therefore, they  are trying to subdue the YNK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan],  which they regard as an impediment to their plan. This is what  rests behind the latest clashes. Through talks they want to  bring about the surrender of the YNK, which they pushed into the  clashes. If they succeed in this, they will have not only  neared a solution they envisage for the South but also managed  to sideline a force which is an ally of the PKK. In this way  they want to deprive us of the opportunity to make use of the  South.    Any upsurge in clashes between the YNK and the KDP is  fraught  with risks. Despite all foreign assistance, the KDP's strength  is limited. It is questionable if it could gain the upper hand  in the fighting or take the area under its control. If the  clashes continue and escalate the possibility of the  independence line advocated by the PKK making fast advances and  gains could arise. That is why the Turkish Republic is entering  the developments and is assuming the role of a mediator in the  clashes. It considers establishing control over the region by  limiting the clashes to be to its advantage. This is the  essence of its mediation efforts. If the talks do not do the  trick it is always possible to rekindle the low-intensity  clashes. Yet another reason for its mediation at the talks is  to charm the domestic and international public and thus to hide  its role in the clashes. This is truly a demonstration of  duplicity.    [KURD-A] In contrast to other European countries, Germany is  continuing attacks on your party. It has gone beyond all  bounds. What are the reasons pushing Germany into such a  situation?    [Bayik] The German state is a full participant in the  Turkish  Republic's dirty war against our people. Only, unlike the case  of General Moltke [Helmuth Karl Bernhard who served in Ottoman  Army], it has not allowed its generals to take part in Turkey's  operation to quell the uprising. Perhaps it has, but we are not  aware of it. However, I can state that we expect it to take such  a step.    Not only is Germany taking sides, it is a partner in the  war. The German state's stance towards our party and people is  unacceptable.    We are duty bound to defend ourselves not only against the  Turkish Republic but also against its German accomplice. We  will make use of this right by using all means at our disposal.  We cannot cave in to a bully, if we do we will be subjected to  more bullying. While using our legal self-defense right, we  would like to see our German friends, the German people, and the  progressive public on our side.    The only way not to become partners with the German state's  dirty objectives is to oppose its war partnership with the  Turkish Republic. To oppose it is tantamount to defending  democracy, human rights, and humanity.    It must be understood that the German state will not be the  winner. Our people's will, reflected by our party, will win  with the support of progressive mankind, primarily our German  friends. We believe that both the German people and the  progressive mankind will mete out the punishment deserved by the  German officials who in unison with the Turkish Republic  officials chant: "We will eradicate the PKK;" "The PKK does not  represent the Kurdish people."    [KURD-A] Documents and evidence suggest that many circles  feel Behcet Canturk [a Kurdish businessman], who was murdered  last month, and Savas Buldan and his two abducted friends [also  Kurdish businessmen] were murdered by the state. Mahir Kaynak  [a former Turkish National Intelligence Organization official]  claimed that the businessmen were killed by those who submitted  a list of Kurdish businessmen to Ciller. As always, the  state-run televisions and radios are trying to establish a link  between the murder victims and the PKK. As you know just before  dying Muhsin Melik [a Kurdish party official] said: "The police  shot me." We want to know your views on this matter.    [Bayik] For some time now the Turkish Republic's attacks on  the guerrillas have assumed the dimension of national  annihilation. All sections of the society favoring national  liberation have become targets. It has become a daily business  to destroy all the national elements. Those siding with the  national liberation and contributing to the struggle are being  murdered. Savas Buldan and his friends were murdered as part of  this policy by the colonialists. The same thing applies to  Muhsin Melek. We cannot consider these murders and previous  ones as mystery murders. Those who perpetrated them are not  unknown. These murders are being committed by the Turkish  Republic without much bother to hide them; only that it does not  openly assume responsibility for them to deflect criticism.    All the national strata started entering the ranks of the  struggle over the last few years. This is also true for the  wealthy and intellectual sections of the society. While all the  dynamic forces of the nation went into action and started  contributing to the war of liberation within their means, the  Turkish Republic launched a variety of attacks in response.  Those prominent among the national groups (intellectuals,  businessmen, and so on) who have taken a clear stance on the  side of the struggle are being murdered one after another. The  aim is to cut off the contribution of various social strata to  the struggle. An all-out genocide is being perpetrated against  our people these days. These massacres do not pale in  comparison to the past ones. There is no difference in the  number of people killed now and those killed during massacres in  the past. Only the method of implementing the genocide is  different. In the past, our people who were regarded as enemies  were massacred in a certain place and time and then buried alone  or in mass graves, or sometimes they were not even buried.  Today's massacres are not confined to a specific place and  time. Now the ongoing massacres are spread over all areas and  time. That is, in the past tens of thousands of our people used  to be massacred in one specific location within a brief time.  This change in method is due the fact that our struggle had  spread over a large area and a longer time span, and the public  has become more sensitive. The colonialists are afraid of  domestic and foreign reaction to mass massacres. For that  reason, they want to attain the same results by massacring  people one-by-one or in groups. They are trying to hide this as  much as possible. All these show that the Turkish colonialists  are developing new methods of genocide. They carry out the  massacres with more mastery. The mystery murders are a part of  this mastery. In the case of Behcet Canturk, Savas Buldan and  his friends, Muhsin, and tens of murders committed daily, the  murderer is the Turkish Republic. Whether or not the massacres  are being committed by the state's open or secret forces is not  important. What is important is that one should not be caught  unaware at a time when the enemy has intensified its genocidal  activity. Measures against it would be even closer ties with  and more effective participation in the struggle. Our reply  will be to escalate the war.    [KURD-A] Political circles are indicating that the Turkish  Republic will step up violence until the autumn and then  introduce Kurdish television, education, and similar things. Is  this possible? By launching such a propaganda what does it hope  to gain vis-a-vis the PKK?    [Bayik] It has become impossible to deny the Kurdish  existence or to try to find solutions based on this policy of  denial. It is possible that at this stage the Turkish Republic  might take such steps, though it is a different matter if they  could be taken sooner or later. Having said that we should also  state the following: It might take such steps to distance  people from the struggle. In both cases the taking of such  steps would be rationalized on the farce that the struggle being  waged under our party's guidance has been destroyed.    The current recourse to such propaganda aims at weakening  our  party's domestic and foreign support, and at alleviating the  growing pressure on Turkey. But, what should be well understood  is that such tactics have gone stale. The Turkish Republic  cannot get anywhere with such tactics. Our people, which has  given thousands of martyrs and made all these sacrifices, cannot  be satisfied with these offers. It is resolved to attain its  freedom under the guidance of our party. It will firmly  continue in its path of freedom, even if that demands very heavy  costs.</p>

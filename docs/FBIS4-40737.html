			<p>BFN     [Text] On Sunday Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha  told Interfax that the Agrarian party, its faction in the State  Duma and the Central Committee of the Union of Workers of the  Agro-Industrial Complex could yet be expected to sign the civic  accord agreement after they met, to clear up positions, with  President Yeltsin on June 27.    The Vice-Premier in charge of agriculture was elected a  member of the State Duma on the ticket of the Agrarian party  which brings together almost 200,000 men and women. Russia's  one and only Agrarian labor union boasts a membership of almost  16 million.    According to Zaveryukha, the Agrarians had failed to sign  the  civic accord agreement owing to differences of opinion on  government support for the agro-industrial complex. In  addition, he said, the labor union and the government differed  on the issue of social insurance.    But, Zaveryukha said, the Agrarian faction in the State Duma  supported the president- and government-backed draft of the  Federal budget although those who had signed the civic accord  agreement opposed the draft.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Troops seize key points in Brazzaville MUTINOUS troops in Congo, led by the army high command, controlled key points in the capital, Brazzaville, yesterday, and demanded the resignation of reformist Prime Minister Andre Milongo, Reuter reports from Brazzaville. But sources close to the premier, who had apparently gone into hiding, claimed he was still in control of the oil-producing central African country. Hundreds of armed soldiers were deployed at the radio and television buildings, the treasury and other key points after demanding the resignation of Mr Milongo's government on Sunday. The city was mainly calm but government officials said troops fired in the air to disperse about 1,000 pro-Milongo demonstrators in the district of Bas-Congo. Leaflets circulated calling for a general strike against the army moves. A military communique broadcast on television said the high command was meeting leaders of the interim parliament, the High Council of the Republic (CSR), yesterday afternoon to discuss the crisis.</p>

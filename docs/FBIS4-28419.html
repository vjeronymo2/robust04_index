			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates a commentary to the 68th anniversary of the June 10  independence movement.    The commentary says:    The June 10 independence movement which was the biggest  anti-Japanese patriotic struggle in Korea in the middle of the  1920s dealt a heavy blow to the brutal colonial rule of the  Japanese imperialists and powerfully demonstrated the  indomitable will and stamina of the people not to tolerate the  Japanese imperialists' aggression and occupation policy in Korea.    Much water has flown under the bridge since then. But  national sovereignty has not yet been fully achieved nationwide.    The U.S. imperialists keeping South Korea under their  military occupation have carried to an unprecedented extent  their anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it, under the false pretext  of "nuclear suspicion against the North," and the Japanese  reactionaries are going to repeat the past history of crimes,  openly crying for "legislative arrangements" to cope with "an  event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula.    The Kim Yong-sam group, in a bid to stay on in power, is  making no bones of converting South Korea into a test ground of  the U.S. "new military strategy," a military intelligence base  against the North and a market of surplus agricultural and  livestock products and old and new weapons.    The United States must renounce its anachronistic policy of  occupation, withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South  Korea and come out with a sincere attitude to the DPRK-U.S.  talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula.    The Japanese reactionaries must give up the hostile policy  toward the DPRK and the scheme to stage a comeback to Korea and  the Kim Yong-sam group must discard the foolish dream of getting  profits through gambling over the issue related to the destiny  of the nation.    Peace and reunification are the unanimous demand and will of  the whole nation. Nobody can break this will of our people.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: A 'forte' soprano Just two months ago, Elizabeth Connell sang a brave, vital Isolde in the Festival Hall, with Wagner's giant pit-band surrounding her on the platform (and with the wrong conductor), and she made her music hit the back of the Grand Tier. On Wednesday she sang a Wigmore Hall programme entitled 'In Praise of Women': a decidedly douce selection of songs with piano, from German Romantics to later French to forgotten Victorian, some of them composed by women. It was an imperfect success. In her Schumanns and Mahlers (husbands and wives) and Mendelssohns (brother and sister), all salon-scale songs, Miss Connell's chesty diva tones were not well found, and her higher register - always in forte - was like chalk on slate. Only because, I should guess, she was trying to reduce her big-house fortissimo to Wigmore dimensions; the result throttled her stirring full-cry tone down to something fierce but thin, and very hard on the ear. Brahms, Wolf and Strauss were somewhat more comfortable, but bumpy (like her lively accompanist Eugene Asti). From time to time some of the Connell strengths flickered through, on reduced voltage - here a telling phrase seized with energy and imagination, there a winning touch of wry Irish humour. But what was the point of barging into territory so fastidiously cultivated by full-time Lieder singers? They have accustomed our ears to long, lucidly detailed lines, partly on the assumption (sometimes debatable) that every word of the poetry should be heard, where this dramatic soprano goes instinctively for the high points and elsewhere drops whole syllables into a murky void. Singing mostly from the printed music, she struck jarring reefs among French vowels as well as German ones. In early Faure, who sometimes let his purely musical impulses spoil the prosody of his chosen verses, Miss Connell - charming though she was - stressed the false accents again and again, where a native specialist would smoothe them over. That assiduous delver Graham Johnson was credited with help in choosing the programme. No doubt it was he who dug up Honegger's Petit Cours de Morale, five arch little songs on Giraudoux texts (sub-Eric Rohmer and distinctly Anglophobe); but they needed sniffy native knowingness to bring them off, and did not get it. In her closing group of parlour songs by Victorian ladies, however, Miss Connell swung nicely into the right sentimental address. I was delighted to learn at last where the deathless line 'Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar' comes from: it turns out to be the first line of a Kashmiri Song by Amy Woodforde-Finden (1860-1919).

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Solvency standards Britain's actuaries are incensed that the government's proposed solvency benchmark for occupational pensions will give an unduly optimistic picture of a fund's financial health. That is because the proposed methodology allows schemes to count their equity holdings when assessing their ability to meet liabilities to pensioners expected to live at least 10 years. The actuaries argue passionately that gilts should be used as they provide more certainty of providing the necessary income. However the debate is resolved, it has usefully served to highlight the trade-off between investments in equities versus gilts. It is exposing something that may have been obscured during the 1980s when high equity returns could be taken for granted: that investment in equities is at the expense of the security of pensioners' entitlements. To guarantee that security requires a higher proportion of gilts in a pension portfolio. And yet, because equities outperform gilts over the long-term, it costs a company more to fund greater security. Those companies whose funds have a low solvency margin - and therefore run the risk of failing the new standards - will eventually be obliged to make greater contributions to their funds. It is alarmist to suggest that the solvency proposals will ultimately lead to a massive switch out of equities. Most funds have a high degree of solvency; and those that do not have until the next century to make the adjustment. But for some funds, which face the obligation to meet liabilities sooner rather than later, the shift to gilts has already begun.</p>

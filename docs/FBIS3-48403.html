An official who refused to be identified said that the PLO  is  expected to set up an interim committee soon to receive  financial aid from the world for the rehabilitation of the Gaza  Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.    Seoul expressed its will to support rehabilitation of the  autonomous region at multilateral talks in Washington Oct. 2-3  last year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu attended the talks  co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.    The talks were the first international ones held to handle  the aid program since Israel and the PLO signed a peace accord  in Washington early last September.    "We are unable to discuss the aid program as no recipient  body has yet been set up by the PLO," the official said.    But inter-ministerial consultations are under way on the  methods of financial aid to the PLO following the establishment  of a recipient body, he said.    He said he is quite sure that the aid program will be  discussed bilaterally with the PLO, not international bodies or  Israel.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned his Korean  counterpart Han to support the rehabilitation of the autonomous  region of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, shortly  after the signing of the peace accord.    It is expected that the government will extend soft loans  from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF). The  EDCF is a government-managed fund for developing nations.    But other officials did not rule out that nonrefundable aid  would also be delivered although in small amounts.    The United States has projected collecting contributions  through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank.    At present, no country has extended aid to PLO for the same  reason as Korea and also because of the uncertainty of the  Middle East peace.    PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat also expressed hope for assistance  from South Korea in a recent interview with KBS [Korea  Broadcasting System]. 'Arafat is familiar with North Korean  leaders, having visited Pyongyang several times.    South Korea has no formal diplomatic ties with the PLO but  has already recognized its identity.</p>

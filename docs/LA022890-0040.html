			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLAND;  </P> <P> WARSAW RESTORES FULL TIES WITH ISRAEL  </P> <P> Israel and Poland resumed full diplomatic relations after a 23-year break.  </P> <P> Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country to renew relations with the Jewish  state in the last six months. Warsaw severed relations during the 1967 Middle  East War. Hungary restored relations in September, and Czechoslovakia followed  suit Feb. 9. Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987, and the new  Solidarity-led government is hoping that the restoration of a formal embassy  will lead to closer economic and cultural cooperation.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator accurately noted that the exception for allocations of overall partnership loss (or, more precisely, what would otherwise be overall partnership loss) that charge back disproportionately small allocations of overall partnership income to a QO partner is somewhat confusing and counterintuitive. Part of the confusion arises because the Code refers to chargebacks of disproportionately large income allocations to taxable partners. However, the equivalent approach taken in the regulations is desirable because it avoids the need to determine the analog of a fractions rule percentage for taxable partners and because it is simpler to apply to partnerships with more than one QO partner. Accordingly, an example has been added to the final regulations, as requested by the commentator, to illustrate a qualifying allocation of overall partnership loss that charges back a disproportionately small allocation of overall partnership income to a QO partner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations revise the formula approach in the proposed regulations for determining the extent to which a minimum gain chargeback is attributable to nonrecourse deductions (or partner nonrecourse deductions) to properly interact with the &sect;1.704&hyph;2 regulations governing partnership minimum gain and partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain. The &sect;1.704&hyph;2 regulations effect minimum gain chargebacks on the basis of the partners' percentage shares of minimum gain. Accordingly, the final regulations require partnerships to determine_in a reasonable and consistent manner_the extent to which a partner's percentage share of the partnership minimum gain is attributable to nonrecourse deductions. The final regulations also provide, by way of example, a formula for determining in certain circumstances the extent to which a partner's percentage share of minimum gain is attributable to nonrecourse deductions. Although the final regulations do not explicitly so provide, a partnership that computes the extent to which minimum gain is attributable to nonrecourse deductions, also computes, by default, the extent to which minimum gain is attributable to prior distributions of proceeds of nonrecourse liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a limited new chargeback exception that applies if QO partners initially contribute capital used to purchase depreciable real property and are allocated the resulting depreciation deductions. If the partnership later borrows money on a nonrecourse basis (using that depreciable real property as security) and distributes the proceeds to the QO partners as a return of capital, the resulting minimum gain chargeback is permanently disregarded in computing overall partnership income or loss for purposes of the fractions rule. Without a special rule, the distribution of nonrecourse proceeds and the resulting minimum gain chargeback might cause a violation of the fractions rule in the year the minimum gain is triggered. In effect, the new exception allows the partnership to apply the general chargeback rule for nonrecourse deductions (rather than the general chargeback rule for nonrecourse distributions) even though the initial depreciation deductions allocated to the QO partners were not nonrecourse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This new rule is narrow. It provides complete relief to partnerships only to the extent the amount of the partnership depreciation deduction for the property for the year does not exceed the overall partnership loss for the year. The reason for making this rule narrow is that chargebacks attributable to distributions of proceeds of nonrecourse liabilities may provide greater potential for manipulation than other chargebacks. Nonetheless, the new provision should provide significant relief from a problem that may be fairly common.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Exclusion of Partner-Specific Items of Deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations continue to exclude from the computation of overall partnership income or loss, certain expenditures allocated to the partners to whom they are attributable. Furthermore, in partial response to a commentator's request that certain other exceptions be added, the final regulations expand the exception for expenditures incurred in computing section 743(b) basis adjustments to generally encompass additional record-keeping and accounting expenditures incurred in connection with transfers of partnership interests. To allow proper consideration of other items that might be excepted, the final regulations also permit the list of qualifying expenditures to be expanded in the future by revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or private letter ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

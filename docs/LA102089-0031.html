			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SEN TORRES HEARING SCHEDULED FOR NOV. 1  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) faces a hearing Nov. 1 on whether his  driver's license should be suspended. Torres, 42, was arrested Sept. 6 near the  state Capitol for driving without lights, and officers said he refused to  submit to a blood-alcohol test. The Department of Motor Vehicles said last  month that Torres would lose his driver's license for two years for refusing to  be tested. Torres asked for the hearing to review the case. The senator also  has a Nov. 30 date in Sacramento Municipal Court for a pretrial conference  where it will be decided if the case will proceed to a trial or if Torres will  plead guilty to some charge, his attorney said.  </P></p>

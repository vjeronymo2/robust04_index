			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with New Party Mirai (Future) representative </F> Michihiko Kano by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter: place  and date not given -- from "Listening Without Reservation"  column]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] You and your colleagues broke  away from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Was  there not a mistake in the timing of your breakaway from the LDP?    [Kano] I believe that we quit the LDP at the right time. We  do not repent of our break from the LDP.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Why has your party not joined the new  parliamentary group "Kaishin"?    [Kano] We do not know at all how or why the parliamentary  group was formed. We just quit the LDP when the parliamentary  group was formed and we heard nothing from other political  parties about forming the parliamentary group. Our party could  not draw a conclusion on whether to join the parliamentary group  because our party values the process of making decisions through  discussion.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of political tactic do you  think Prime Minister Hata should adopt?    [Kano] In my meeting with Prime Minister Hata, I proposed  that parties and parliamentary groups that voted for Mr. Hata in  the prime ministerial election at a Diet plenary session  assemble to discuss issues, and asked the prime minister to tell  the assembly what he thinks. However, the prime minister did  not accept my requests.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata  government is expected to have difficulty implementing policies  after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is enacted in the Diet.  What is your opinion?    [Kano] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is  sharing a common perception with other parties on the nine-point  policy agreement. If the Hata government holds talks with the  SDPJ to discuss policy matters forthrightly, the SDPJ would  understand. If both ruling and opposition parties hold frank  debates on how the current tax system should be reformed to turn  Japan around, it would be possible to reach an agreement. Both  ruling and opposition parties should make concerted efforts to  grapple with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of role does the "New Party  Mirai" intend to play in the future?    [Kano] As for reforming the current tax system, our party  plans to set forth a concrete vision that aims to improve the  quality of life for the people through tax system reform.  Regarding the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear arms, our party intends to plead with that country to  remain a nuclear-free nation. Our party also intends to make  efforts to keep that country from being isolated from the rest  of the world through diplomatic channels. Our party will  advocate the need to keep all of Asia nuclear-free.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to increase your  party's membership?    [Kano] Now that the Diet has enacted the political reform  bill, the next task will be a realignment of the political  parties. For our party to function properly in this drastically  changing political situation, our party needs to reorganize  itself on the basis of policies and political beliefs. Our  party should set forth a set of new policies while pushing for  reforms. Many people agree with our party's plans. There are  many legislators in the LDP with whom I worked for the political  reform.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that you and Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa are  of the same political beliefs?    [Kano] I do not know all of what Mr. Ozawa thinks. We do  not share the same views on handling the reforms, but we may  share views that things must not be deferred until later.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the possibility of  dissolving the House of Representatives?    [Kano] Our party resolutely opposes holding the next general  elections under the current multiseat constituency system. What  is important for us at the moment is to move things forward.  Why did we spend seven years working for political reform? We  should not set back political reform. To keep political reform  on track, we have to speedily draft a bill on the demarcation of  single-seat constituencies.</p>

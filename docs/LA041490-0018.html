			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS INITIAL REACTION NOT EXACTLY POSITIVE  </P> <P> Regarding Mike Downey's column, "TBS: Is It Short for Those Braves Stink?"  </P> <P> DOWNEY: Is it short for Dumb Obnoxious Whining Numbskulled Egotistical Yawn?  </P> <P> It is now very evident why Mike Downey understands so little about the game of  baseball. Instead of watching the Atlanta Braves play the sport on TBS, he's  busy critiquing the commercials. Downey should stick to covering college  basketball and leave the national pastime to the real writers.  </P> <P> KENNETH BENES, Van Nuys  </P></p>

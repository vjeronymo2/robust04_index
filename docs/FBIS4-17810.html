			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The deputies of the Federation  Council have decided to set up a permanent working group which  would work on anti-crisis measures in the Russian economy  together with the government and the Russian president's  administration. Today they discussed the question of the crisis  in the country's economy, but voted down the draft resolution on  this issue. Several committees of the chamber have been  instructed to generalize the proposals that were made during the  rather long discussion and to submit them to the next sitting.    However, an opinion was voiced that this type of document  should not be adopted altogether, as "just another piece of  paper" would not lead to any results. Instead of this it should  be demanded that the government adopt and publish a program of  anti-crisis measures.    The "complete absence of any consistent and sensible policy  of the national economy" in the draft resolution was named as  the "main strategic error of the government." The absence of  "macroeconomic planning and of a mechanism for its  implementation" was also held against them.</p>

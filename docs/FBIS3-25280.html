			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has,  with immediate effect, stopped any cooperation whatsoever  between the ruling party, KANU [Kenya African National Union],  and the FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya  party. And, at the same time, he warned of dire consequences  for any KANU leader that will be seen to be cooperating with any  officials from the FORD-Kenya party.    The president explained that when KANU accepted to cooperate  with FORD-Kenya, it was because he knew the political policies  of the late FORD-Kenya leader Jaramogi Oginga Odinga well, and  Odinga too understood President Moi's policies. However, the  president added that recent events and remarks by some  FORD-Kenya officials have completely disqualified them from that  cooperation. President Moi was speaking at the Kericho Show  Ground when he officially opened this year's Kericho  Agricultural Show.    The president further said that for the past two years he  had  been eagerly watching the outbusts and actions of some officials  from FORD-Kenya and had come to the conclusion that those  leaders had lost a sense of direction. He said KANU stood for  peace and stability and cannot, therefore, enter into any  cooperation with the party that excels in abuses. President  Moi, who is also the president of the ruling party KANU, said he  was definitely annoyed by the insults directed at him but  restrained himself because of his great love for the children of  this country. He, however, added that tolerance has a limit.  [passage omitted].</p>

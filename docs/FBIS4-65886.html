			<p>BFN     [Text] "This Italian government will be the most  pro-Israeli in the past 20 years". These were the words with  which Foreign Minister Antonio Martino who is currently visiting  Washington, sought to reassure the Jewish-American community.    At the next G-7 meeting Martino will ask for condemnation of  "the ongoing Arab economic boycott of Israel."    Martino met earlier with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who said "he has a lot of faith in the government  that resulted from the elections: we are ready to work together."</p>

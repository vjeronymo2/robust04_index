			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Magnum Power to float Magnum Power, which designs built-in uninterruptible power supply units (Bi-ups), is planning a USM flotation through a placing with institutional investors. Bi-ups can be built into equipment such as personal computers and fileservers to protect against the loss of valuable data and equipment damage if the primary power supply fails. Magnum was founded in 1990 by Mr Vincent Lavin, who claims to have invented Bi-ups the previous year, and Mr Ian Irvin, finance director. The flotation, which is sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, is designed to strengthen Magnum's capital base so that the group can fully exploit the commercial potential of Bi-ups and build sales volumes.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Arianespace halts launches Arianespace, the European aerospace group, said yesterday it had suspended its satellite launching programme and set up an inquiry into the crash of Flight 70 last Thursday shortly after its launch from the island of Kourou off French Guyana in the Atlantic. First results of the inquiry into the accident - the seventh since 1979 but the second of its kind this year - are to be presented on December 19. But Arianespace said it would not comment on the findings until the official report was complete. '(The) mandate is to establish the causes of the failure of Flight 70 and to recommend all the necessary measures to be taken to correct the anomalies found,' the company said. It is committed to launching 30 rockets before the end of 1996. Insurers have warned that the failure of the launch will lead to a reappraisal of rates for launches where insurance cover has not yet been agreed.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: SIA and Tata in venture to form Indian airline Singapore Airlines (SIA) is planning to launch a domestic airline in India in a joint venture with Tata Industries, India's leading industrial group. The two companies yesterday signed a preliminary agreement to form the airline joint venture, and will carry out a feasibility study and seek the necessary government approvals. SIA said this process was expected to take up to six months and, barring unforeseen circumstances, the new airline should be operational by the end of next year. SIA has earmarked India as well as China and Vietnam as significant growth markets. The airline announced last week a Dollars 10.3bn order for new Boeing and Airbus airliners to modernise and expand its fleet to meet future growth. Liberalisation of the Indian economy and continued strong demand for air travel in the country was expected to stimulate growth in domestic travel and tourism in India, both SIA and Tata said. SIA also said its participation in the new venture was consistent with its strategy of investing selectively in airlines and associated airport services in rapidly growing economies of the Asian region. The joint venture, if approved by the Indian authorities, will also mark the return of Tata to the airline business. Tata pioneered the industry in India with Tata Airlines before it was nationalised to become Air India. SIA also announced yesterday that its Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats) subsidiary was taking a 49 per cent stake in a Dollars 13m joint venture in-flight kitchen company based at Karachi international airport in Pakistan. Sats recently invested in a similar in-flight kitchen venture in Beijing and the project further reflects the Singapore carrier's expansion drive in fast-growing Asian air travel markets.</p>

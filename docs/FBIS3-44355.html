In an  interview with this reporter, Lou Yu-huai, general manager of  the Guangdong Provincial Service Center for Foreign Businessmen,  said that many foreign businessmen believed they would benefit  from now on in the payment of staffers' and workers' wages in  the hinterland and in the verification of funds.    Lou Yu-huai explained that foreign businessmen had to use  their foreign currency to obtain renminbi at the official  exchange rate in order to pay the wages of staffers and workers  in the hinterland, and the taxation administration constantly  checked their foreign exchange receipts. In general, it was  impossible for foreign-funded enterprises to avoid such legal  channels. However, with the unification of the exchange rates,  foreign exchange can be freely bought and sold; the dollar,  which was 5.7 yuan at the official exchange rate, now can yield  more than 8 yuan, and thus the cut in wage costs is  self-explanatory.    Second, according to regulations, the value of foreign  investment in fixed assets in China must be calculated in  renminbi, so every $1 million invested yielded only 5.7 million  yuan at the official rate before the unification of exchange  rates, when the funds were verified according to foreign  exchange receipts. Beginning with 1994, however, every $1  million will yield 8 million yuan, meaning that every $1 million  will yield an additional 300 million yuan, which will be a great  benefit to any foreign businessman.    Third, foreign businessmen also will benefit from this  practice in the calculation of costs, for they now are freed  from doing several calculations in accounting.    However, this new policy might have negative effects on  foreign businessmen. For example, viewing the present  situation, the change in procedures can be slow in meeting the  requirement of wide-ranging implementation of unification of  exchange rates, and there will be some gaps in service. Foreign  businessmen may find it difficult to feel comfortable with the  confusion arising from the change.    In addition, foreign businessmen all along have been  "flexible" in their accounts because of the two exchange rates  in price-fixing. When declaring taxes and profits, more often  than not, it was a case of "superficial deficit, with actual  profit." However, with exchange rates unified, it will be  impossible to take advantage of the price difference "loophole"  any longer.    As for the reaction of the man on the street to the new  central policy, psychological fluctuations still can be detected  out of his seeming indifference. It was believed that the  exchange rate on the market long had been based on the black  market; the new policy served only to legalize the black market  exchange rate, and there was nothing strange in that. However,  this policy obviously has demonstrated a 70 percent devaluation  of the renminbi. People recently have vied to exchange all the  renminbi in their hands for hard currencies so as to reduce the  risk of devaluation.</p>

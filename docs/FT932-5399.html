			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Ford and Rover launch refund offers on new cars FORD and Rover are to offer new car buyers unhappy with their purchases the chance to exchange their vehicles or receive cash refunds in competing schemes that break new ground in the European car market. The two car producers rushed to outflank each other yesterday with rival announcements claiming to be the first in the market-place with the initiatives. Cash refund schemes to dissatisfied car buyers have been pioneered in recent months in the US, including by Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, but Ford and Rover both say their UK initiatives are the first to be mounted in Europe. Rover is to offer retail customers in the UK a new vehicle or a cash refund within 30 days or 1,000 miles, if they are not satisfied with their first purchase. Ford is introducing a 'no strings' offer to both retail and fleet customers to exchange any new car or commercial vehicle within 30 days or 1,000 miles, if the customer is dissatisfied. Unlike Rover, Ford is not offering a cash refund within 30 days. Ford is offering, however, to replace a car or commercial vehicle or provide a refund within the first 12 months, if the vehicle has a 'persistent defect'. After six months, the size of the refund would be reduced to reflect the mileage driven. The Rover scheme was originally intended to be unveiled on June 15, but details were hurriedly announced last night in the wake of a Ford press conference held at only a couple of hours' notice yesterday afternoon. The Rover scheme is not open to fleet customers. The offer applies to customers who have either paid cash for their car or bought it through a credit arrangement with Rover's finance subsidiary. The pioneering initiatives from Ford and Rover reflect the growing importance of sales and marketing and the issue of customer satisfaction as the new frontier for competition between carmakers, which increasingly have managed to close the gap between each other in manufacturing efficiency and quality. Rover said it had no fears that the scheme would be abused by drivers looking for free car hire. Toyota to boost output, Page 12</p>

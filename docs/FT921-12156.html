			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / PLO casts shadow over peace talks DEMANDS by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for a broader Palestinian representation at the Middle East peace talks have cast a shadow over the multinational forum due to open in Moscow today. US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation and made it clear the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel in 1987. Palestinian delegates, including their spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi, are pictured driving to Amman, Jordan, to discuss the issue with PLO officials. Full report, Page 4</p>

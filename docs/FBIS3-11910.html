I believe the end of the embargo is neither in sight nor in  the future, as the most pessimistic might think.    The rejection of this ineffective and hostile posture toward  Cuba has increased considerably. Concurrently, this U.S.  position meets the determined resistance of important forces  both in and outside government circles.    Summing up the opinions of the increasingly large number of  those who oppose the embargo, the Miami newspaper the NEW HERALD  reported on 7 March: "From religious and humanitarian  organizations to conservative editors and from civil rights  groups to business managers the various groups that criticize  the commercial embargo say it is a Cold War relic that harms  U.S. business or contributes to poverty on the island."    To this must be added the beginning of the embargo debates  in  the House of Representatives. Apart from the final results, the  internal pressure has reached a point where, in addition to many  expressions of international repudiation, two UN resolutions  have been issued on the issue.    To all this could be added the powerful movement the  organization Pastors for Peace coordinates in the United States  against the embargo. An increasing number of U.S. church people  are participating in this crusade, which picks up followers in  other countries and Europe as well.    The fact the most influential U.S. newspapers, including THE  WALL STREET JOURNAL, have criticized the embargo as the best way  to deal with Cuba is another very meaningful indication of the  trend which will prevail gradually and "step by step" [previous  three words in English] in the United States.    If, with the lifting of the blockade against Vietnam, the  realism and levelheadedness of U.S. businessmen has managed to  do away with the dogmatism and anachronism of a group of  officials and legislators, I believe, concerning Cuba's, they  would not be too far away from playing a significant role.    That is, of course, if they are not forced to arrive too  late  to an event where businessmen from the American and European  continents, among other areas, are already operating legally in  places open to them.    All which has been said up to here must still confront tough  opponents, which include, among other elements, electoral  interests which, in their attempt to win the 1996 elections in  Florida, have tied the Cuban policy to the dictates of the  extreme rightist sectors in Miami; a Congress that faces  elections in November and is extremely cautious of its actions;  and even an overloaded official agenda which has not made the  Cuban issue a priority.    To this we have to add, as an ingredient we cannot possibly  ignore, the complicated situation triggered by the so-called  White Water scandal in the current Democratic administration.    In my opinion, boosted by the most rightist sector of the  U.S. political and business scenario with which President  William Clinton has had disagreements since last year, this  process will tend to favor, at least for the time being, those  in Washington who advocate a conservative government position.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rio Algom profits for year decline RIO ALGOM, an independent copper, uranium, potash and coal producer since Rio Tinto Zinc sold its 51 per cent control to the public last June, has reported lower profit for 1992. Though copper prices were favourable, potash operations improved and the Canadian dollar was lower, uranium and metals distribution results were lower. Profit from continuing operations was CDollars 39.4m (USDollars 31.2m), or 85 cents a share, against CDollars 44.8m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed at CDollars 1.03bn. On the same basis, fourth-quarter net equalled 22 cents a share against 29 cents, on revenues of CDollars 263m against CDollars 264.5m. Rio Algom expects to be out of uranium mining by 1996 when supply contracts with Ontario Hydro run out; it operates only one mine at present. It is concentrating on building long-term low cost copper reserves, says the president, Mr Colin MacAulay. Rio's main Canadian copper holding is 34 per cent of the big Highland Valley mine in British Columbia. It also has a strategic interest in the big El Condor copper-gold property, also in British Columbia. Its other principal copper holding is the Cerro Colorado mine in Chile.</p>

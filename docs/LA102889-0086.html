The measure, part of a $67-billion  spending bill, now goes to President Bush for approval. Currently, the ceiling  on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration is $101,250, an  amount below the median price of homes in the District of Columbia and 18  states, including California.  </P></p>

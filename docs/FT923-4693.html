			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Government action lifts Tokyo stocks - But the rise in values may become more difficult to sustain After more than two and a half years of decline, the scale of the recent jump in Japanese share prices seems to reflect a definite turnround in sentiment. The Nikkei average has surged amid heavy volume, gaining 4,245.89 points, or 30 per cent from its six-year low in mid-August. Most market participants seem convinced that the worst is over. 'It's a very, very powerful rebound, one of the strongest I've seen in my life,' says Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson. The first round of buying followed the government's announcement of emergency support measures for the country's banking system. After the Nikkei plunged to a new six-year low of 14,309.41 on August 19, the government announced measures preventing financial institutions from selling shares to boost profits. However, the real spur was anticipation of the economic package announced late on Friday, August 28. Aside from Y10,700bn in public works spending, additional measures to support the stock market were included. On the demand side, additional public investment was allotted to be invested freely in the stock market, while, on the supply side, financial institutions were 'guided' not to sell shares. New offers of former government owned companies, such as Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and JR East, were also suspended. The government decided to allocate Y1,120bn this year in addition to the initially planned Y5,680bn of public funds for investment. There will no limits on equity investments for Y2,280bn of the allocation and, in addition, that Y2,280bn will be managed on a five-year basis rather than the usual one year, easing pressure on fund managers to produce short-term returns. However, while hopes of new demand have added to this week's bullishness it is unlikely that the public funds will pour into the equity market. Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of public pension fund management at Sumitomo Life, says: 'We will buy at dips, but we already have 15 per cent in the equity market, and we are not in a rush.' At the end of last March, funds of health and welfare ministry pensions, the postal savings system, and post office life insurance invested into the stock market totalled Y5,990bn, although the maximum amount allowed was Y11,000bn. Investment management for public funds has been among the most conservative in Japan, and strategists point out that while the government's increase in allocation boosts the potential of funds into the stock market, it will not mean aggressive buying by managers of public funds. 'The government is not saying that we should put the money into the equity market and lose it,' says Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Mr Chudler estimates that on the basis of past allocations by fund managers, some Y1,700bn will flow into the market during the current fiscal year to next March. Meanwhile, the main question is whether share prices have further to rise. The halt on share sales and the increase in buyers has created a temporarily artificial environment for the stock market. While hopes that the government will solve the problems of the banking industry is currently lifting prices, analysts point out that such expectations are dangerous. Mr Tasker at Kleinwort Benson points out that the government is delaying the surfacing of problems, rather than solving them, allowing time for banks to recover until the economy picks up. 'It's wrong to think that the bad debt problems will immediately disappear,' he says. In terms of share price valuation, stocks also look unattractive. The market is currently trading at a price/earnings ratio of 50 times, and with the outlook for corporate earnings still weak, the potential for further gains may be limited. 'It's hard to find buyers at the 19,000 to 20,000 level,' says Mr Chudler. For the current year to next March, Nomura Research Institute, the research division of Nomura Securities, yesterday revised down its corporate earnings outlook for 1,400 companies, including financials. It estimates that pre-tax profits will fall by 17.9 per cent instead of the initial 10 per cent forecast, due to a worse-than-expected fall in consumer spending. Even if economic fundamentals improve, analysts point out that a sustained rise in share prices will not be achieved without a change in the nature of the market, which is currently oriented around capital gains. Since over 70 per cent of the shareholders are institutions, who do not gain from increased dividends due to the tax system, companies have been reluctant to raise dividends. On the long term, it will be hard to achieve a stable market recovery without the participation of individual investors. However, with the current yield on the Nikkei around 0.8 per cent, and other fixed income products offering around 4 per cent, it will be hard to convince individual investors to invest.</p>

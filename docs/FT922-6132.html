			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Norway's top savings banks show advance NORWAY'S top 34 savings banks, which represent 80 per cent of the combined assets of the savings banks, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in first-quarter performance, helped by improved net interest earnings, lower operating costs and cheaper funding by the central bank. According to the Savings Banks' Association, the banks boosted first-quarter net interest income to NKr2.64bn (Dollars 418m) from NKr2.55bn last year. Other operating income rose by NKr50m to NKr450m while operating costs were reduced to NKr1.87bn from NKr2.04bn. Combined first-quarter credit losses were slightly up by NKr30m to NKr860m, however, while the 34 banks' combined operating profit improved to NKr360m from NKr80m in last year's first quarter. The Savings Banks Association yesterday reiterated sharp criticism of the amount of state support issued last year to prop up the country's top three commercial banks, saying it was undermining competition. The association singled out Christiania Bank, which was acquired last year by the state after its equity capital was wiped out by massive losses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Own Information report: "Two Countries' Parliamentarians </F> Unite"]    [Text] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, there was  a meeting in Moscow on 30-31 May between deputies of the Russian  Federation State Duma and U.S. senators involved in defense  questions. On the U.S. side the working groups were headed by  Senators S. Nunn and J. Exon, on the Russian side by S.  Yushenkov and A. Piskunov.    The U.S. legislators voiced extreme concern at the state of  civilian control in the defense sphere in Russia. Special  attention was paid to the need to monitor the observance of the  regime governing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and  nuclear materials and of chemical and bacteriological weapons  and their components. The Russian deputies accepted the need  for civilian control within the framework of the approval of the  federal budget and verification of its implementation as well as  the ratification of international treaties, backed up by the  functions of the parliamentary monitoring of their  implementation.    During the meeting there was a broad exchange of opinions on  the state of affairs in the sphere of strategic offensive  weapons. The question of extending the Nuclear Weapon  Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 was regarded as a priority. The  two sides agreed that in mutual relations with Ukraine special  account is to be taken of the delay in the deadline for the  latter's fulfillment of the obligations under the Lisbon  protocol on affiliation to the Nuclear Weapon Nonproliferation  Treaty, which is holding up the entry into force of the START-1  treaty and the preparation of START-2 for ratification.    Despite the persistent attempts to find coordinated  decisions, it has not yet proved possible to find common  approaches on the possible levels of the further reduction of  strategic offensive arms, even though the sides do not deny the  need for that, or on the creation of the conditions for the  testing im military theaters of ABM systems relating to the 1972  ABM Treaty.    Considerable attention was paid at the meeting to the use of  the U.S. resources allocated by the Nunn-Lugar initiative to the  destruction and recycling of nuclear and other types of arms  belonging to the Russian Federation. Attention was drawn to the  fact that these resources are not being used effectively enough.  Of the $432 million allocated in 1992-1993, the Russian side has  used less than $100 million. In view of the slow rate at which  the executive power structures are concluding the relevant  agreements it was deemed expedient to hold joint hearings on  this question in fall 1994.    It was noted that joint military exercises are an important  measure for strengthening confidence between the two countries.  Bearing in mind the complex domestic political situation in the  Russian Federation, the U.S. side agreed to propose to its  government that the initial stage of the joint exercises by  peacemaking forces be switched to U.S. territory.</p>

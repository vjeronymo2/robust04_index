			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Design Council's day of judgment - If bidders are not found by next week, some services will disappear Privatise or die: that is the ultimatum which a big chunk of the UK government-funded Design Council faces over the next week. Wednesday is the deadline for bids from outside organisations wanting to take over the council's range of industrial services. Before the end of the month these services are likely to have new owners, or be set to disappear. The privatisation is part of a wholesale shake-up of the Design Council which began last September. Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister, made it clear that the existing body, which had provided design advice to British industry for nearly 50 years, was to be largely dismantled. In its place was to be reborn a much smaller, more highly-focused advisory body, which would not, itself, get involved in the direct delivery of services to industry and the design profession. Its staff of about 200 was to be reduced by three-quarters, its annual Pounds 7.5m grant substantially cut, and its Haymarket, central London, offices vacated. Many of its industrial functions were to be transferred to the new national network of one-stop business service centres, called Business Links, which was being set up by the government. The announcement caused less of an outcry than might have been expected, for over the years the council had lost much of its public profile. There was widespread criticism that the council had moved away from educating consumers and promoting to industry the styling aspects, for example, of design, while becoming increasingly pre-occupied with engineering issues. John Sorrell, the newly-appointed chairman of the Design Council, himself a designer and a former chairman of the Design Business Association, began an intensive four-month review of the objectives and structure of the body. At the same time, the serving director general, Ivor Owen, stepped down and a career civil servant, Evelyn Ryle, moved in on a short-term assignment to shed or redeploy staff, and to dispose of the council's industrial services. These services include: Materials information service, which provides enquirers with free information on the properties, sourcing and application of materials. The service is provided under contract to the Department of Trade and Industry. Innovation noticeboard, which helps to put inventors in touch with companies which could produce and market their ideas. Companies request to be included on the innovation database and projects are screened by panels of new product development specialists. Design advisory service, a subscription service which offers the help of design advisers to companies wanting to prepare specifications for design consultancy work, as well as recommending suitable design practices from a consultancy register. Consultancy register, which vets designers and includes them, for a fee, on a register. Disciplines on the register include graphics, interior, engineering, textiles and human factors design. Enterprise Initiative design consultancy scheme, which is operated under contract to the DTI and enables companies to use a specialist design consultancy for projects for up to 15 days, with at least a third of the cost paid by the DTI. Industrial training and marketing, which organises new product development seminars under contract to the DTI. This unit also markets the council's range of industrial services. A central research unit also supports these services. The original intention was to keep all of the components of the industrial services together and to invite 'integrated' bids from interested parties. Says Ryle: 'The services together are bigger than the sum of the parts. No one person can be an expert in all the areas of design. The services we have feed off one another. We and the DTI started off by saying that, because of the synergy of the components, an integrated bid was a better solution if we could achieve it.' By the time the May 31 deadline for bids was reached, though, it was clear that the integrated option would not work. In spite of four full bids, Ryle was forced to write in a memo to staff two weeks ago: 'I am sorry to have to tell you that, in the end, the financial contributions which the various parties were seeking from the government fell well outside what DTI would have considered acceptable, and therefore all the integrated bids failed.' In other words, all four bidders - their identities have not been disclosed  -wanted to be assured of government grants to cover the less commercial parts of the operation. As Ryle admits: 'Quite a lot of our work in these areas is subsidised by the Design Council's grant in aid. The Design Council never was, and was never intended to be, a fully commercial operation.' A further worry to bidders must have been the operation of the Business Links. It is still unclear exactly what their role will be in relation to design, and how much money they will have to spend on it. It is expected that the DTI will be reluctant to tie the hands of the Business Links by specifying that they must buy in the former Design Council industrial services. Meanwhile, the 'integrated' option has been jettisoned by Ryle and fresh bids for a piecemeal disposal have been invited. According to DesignWeek, interested bodies include the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the Chartered Society of Designers, the Design Business Association and the Design Museum. It is likely that some synergy will be lost, says Ryle: 'The amount lost will depend on how many of the individual bits we succeed in privatising and how prepared their new owners are to allow them to work co-operatively in the future.' And what of those that fail the privatisation test? 'If we don't have bidders for individual services, then it is unlikely that they have a future,' she concludes.</p>

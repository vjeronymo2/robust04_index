			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A BAD IDEA FOR BORDER  </P> <P> As an idea to reduce illegal immigration or drug traffic from Mexico into the  United States, the proposed ditch at the Otay Mesa border crossing probably  makes as about much sense as the notoriously ineffective "Tortilla Curtain," a  chain-link fence erected 10 years ago.  </P> <P> The ditch would not hinder the overwhelming majority of aliens and smugglers  who travel by foot. It is designed to make it harder for about 3,000 vehicles  that drive illegally across the border between Otay Mesa and San Ysidro each  year, and make it easier for U. S. Border Patrol agents to catch those who  circumvent the ditch. That would reduce drug and alien traffic and help prevent  accidents caused by reckless smugglers, Border Patrol officials say.  </P> <P> Whether the ditch would succeed in this goal is doubtful. But, even if it did,  the people in those 3,000 vehicles, up to eight or nine in a car or up to 25 in  a van, are a tiny percentage of the estimated 1 million people who cross  illegally each year in the San Diego area. And what's to stop them from  crossing by foot? As a tool against illegal immigration or drug trafficking,  the ditch is just one more finger in the dike and not worth jeopardizing  relations with Mexico.  </P> <P> But, as an idea to channel Otay Mesa rain runoff, which threatens to flood  areas on the Mexican side of the border -- the original reason Mexico suggested  the ditch -- the ditch probably makes sense. At least, the engineers from the  International Boundary and Water Commission thought so.  </P> <P> Just how and why the ditch went from being the solution to an international  drainage problem to being a solution to a smuggling problem is a bit murky.  That the Mexican government was blind-sided by U. S. officials is fairly clear,  however.  </P> <P> The controversy is just one more illustration of the uneasy relations between  the two countries. It also telegraphs the reaction that the Mexican government  is likely to have to even more radical proposals by the Federation for American  Immigration Reform, for a sunken concrete wall topped by a fence running along  25 miles of the border, and the idea by FAIR and Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego),  to charge a fee for legally crossing the border.  </P> <P> Both proposals are likely to increase friction between the two countries and  neither does anything to address the root causes of illegal immigration and  drug traffic.  </P> <P> Ironically, the news of the ditch came the same week as an announcement by the  San Diego Assn. of Governments that it would be exploring the idea of a  binational airport with Mexico on Otay Mesa as part of its study of alternative  locations for the overcrowded Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> If the history of the ditch is any indication, something as complex as a  binational airport -- no matter how logical it might be -- is unlikely to be  achieved.  </P> <P> With so many issues that need cooperation between the two governments, and the  promise of better relations suggested by the new presidents of both countries,  it's a shame that a fairly simple plan to solve a fairly simple drainage  problem was sidetracked into the diplomatically dangerous arena of immigration  control.  </P> <P> The ditch should go back to the engineers' drawing boards, and the decision on  whether to build it should be based on whether it solves the drainage problem.  </P></p>

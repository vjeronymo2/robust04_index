			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: NHL pays Pounds 0.75m to former directors NATIONAL HOME Loans, the troubled centralised mortgage lender, yesterday disclosed that it paid Pounds 748,000 compensation to four board directors who left the company after the full extent of its difficulties became clear. NHL disclosed the payment in its annual report. Shareholders were told that it had agreed to pay only one year's salary to the directors involved, although their contracts provided for three years' compensation. The company said the directors involved were Mr Kevin Milner, its former chief executive, Mr Anthony Moir, the former finance director, and Mr Christopher Slay and Mr Kenneth Lewis, formerly executive directors. The company's annual meeting - from which journalists were excluded - was told that it was still trying to exchange two D-Mark bond issues worth a total of Pounds 120.1m. It had expected to complete the transaction last month. Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said afterwards he now expected to complete the transactions putting back the date when the loans have to be repaid within six weeks. The company wants to make the loans due at the end of 1995. In November, NHL announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 146.4m, which cut its net assets to Pounds 11.2m. Because net assets fell below half shareholders' called-up share capital of Pounds 114.1m, the company had to call an extraordinary meeting. The EGM, held yesterday after the AGM, resolved to allow the current management to continue with its strategy of trying to repay on-balance sheet debts of Pounds 700m, and improve the flow of income from its mortgage assets. Mr Perry told the meeting that Pounds 120m of debt had been repaid since June. He also said the group had increased margins by passing on only 1.35 percentage points of a 3 percentage point base rate fall to mortgage borrowers.</p>

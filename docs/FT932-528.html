			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Rabin seeks to justify government record MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday set out the achievements of his one-year-old coalition government in an effort to bolster waning public support. In an address to the nation, broadcast live on state-run radio, Mr Rabin conceded he had failed to deliver his electoral promise of a peace settlement with Palestinians and Arab neighbours within six to nine months. But he said substantial progress had been made in the negotiations and that there was 'no other road'. 'Maybe I was wrong when I gave too short a time period to reach a settlement and I raised too many expectations,' Mr Rabin said. He said the government had boosted internal security by its 'permanent closure' of the occupied-territories, improved relations with Washington, secured the Dollars 10bn US loan guarantees and restructured economic priorities towards spending on infrastructure and education.</p>

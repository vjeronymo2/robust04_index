			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Peps help recovery in unit trusts THE POPULARITY of Personal Equity Plans (Peps) helped unit-trust sales recover last year after a disappointing 1990. Net investment in unit-trust Peps was Pounds 652.2m last year, contributing about a quarter of the industry's net investment for the year. Investments in a Pep are free of income tax and capital gains tax. Further encouragement was that the industry was attracting retail, rather than institutional, investors. Net direct investment by individuals in the first three quarters of last year was Pounds 1.73bn, compared with Pounds 757m by institutions. The recovery of unit-trust investment last year was helped by the strong stock market. Yet the industry's overall net investment figure for the year of Pounds 2.77bn, while up on the Pounds 392m recorded in 1990, was well down on the Pounds 8.2bn in the peak year of 1987. At the end of the year, the value of funds under management was Pounds 55.1bn, up from the Pounds 46.3bn reached at the end of 1990 but down from the peak of Pounds 58.2bn at the end of 1989.</p>

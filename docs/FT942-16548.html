			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Somewhere to go on a wet afternoon? The atmosphere was tense. Shareholders were spoiling for a fight after the announcement of heavy losses and the board knew it. As the chairman came to call for questions from the floor, the directors looked down nervously at their notes. The well-dressed woman sitting in the front row was called on first, and the tension became almost tangible. 'Can you tell me Mr Chairman,' demanded a baritone voice which left no doubts that first impressions can be misleading. 'Can you tell me why your credit card department will not deal with my sex shop?' Such stories are rife in the lore of general meetings. The cast of characters range from the AGM-goers who turn up with plastic bags into which they tip trays of sandwiches, to political protestors such as those at Thursday's Lloyd's Bank meeting. Several of the most energetic demonstrators were carried out and dumped on the street. Barclays has occasionally been saved such embarrassment in the past, for example when a shareholder decided to take matters into her own hands. Growing increasingly tired of a diatribe against loans to South Africa from the man sitting in front of her, the woman stood up and beat him over the head with her handbag. In the end, the dissident was forced to appeal to the chair for protection. Then again, there is the faithful shareholder who turns up every year to ask just one question. At North Sea Assets, the energy industry services supplier, the chairman greets her by name. Private shareholders are notorious for making the most unusual criticisms, which even the most diligent board could not predict, such as the chivalrous Titaghur investor, who objected to the use of the word 'pee' to define the currency in which dividends were paid. Yet not all the surprises come from the floor. Mr Gerald Ratner, the former head of the jewellery chain now known as Signet, found the experience of facing angry shareholders so intimidating that he hired security guards for one AGM who enthusiastically deflected any approaches as he left. Mr George Walker, former head of the leisure group Brent Walker, also caused comment when he resigned from the board by unexpectedly joining the audience. Then there are the meetings where no one turns up. 'The board loves it,' says one PR who helps to organise AGMs. 'There are no difficult questions, which means they can go off for lunch early.'</p>

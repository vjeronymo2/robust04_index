			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING CRITICIZED  </P> <P> On Jan. 22, I was shocked to see a photo in your Real Estate Section of one of  the most loathsome architectural creations in recent Los Angeles history. But I  was delighted to finally learn that it has a name, a price and people claiming  responsibility: Andrex Point/Los Angeles; $75 million, Johnson Fain &amp;  Pereira Associates. Now I can point my finger at someone with derision.  </P> <P> Andrex Point simply does not make sense above the first level of windows and  the tasteful landscaping. It hints at slick, but doesn't use mirrored windows  -- it uses a most uncomfortable flat, lifeless gray-green paneling and bands of  dark glass. It departs from the square and the block with what I can only  describe as vintage Winnebago.  </P> <P> And then the final insult to someone's serious efforts, which became a joke:  From the southbound 405 Freeway at about Normandie Avenue, the west facade  turns into a grid of squiggles. It looks like a child's drawing, or a  draftsman's who forgot to bring his straightedge to work.  </P> <P> RICHARD G. LAUX  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech of Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial </F> CPC Committee, made at the forum on cultivating and nurturing  entrepreneurs cosponsored by the provincial party committee and  the provincial government on 1 May]    [Text] With the focus on cultivating and nurturing the  ranks of entrepreneurs, this forum discusses the issues on how  to deepen the discussion of the issue concerning entrepreneurs  and on how to reform the enterprise cadre management methods to  make the cadre and personnel affairs work suit the demands of  the market economy. I am going to set forth the following three  opinions:    1. The buildup of the entrepreneur ranks has become the key  to deepening the economic structural reform and building our  province into an economically powerful province.    Achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises,  particularly state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, is  an important and difficult task in setting up the socialist  market economic system. If we fail to achieve and enliven the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the course of  reforming the economic system, the dominant role of the state  sector of the economy will become weakened, the new market  economic system will not take shape, and the socialist nature of  the market economy will seriously be affected. Enlivening and  achieving state-owned enterprises, particularly large and  medium-sized enterprises, is a basic task for deepening the  economic structural reform and building an economically powerful  province. The state and the government certainly assume the  responsibility for achieving and enlivening state-owned  enterprises. For instance, the state and the government should  strengthen macroeconomic control to create conditions for  enlivening the microeconomy, should delegate power to lower  levels according to the requirements as set forth in the  "enterprise law" and the "regulations" to make enterprises  actually have the rights to independent management, and should  positively provide enterprises with a social guarantee system  and the conditions for setting up markets to create a good  social environment for changing the enterprise managerial  mechanism. However, the key to actually enlivening and  achieving state-owned enterprises hinges on enterprises  themselves. The enterprises should grasp favorable  opportunities, apply the state and the government's policies and  laws as well as various resources provided by the markets, work  out accurate policy decisions, and achieve management. External  cause is the condition for changes and internal cause is the  basis for changes. So, the key to enlivening enterprises hinges  and depends on enterprises themselves.    The key to achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises  under appropriate conditions hinges on personnel. To solve the  problems in this regard, there must be outstanding entrepreneurs  with both professional ability and political integrity, with  knowledge of the market economy, with management ability, with  courage and insight, with the daring to make attempts and to do  pioneering work, and with the courage to keep forging ahead.  Countless facts prove that with an outstanding entrepreneur, an  enterprise will be able to find out information, products,  technologies, capital, and skilled persons. An outstanding  entrepreneur is able to grasp favorable opportunities, overcome  existing difficulties, and find out ways and methods for  eliminating contradictions. An enterprise lacking an  outstanding entrepreneur, cannot enliven itself although its  external conditions are good. At present, enterprises' deficits  increase by a big margin due to historical, realistic, and  objective reasons. But, responsible persons of enterprises  should be held responsible for some of the reasons because they  do not have sufficient motivation and pressure. The importance  of the role of entrepreneur to an enterprise is thus clear! To  achieve and enliven state-owned enterprises and develop the  socialist market economy, we must cultivate a large number of  outstanding entrepreneurs.    2. We should strengthen organizational leadership and  deepen the discussions of the issue concerning entrepreneurs.    The publication of Comrade Zhang Shire's [name as published]  article drew attention from all fronts. Press units also  organized the personages of all fronts to express opinions and  hold discussions. Relevant departments under the  provincial-level organs also thought out and explored ways for  building up and cultivating an outstanding of entrepreneur rank.  The question at present is how to further draw the attention of  all fronts and to deepen the discussion of this issue.    Our aim in supporting this discussion is to unify the  understanding of the leaders at various levels and all social  fronts, to promote the economic structural reform, to realize  the target of building an economically powerful province, and to  mobilize all fronts to pay attention to, support, cultivate, and  build up a large number of outstanding entrepreneurs. To deepen  this discussion, we should grasp the following few key points:    A. The leaders at various levels and all fronts in society  should define entrepreneurs's key positions and functions in  enterprises and the market economy. This issue is not only a  matter relating to entrepreneurs themselves as well as some  government departments but also a matter that should be defined  by the leaders at various levels and all fronts in society.    B. Entrepreneurs themselves should further make efforts to  upgrade their own quality to suit the new situation of the  market economy. They must not remain satisfied with being plant  directors and managers under the planned economic conditions any  longer but should strive to be outstanding entrepreneurs  fighting under the market economic system.    C. Party committees, governments, people's congresses, and  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  organizations, and all departments concerned should regard  entrepreneurs as the most important factor of production  factors, proceed from the development of productive forces, and  mobilize all fronts to support, show concern about, protect, and  cherish entrepreneurs. Governments should change their functions  and delegate power to lower levels. Legislation and law  enforcement departments should protect the legal rights and  interests of entrepreneurs. All discussions, party committees,  governments, and all departments should determine ways to  support entrepreneurs.    D. Organizational and personnel affairs departments should  emancipate the mind, renew ideas, and reform the ways for  management of enterprise cadres according to the new situation  of the market economy. There are differences between enterprise  cadres and the local party committee workers and government  officers. Therefore, enterprises should carry out the  competition mechanism in selecting and employing cadres.  Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should optimize  reasonable distribution and organization according to the  principle of market competition.    E. How can the restructuring departments and the industrial  and commercial management departments closely link the  implementation of the modern enterprise system with the reform  of the enterprise cadre management system in the course of  reforming the enterprise system? They should select and employ  outstanding entrepreneurs to promote the reform of the  enterprise property right system and the setup of the modern  enterprise system. Simultaneously, they should also be good at  discovering and employing, through selection, outstanding  entrepreneurs in the course of setting up the modern enterprise  system.    3. According to the market's economic requirements, we  should  positively promote the reform of the enterprise cadre management  system.    The organizational and personnel affairs departments should  attend to the following few principles in order to promote the  reform of the enterprise cadre management system according to  the requirements of the market economy.    A. According to enterprises' different situations,  organizational and personnel affairs departments should set  forth different new ideas and methods for managing the cadres of  enterprises of different categories. There are four different  categories of enterprises as follows:    The first category indicates the state-owned enterprises  where systems have been reformed and the shareholding system is  mainly carried out. The shareholding enterprises have four  conditions. First, limited liability companies. The companies  of this kind involve those with legal persons as their  shareholders and those wholly funded by the state. Second,  limited companies. The companies of this kind involve those  with legal persons and staff members and workers as shareholders  and those where fixed amounts of shares are sold to society by  legal persons. The second category indicates the state-owned  enterprises where systems have not been reformed yet and the  contract system is being carried out. The third category  indicates the urban collective enterprises whose cadres had been  transferred by the governments for a long period of time in the  past. The fourth category indicates the rural and urban  collective enterprises where a considerable number of cadres are  transferred by the town and township governments. Now, we are  going to study the methods of managing the cadres of the  enterprises of these four different categories and will set  forth methods for selecting, recommending, and employing cadres  for these enterprises according to the requirements of the  market economy.    B. To cultivate and nurture entrepreneurs, we should not  only provide the necessary conditions for cultivation but also  select the best and eliminate the worst through competition.  Therefore, we must create an environment where entrepreneurs can  compete with one another on equal terms. We should work out  encouragement and restriction mechanisms and have the daring to  give handsome awards and inflict heavy punishment so that a  group of outstanding entrepreneurs will emerge and a group of  incompetent enterprise responsible persons will be eliminated.  Up until now, our enterprise cadres only promoted but never  demoted anyone. Handsome awards could not be given to those who  made contributions, and those who were incompetent could not be  eliminated. Motivation and pressure was insufficient. Our  state-owned enterprise leading cadres and entrepreneurs' quality  is not lower than that of individual and private enterprise  entrepreneurs, and the work of state-owned enterprise leading  cadres and entrepreneurs is more difficult than that of  individual and private enterprise entrepreneurs. Why does the  state allow the entrepreneurs of private and individual  enterprises to make larger amounts of money for themselves? Why  are our state-owned enterprises not given proper remuneration  from making larger amounts of profits and creating profits and  taxes for the state? Heavy award means further mobilizing  entrepreneurs' enthusiasm through material and honorary awards.  On the other hand, if you make enterprises go bankrupt due to  your incompetence, you will no longer be entitled to being a  cadre or enjoying a good reputation in society. You will  neither register yourselves to the industrial and commercial  administrative departments within a set time nor be appointed as  enterprise responsible persons by any enterprises. Awards must  be handsome and penalties must be heavy. There must be such  examples of courage and daring. The province as well as all  localities should explore scientific and reasonable ideas and  methods for handsome awards and heavy penalties.    C. Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should enter  markets. Distribution needs to be reasonable and organization  needs to be optimized. We should positively make preparations  and set up entrepreneur markets. I hope that Tangshan and  Shijiazhuang cities take the lead in this regard. We should  formulate regulations and methods governing entrepreneur markets.    D. We should proceed from the reality of the market economy  to positively explore ways for management of enterprise cadres.  First, there should be realistic requirements for  entrepreneurs' ages and records of formal schooling. Second, we  should popularize Tangshan's methods for recommending and  appointing cadres by the organizational and personnel affairs  departments. That is, recommend and appoint a cadre or a top  leader for an enterprise. Third, the enterprises with conditions  can carry out the method that enterprise party and government  cadres "assume full responsibility."    E. Entrepreneurs' associations, organizations of  entrepreneurs themselves, should understand and reflect the  voices of entrepreneurs and make efforts to protect the legal  rights and interests of entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, these  associations should play a positive role in upgrading  entrepreneurs' quality and cultivating and nurturing  entrepreneur ranks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Falling Educational Standards and Senate </F> Chairman's Warning"]    [Text] Expressing concern over the falling educational  standards and unrest in educational institutions, Senate  Chairman Wasim Sajjad said that if the educational system is not  improved our country's existence will be in danger. Every  concerned citizen would agree with Mr. Sajjad's opinion about  the deteriorating educational system in our country. Our  educational system was never coordinated with the needs of the  nation and we could not get rid of the British system of  education even after independence. The main purpose of that  educational system was to create office clerks. This system is  totally decayed now because of bribery, nepotism, corruption,  and political interference in schools. Cheating in examinations  has become the rule. "Cheating mafia" and other control groups  have taken over the examination centers. Kalishnakovs and  political influence are used to allow students to openly cheat  in examinations. Thus, some students pass examinations without  learning anything, and the bright students who really want to  learn are deprived of their right and feel discouraged. The  political parties have affected the educational atmosphere in  these institutions very badly. The students waste more time in  political activities than in learning. Many schools are closed  because of confrontations between student groups. The hands that  should carry books carry kalishnakov rifles. Thus, we are moving  towards degeneration very rapidly. The world is changing very  fast and the speed with which science and technology are making  progress calls for us to improve our educational system.  However, because of our administrative weakness, dishonesty, and  corruption, we are moving toward the goal of ignorance. This  unfortunate situation has deteriorated so badly that mere  ceremonial talks will not alleviate this problem. All sections  of our society have to unite and try with full responsibility to  improve this situation. Otherwise, our paralyzed education  system will make Mr. Wasim Sajjad's fear that our national  identity and existence is in danger become true. Our leaders  should understand fully that unless we improve our educational  system thoroughly, we will cannot make an important place for  the nation at the international level.</p>

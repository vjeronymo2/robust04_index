			<p>BFN     [Text] Several dozen kilos of explosives were found just  over two hours ago on the outskirts of Rome. It is likely that  the explosives were to be used in an attack on one of the most  famous Mafia supergrasses -- Salvatore Totuccio Contorno. The  supergrass lives in a secret hiding place, which is probably not  too far from where the explosives were found. Francesco Vitale  reports from the scene.    [Begin Vitale recording] The Mafia has used 70 kilos of  explosives to relaunch its offensive against the state and Mafia  supergrasses.    This evening fear returned to Rome, three kilometers down  the  Via Formellese, at the junction with the Cassia-Bis road. Five  boxes containing explosives linked up to a car battery were  placed in a gutter. It was a huge amount of explosives and  could have caused a massacre. Carabinieri bomb disposal experts  detonated the explosive device and what you are looking at is  the crater made by the explosion.    Why did the Mafia plant this bomb? The road where the bomb  was found is one that supergrass Totuccio Contorno uses every  day. He lives just a few kilometers away.    The investigators remain cautious, but it is likely that the  famous Mafia supergrass was the killers' target. Contorno has  not collaborated with investigators for some time, but he is  obviously still the Sicilian Mafia's number one enemy.    It is still not known how the bomb was found. It was  probably reported to the Carabinieri, perhaps by a passer-by.  Following jailed Mafia boss of bosses Toto Riina's invectives  against supergrasses, the latest was yesterday afternoon, Cosa  Nostra has turned from words to deeds.    Totuccio Contorno is the supergrass who has paid the highest  price in terms of human life. The Mafia has killed nearly all  his relatives, including his cousins three and four times  removed. Luckily the bomb attack was thwarted, but once again  Cosa Nostra has shown it can strike undisturbed just as easily  in Rome as Palermo. [end recording]</p>

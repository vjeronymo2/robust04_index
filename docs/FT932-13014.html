			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Unease over security as frustrations build up ASSURANCES that business would continue as usual were again much in evidence as mopping up began yesterday after the City's second one-tonne bomb in just over a year. But this time the questions being asked were more pointed, the unease among financial institutions more pronounced. Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, which owns Midland Bank as well as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, summed up the sense of frustration. 'I am absolutely sure that the authorities are doing the best they can. It is very difficult, I'm sure, to track down these people. But it does seem quite extraordinary that that quantity of explosives can be put in a truck and brought into the City.' The shock from this second bomb could have a bigger impact in the long term than the first. Sir William said: 'At a time when there is a fair amount of competition for a future central bank of Europe, this must work against the case for it being in London.' The attack is likely to have little effect on where institutions such as National Westminster Bank and HSBC Holding - two of those worst hit  - choose to do business. NatWest operates at the heart of the UK financial establishment, while HSBC only moved its head office from Hong Kong to London at the start of this year. Through subsidiaries such as James Capel and Midland Bank, as well as through the London branch of the Hongkong Bank, it has one of the biggest presences of any financial institution in London. The Corporation of London, the City's local authority, lists HSBC and NatWest - alongside BP, the oil giant - as among its biggest ratepayers, shouldering a large part of the Corporation's annual Pounds 700m budget. Large institutions such as these had already pressed after last year's bomb for a greater police presence to protect the City from terrorist attack and are likely to become more vociferous still this time around. The devastation could have more of an effect on institutions whose presence in London is smaller. The number of foreign banks in London has remained more or less constant at about 500, but many have already cut operations sharply in the face of unprofitable banking markets in recent years. Events such as the Bishopsgate bomb may give some the excuse they need to pack up altogether, though this would have little impact on the City's main markets. The City establishment was yesterday dismissing the thought that London's competitive position was about to be undermined. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said: 'At first glance, this is obviously bad for the City. But it does provide the opportunity to emphasise that it is business as usual the next morning, which is, after all, what the City stands for. I'm confident that, whatever the pressures, the City remains competitive.' Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange - itself the target of terrorist bombs in the past - added: 'It's perilously easy to get overwhelmed by the drama of events like this. Other centres have their problems - though perhaps they haven't had two big bombs like us.' He pointed to the terrorist bomb this year at New York's World Trade Centre and to the assassination in the past two decades of the heads of two of Germany's biggest banks - Alfred Herrhausen of Deutsche Bank and Jurgen Ponto of Dresdner - as proof that other financial centres faced similar difficulties. The Bank of England also waded in to the debate in defence of London's financial centre, which recorded Pounds 16.9bn of overseas earnings in 1991. 'The experience of last time doesn't suggest that this will affect the City's ability to do business internationally or to attract business from overseas,' the Bank said. It conceded, though, that as far as London's competitive position was concerned, 'obviously it doesn't help'. Behind the assurances was an acceptance that the City would remain vulnerable to terrorist attack and that the cost of insuring against damage to property or the loss of earnings that results from bomb attack is likely to rise further. Last year's bomb had already led to a doubling of the cost of insuring large commercial buildings in the City, according to the Corporation. The proof that Europe's leading financial centre is vulnerable to terrorist attack, in spite of extra security arrangements introduced after last year's bomb outside the Baltic Exchange, has not come at a good time for the City establishment. Last month's move by the Stock Exchange to scrap its planned Taurus automated settlement system, at an estimated cost of Pounds 400m, was a big reversal for the credibility of London's securities markets - though the computer disaster had little effect on the operations of the markets. Foreign financial institutions often complain of London's poor transport system or its heavy burden of regulation on the wholesale investment markets  -though recent steps have reduced the second of these complaints. The threat of bombing, and the probable rise in the cost of insuring against it, could become the latest on the list of moans. The City's future security arrangements were already the subject of discussion yesterday. 'There's no financial centre that is free from all risk, and we can't expect to be either,' the Bank of England said. However, the Corporation, whose budget supports an 800-strong police force, among other services, was working on plans yesterday to make the chance of a third bomb more remote. 'This has got to have some impact on security arrangements,' said Sir Andrew Hugh Smith. 'There will have to be some further tightening up.' The Corporation has been trying to discourage private cars from entering the City area, in part by turning side-streets into pedestrian areas. This process will be accelerated, said Mr Michael Cassidy, head of policy, allowing the police to put more effort into checking commercial vehicles going into the Square Mile. There was an acceptance at the Corporation and elsewhere, though, that the City could not be protected from all risks of attack. The bomb is also likely to have a direct financial impact, in the process adding to the cost of operating in the City and making it a less attractive centre from which to operate. Insurance costs have risen as a result of last year's bomb, as insurance companies have moved to exclude terrorist damage as an insurable risk and a government-backed reinsurance arrangement has been launched. According to most estimates of the cost of the weekend's damage, the private-sector contribution to this insurance fund for the current year has been more than exhausted, leaving it to the taxpayer to foot part of the bill - and the full cost of any further damage to large commercial buildings on the UK mainland from further terrorist attack over the coming year. Given this, it was thought highly probable yesterday that insurance premiums to cover the risk of terrorism will increase sharply in future years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 8, IRNA -- Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias said here Wednesday [8 June] that talks  between Iranian and European officials would help remove any  obstacle in the way of relations between Iran and the European  Union (EU).    Greece is now trying to improve Iran-EU relations and help  them have "good" ties, the Greek foreign minister said in a  joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar  Velayati.    He departed Tehran after the conference.    The minister expressed hope that the present impediments to  the relations between some European countries and Iran would be  removed.    Referring to the Bosnian issue, Papoulias said despite  problems facing Europe, it is now trying to solve the issue.  However, he admitted that the question has remained unsolved  for europe.    Papoulias, terming the Bosnian issue as a European problem,  maintained that the issue could be solved through peaceful means  and that there would be no military solution.    EU member states and the permanent members of the United  Nations Security Council in the latest meeting on the Bosnian  crisis reached the conclusion that the Bosnian issue could be  resolved solely through negotiations between the warring sides.    Velayati termed as "positive" Papolias talks with Iranian  officials which he said focused on international issues,  especially relations between EU and the Islamic Republic of Iran  and on growing ties between Tehran and Athens .    On the issue of human rights, Velayati said that Iranian  officials, based on their Islamic beliefs and ideology, believed  that human rights should be respected by all countries.    He added that the recent meeting of the foreign ministers of  the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Cairo approved that human  rights should be observed by the third world countries with  regard to their beliefs and ideologies.    Papoulias, who arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day  official  stay at the head of a high ranking delegation, conferred with  president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his iranian counterpart  'Ali Akbar Velayati.    Papoulias and Velayati in two rounds of talks discussed  expansion of Tehran's relations with the EU and Greece, the  crisis in the Balkans and issues relevant to Central Asian and  Caucasus republics.</p>

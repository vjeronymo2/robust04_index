			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Six out of every 10 big  companies say they are overstaffed in the wake of Japan's worst  economic recession in postwar history, according to a survey  released Wednesday [4 May] by an affiliate of the national  personnel authority.    The Japan Institute of Personnel Administration asked 1,052  major Japanese companies, including some which are listed on the  first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A total of 34.6  percent of the firms responded to the survey, which was  conducted last October.    Of the respondents, 16.8 percent said the number of their  employees outstrips their earnings performance, the survey  found. The figure contrasted sharply with the corresponding  figure of 7.5 percent a year before.    More than 41 percent of the respondents said their labor  supply in relation to their business performance was "rather  excessive." The corresponding figure for the previous year was  28.6 percent.    The survey also showed that the larger the corporation, the  heavier the labor burden. The recession was seen as weighing  particularly heavily on manufacturers as opposed to those in the  service or retail industries.    About 36 percent of the respondents in nonmanufacturing  sectors said they implemented some type of labor retrenchment  programs in 1993, according to the survey. Of the figure, 77.9  percent said they refrained from recruiting new employees,  followed by 70.6 percent which squeezed overtime hours of  employees and 58.9 percent who transferred employees to  subsidiaries or subcontractors.    A total of 5.5 percent said they pared down their work force  by recommending employees to voluntarily quit the company, the  survey said.    A total of 9.8 percent replied that they implemented  temporary lay-off programs, the survey said.</p>

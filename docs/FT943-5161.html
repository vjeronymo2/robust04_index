			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Mielke trial adjourned again Mr Erich Mielke, 86, one-time boss of former East Germany's Stasi secret police, yesterday once again side-stepped the German judicial system after his defence accused the presiding judge of bias. The trial in Berlin was adjourned after 25 minutes when lawyers for Mr Mielke accused the judge, of bias because he had visited the former Stasi boss in prison last week. Mr Mielke's defence has said it will try to have the case dropped on the grounds that the defendant is too old. Mr Mielke first went on trial with Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, in November 1991 but was later sentenced to six years imprisonment for the murder of two Berlin policemen in 1931. To simplify the trial, Mr Mielke is now accused of murdering a nominal six people who tried to cross the Berlin Wall.</p>

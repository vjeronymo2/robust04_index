			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sales data knock pound Trading in currency markets was dominated yesterday by the pound, which lost ground across the board. The release of weaker than expected economic figures prompted speculation about an early reduction in interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. The combination of subdued December retail sales figures and confirmation of a benign inflationary environment convinced the market that a rate cut had become more likely. The interest rate expectations were reflected in other financial markets. In the futures market, after opening at 94.74, the March short sterling contract rose 11 basis points to trade at a high of 94.85 before falling back in late trading to 94.81. After closing on Tuesday at DM2.618, the pound fell below the DM2.60 level in early trading. Later it moved above DM2.6050, before falling back to finish in London nearly 1 3/4 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.6016. Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays said sterling had been 'trashed' on the back of the numbers and the easier inflationary background, bringing to an end the currency's rise against the D-Mark from DM2.54 in mid-December to above DM2.62 last week. 'The negative side of the pound is now coming much more to the fore.' added Mr Luxton. Although December's seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent fall in retail sales was unexpected, the currency's pull-back was not a complete surprise, with analysts viewing sterling at DM2.62 as 'frothy'. The pound also started weaker against the dollar, slipping to Dollars 1.49 in morning trading after Tuesday's close of Dollars 1.4972. It finished the day at Dollars 1.4918. The government warned, however, that the market should not link any future interest rate cut to sterling's strength alone. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'We shall watch the exchange rate but we shall also watch a number of domestic indicators, and we shall set interest rates in the light of all those indicators.' Continued pessimism about the framework trade talks between the US and Japan put downward pressure on the dollar in early trading. US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as voicing deep concern about the lack of progress in the talks. The dollar eased against the yen in early London trading to Y110.50 from the overnight London close of Y110.75. However, after the release of better than anticipated trade data, the currency firmed to end in London at Y110.89. Against the D-Mark the dollar traded in a narrow range all day, with investors unwilling to take big positions ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting. The dollar ended at DM1.744, down from Tuesday's London close of DM1.7487. In a Reuters poll, 64 per cent of analysts predicted that the Bundesbank would not cut rates. The majority expect a cut next month. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7455 and Y111.40. The Danish crown weakened against the D-Mark after Denmark's central bank lowered its discount and key deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent on Tuesday. It closed at DKr3.885, compared to Tuesday's Dkr3.877. The rouble continued its recent plunge following the departure from government of the reformist minister Mr Yegor Gaidar. The Russian unit fell yesterday on the St Petersburg Interbank Currency Exchange to 1,627 to the dollar, from 1,527 on Tuesday, moving below Moscow's record low of 1,607 roubles to the dollar. The Bank of England yesterday announced its first regular sale and repurchase facility, which will put Pounds 3.979bn of liquidity into the market, of which Pounds 3.842bn will be provided in the three-week repo expiring on February 10 and Pounds 137m in a five-week repo expiring on February 24. The interest rate of 5 13/32 per cent on the repos is the same rate currently offered on repos in the course of the Bank's daily money market operations. The new arrangements replace a temporary facility in place since September 1992. The Bank introduced the arrangements to help relieve large money market shortages and reduce short-term interest rate volatility. The new facility showed evidence of success by raising nearly Pounds 0.5bn more than the temporary facility, which was about Pounds 3.5bn, and attracting more players. Money market sources said the sudden rush of rate cut speculation was the reason why the shorter-dated facility was larger than the longer facility. Investors did not want to lock into fixed rate funding at current levels when there was a chance they might fall soon. The Bank has indicated that it plans to use the regular facility to 'rough' tune the shortage, while normal money market operations will be used for 'fine' tuning purposes. Accordingly, the Bank is more likely to send interest rate signals to the market through its daily operations rather than through the regular facility. The larger the sums dealt with through the regular facility, the greater the Bank's scope for fine tuning monetary policy through its daily activities. Yesterday was a tight day in the UK money markets, with overnight rates rising from 5 7/8 per cent at the start of trading to above 7 per cent by noon, with the Bank providing limited early assistance. The Bank provided the market with around Pounds 760m of late, unspecified assistance, bringing total help over the day to Pounds 1.137bn, against a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn.  ----------------------------------------           POUND IN NEW YORK  ---------------------------------------- Jan 14        Close     Prev. close  ---------------------------------------- Pounds spot     1.4930      1.4960 1 mth           1.4900      1.4929 3 mth           1.4853      1.4881 1 yr            1.4724      1.4745  ----------------------------------------</p>

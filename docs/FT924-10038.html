			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UN-Iraq accord is denounced THE LATEST United Nations agreement with Iraq was denounced yesterday as 'akin to Florence Nightingale making a pact with Adolf Hitler' by Miss Emma Nicholson, a British Conservative MP, writes Edward Mortimer. Miss Nicholson, launching an appeal to help Shia refugees from south-eastern Iraq, complained that the memorandum of understanding, signed on October 22 by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, talked only about the north. It was, she added, a 'major rip-off' of the world's relief funds, 'so incredible as to beggar belief,' since it left the Iraqi government responsible for organising relief efforts for the southern marshlands, where half a million people are being subjected to 'sustained military and environmental terrorist attacks' by that same government. The memorandum was, she said, 'contrary to all Security Council resolutions,' and she could not understand how Mr Boutros Ghali had authority to sign it.</p>

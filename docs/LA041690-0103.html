			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLAST, FIRE ON INDIA TRAIN KILLS 80 PEOPLE, INJURES 65  </P> <P> A leaking gas cylinder exploded and burned in a passenger train in eastern  India today, killing at least 80 people and injuring 65 others, officials said.  </P> <P> Local reporters said at least 100 people died in the fire, which raged through  two train cars before firefighters extinguished it.  </P> <P> The train was passing through Patna, 500 miles southeast of New Delhi, when the  fire broke out at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> The blaze swept through two cars of the 16-car train before firefighters could  extinguish it, said District Magistrate S. K. Sharma, top civil administrator  in the Patna region.  </P> <P> United News of India quoting local officials said at least 80 people died.  </P> <P> "After smelling something like gas, I felt suffocated and jumped out of the  train," said Ram Narain Prasad, who sustained a head injury in his leap from  the second car.  </P> <P> "We were playing cards. Suddenly a strong smell of gas engulfed the whole  compartment and in a trice, a column of thick smoke and leaping flames  enveloped the ill-fated bogey (car)," Suresh Singh, a railway employee, told  the Press Trust of India news agency.  </P> <P> Police said that, based on survivors' reports, investigators believe the  inferno was sparked by the explosion of a natural gas cylinder used for welding  torches that was brought aboard one of the cars. The shattered, blackened  cylinder was recovered from the charred remains of one of the cars.  </P> <P> The nozzle of the cylinder, apparently came off, releasing the pressurized  contents in a tremendous gush, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators speculated that the leaking gas was then ignited by a cigarette  and the cylinder exploded in an intense fireball. Flames were spread rapidly  back to the second coach by wind created by the forward movement of the train,  they said.  </P></p>

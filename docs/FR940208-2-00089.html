The Commission requested that the Exchanges report on, among other things, GTX executions on its trading floor to ensure that their specialists are not taking unfair advantage of information derived regarding which orders on their books are designated GTX and the priority among those orders. In addition, the Commission requested that the Exchanges submit a report to the Commission describing their experiences with the new rule during the pilot period. The Commission requested that the following information (broken down by month) be included in the reports: (1) Whether customers who have entered GTX orders experienced any problems when they attempted to cancel such orders; (2) whether the Exchange has experienced any difficulties in monitoring the activities of specialists with regard to determining their particular obligations to fill GTX orders; (3) the number, if any, of GTX orders executed after the close of the regular auction trading session pursuant to the new rule; (4) the number, if any, of GTX orders that remain unexecuted after the specialist has fulfilled his or her obligations in connection with the new rule; (5) the number and percentage of good until cancelled orders on the book that were designated ``GTX'' and thus eligible to be filled; (6) whether the marketplace has experienced any increased volatility during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading sessions after the initiation of the new rule; (7) whether there were greater (wider) quote spreads during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m.to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the new rule; and (8) whether the Exchange or any specialist has given any special guarantees to execute GTX orders over and above the requirements of the new rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies after early fall with drug stocks Wall Street SHARE PRICES recovered yesterday afternoon as investors turned their attention to cyclical stocks, following a morning sell-off in drug issues which depressed US equities for most of the day in a market that was already nervous following the flood of corporate results, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a net 9.84 up at 3,348.61 after having fallen more than 25 points at midsession. New York SE volume was a fairly heavy 237.9m shares. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was finally 1.79 ahead at 411.60 but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks shed 2.18 to 576.05. In addition to the pressure from the quarterly corporate results, the market was depressed by higher yields for longer-dated bonds. The yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond continued to climb above the 8 per cent mark in the morning following a report that initial jobless claims had fallen in a week when economists had expected an increase. In late trading, the long bond was quoted  3/16 down to yield 8.04 per cent after falling about  5/8 earlier in the day. Big board trading was dominated by pharmaceutical stocks. Johnson &amp; Johnson tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 90 7/8 , reflecting disappointment with its first-quarter results. The healthcare products company had a net income of Dollars 464m or Dollars 1.38 a share, compared with Dollars 418m or Dollars 1.25 a share a year ago. The 11 per cent improvement was weaker than expected. Sales increased by about 7 per cent to Dollars 3.36bn from the year earlier figure of Dollars 3.15bn. Shares in Merck also took a beating, although the company had no corporate developments or news to report. The issue lost almost Dollars 5 before recovering somewhat to close Dollars 2 5/8 lower at Dollars 139 3/4 . Among other actively traded pharmaceutical stocks, Glaxo Holdings declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 5/8 but Bristol-Myers Squibb ended Dollars  3/8 ahead at Dollars 73. Citicorp shares, which initially gained about 13 per cent after the bank posted strong first-quarter results on Tuesday, started to correct yesterday, with the issue slipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 19. Trading was also active in Chase Manhattan, which rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 27. A flood of results from technology companies fuelled active trading in the sector. Tandem Computers slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 following second-quarter earnings of 8 cents a share, against 17 cents. In the secondary market, Sun Microsystems rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 , reflecting the company's better than expected third-quarter income of 60 cents a share, compared with 56 cents a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks put on a steadier performance yesterday, helped by some recovery in bank, real estate and construction issues. Traders said that nervousness over the debt troubles of Olympia &amp; York had eased, after the company said it had arranged a loan of USDollars 20m. The composite index picked up 3.7 to close at 3,371.5, but declining issues outnumbered advances by 306 to 245. Trading volume amounted to 28.9m shares. Financial services had the day's best gain, up 1.1 per cent. The real estate and construction index recovered 0.6 per cent. BCE lost CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 44 3/8 . The company's BCE Telecom International unit said it agreed to acquire a controlling interest in East London Telecommunications, a British cable television company.</p>

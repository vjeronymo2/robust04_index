			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State </F> Council and foreign minister, with domestic and foreign  correspondents in the Great Hall of the People on 16 March]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman for  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC], held a news conference at the Great Hall of the People  this morning. Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and  concurrently foreign minister, was invited to answer questions  raised by Chinese and foreign correspondents on the portion of  Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" regarding the active  promotion of the motherland's peaceful reunification and China's  diplomatic work.    [XINHUA correspondent] Two days ago U.S. President Clinton  expressed disappointment at the outcome of U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher's visit to China. What are your views on  this? How do you assess the chances of the United States  extending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status?    [Qian] I am somewhat disappointed at Secretary of State  Christopher's visit because we were hoping to achieve more  results. The visit produced some agreements and results, but not  as many as had been anticipated. In addition, I am of the  opinion that if China's MFN status is maintained, it would be  good for both China and the United States; if it is revoked, it  would be bad for both countries.    [EUROPE TIMES correspondent] The French prime minister will  soon visit China. How do you view the prospects for Sino-French  relations?    [Qian] The Sino-French Joint Communique released on 12  January of this year proclaimed the normalization of Sino-French  relations, with the French Government promising not to approve  participation by French enterprises in arming Taiwan in the  future; its purpose is plain. Thereafter, I paid an official  visit to France, one of the purposes of my visit being to  prepare for Prime Minister Balladur's visit to China. I believe  Prime Minister Balladur's visit is a major event in Sino-French  relations and will have an important effect on promoting the  development of Sino-French relations, including economic  relations and trade. The visit will take place in early April.    [LIEN HO PAO correspondent] You raised the possibility a few  days ago during a meeting with the Taiwan delegation to the NPC  of signing a cross-Strait investment protection agreement. What  kind of an agreement will probably be signed?    [Qian] The "Law on Protecting Investments by Taiwan  Compatriots" formulated by the NPC Standing Committee is  beneficial to granting legal protection to Taiwan compatriots'  investments and to promoting cross-Strait economic cooperation;  it is more comprehensive and authoritative than relevant  regulations in the past. We cannot exclude the possibility of  nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait  signing investment protection agreements in the future.  However, conditions are not ripe yet. The most important  reason is that two-way exchanges have yet to be realized.    [Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited correspondent] The  U.S. secretary of state said both sides had narrowed their  differences following his meeting with you. Do you agree?  Also, when will you meet the British foreign secretary again on  the Hong Kong issue?    [Qian] I think the two sides may not necessarily have  narrowed their difference in their fundamental viewpoints on the  human rights issue. However, we did reach some concensus on the  concrete measures for dealing with this matter, and this can be  characterized as a narrowing of our difference.    As to whether the Chinese and British foreign ministers will  meet, I do not think it is possible now. Opportunities do exist  in the future, at least at a time when the UN General Assembly  meets.    [DPA correspondent] Why are you disappointed at the outcome  of Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China?    [Qian] Both sides held the meetings according to the  invitation I extended during our meeting in Paris on 24 January.  In mid-February, he wrote me a letter in which he indicated his  plans to visit China in mid-March. I concurred, hoping the  visit would produce an agreement that was conductive to further  developing the relations of the two countries. However, some  things happened prior to the secretary of state's visit to  China, and these disappointed us [hen shi wang 1771 1136 2598].  The occurrence of these things at least shows that the United  States is not sincere enough [cheng yi bu gou 6134 1942 0008  1124] about the visit.    [LIANHE ZAOBAO correspondent] In his "Government Work  Report," Premier Li Peng said China does not seek hegemony at  present and will not do so when it has become economically  developed in the future. China's national defense expenditure  will total 52.04 billion yuan this year. What percentage is  this of China's gross national product [GNP]?    China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan last  year, and the budget for 1994 is 52 billion yuan. On the  surface, the figure has somewhat increased; but in real terms,  the increase is to offset inflation. As is known to all,  inflation in 1993 hit 13 percent; and this year it is expected  to reach 10 percent. Hence, the military expenditure actually  has not gone up. In 1994, military expenditures account for 11  percent of the state budget, a proportion which has remained  largely unchanged; and military spending accounts for less than  1.7 percent of China's GNP, which actually represents a slight  drop. Converting the defense budget into U.S. dollars, there is  no change in the level of China's military spending. Compared  with the military spendings of other countries, China's military  spending is a pittance, and it is out of proportion with the  U.S. spending of more than $200 billion and the Japan's more  than $30 billion. Therefore, China's current defense budget  explains exactly that China is trying to concentrate its  financial resources on developing its national economy instead  of seeking to be a military power.    [ANSA] If the United States does not renew the  most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China, economic relations  between the two countries will deteriorate. Will this also lead  to a deterioration of their political relations?    [Qian] I think deterioration of economic relations will  surely affect deterioration of political relations, but efforts  being made by both sides are just to prevent this kind of  deterioration from occurring.    [CNA] The fourth round of consultations between the Strait  Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait will be held at the end of this month. How does  the mainland assess the demand of the people on Taiwan for the  Taiwan authorities to develop space?    [Qian] We stand for frequent consultations between  nongovernmental organizations from both sides of the Taiwan  Strait to reach agreements on relevant issues. Such contacts  will undoubtedly help improve cross-strait relations. However,  there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of  China. This is the consensus of both sides of the strait, as  well as a fact recognized by the international community.  Therefore, if the move to "develop space" aims to develop  economic relations, we can understand. But, if it aims to  create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," that will harm  the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and it will be  detrimental to the cause of the motherland's reunification. At  present, the Taiwan authorities are asserting that their  "holiday-making diplomacy" is aimed at developing economic  relations. This is somewhat like "no 300 taels of silver  curried here" [the sign put up by the man in a folk tale over  the place where he had hidden some money meaning obscuring the  obvious]. There are political intentions in the "holiday-making  diplomacy." We understand the wish of some countries to seek to  develop economic relations with Taiwan. But the Taiwan  authorities want to take advantage of such economic relations to  develop the so- called "diplomatic space" in an attempt to  create "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." This is a move  that is not in keeping with the trend of the times and goes  against the aspirations of people on both sides of the Taiwan  Strait.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  will soon visit China. What are China's expectations of his  visit?    [Qian] China and Japan are close neighbors and the leaders  of the two countries often exchange visits. Chinese Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan was a great success.  Now Chinese leaders are looking forward to Prime Minister  Hosokawa's visit. I believe the visit will play an important  role in further developing Sino-Japanese relations and  cooperation in economic fields. During the visit, China and  Japan will sign an agreement on strengthening cooperation in  environmental protection.    [AP] You have just mentioned that efforts are being made  between China and the United States to avoid deterioration of  relations. What efforts will China make to this end? Will the  Chinese foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state meet  again?    [Qian] The two sides did not discuss whether to meet again.  But both sides agreed to maintain contacts. What China or the  United States intends to do will be decided by the country  itself. We have no intention to interfere with internal affairs  of the United States, and it should also not interfere with  China's internal affairs.    [CHINA DAILY] Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei made a  trip to South Africa not long ago. What are the prospects of  diplomatic relations between China and South Africa?    [Qian] China and South Africa have had some contacts. They  have nongovernmental organizations stationed in each other's  country. South Africa is preparing for an election in April,  which is to elect a new democratic government that abandons the  policy of apartheid. Establishment of diplomatic relations  between the two countries is not possible before that. The  formal diplomatic links between China and South Africa will  certainly be put on the agenda after the general election in  South Africa.    [SING PAO DAILY NEWS] The prime ministers and foreign  ministers of both China and Britain have agreed that the work of  the Joint Liaison Group [JLP] should be sped up. However, the  JLP has only made slow progress in its work. What are your  views of the JLP's work in the future? Will the JLP's work have  an impact on Hong Kong's stability and prosperity?    [Qian] Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong  1994-95 elections have broken down, but this does not mean work  of the JLP will suspend. The JLP should continue its work and  negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing, too.  In my view, both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a breakdown in  Sino-British talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 Hong Kong  elections, China still cares about Hong Kong's economy and the  livelihood of its people and will try its best to cooperate with  the British side. Whether or not cooperation can proceed  smoothly depends on both the attitude and action of the British  side.    [REUTERS] What are your comments on the current situation in  regard to the inspection of nuclear facilities in the DPRK?    [Qian] China hopes that the situation on the Korean  peninsula will move towards relaxation and stability and also  hopes the peninsula be nuclear free. This conforms to China's  interests as well as to the regional and world interests. China  supports the DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States,  the south, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the  past, the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved some  progress too. The situation can be perfectly described by this  verse: "When the mountains and streams come to an end and one  would think there is no path, the shady willows and bright  blossoms bring him to yet another village." Now some  difficulties have cropped up again. We believe that as long as  all sides are patient in negotiations and do not adopt measures  to complicate the situation, the negotiations will achieve  important progress.    [China Central Television] Someone said that whether the  United States renews China's MFN trade status is not just a  matter between China and the United States. It will have a  worldwide impact. Do you agree?    [Qian] MFN trade status is a reciprocal and mutually  beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and  it is the base for normal trade for the two countries. The  United States has given the MFN trade status to many other  countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the  U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade  between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on. If it  should happen, China and the U.S. would be the first to suffer  losses, and other countries and regions will also suffer.  Therefore, I hope that this will not happen.    [SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST] Which conditions in President  Clinton's executive order are acceptable to China, which are not?    [Qian] China does not have the obligation to carry out the  U.S. President's executive orders. Some of the "conditions"  mentioned in the "executive order" do not constitute a problem.  Take the export of prison labor products for example. Even the  United States acknowledges that its prison labor products are  exported to some countries. However, the United States does not  want prison labor products from other countries to enter the  United States. This can be solved easily. China has a big  market and it is entirely possible for China not to export its  prison labor products to the United States. Moreover, an  agreement on this issue was signed and a statement on  cooperation in implementing it has just been signed. We can say  that this question has been settled. For another example, the  "Jackson-Vanik" Amendment requires the United States to remove  the MFN trade status of any country that does not have  immigration freedom. This is not a problem as far as the  Chinese are concerned. The obstacle now is that the United  States often denies Chinese citizens visas on the ground of  "intent to immigrate." This and similar matters may be regarded  as conditions and maybe not. If you want to make a mountain out  of a molehill, then they become conditions. If approached with  a realistic attitude, they would not constitute a problem. We  do not want to see issues played up or played down for political  needs. So long as the two sides adopt a realistic attitude,  these issues can be solved without much difficulty.    Over 500 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the news  conference.</p>

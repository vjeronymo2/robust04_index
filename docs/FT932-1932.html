			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Europeans provide 3m US jobs EUROPEAN affiliates in the US provide jobs for 2.9m Americans, more than the subsidiaries of all other nations combined, according to a recent report by the Washington-based European-American Chamber of Commerce. The affiliates account for 7 per cent of all US manufacturing jobs, and pay higher wages on average than US companies. A boom in employment by Europe's American affiliates in the 1980s drew little attention compared with the alarm raised by Japanese takeovers and investment. By the end of the decade, European-owned companies employed more than 10 per cent of the labour force in New Jersey, West Virginia, South Carolina and Maryland. At the same time, employment by European subsidiaries has surged in California, Texas, Indiana and Florida. Despite the benefits of European investment, the three-year-old European-American Chamber and other business groups are kept busy countering discriminatory measures in Congress, where anti-foreigner sentiment has been subdued but not eradicated with the fallin Japanese investment. 'There is still concern that the US is not in control of its own economic destiny,' said Mr Willard Berry, president of the Chamber. 'But those who propose policies that upset the European-American relationship may find that they are biting the hand that feeds their fellow Americans.' Many European affiliates have been in the US so long that their American customers are barely aware of their overseas ownership. However, Congress has repeatedly demonstrated its reluctance to share with foreign offspring the benefits it grants to American companies. Nor is it above employing the benefits as leverage to force foreign markets open. The National Co-operative Production Act of 1993, passed this month, relaxes antitrust treatment for companies doing joint production ventures. American subsidiaries of foreign companies are eligible for this benefit only if the principal facilities of the production joint ventures are in the US. The act also makes national treatment conditional on similar opportunities being made available in the country of the parent company. Foreign business lobbyists worry that the act has set a dangerous precedent. They are particularly concerned that their companies will lose out in the Clinton administration's much touted business-private sector relationship and the millions of dollars of government aid to be poured into industry consortia for research and development.</p>

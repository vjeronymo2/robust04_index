			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A Soviet pianist whose father competed against Van Cliburn 31 years ago is  among six finalists chosen in the Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano  Competition that wraps up in Ft. Worth, Tex., this weekend. Alexander  Shtarkman's father, Naum, finished third behind the victorious Cliburn in the  1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, a contest that rocketed  Cliburn to fame. Two other Soviet musicians are also finalists, Elisso Bokvadze  and Aleksei Sultanov. Other finalists out of a field of 38 that began competing  May 27 are Jose Carlos Cocarelli of Brazil, Benedetto Lupo of Italy and Ying  Tian of China. The next step is for each to perform two piano concertos with  the Ft. Worth Symphony Orchestra before the medalist is chosen Sunday. Kevin  Kenner, 26, of Coronado, Calif., was the only U.S. semifinalist. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION: CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO GETS ITS LONG-AWAITED NCAA BERTH  </P> <P> After completing its regular-season schedule with a 25-12 record last week, Cal  State San Bernardino's baseball team seemed a shoo-in to receive its first NCAA  Division III playoff berth.  </P> <P> But Coach Chuck Deagle wasn't about to take anything for granted.  </P> <P> At least, not until he received official word from the NCAA on Sunday that the  Coyotes will be facing Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference  champion Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in the Division III regional starting Friday in  Claremont.  </P> <P> The coach still has bad memories from the previous two seasons, when San  Bernardino was listed among the top 10 in the NCAA rankings, only to be passed  up for a playoff berth. San Bernardino was ranked No. 5 in 1988 and No. 6 last  season.  </P> <P> "We had two real disappointing years in a row," Deagle said. "The year before  we were 29-7 and last year we were 28-8 and there were always reasons given why  we didn't make it. You know, like we're an independent or that they don't think  we play a tough schedule."  </P> <P> The biggest surprise was last year's, since the Coyotes were recommended for  the playoffs by the Division III regional committee.  </P> <P> "We were 28-8 last year and, boy, it was a shock when we didn't make it," he  said. "We just couldn't believe it. We were even picked by the regional  committee but the NCAA still didn't pick us."  </P> <P> Deagle, in his fourth season as coach of the Coyotes after four seasons at the  University of Redlands, said he was particularly concerned for the seniors on  the team.  </P> <P> "The thing that bothered me was that I've been through the ups and downs of  life but for a lot of those seniors that was it," he said. "I knew I'd always  be back the next year but they wouldn't be."  </P> <P> This season, San Bernardino took the matter into its own hands, although the  season didn't start well.  </P> <P> The Coyotes won only three of their first 10 games and suffered a 17-3 loss to  Cal Baptist in February. It didn't help that the team had 12 newcomers and only  one returning starter, first baseman Paul Gonzalez.  </P> <P> "As a coaching staff, we were very concerned," Deagle said. "We felt we were  better than that. It was almost like we didn't know how to win."  </P> <P> The team then swept a doubleheader from Menlo on March 10 in Menlo Park. The  Coyotes returned home and won their own tournament in late March.  </P> <P> "I think the turning point was when we had our tournament here and we had some  Division III teams and Southern California College here and that's when we  really felt like we could beat these guys," he said.  </P> <P> San Bernardino has won 22 of its 27 games since March 10, but the team may have  clinched a playoff berth with its play in the final weeks of the season. That's  when the Coyotes swept a doubleheader from UC San Diego and took a single game  from Claremont -- perhaps its two biggest challengers for a playoff berth.  </P> <P> That is the biggest reason, Deagle said, that the Coyotes have reached the  playoffs, even though they finished with better records the last two seasons.  </P> <P> "What really helped us this year is we won at the right time," he said. "It was  a five-way race (for the playoffs) down the stretch and it just so happened  that we won all of our games. Last year we lost a couple here and there and  that had to hurt."  </P> <P> The Coyotes have been led by the pitching of Rene Aguilar, a transfer from San  Bernardino Valley College, who is 4-1 with a 2.40 earned-run average, and  Brooks Peters, who is 6-1 with 54 strikeouts and only six walks. The offensive  leaders are Gonzalez, batting .370, and second baseman Ryan Love at .363.  </P> <P> They will face a Claremont squad that finished with a 21-16 record and won the  Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title. It will be the  fifth regional trip for Claremont and the first for San Bernardino, which has a  100-42-2 record in the first four years of its program.  </P> <P> The winner of the best-of-five, double-elimination series advances to the  Division III World Series May 25 in Battle Creek, Mich.  </P> <P> San Bernardino has defeated Claremont twice this season, 6-1 Feb. 9 and 8-6 in  10 innings May 1. That should make the Coyotes the favorites this time.  </P> <P> But considering the team's disappointment in the past, Deagle said the Coyotes  are not taking anything for granted.  </P> <P> Cal State San Bernardino and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps are not the only College  Division teams from the Southland competing in postseason play.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside have advanced to the NCAA Division II  regionals, and Cal Lutheran has gained the National Assn. of Intercollegiate  Athletics area playoffs.  </P> <P> California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rivals Northridge and Riverside, who tied  for the conference title, will compete in the three-team Division II West  Regional that starts Friday at Northridge.  </P> <P> The double-elimination tournament opens with Riverside (37-16) playing UC Davis  (28-23) at 11 a.m. and the loser meeting top-seeded Northridge (34-20) at 2  p.m. The regional runs through Sunday, if necessary.  </P> <P> Northridge, making its first playoff appearance since 1987, has been led by  pitcher Craig Clayton and first baseman Scott Sharts. Clayton has a 12-5 record  and is batting .387, and Sharts had a conference-leading 24 home runs and 62  runs batted in.  </P> <P> Riverside, which is making its first playoff appearance since it won the  Division II World Series in 1982, has been led on offense by outfielder Pete  Weber and shortstop Mark Saugstad. The team's top pitchers are Bill Jordan and  Bob McElderry, each at 7-2.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran may be the biggest surprise among the Southland teams in the  playoffs. The Kingsmen had to sweep a doubleheader from Azusa Pacific, the  regular-season District 3 champion, last Saturday to earn a berth in the area  playoffs.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen (32-14) face District 29 champion Hawaii-Pacific (23-19) in their  opening game Thursday at the University of Portland. The other teams in the  double-elimination tournament are Whitworth of Washington and Lewis and Clark  of Oregon.  </P> <P> There will be a distinct CCAA flavor when the NCAA Division II women's softball  tournament is held Friday through Sunday at Saginaw Valley State University in  Midland, Mich.  </P> <P> Two of the four teams in the double-elimination event are Cal State Northridge  and Cal State Bakersfield, which has won the Division II title the last two  years. The other two entries are Bloomsburg State of Pennsylvania and Missouri  Southern.  </P> <P> Northridge is ranked No. 1 in Division II, Bloomsburg No. 2 and Bakersfield No.  3. First-round pairings have yet to be announced.  </P> <P> Northridge (49-19) won the CCAA title, with Bakersfield (40-10) finishing  second.  </P> <P> But Bakersfield has been difficult to beat in postseason play the last three  seasons with a 16-2 record.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Three players from Cal State San Bernardino have been selected to the NCAA  Division III All-West Region softball team. Senior outfielder Anne Cordaro made  the first team and senior second baseman Tammy Shearer and sophomore pitcher  Tanna Cash were named to the second team. Cordaro, a Division III All-American  in 1988, led the Coyotes with a .500 batting average, four home runs and 37  runs batted in, posting a career average of .477.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge has placed three players on the NCAA Division II All-West  Region softball team selected by the National Softball Coaches Assn. The  players are senior pitcher Debbie Dickmann, sophomore catcher Patti Pearson and  senior outfielder Lisa Erickson. Dickmann was previously named CCAA most  valuable pitcher and Erickson was the conference's co-most valuable player.  </P> <P> Senior Edna Olivarez of Cal State Los Angeles capped a brilliant college career  by winning the singles title last week and combining with teammate Jennifer  Choi to take the doubles title at the NCAA Division II women's tennis  championships in Sacramento. Olivarez defeated Julie Slattery of Cal Poly  Pomona in the singles final, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, and teamed with Choi to defeat  Christy Murphy and Vicki Kanter of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in doubles, 7-5,  7-5.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona posted its highest finish in NCAA Division II women's tennis by  placing second to UC Davis in the championship match last week. The top-seeded  Broncos (24-2) suffered a 5-3 loss in the final, which snapped a 20-match  winning streak. San Luis Obispo finished third with a 5-2 win over Abilene  Christian of Texas.  </P></p>

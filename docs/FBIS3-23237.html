			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eli Bohadna] </F>   [Text] "Special squads roam the area, and each squad acts  independently," 21-year-old Ahmad 'Abdallah (an alias),  commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Jewish squad, disclosed  this week. "Since we look Jewish, our squad has one single  objective -- to kidnap soldiers and civilians, and we have been  training for that."    The interview with squad members was held after numerous  coordination attempts and under prearranged conditions. The  place: a safe house in Gaza. The squad members: Muhammad  Hasan, 22; 'Ali Salim, 24; and Ahmad 'Abdallah, 21. All the  names are aliases. Ahmad 'Abdallah is the spokesman, and the  other two squad members listen attentively without saying a  word. Ahmad looks Israeli in every way. The three squad  members are not fugitives, and are therefore free to operate  inside Israel.    Ahmad 'Abdallah is a product of the intifadah. Like many of  his fellow Palestinians, he joined Fatah in the course of the  intifadah. He says: "Even then, as a boy, I was very conscious  of the need to liberate Palestine from occupation at any price."  Like most of his friends, he was arrested in 1992, tried, and  incarcerated for six months in Qezi'ot under administrative  orders.    The reversal in his life occurred in prison. One day his  Fatah commander, who was also in prison, asked him to tell his  Israeli interrogators that it was he who had recruited 'Abdallah  to Fatah. 'Abdallah, an intelligent young man, understood right  away what lay behind the odd request. During the intifadah,  "recruiters" received funds from PLO headquarters for every new  recruit to the organization. The money was intended for  operational uses only, but 'Abdallah's commander sought to  increase his list of recruited activists in a bid to make  personal gains.    "Did I throw stones and Molotov cocktails for money?"  'Abdallah asked him. "You are a traitor and you are greedy. I  was a fool to trust you and to believe you were a good man. I  made a mistake." There was a confidence crisis between them, and  Ahmad 'Abdallah quit Fatah and approached the Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] commanders in prison with a request to join  their organization. "They told me: 'Finish your prison term,  and then we will decide.'"    In December 1992, 'Abdallah was released from prison. "About  a month later, three people approached me. They told me they  were from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, that they had been following me  during that month, and that they liked me. They said I met  their demands and asked me to become religious and to undergo  some arduous training. At first, I was given simple tasks. At  their request, I painted slogans on walls, but my aim was to be  admitted into the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's operational  activities. I did all they asked me. I wanted to realize my  dream of becoming a fallen soldier."    "In April 1993, they decided to recruit me into the  organization's military system. Three people came to me and got  me into a car. I was very glad. Afterward we would go out to  practice in orchards. The training was hard. We did physical  fitness training, learned how to use weapons, and they taught me  hand-to-hand combat. I was happy. I felt I was doing something  for my people. I wanted to excel. I would drive near Army  outposts, following Israeli Army vehicle movements. We would  see a soldier waiting for a lift and plan how to kidnap him."    Question: Why did you want to join the Hamas?    'Abdallah: The Hamas Islamic movement and the  'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squad are the right party. I heard about  their activities, and I strove to be admitted into their ranks.  Their work has quality. They are people of principle. In  1989, three organization members -- Muhammad Nasir, Mahmud  Mamduh, and their commander Muhammad Shurayha -- kidnapped  soldier Ilan Sa'adon. After that operation, the Israeli Army  managed to capture the squad commander, Muhammad Shurayha. The  other two squad members managed to flee Israel. The kidnapping  of Ilan Sa'adon and Avi Sasportas totally confused the Shin Bet.  They were unable to discover the whereabouts of Ilan Sa'adon's  body. They were likewise unable to dig up any details from the  squad commander, although four years had elapsed since the  soldier's kidnapping.    Question: Do you know where Ilan Sa'adon's  remains are?    'Abdallah: There are rumors among 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam members that the two squad members who managed to  escape, took the body with them, and it is in either Lebanon or  Syria.    Question: What do you mean, rumors?    'Abdallah: That is what people in 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam are saying.    Question: Does it sound plausible to you that  they should tote Sa'adon's body along outside Israel?    'Abdallah: I told you, that is what organization  members have been saying. I can say nothing beyond that.    Question: How are contacts between the squads and  the commander established?    'Abdallah: There are three to four members in  every squad. There are dozens of such squads. Contacts between  them are established by squad commanders only. Squad members do  not know about the existence of other squads or about the people  who control any particular squad. Thus, if any one of the squad  members is arrested, he will be unable to disclose any names  except those of his fellow squad members.    Question: And how is the contact with the  commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad, 'Abd-al-Fattah  Sattari, established?    (Reporter's note: 'Abd-al-Fattah Sattari, alias the  Engineer, was unofficially appointed commander of the  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad after organization commander 'Imad  'Aqil was liquidated by the security forces in the course on an  operation in the al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood on 25 December 1993.)    'Abdallah: Fattah al-Sattari is not the  commander. He is an important figure in the organization, but  we have another commander.    Question: Who?    'Abdallah, evasively: I don't think I know that.    Question: What is the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  squad's ultimate goal?    'Abdallah: The squad members have a deep sense of  the need to liberate the occupied lands of Palestine. The enemy  security forces tried every way to prevent us from carrying out  attacks and to stop our activities. But they failed. We aim to  liberate the land of Palestine from the Israeli occupation, to  cleanse the holy land from Jewish filth. We are doing it for  the sake of the Palestinian people and so that we may all go to  heaven in the next world.    After Nasir Namrutti, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad  commander, was killed while being pursued by enemy soldiers near  Rafah, a unit named after him was established. Members of the  squad decided to avenge his death by carrying out a shakedown  attack: kidnapping a soldier, hiding him, and demanding the  release of Palestinian prisoners, most notably the release of  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin.    Members of the squad dressed up to look Jewish. They had  all the resources for that. They spoke Hebrew as well as any  Israeli, and they found a Peugeot 305 with yellow license  plates. The squad had an excellent driver. He was bearded, and  with a yarmulke on his head, he looked like a typical settler.  No one would suspect him of being Muslim. Another squad member  had fair hair. He was tall. A third member had a moustache and  short hair. They set out early in the morning of 18 September  1992. They drove around, looking for a Jewish soldier.    They reached the Morag settlement, but could not find a  single soldier. Neither did they find a victim in the moshavim  of Gan Or, Neve Deqalim, or Ganey Tal. In Moshav Netzer Hazani,  they saw two soldiers at the gate, but they did not stop. They  were looking for another victim. Near one of the moshavim,  their car almost crashed into a local car. One of one fighters  put his head out of the window and started cursing the Arab  driver in Hebrew, because soldiers and settlers were standing at  the gate of the moshav, and he wanted them to think our fighters  were Jewish. Then they proceeded toward Gaza.    Near al-Nusayrat they saw soldier Alon Qarawani standing all  alone. They stopped, and Qarawani asked whether they were going  to Ashqelon. They said they were only driving as far as the  Erez checkpoint. The soldier agreed and got in the car. As  they were driving, one of our fighters took out a gun and asked  the soldier: "Do you know us?" He said he did not. The squad  members told him they belonged to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the  sons of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin.    The soldier started crying. They tried to calm him, they  said he should not worry. "We only want your weapon," they told  him. The soldier told them: "Take it, I don't need it. I have  parents and a family, don't kill me." The fighters told him:  "We too have mothers and fathers and friends, and you are  killing them." The soldier answered he was not on combat duty,  that he only repaired Army cars.    Further down the road, our fighters drove into an orchard  and  ordered him to take off his clothes and keep on only his shorts.  Then they stabbed him with knives. They thought he was dead,  and they tied him to a tree. They took his identity card and  all his equipment and left the place. Palestinians who saw the  soldier summoned the troops, and later we learned that he had  not died, but was only badly wounded.    Question: Did you participate in that operation?    'Abdallah: No.    Question: Then how come you know so many details  of the event?    'Abdallah: I did not participate in that  operation.    Question: How do you enter Israel?    'Abdallah: We dress up like Jews. No one stops  us. We enter with a car with yellow license plates and drive  through roadblocks without being stopped. Sometimes we even  enter as Arabs. We are not fugitives.    Question: What do you think of the Fatah Hawks  organization?    'Abdallah: Fatah is divided into two parts --  those who support the peace process and those who oppose it. We  respect them and we hope they will continue their military  operations against the Zionist enemy. At this stage, we all  have to take up arms and act together to release our lands. The  Palestinian people does not have to obey 'Arafat's orders. The  only way for us is to win the war, and God will decide who will  live in this land.    Question: Are you associated with the Fatah Hawks  in any way?    'Abdallah: There is cooperation between us, but  only with activists who oppose the peace process and would like  to take up arms against Israelis. We help and encourage them.  But the link is not strong. We show them respect.    Question: Will you try to assassinate 'Arafat if  there is peace?    'Abdallah: I do not think 'Arafat will ever get  to come here. There will be no peace and no autonomy. And if  there is autonomy, God forbid, I think the Palestinian people  will judge 'Arafat by his deeds and start a revolution. If we  kill 'Arafat, we will lose our people's love.    Question: How many activists are there in the  'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squads?    'Abdallah: The number is unknown. Some of our  members are also active in Fatah. Everybody knows they to  belong to Fatah, but in fact they operate under cover, and they  belong to 'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam. Also, there are some who do  not pray and look secular, to prevent people from knowing what  organization they belong to.</p>

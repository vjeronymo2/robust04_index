			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN PARTY CAUCUS TO PICK NEW LEADER;  </P> <P> RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SEEKING APPLICANTS TO SUCCEED UNO  </P> <P> The ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Monday decided to receive applications  from candidates for the party presidency on Saturday and then hold a caucus  Aug. 8 to choose a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Sosuke Uno.  </P> <P> The decision by the Liberal Democrats' presidential election management  committee marks the first time since former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  was chosen in 1982 that the party has committed itself to pick a new leader in  an open election, rather than through back-room machinations. It is expected to  be formalized today by the party's executive board.  </P> <P> It came as Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had been touted as a potential "youth  candidate" to lead the beleaguered party into a crucial lower-house election,  declared himself out of the running after being informed that the party's  biggest faction has decided to refrain from fielding any of its members,  including Hashimoto, as candidates to succeed Uno.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking Responsibility  </P> <P> Ichiro Ozawa, the faction's secretary, said faction leaders had decided to stay  out of the presidential race by way of assuming responsibility for the Liberal  Democrats' defeat in an upper-house election July 23.  </P> <P> Ozawa said former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who heads the faction,  shares the blame with Uno, his surprise successor, for the upper-house debacle.  Takeshita resigned in May after the yearlong Recruit influence-buying scandal.  </P> <P> Already reeling from a voter rebellion over the scandal and a broken promise by  the ruling party not to impose a consumption tax, Liberal Democrat fortunes  encountered new problems when a weekly magazine revealed three days after Uno  took office that the new prime minister had purchased sexual favors from a  geisha in 1985.  </P> <P> In the election last month, the Liberal Democrats lost nearly a fourth of their  holdings in the House of Councillors, falling 17 seats short of a majority.  </P> <P> The defeat marked the first time in the party's 34-year history that it had  lost control of either house of Parliament and raised the specter of a  thrashing in an election for the lower house, which elects the prime minister.  That ballot must be held by next July but is expected much sooner.  </P> <P> Political analysts said the real reason behind the Takeshita faction's move  Monday was a fear that the faction might split up. In addition to Hashimoto,  the party's 52-year-old secretary general, two other Takeshita followers had  been mentioned as possible successors to Uno.  </P> <P> Takeshita lieutenants gave no indication of whom they might back. Speculation  swung toward either Toshio Komoto, 78, the leader of the party's smallest  faction, or Toshiki Kaifu, 58, a Komoto lieutenant who has served twice as  education minister.  </P> <P> No one has yet declared his candidacy, however, and a host of names are still  being bandied about.  </P> <P> The party's presidential election commission said applications will be accepted  for one hour Saturday morning from candidates who receive the endorsement of at  least 20 of the party's members of both houses of Parliament.  </P> <P> Candidates would then be asked to present their policies both in a Saturday  afternoon news conference and in a speech before a caucus is convened next  Tuesday to elect one of them.  </P> <P> If only one candidate files for the contest, that leader will become the party  president and the next prime minister -- Japan's third in three months -- by  virtue of the Liberal Democrats' control of the lower house.  </P> <P> Uno's Cabinet officially decided today to convene a six-day special session of  Parliament next Monday to elect both officials of the upper house and conduct a  ballot for the new prime minister. Although both houses cast ballots for the  prime minister, the decision by the lower house is final.  </P></p>

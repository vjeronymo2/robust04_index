			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Upper House [UH] on  Thursday [23 June] approved revisions of a law on foreign  lawyers which will ease restrictions on their operations in  Japan, allowing them to participate in law firms jointly run  with Japanese lawyers.    The law will come into force within a year.    Under the revisions, the employment of Japanese lawyers by  foreign lawyers is still not permitted, but Japanese and foreign  lawyers will be permitted, under certain conditions, to set up  joint practices.    The revisions also ease the strict reciprocity which  prevailed till now, allowing the Justice Ministry to use its  discretion in accrediting foreign lawyers.    The revisions ease the number of years of experience  required  to gain accreditation, and allow foreign law firms to operate  under their own names in Japan.    The United States and the European Union have criticized  restrictions Japan places on the activities of foreign lawyers  as against the principle of free competition.</p>

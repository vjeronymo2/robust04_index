			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: A less than stabilising exercise - Global Investor In the second half of the 1980s, Japanese investors, encouraged by government officials, played a remarkable stabilising role in the US currency and capital markets. Their reward was a domestic equity market bubble and a crash that rivalled Wall Street's in 1929. Small wonder that they have been reluctant to repeat the trick in this year's troubled markets. Yet with the dollar perking up and the US bond market looking uncharacteristically cheerful, speculation is mounting that Japanese private capital outflows are accelerating. Are dollar assets coming back into fashion? And will UK gilts enjoy some of the leftovers? The case now being made by many analysts is straightforward enough. With the three-month interest rate differential between New York and Tokyo at around four percentage points, there is a powerful incentive to recycle Japanese capital. Historically, the dollar has always risen when interest rate spreads have been at this level. Once short-term private flows underpin the dollar, portfolio capital might be expected to follow into US assets. Up to a point this has already happened. In the first half of this year Japanese purchases of foreign bonds, in which the US usually accounts for a disproportionate share, were running at an annualised rate of Dollars 46.5bn, usefully higher than in 1992 and 1993. Yet in practice the issues are more complicated than these arguments imply, because of profound structural upheavals taking place in the capital markets of both the US and Japan. If the case for an accelerating outflow from Japan currently looks plausible, it relates as much to the behaviour of US investors as the Japanese. In the first half of the year American fund managers led the foreign stampede into Japanese equities. The inflow, at an annualised rate of Dollars 95bn, dwarfed long-term Japanese portfolio outflows. This reflected US investors' new-found enthusiasm for international diversification. The Tokyo market, which accounts for a big chunk of the global equity market capitalisation, did not share in the upturn experienced elsewhere in 1993. Fund managers were underweight in Tokyo and worried that a rise there would cause them to underperform badly. They promptly became bigger buyers of Japanese equities than the Japanese. Much of this flow seems likely to reverse, because the foreign investors have allowed themselves to be suckered. For the structure of the Tokyo market is perfectly designed to make a nonsense of the theory of portfolio diversification - not least because the market is currently being used, in true Japanese style, as an instrument of government policy. Confronted with a banking crisis similar to the one in the US, the Japanese authorities felt constrained by their experience of the bubble economy from following the Federal Reserve's approach to restoring bank profits and capital. Instead of reducing interest rates and encouraging the banks to invest low-yielding deposits in higher-yielding government bonds, they rigged the equity market in what is jocularly known in Tokyo as the Price Keeping Operation. This encouraged overstretched financial institutions to sell low-yielding equities to invest in higher yielding bonds. The logic of this operation, perceptively analysed in a recent circular by Andrew Smithers*, rests on the banking and insurance systems' excessive exposure to an equity market overvalued on fundamental grounds. The banks hold equity investments whose value is greater than their own capital. By selling shares to invest in less risky, higher-yielding assets, they can usefully reduce exposure to an inflated stock market as they struggle to overcome their bad debts in property. So, too, with the Japanese life companies, which are insolvent in the sense that they have promised policyholders a higher return than than they are able to earn currently on their investments. They are thus diversifying out of equities that yield less than 1 per cent into bonds that yield more than 4.5 per cent. Like the banks, they are able to do so largely thanks to the buying activity of the state-run postal savings and insurance institutions and the state pension funds, which have allocated an annual Dollars 57bn for the task. By a happy accident, foreigners started buying in bulk late last year, just when these funds were running low. The result is that the market is largely independent of the economy; and any attempt at a significant equity rally always runs into heavy selling. To buy Tokyo on the expectation of economic recovery is thus pointless. It is doubly pointless, as Andrew Smithers argues, if people allocate foreign assets on the basis of the standard global market indices, which do not allow for the overweighting of Japan that arises from the high incidence of cross-shareholdings. As foreigners realise they are stabilising Japanese markets for no satisfactory return, they are bound to repatriate funds - just as the Japanese did after their experience stabilising US markets. They are almost certainly doing so already. For their part, the biggest Japanese institutional investors, the life companies, face new regulatory constraints in the aftermath of the bubble. Both equities and foreign bond holdings now carry a capital penalty relative to domestic bonds. This reduces the attraction of the healthy yield premium on US Treasuries and UK gilts in a more stable currency environment, which might otherwise be helpful in addressing the insurance companies' mismatch of assets and liabilities. In effect, the penalty on foreign holdings gives life companies a powerful incentive towards short-term trading rather than long-term investing. It follows that Japanese capital outflows may prove less stabilising than many hope. *Japanese Equities: Will The Rigging Have to Stop? - Andrew Smithers, Smithers &amp; Co.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 8/12/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              % change over period                  US     Japan     Germany     France     Italy     UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week            0.11     0.04      0.10        0.10       0.16     0.10 Month           0.44     0.19      0.42        0.45       0.70     0.49 Year            3.75     1.81      5.25        5.73       8.63     5.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week            0.11     0.14     -0.31       -0.22       0.16    -0.10 Month          -0.04     1.01      0.61        1.15       1.20     1.04 Year           -3.00    -1.42      0.21       -0.35       2.39    -1.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week            0.70     0.09     -0.04        0.27       0.08    -0.27 Month           1.30     1.28      1.85        3.05       1.59     1.75 Year           -6.41    -3.87     -3.47       -5.71      -4.30    -5.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week            -0.7      0.2      -0.3        -0.5       -3.4     -0.8 Month           -3.9     -1.5      -0.6         1.5       -1.9     -1.4 Year            -1.2      9.4      -5.9        -7.3        8.1     -3.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "With the Events" feature] </F>   [Text] The Israeli-Palestinian talks within the context of  the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees continued in Cairo  today. To learn the latest developments in this regard, let us  move to our correspondent 'Umar Zaydani [in Cairo]:    [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The security talks held between  Israel and the PLO today primarily addressed the issue of  security, prisoners, and the repatriation of deportees.  Muhammad Dahlan [the PLO delegate in charge of the prisoners'  issue] informed us that the Palestinians are demanding the  release of 8,300 prisoners. Last week, it was agreed that only  5,000 prisoners would be released. The talks have continued  regardless of the statements being made by either Hamas or the  Israelis, Dahlan noted.    Reports have revealed a willingness on the part of Hamas to  halt violence in return for a halt to the pursuit of Hamas  personnel by the Israeli security authorities.    [Dahlan] I am not interested in what Hamas or the Israelis  are saying. We are negotiating the release of all prisoners.    [Zaydani] [Words indistinct]    [Dahlan] No, there are no [words indistinct] or (?bargains)  over the prisoners currently under way. The number of the  prisoners whose release we demand stands at 8,300.    [Zaydani] Muhammad Dahlan also informed us that six  deportees  will be repatriated tomorrow, and 10 others will be repatriated  on 21 April. Among the deportees who will return from Libya and  Algeria are Salih Abu-Sa'id and Nasim al-Farrah.    Moreover, the Legal Committee resumed its meetings today.  Progress was made in the deliberations of this committee. The  Israelis submitted a working paper, whereas the Palestinians  submitted another working paper during the deliberations of this  committee. The two papers are currently being addressed, as  Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  Legal Committee, said:    [Al-Qidrah] We cannot speak of differences right now. The  Palestinian and Israeli working papers are being debated and  negotiated. God willing, there is progress. I do not want to  delve into details. But, indeed, there is progress.    [Zaydani] With regard to the negotiations on the launching  of  a Palestinian radio and television station, these negotiations  were interrupted for some time soon after they had been started.  This was because the Palestinian side backed down on an initial  agreement reached in this regard in Cairo in February.    Radwan Abu-'Ayyash [Palestinian negotiator in radio and  television affairs] left the negotiations for consultations with  Nabil Sha'th. As for (Shlomo Vax), he informed (Gabi Johar) of  the differences with the Palestinians. These differences  concern the extent and scope of the frequencies to be used by  the Palestinians. They also concern the range of these  frequencies. Unless the Palestinian back down on these demands,  the Palestinians will not have a Palestinian radio and  television station. A source close to the Israeli delegation  informed us that Israel is willing to meet the Palestinian  demands regarding all that concerns the radio and television  station. The Israelis are also willing to meet demands  regarding frequencies for civilian communication equipment and  police communications equipment. However, the Palestinians also  want frequencies for airports and ports, something not enshrined  in the agreement. [end recording]</p>

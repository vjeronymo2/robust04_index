[Lukic] It is truly difficult to be a great optimist after  the news from Geneva. However, I am nevertheless convinced that  the forces in the world, and also on the Muslim side, who want  peace will strive to put an end to this unfortunate war on these  territories. I am deeply convinced that [Bosnia-Herzegovina  President] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic will also realize that he is  truly a great loser in this war and that he will be an even  greater loser if he continues with it.    [Vojvodic] You have recently stated that the purpose of the  defense of the Srpska republic is to prevent the spread of war  from these territories. What does this mean in practice?    [Lukic] This in practice means bringing this war to an end  as quickly as possible and preventing it from spreading further.  I would really be very happy if the war confined itself to  these territories only, because I am deeply convinced that our  recovery tomorrow would be much faster if the war stopped where  it is raging nowadays. Namely, a war devastates and destroys  all assets, not to mention human lives.    [Vojvodic] However, in these conditions the government is  striving for the survival of the people. Recently, you launched  a plan to return 70,000 to 100,000 people to production. What  does this plan involve and how to realize it?    [Lukic] We have many plans. One of the priorities is  definitely the revival of the economy and the return of 70,000  to 100,000 people into production, the return of our emigres,  better to say, refugees, who are outside our republic, and  finally, what is definitely very important, the strengthening of  our front, in other words, the defense of our territory and our  residents.    Beside all this we are now also working on the introduction  of a social program to protect all the residents who have  problems with food, accommodations, and so forth.    [Vojvodic] Production of food is one of the priorities, to  my knowledge. Can it be accomplished in a shorter period of  time, also through direct partial demobilization of soldiers who  are currently on the front?    [Lukic] Yes, our last harvest was truly successfully.  Unfortunately the sowing did not go as planned, actually, it  under-performed significantly due to a shortage of gas.  However, we are preparing for the spring sowing, when we would  like to compensate for what we missed this autumn. We are  making plans according to which the entire population would be  engaged. Therefore, everything that is not on the front should  work and all capable people must work.    [Vojvodic] And secure existence through production?    [Lukic] Naturally. The resources have been considerably  exhausted in the war and we have no other choice but to strive  for greater production. All our plans are aimed in this  direction.    [Vojvodic] How much do you cooperate with Serbia and  Montenegro, that is to say the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia], and how do you assess their assistance in  production and survival under the war conditions?    [Lukic] Well, I am taking this opportunity to sincerely  thank all our brothers from Serbia and Montenegro, that is to  say Yugoslavia, for all the assistance that they have offered  us, and continue to offer, as this assistance has been truly  outstanding, and for everything that we have endured we can  definitely thank this assistance. Cooperation with our  brotherly republics, that is to say our brothers from these two  republics, is really at a high level and I can say that it is  getting better and more successful every day. I hope that we  will soon be one political territory.</p>

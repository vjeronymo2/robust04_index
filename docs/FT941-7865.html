			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Education quango selection attacked Labour last night alleged that the government had 'put political dogma before education' in selecting members for the new quango which will control funding for grant-maintained schools in England and Wales, John Authers writes. The only representative of a local authority on the Funding Agency for Schools, which will have powers to plan education provision alongside education authorities, is Mr Edward Lister, leader of the Conservative 'flagship' borough of Wandsworth. Members also include two directors of the Thatcherite Centre for Policy Studies - Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, and Sir Robert Balchin of the Grant-maintained Schools Foundation - as well as three heads and one governor of grant-maintained schools.</p>

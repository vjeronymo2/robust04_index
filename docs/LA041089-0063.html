			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH PRICE OF TIME: $2.74 MILLION  </P> <P> The world's most complicated watch, which took a team of jewelers nine years to  design and assemble, became the world's most expensive watch when it was  auctioned off in less than two minutes Sunday for $2.74 million.  </P> <P> Bidding for the 18-carat gold Patek Philippe watch that packs 1,728 parts --  but must be wound every 30 hours -- began at $1.67 million and moved up  quickly.  </P> <P> The buyer's name was withheld, but the auctioneer -- Habsburg, Feldman of  Geneva -- identified him as a South American. With a 10% commission and 6.2%  federal sales tax, he will pay $3,169,000 for the timepiece.  </P> <P> Previously, the highest price paid for a watch at auction was $1.2 million in  1984 for a clock from the mid-17th Century.  </P></p>

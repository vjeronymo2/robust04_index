The talks were suspended  for one week at the request of the Israeli side to hold  consultations with its government. The nature of these  consultations and their results are still not clear. However,  it is clear that Israel recessed the peace talks in order to  cover up its intransigent, maneuvering stands. Israel also  wants to prolong these talks to give the impression that it is  serious about reaching ideas and views to discuss the question  of peace and its requirements.    TISHRIN adds: Since the suspension of the talks, Israel has  not said anything signaling that the Israeli side has come up  with anything new or that it has changed its familiar stand and  abandoned its conditions and obstacles. On the contrary, all  indications are that Israel still adheres to everything that is  far from achieving a just and comprehensive peace. Also, Israel  is still committed to sabotaging the peace process. No Israeli  official has said anything that inspires optimism and hope for  real progress in the Washington talks.    TISHRIN goes on: Israel has cast doubt on the results of the  talks even before they start. Several Israeli officials have  said the talks will be unproductive, just like all the other  previous rounds and sessions that have been revolving in a  vicious circle since the Madrid conference. The only new thing  that Israel has come up with is the old, familiar tune repeated  by its Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres when he said: The talks  between Syria and Israel should be upgraded. This discordant  Israeli tune cannot fool anybody. Israel's previous discordant  tune -- arguing that secret talks alone can produce positive  results to advance the peace process -- could not fool anybody  either.    The paper says the secret Oslo talks revealed that the aim  Israel seeks behind the talks is to take on each Arab party on  its own so that it can easily blackmail it and drive it to make  more concessions. The purpose of this is to defeat the Madrid  formula and evade its foundations and terms.    Since Syria is perfectly aware of Israel's malicious  objectives and premeditated intentions, and stemming from a  comprehensive pan- Arab perspective, Syria has firmly and  proudly rejected Israeli suggestions and claims. Syria has  asserted that the one who is concerned about peace would also be  eager to maintain the foundations on which the peace process was  launched, particularly in terms of a comprehensive solution,  clear position, just cause, and that peace is impossible along  with occupation, not even some or part of this occupation. This  is because peace can only be achieved through real, serious  implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy.    TISHRIN concludes: There can be no peace without the Arabs  regaining their territories in full. This will enable the  region to start an age of stability and prosperity, end tension,  explosions, disasters, wars, and calamities.    Under the headline "Partial Solutions Are Not the  Alternative," AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral peace talks are  expected to resume in Washington tomorrow amid an atmosphere  that does not inspire optimism. Israel has once again attempted  to reshuffle cards in line with its rejection of peace and its  policy to take on the Arab parties one at a time, resulting in  the Oslo and Cairo accords.    AL-BA'TH adds that this policy aims at fragmenting the  Palestine question, in fact the Arab-Israeli conflict, to impose  surrender on the Arabs and Zionist hegemony on the region.  Israel has found a party that responds to it by making endless  concessions. This encouraged the Rabin government to show more  intransigence whenever it achieves a breakthrough that serves  its purposes. The best evidence of this is Israel's demand that  representation on the Syrian track be upgraded, or else  emphasizing that it has no wish to go any further on this track.    This position, though old, has come on the heels of the  Cairo  agreement. We do not know what new position the Rabin  government will come up with after whatever agreement. This is  because the talks between Israel and the party that claims to be  representing the Palestinian people are not over yet. The two  parties need a series of agreements to implement the Oslo accord  of capitulation.    AL-BA'TH adds that Israel is still deliberately seeking to  steer clear of the principles that call for a just and  comprehensive solution in the region. This approach, with all  its attempts to reshuffle cards, is impossible to continue  forever, since a just and comprehensive peace is an  international demand, as well as a regional and Arab demand.</p>

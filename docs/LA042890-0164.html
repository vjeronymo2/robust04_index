			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN IN DNA CASE GETS 49-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> A 34-year-old Los Angeles man who last month became the first person in Los  Angeles County to be convicted in a case built on DNA evidence was sentenced  Friday to 49 years in prison for sexually assaulting two women.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman imposed the sentence on Henry  Wilds, saying Wilds exhibited a high degree of "cruelty, viciousness and  callousness."  </P> <P> In March, after a trial that featured two months of complicated scientific  testimony, a jury convicted Wilds of 10 counts of rape, robbery, forcible oral  copulation and burglary in connection with three separate attacks on women in  North Hollywood. Wilds wore a mask for two of the attacks, making  identification difficult. Although the property of one victim was found in  Wilds' apartment, several jurors said they could not have found Wilds guilty of  anything but burglary without the DNA evidence.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, who prosecuted Wilds, asked Coleman to sentence  Wilds to 77 years in prison, saying he "is a dangerous and violent man and a  true threat to our community."  </P> <P> She cited a string of assault and robbery convictions against Wilds that date  back to 1971. Wilds' victims have continued to suffer emotional trauma since  the attacks, Kahn said. One rape victim became pregnant as a result of the  assault and underwent an abortion, Kahn said. The third victim suffered a  miscarriage a few days after the burglary, the prosecutor added.  </P> <P> But Wilds' attorney, Ralph J. Novotney, argued that Wilds should receive only a  30-year sentence because he did not stab or beat the victims "or impose any  terrorism over and above" what was necessary to assault them.  </P> <P> Coleman took the middle ground after noting that Wilds, a large man, preyed  upon "small, defenseless women" and "engaged in a pattern of violent conduct  that poses a danger to society."  </P> <P> With credit for time served and good behavior, Wilds could be released from  prison in 24 years, said Novotney, who said he would appeal the conviction.  </P> <P> Developed four years ago in Great Britain, DNA testing is expected by some to  become as important a forensic technique as fingerprinting. Others say the  technique is unreliable because of flaws in the scientific procedures,  statistics and the standards of laboratories that do the work.  </P> <P> DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in all human cells, including sperm,  blood and hair. Experts say the genetic makeup of tissue can be translated into  patterns that resemble supermarket bar codes. Except for identical twins, no  two people have the same DNA pattern experts claim.  </P> <P> In so-called genetic fingerprinting, DNA samples taken from a crime scene are  analyzed and compared to DNA samples take from a suspect's blood.  </P> <P> Wilds was convicted of assaulting and robbing a 30-year-old woman in December,  1986, in the underground garage of her apartment building, and of a nearly  identical attack on a 27-year-old woman in February, 1987.  </P> <P> He was arrested by Los Angeles police two months later, after allegedly  following a 28-year-old woman into the underground parking lot of her apartment  building. Seeing Wilds, the woman became suspicious and fled in her car. She  flagged down police, who arrested Wilds on a bicycle and found a kitchen knife  in nearby bushes.  </P> <P> Over defense objections, prosecutors obtained a court order to compare the DNA  coding in samples of Wilds' blood to that of sperm found after the assaults.  Maryland-based Cellmark Diagnostics, which performed the test, said there was  an infinitesimal chance that the sperm samples were not those of Wilds.  </P> <P> The two-month trial followed an even more lengthy hearing to determine whether  DNA evidence is reliable enough and respected enough in the scientific  community to be admissible as evidence under California law.  </P> <P> In September, as 35-year-old Ventura woman became the first person in  California to be convicted because of genetic evidence. Prosecutors used DNA  patterns in 15 strands of hair as evidence that the woman stabbed a man to  death at a Ventura hamburger stand. Although appeals are pending, no higher  court has yet ruled on the technique's admissibility.  </P></p>

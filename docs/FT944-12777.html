			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Noyaux durs The forthcoming Renault share sale has brought France's system of noyaux durs - or stable shareholders - into sharp relief once again. Rhone-Poulenc has become the first industrial partner to apply for shares in the automotive company. There is precious little industrial logic in such a stake, much as the chemical group argues there will be synergies developing fuel additives for diesel engines. The financial logic is similarly threadbare. Heavily indebted Rhone-Poulenc will have to divert capital from its core businesses. It will also have to pay a premium for an interest that cannot be sold on the open market for at least 18 months. The only logic would seem to be political: the government wants Rhone-Poulenc as a shareholder, so it would be unwise to disappoint it. Noyaux durs contain dangers not merely for those companies that acquire stakes but also for ordinary investors. The risk is that a system of interlocking shareholdings could allow French industry to huddle together and ignore market disciplines. The main argument for noyaux durs is that they help smooth a company's transition from public to private sector. In particular, they stop a newly-privatised group becoming victim of a hostile takeover - something which could cause a political uproar. Such an argument would be fine if noyaux durs expired after a fixed period, as is the case with the golden shares used in the UK for similar reasons. The snag is that, if the system allows management a comfortable life, noyaux durs could easily become a long-term habit.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Personal View: New rhythm for the tax and spend rhyme The rhythm of life is changing. Chancellors of the exchequer will no longer hold Mr Gladstone's box aloft on a sunny afternoon in the spring, but in the dingy gloom of late November. The second Budget of 1993 seems set for November 30, St Andrew's Day. The change was announced in the 1992 pre-election Budget of the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, with the claim that the new timetable would 'enable all concerned - parliament, the public, and government - to consider spending proposals alongside the tax proposals needed to pay for them'. In future, details of both public spending and tax plans will be announced together on Budget day in late November. This means delaying the announcement of spending decisions by two or three weeks compared to the old timetable, and accelerating the announcement of tax changes by three or four months. The government has made a number of claims about the benefits that will flow from this change in timetable: that it will improve decision-taking, improve presentation, stimulate more informed debate and provide benefits for taxpayers. On the quality of decision-taking, the white paper announcing the change comments that 'ministers will be better able to judge the merits of public spending proposals in the light of the overall fiscal position and the implications for taxation. And the potential trade-offs between tax reliefs and public spending can be more carefully considered'. All this would be true if decisions were to be made together. But all that is really happening is that they are to be presented together. The overall levels of public spending for the next three years were decided in a cabinet meeting in mid-June, and these are now fixed and 'are not to be reopened in subsequent cabinet discussion'. All that remains to be decided on spending is the allocation between departments. But because of the potential burden on officials and ministers caused by bringing together the tax and spending process, the spending process is to be accelerated so that the relevant cabinet committee can carry out the bulk of its work in September. As the all-party Treasury and Civil Service Committee said in its report on the new time-table, if the only way of coping is to separate the decision-making processes (either in time or by allowing different personnel to concentrate on the expenditure and revenue side respectively), much of the claimed advantages of better decision-taking within government will prove illusory. Nor does it seem likely that 'potential trade-offs' between taxation and expenditure will be any better considered than previously if the expenditure decisions have largely been taken two months before the unified Budget. Given the recent suggestion by the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, that he will decide three or four weeks before the Budget whether to raise taxes, the fact that the level of spending will be set five months before the Budget and its allocation at least two months before the Budget, makes suggestions of truly joint decision-making seem fanciful. In hoping for better presentation and more informed debate, the government is on firmer ground. By announcing tax and spending plans together, it should be possible to increase awareness of the costs of higher spending in terms of higher taxes, and of lower taxes in terms of lower spending. The main complaint to make here is that, while debate may be more informed, there are no proposals to create any new opportunities for parliament to engage in decision-making as opposed to debate. And the chance offered by an earlier Budget to extend the period of debate on the finance bill has been missed. The final stated advantage, that there will be benefits to taxpayers, has some weight. The announcement of changes to income tax four months before they are to be implemented will mean that pay-as-you-earn will work smoothly and that there will be scope in some cases for taxpayers to take advantage of pre-announced changes to minimise their tax payments. The announcement of indirect tax changes in the run-up to Christmas may not seem such a benefit. To describe the new unified Budget statement as much more than a shift in the timing of the announcement of tax and spending decisions is to exaggerate. This bringing together of announcements has some advantages and should lead to a better-informed debate. But we are not going to see tax and spending decisions made together, nor is the change a way of extending consultation. Much more could and should have been done.

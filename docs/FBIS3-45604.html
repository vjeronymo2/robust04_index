More than one million Chinese characters are carved on the  stones, which are arranged in the shape of a map of China.    An artist in East China's Fujian Province spent 15 months  carving the stones.    To mark the 100th anniversary of the late Chinese chairman's  birth which fell on December 26 last year, a number of events  were held all around the country.</p>

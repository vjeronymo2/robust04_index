			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEF OF STAFF TO SALVADOR'S NEW LEADER IS SLAIN;  </P> <P> 2 OF VICTIM'S AIDES DIE IN ATTACK BLAMED ON MARXIST REBEL BAND  </P> <P> Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, an ultra-right-wing ideologue who was one of  President Alfredo Cristiani's closest advisers, was assassinated here Friday  nine days after taking office as presidential chief of staff.  </P> <P> The 73-year-old Rodriguez Porth, whose formal title was minister of the  presidency, was shot to death at 8:10 a.m. (7:10 PDT) just as he was entering a  station wagon parked in front of his house in the La Mascota district of the  city. His driver, Juan Gilberto Clara Carranza, and his groundskeeper, Benjamin  Perez, also died.  </P> <P> The Salvadoran government, the military and U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker  all blamed the deaths on the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a  Marxist guerrilla movement that has fought a nine-year civil war here. They  charged that the rebels are trying to provoke a violent right-wing reaction  that would endanger the massive U.S. aid program for El Salvador.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widow's Suggestion  </P> <P> However, a guerrilla spokesman in Mexico City told the British news agency  Reuters that "it is almost impossible" that the FMLN, as the rebels are called,  carried out the murders. And Rodriguez Porth's widow suggested the killers  could have been "terrorists from the right."  </P> <P> Rodriguez Porth, a founder and one-time director general of Cristiani's ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party), was the second senior member of  the party to be assassinated in the last two months. Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia  Alvarado died April 19 when his car was bombed. In addition, an unsuccessful  attempt was made April 14 on the life of Vice President Jose Francisco Merino.  </P> <P> Although they deny responsibility for these attacks, the rebels have pledged to  make El Salvador "ungovernable" under Cristiani's leadership.  </P> <P> In a news conference at the end of the day, Cristiani said the killing of  Rodriquez Porth demonstrates that the "dark forces" of the FMLN "don't want  peace, nor reconciliation, nor agreement nor progress for the country."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Punishment Vowed  </P> <P> In reply to questions about a possible violent government or Arena reaction,  the president stressed that "we are going to respond under the law . . . and  punish those responsible for this crime . . . but we will not be provoked into  sinking the country into a whirlpool of violence."  </P> <P> Rodriguez Porth was a natural target for the rebels. Over the years, first as a  lawyer and a member of the country's wealthy business establishment, then as a  law professor, diplomat and official of Arena, he was a bitter critic of any  opponent of right-wing policies. He consistently advocated hard-line action  against the National University for supposedly harboring FMLN supporters.  </P> <P> A close friend who held similar opinions, Francisco L. Peccorini, was shot to  death March 15. The FMLN acknowledged killing Peccorini, a dual  American-Salvadoran citizen who had retired from teaching philosophy at Cal  State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Rodriguez Porth, who served as foreign minister during a right-wing military  dictatorship in the late 1970s, probably was best known to the public for his  almost daily denunciations of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whom he  called a Communist dupe.  </P> <P> Yet, although he had been an unrelenting advocate of hard-handed suppression of  the FMLN, Rodriguez Porth last week called for talks with the guerrillas to end  the civil war. It was this that led his widow to say Friday that he could have  been murdered by the right.  </P> <P> Friday's killings clearly were well planned. As the official walked the 20 feet  from his front door of his house at 240 La Mascota St. to the Jeep Cherokee  parked at the curb, the killer sat on a motorcycle about 50 yards away. He  evidently knew that Rodriguez Porth never used bodyguards and left for work at  the same time nearly every day.  </P> <P> Just as Rodriguez Porth clambered into the back seat of the car and the two  other men were walking to the front doors, the motorcycle drove up and stopped.  Watched by a jogger only 90 feet away and two housekeepers from a home across  the street, the killer calmly but quickly walked to the curb-side and fired  three shots into Rodriguez Porth's upper right chest.  </P> <P> He turned and shot Perez once and Carranza twice and then climbed onto his  idling motorcycle and drove away as Perez's wife and small child came to the  door. The roar of the departing motorcycle did not drown out the sound of the  child crying "Papita, papita."  </P> <P> The attack was over in less than two minutes.  </P> <P> In a statement read to reporters, Ambassador Walker said that the killing was  "an act of mindless terror . . . that fits the pattern of other recent  terrorist attacks and killings."  </P> <P> That, he said, is to "do something so atrocious, so provocative, so repugnant  that the government, or others, must retaliate." The "others" Walker mentioned  are the right-wing death squads that killed thousands of FMLN supporters and  other anti-government critics in the early 1980s. Many Arena leaders are widely  suspected of involvement in the death squads, which were responsible for 17  killings during the first four months of this year, according to the human  rights office of the Roman Catholic Church.  </P> <P> In fact, the guerrillas proposed last month to call off attacks on government  and Arena leaders if Roberto D'Aubuisson, another founder of the party and one  whose name is most often linked with the death squads, were tried for the 1980  assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. The offer was rejected.  </P> <P> In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying that President Bush  "strongly condemns the vicious murder" and "again calls on extremist groups to  put an end to the violence in El Salvador, noting that only through the  renunciation of terrorism and war, and the acceptance of democracy, will there  be peace."  </P> <P> "The president noted a pattern of violence against government officials in El  Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic gains made in that  country," the statement said.  </P> <P> Although Walker said he expects the government to pursue the killer "within the  legal system," powerful Arena leaders were speaking of revenge within an hour  of Rodriguez Porth's death.  </P> <P> "We are facing outright terrorism," said Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a former army  colonel who once led a military mutiny against Duarte's government. "They are  troglodytes, and the only way to make them understand is to fight fire with  fire."  </P></p>

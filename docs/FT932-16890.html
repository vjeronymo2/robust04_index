			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Patten challenges Beijing on poll CHINA should come forward with its own proposals on the 1995 elections to Hong Kong's legislative council, Mr Chris Patten, governor of the British colony said yesterday, instead of simply denouncing his plans for modest democratic reform. The Chinese authorities were 'trying to play the man, rather than the ball,' in trying to discredit him as governor, Mr Patten said. 'I know the adjectives, and I know the names being called,' the governor said, 'but what are their proposals for the 1995 elections?' In particular, were they willing to countenance the 'fair election' of legislative council members 'they don't like?'. And if so, would they allow them to finish their terms - which run until 1999 - after the colony is handed back to China in 1997? Despite China's attempts to step up pressure on Britain over the governance of Hong Kong, Mr Patten emphasised that the UK had set no preconditions for the resumption of talks with China to end the diplomatic stand-off. In a spirited defence of what he called his 'quasi-democratic' reform proposals, Mr Patten said resuming talks would be a 'better way to spend spring in Peking than inventing new forms of denunciatory language for the New China news agency.' He was addressing a packed conference on the future of Hong Kong at the Centre for European Policy Studies, the independent Brussels think-tank, after talks with Commission president Jacques Delors. Asked about China's appointment of Sir David Akers-Jones, a former acting governor of Hong Kong, as an adviser to the shadow authority it has set up for the colony, Mr Patten said: 'I don't think Sir David Akers-Jones' views have changed much over the years.' Sir David has attacked Mr Patten's reforms as confrontational and damaging to Hong Kong's future, and his appointment is widely seen as a deliberate attempt by Peking to undermine Mr Patten. The governor said he hoped Sir David and his colleagues would give 'fair advice, I hope they give it fearlessly, and I hope Chinese officials listen.' Mr Patten said his reforms were aimed merely at assuring 'clean and fair elections in 1995', so that Hong Kong would have credible government, under the rule of law, with an honest bureaucracy and independent courts. He said Hong Kong's freedom was part of the explanation for its remarkable economic success, and implied delicately that China's economic reforms would build up new pressure for political reform. 'When people make economic decisions for themselves, they tend to want to make political ones too.'</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who played a key role in ending the  Persian Gulf War, has resigned as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.  Tehran Radio said Rafsanjani offered his resignation to the nation's supreme  leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying his new job as president leaves him  little time for the armed forces. Rafsanjani, appointed to the top military  post by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, persuaded the late spiritual leader to  accept a cease-fire last August in the eight-year war with Iraq.  </P></p>

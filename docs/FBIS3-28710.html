Purebdorj said that NATO "is not an  aggressive alliance" today. In the vice premier's opinion, most  speedy rapprochement with NATO "would have a positive impact on  strengthening Mongolia's national security as it makes the  transition to a democratic society."    C. Purebdorj told correspondents that a large group of NATO  experts is due to come to Ulaanbaatar this summer for the first  time "to establish contacts and hold consultations on national  security questions."    In the opinion of Russian Foreign Ministry experts, the  Mongolians' view of the North Atlantic bloc is by and large the  result of a positive attitude to the decisions adopted at the  last NATO session, in particular, the "Partnership for Peace"  program. IZVESTIYA was told that diplomats in Moscow have not  got a complex over this.    The European Parliament Commission recently heard a report  on  the situation in Mongolia advocating an exchange of  representatives and the organization of dialogue with the Great  Hural. The Europeans decided on the advisability of granting  most-favored-nation status for imports of Mongolian goods to the  West and also of concluding a partnership treaty.    We learned from diplomatic sources in Moscow that Mongolian  banks have already received 8 million European Currency Units  from Europe within the framework of the so-called "TACIS"  economic aid program.</p>

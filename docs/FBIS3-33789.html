			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "How Far the Punishment"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali took the  right step in going straight to the U.N. Security Council  Committee monitoring the application of sanctions against Iraq  in a bid to highlight the Jordanian case at the United Nations  headquarters. Jordanian losses due to the observance of the  sanctions imposed on Baghdad in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis  of 1991 have been carefully documented and conservatively put at  $300 million annually. Numerous attempts have been made by  Jordan to explain the extent of the hardships that our economy  has sustained as a result of the application of these measures  and to seek adequate compensation for them. It is no secret  that industrial production in the country has been oriented with  the Iraqi market in mind, in view of the geographic proximity  and in order to maintain a trade balance commensurate with  Jordan's dependence on the import of oil from Iraq.    All nations of the world which admit to having a stake in  the  stability and development of the Kingdom, whether for the  promotion of the peace prospects in the Middle East or for the  overall security of the region, have now an opportunity to  translate this faith into action. This they could do by lifting  the secondary "sanctions" that have been applied against Jordan  and by ending their indiscriminate interference with sea  shipping to and from al-'Aqabah. Jordanian imports and exports  have been unduly and unnecessarily jeopardised because of  routine inspection of freighters bound to the Jordanian Red Sea  port. Costs to the economy attributable to such unacceptable  practices have been staggering. Needless to say, this country  can ill afford the additional costs to its imports and exports.  Sea lines to Jordan have also been curtailed considerably, by  up to 30 per cent, because ship owners cannot afford the unusual  delays experienced by their ships en route to Jordan. The  alternative Jordanian proposal to replace sea searches by  on-land inspection by a neutral party is a lesser evil, even  though such idea had been anathema to us until the recent past.  In principle, the proposal is a threat to Jordan's sovereignty  but it would work out as a temporary alternative.    As to the prime minister's other major concern--that  Jordanian applications numbering already in the thousands,  requesting U.N. authorisation to export certain food and medical  products be processed on criteria basis rather than on the  existing case-by-case method--is also a step in the right  direction. There is no sense in spending precious time on the  applications and working on the 15 members of the committee to  discuss each and every request if the majority of requests fall  under similar general category. The current method is simply  not cost effective. A more rational way to deal with this issue  could be found in the Jordanian proposal. Still, the central  problem lies in neither dimension of the application of  sanctions against Iraq. It is the question of the sanctions  themselves that has to be reasked, especially after it was  proven beyond a shadow of doubt that it is the Iraqi people who  suffer most from them. Besides, Baghdad has enforced most if  not all of the U.N. Security Council's resolutions imposed on it  after the Gulf war. There is a good case to at least relax the  sanctions and start lifting them on a gradual basis,  commensurate with the extent of Iraqi adherence to the original  U.N. resolutions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Iranian Charge d'Affaires Gholam Reza Ansari  tonight "emphatically denied" his country was involved in  supplying arms or money to the IRA. "There is absolutely no  contact between the intelligence services of our country and  provisional IRA," he said.    "We naturally understand that any such contact would produce  a feeling of revulsion in the UK, but as there is none, there is  no need for alarm or criticism. There is no shred of evidence  to support these astonishing claims. They are without  foundation, there is no basis for them and there is no truth in  the suggestion that Iran supports terrorism in Northern Ireland  or in any part of the world."    He blamed the reports on unnamed "elements" who he said  wanted to damage relations between Britain and Iran. He said  that he was notified that he was being summoned to the meeting  with Mr. Hogg on Wednesday [27 April].    He said that during discussion the foreign minister had not  presented him with any firm evidence to support the allegations.  However, he did confirm that Mr. Hogg raised the name of an  Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, who was named in Greek  newspaper reports as the head of the Western European Department  of the Iranian intelligence Ministry, and who was said to be  involved in the negotiations with the IRA.</p>

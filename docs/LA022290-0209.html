			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BOSTON CAMERATA  </P> <P> The point of the Boston Camerata's "Sacred Bridge" program is simple enough in  theory, complex in practice -- the interrelationship of medieval Jewish and  Christian music. Director Joel Cohen and five other early music heroes of the  Camerata made this potentially dry subject live through fluent, stylistically  persuasive music-making Tuesday evening at the Sephardic Temple Tifereth  Israel.  </P> <P> The Bostonians were repeating the program with which they made their local  debut in 1985. Cohen provided some humorous verbal annotation, but largely let  the music deliver its own message through pointed program juxtapositions.  </P> <P> The entire second half of the agenda matched songs from the Sephardic oral  tradition with some of the Cantigas de Sancta Maria collected by Alfonso el  Sabio in the 13th Century.  </P> <P> The program began similarly, with sets that included a performance alternating  the Latin and Hebrew versions of the same Psalm tone. This monophonic repertory  was presented simply, but with remarkable vocal grace and clarity.  </P> <P> A set devoted to Jewish minstrels culminated in another bit of early music  kitsch, based on a comically boastful autobiographical poem by one Yitzhak  Gorni.  </P> <P> Selections from the 18th-Century repertory of the Jewish community in  Carpentras, some of it based on familiar Baroque airs such as "La Folia," were  the only ventures outside the Medieval-traditional bounds. These pieces  featured the bright, supple singing of soprano Anne Azema, and allowed Carol  Lewis -- otherwise confined to droning vielle accompaniment -- some difficult  solo gamba opportunities.  </P> <P> Other members of the ensemble were the busy singer-lutenist-harpist John  Fleagle, his warm, focused baritone particularly effective in Mathieu le Juif's  "Par grant franchise;" clarion countertenor Michael Collver, who also played  percussion and contributed a cornett solo to the Cantigas set; and under-used  flute and recorder virtuoso Jesse Lepkoff. Cohen himself sang reedily and  played lutes. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

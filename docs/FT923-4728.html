			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Vinten shows 8% contraction DESPITE higher turnover and reduced interest charges, Vinten Group saw pre-tax profit fall by 8 per cent, from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 4.29m, in the first half of 1992. The group supplies camera mounting equipment and systems to the broadcasting, video, photographic and defence markets. Mr Humphrey Wood, chairman, said trading profits in the broadcast and photographic divisions rose 9 per cent to Pounds 4.23m, from sales of Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 19.9m), assisted by the contribution from Bexel, acquired late last year. Offsetting that, profits from the surveillance and electro-optic sides decreased by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 620,000, on turnover of Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 11.3m). Mr Wood pointed out that the 1991 results were influenced by defence work accelerated by the Gulf war. Earnings per share were 8.8p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is 1.9p (1.8p). Vinten is acquiring Gitzo Holding for FFr27.2m (Pounds 2.9m), of which FFr26.1m will be in cash. Gitzo makes photographic video and television tripods, and produced a pre-tax profit of FFr900,000 on turnover of FFr30.5m in 1991. At the year-end net assets were FFr6.6m.</p>

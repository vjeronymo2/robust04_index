			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Dudek: "Sobriety Above All"] </F>   [Text] When U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peter  Tarnoff tactfully pointed out to journalists last May that, in  foreign policy, the United States will continue to pursue only  those aims that it can manage--and that have economic  significance for Washington--many politicians on both sides of  the Atlantic feigned great surprise. Commentaries and  statements repudiating the surprisingly "resigned" and  "isolationist" drift of U.S. foreign policy began to appear. At  the same time, Tarnoff had only conceded something that was as  plain "as the nose on his face." Perhaps he came up with his  formulations a little soon. However, with the passing of a year,  we can only acknowledge his good intentions.    The number-three in the U.S. Department of State underlined  his view of future U.S. international policy yesterday and the  day before yesterday in Prague. The stabilizing Czech economic  situation suits the U.S. side. Tarnoff referred with  satisfaction to the higher U.S. investment in the Czech Republic  (roughly 30 percent of the overall volume of foreign imports).  Viewed through Washington's eyes, the Czech basin [ceska  kotlina] is a region that it does not have to take care of  systematically because its inhabitants, within the framework of  their potential, are taking care of it themselves.    Unfortunately, the issues that affect the fate of countries  like the Czech Republic, issues that these countries cannot deal  with on their own, will not wither away in this fashion. The  security vacuum in which the Central European countries have  found themselves following the collapse of the Soviet empire can  only be filled under the given circumstances by membership in  NATO. If, however, Moscow decides to put off the moment when  its former satellites are accepted into NATO, no one in today's  world other than Washington can influence its willfulness. Will  it do so?    Tarnoff left this question, which must have come up in his  talks with Czech politicians, only half answered. Yet he spoke  extensively and optimistically, as was to be expected, about the  Partnership for Peace, project and, in an interview with  journalists, he rejected tactfully but decisively the criticism  that has recently been leveled at this unbinding program in the  United States.    The Czech Republic is far from being a state that would not  let the key officials in the U.S. Department of State sleep  peacefully. Visiting it, therefore, is not something that would  "get hot" for U.S. diplomats. Tarnoff himself called off at the  last moment in the spring his announced and carefully planned  visit to Prague.    It is impossible to be surprised at the calm unconcern with  which Washington dubs us self-supporting. Other countries,  threatening to explode, merit U.S. attention more. North Korea  is the most noticeable example. Even here, however, Washington  is limiting itself only to what it can manage--and it seems that  it can manage little.    Peter Tarnoff, who held talks in Asian countries last week,  in reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY on whether Washington  will be willing and able to prevent Pyongyang from producing  more nuclear bombs, was quick to recall the success of the  conciliatory mission by former President Carter. In return for  Kim Il-song's allowing two international inspectors to remain in  the DPRK, the United States will suspend its attempt to  introduce sanctions. A meager victory--but in the spirit of the  sobriety formulated by Tarnoff. Rather than dispatching the  Army to force Kim into obedience, it is worthwhile for  Washington to send Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang. The fact that the  North Korean regime cannot be trusted and that the two  inspectors will not prevent the production of further nuclear  bombs in the DPRK has somehow been left aside.</p>

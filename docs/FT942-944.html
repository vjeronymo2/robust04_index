			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Arts: It's a mad, mad, Ken Campbell - Theatre A mad world, my masters. Especially when Ken Campbell discourses on it, and ranges from drinking other people's spinal fluid with vodka to get their thoughts ('like getting other people's snaps from Boots') to quantum physics. To judge from Mysterious Bruises at the Almeida Theatre, Islington, his scavengings through the mind's litter-clogged laybys are, if anything, madder than ever. But there is a new gentleness about him. Bursts of manic gargoyle glee are undercut by almost embarrassed throwaway reticence which is just as funny. As ever, the apparent red herrings, wild geese and shaggy dogs that roam the moonstruck prairie of his intellect are logically linked and neatly come full circle, through whatever hoop, U-turn or lateral flea-leap on to another juicy subject he casually urges them. Campbell has stepped in, following the premature demise of the Almeida's previous production. As he gracefully puts it, the theatre rang him to say: 'the bollocks we've got on at the moment have been rumbled.' He speaks about theatre - the art, the craft, the bollocks - with brief homage to 'tubby and caring' Peter Brook ('we miss Jess Yates, don't we?', he adds, wickedly inconsequential); a talking dog that told 'an utterly constructed narrative of the horror genre' sounding like Sir Herbert Beerbohm-Tree; and, disregarding theatrical superstition, dwells on productions of Macbeth he has known. In Stoke-on-Trent (1964) he played the Porter as if suddenly aware of the audience, with an amazement reserved for time travellers. He adopted a Method approach for Colchester (1967), deducing from clues in the text that the character of Angus was a flatulent dwarf, probably opting for bonsai disguise in Burnham Wood. I fear he may never be a company man as the term is understood in the Berliner Ensemble. But the two hours traffic jam of his stage begins and ends with science. Ejaculating polyfilla canisters are to this set what candelabra were to Liberace's. Campbell thoughtfully provides the front row with covering in case the spouting substance gets into the spectators' pores before hammering a nail into the 'disenfranchised self' of the aerosol and letting it gush. This leads easily - as easily as anything is led in a Campbell ramble - to the space-time continuum. He ends the show with physics, his nonsense firmly researched, unimpeachable authorities quoted (and mocked). 'I'm not making this up, you know,' as comedian Anna Russell would reproachfully remark when outlining the plot of Wagner's Ring. Mad world, mad kings, mad composition; and, thankfully, maddest of all is Ken Campbell.</p>

They show that the cost of NHS management rose from  &pound;25.7  million in 1987 to &pound;494.2 million this year -- an increase  of  &pound;468 million or 1,800 per cent.    An analysis of the figures by Labour show that annual  bureaucratic costs -- including administration, clerical and  management costs -- have risen over the same period from  &pound;1.44 billion to &pound;3.02 billion, an increase of 110  percent.    The proportion of spending on administration, clerical and  management costs has risen from 8.7 percent of the total NHS  budget in England in 1987-88 to 10.8 percent in 1992-93.    Mr. David Blunkett, Labour Shadow Health Secretary, claimed  that greater bureaucracy and increased administrative costs were  a direct result of the introduction of the internal market --  the commercialised contracting system within the NHS.    He said it had been commonly accepted before the  Conservatives came to office that NHS management and  administrative costs amounted to about six percent of total NHS  spending.    "A rise to nearly 11 percent over 15 years is a staggering  indictment of the Conservatives mismanagement and misuse of  resources."    A spokesman for the Department of Health said that Mr.  Blunkett was only looking at the "input" side of NHS statistics  without considering the output it achieved.    He said: "For every 100 patients treated in hospital before  the reforms, the NHS now treats 115 and it will rise to 120 next  year. The NHS spends &pound;100 million every day and if it is to  treat more patients and improve the quality of care, the money  has to be properly used and management plays a vital role in  that process."    Mrs. Bottomley argues that the increase in management is  caused to some extent by staff such as senior nurses being  re-designated as managers under the reforms.    She also says the Government has acted decisively to cut  bureaucracy -- regional health authorities are about to be  abolished with the loss of 2,000 staff. District health  authorities, totalling 192 a few years ago, are already down to  145 and will fall to only 94 in coming years.    In a counterblast to Mr. Blunkett's comments she accused  Labour of failing to produce a promised document on its health  policy: "Instead of attacking the health service, Labour should  deploy their time explaining how they would match the  improvements in the quality and quantity of patient care  achieved under the Conservative reforms."    The skirmish between the two parties is in preparation for a  Parliamentary debate today initiated by Labour on the level of  NHS bureaucracy.</p>

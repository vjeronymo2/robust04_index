			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: OLD COLUMBIA IS ACTUALLY NEW AND THRIVES ON BREW  OF ITS OWN MAKING  </P> <P> Downtown San Diego's Old Columbia Brewery &amp; Grill, the city's first "pub  brewery," actually looks like it should.  </P> <P> Neither cute nor suburban, the long room stretches back under a barrel-vaulted  ceiling, the brick walls and utilitarian furniture giving it the appearance of  a late Victorian warehouse.  </P> <P> On the right side of the room, the salient features are the highly polished  brew kettles and beer tanks that squat behind plate-glass windows, and the bar  that runs in front of them. Although the place opened just a month ago,  sundowns find the bar jammed with patrons, most of them locked in conversation  and downing brews with names like Gaslamp Gold and Old Columbia Amber Lager.  The sight of so many people enjoying themselves is a real pleasure.  </P> <P> Old Columbia (which of course is new, not old) joins a group of about 75  independent microbreweries that have sprung up recently across the country; the  idea actually is a rejuvenation of the old-fashioned practice of brewing in  small batches for consumption on the premises. Old Columbia intends to produce  about 46,500 gallons annually, an amount unlikely to put Miller Brewing Co. or  Anheuser-Busch over a barrel when it comes to competing for the American beer  dollar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Essential Element  </P> <P> Consumers who value flavor in beer -- an essential element that gradually has  vanished as major brewers have cut back on hops content and have introduced  watered-down "light" beers -- will not only applaud Old Columbia, but will  cheerfully look forward to two more microbreweries expected to open in the  county later this year.  </P> <P> Old Columbia features "handmade" beers brewed according to recipes developed by  Karl Strauss, retired brewmaster of the Pabst Brewing Co. and uncle of Old  Columbia partner Christopher Cramer. Two -- a golden ale and a lager -- have  been available recently, but plans call for the introduction of other types.  </P> <P> Critiquing a beer is not the easiest task. But consider Gaslamp Gold a beer of  pronounced but mellow bitterness, with a strong finish and a rich, chewy body.  The Amber Lager similarly is full and rich, but heavier, and is rather  challenging to taste buds accustomed to more weak-kneed brews; it stands well  on its own or as an accompaniment to strongly flavored or highly seasoned  foods.  </P> <P> Food is a very strong element of the business at Old Columbia, but now it seems  mostly an adjunct to the business of brewing and serving beer. The menu runs to  some length and is well-designed as an accompaniment to the house brews, but  the execution, by and large, is shaky. In truth, the one dish that really stood  out among the many sampled on two recent visits was a dessert called "chocolate  on tap," a fudge brownie buried at the bottom of a goblet under vanilla ice  cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream.  </P> <P> This dessert, of course, is not a dish meant to accompany beer. Among those  designed for that purpose, the best bets are the beer-battered onion rings and  the fish and chips. The batter used both for the onions and the fish is yeasty  and perfumed with the beer that gives it its essence, and it puffs to a  wonderful crispness in the deep fat.  </P> <P> The onion rings can start a meal; another happy starter that could double as a  light entree is the sausage and cheese platter that pairs triangles of Jack and  Cheddar with slices of cold bratwurst. French fries also are listed in the  appetizer category, both plain or in a plethora of guises that include spuds  draped with melted cheese, drowned in chili and, for die-hards, buried beneath  slatherings of both.  </P> <P> The chili could have been hotter in temperature when sampled, but spice-wise,  it made the mark. Leaning more heavily on minced beef than on beans, this one  had a good tomato base and a relatively deep flavor, and was garnished on the  side with chopped onions for those who don't know when to quit. The menu also  offers baked onion soup and a soup of the day, which recently was a "seafood  bisque" of uncertain parentage that seemed like nothing so much as thickened  clam juice garnished with a few snippets of shellfish. It was eminently  forgettable.  </P> <P> Some entree-sized salads include beer in their dressings. The Cobb instead is  moistened with a Champagne vinaigrette, which may be its best feature. This  salad, to be correct, must be chopped, but the greens were in too large pieces;  the worst part was the cubed chicken, which had been grilled over charcoal and  had a strong, smoky flavor that fought all the other elements. Other choices in  this department include Caesar, chef and vegetable salads.  </P> <P> Among heartier items, the meaty short ribs were interesting, not so much for  their flavor (the menu claimed they were marinated in a "secret blend of herbs  and spices," a secret that must have been guarded from the cooks), but for  their texture, which resembled that of a properly done pot roast. A hamburger  (there are several varieties) was plump, but not particularly juicy or notable  in other ways, except for the creamy, dill-flavored potato salad that  accompanied it. The "Brewmaster" sandwich was much more interesting; it layered  thinly sliced roast beef with Jack cheese and sliced chilies on a toasted roll,  and made a hearty, savory meal.  </P> <P> Oddly enough, Old Columbia offers a good selection of California wines by the  bottle and glass, and at prices that should make many San Diego restaurants  blush. But the real interest here is the product that flows from the shiny vats  in the back room, and San Diegans who like a decent beer should find that Old  Columbia's offerings have vintage qualities of their own.  </P></p>

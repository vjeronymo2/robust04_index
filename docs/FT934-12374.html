			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / People: Bodies politic The Civil Aviation Authority has appointed Rod Lynch, 44, to its governing board. The CAA board comprises a selection of full and part-time members with financial, aviation, air safety and other appropriate qualifications and experience. It is responsible for civil aviation policy in the UK, including air traffic control and safety regulations. Its chairman is the Rt Hon Christopher Chataway, the former government minister. Lynch is currently managing director of resources, engineering and services at the British Broadcasting Corporation, having joined the BBC from Forte Hotels - where he was sales and marketing director - in May this year. But Lynch can offer the CAA more than guidance as to improvements in its catering. He worked for 20 years in the airline business before moving to Forte: 18 with British Airways - where he became head of customer services - and two as managing director of Air Europe.</p>

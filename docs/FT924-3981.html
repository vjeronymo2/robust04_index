			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Fixing the EC budget IF NEXT week's Edinburgh summit is to achieve its goals, an agreement on the European Community's budget must be reached. Of the complex questions on the agenda, the budget is the least insoluble. A two-pronged strategy is needed. In addition to an immediate compromise, a more radical programme of reform should be started, aimed at making the EC budget more redistributionally rational and more economically effective. If the current EC budget did not exist, nobody would dream of inventing it. The pattern of national contributions is the main problem. In 1992, Germany will provide two-thirds of the net budgetary contributions, the UK 22 per cent and France 11 per cent. Among the most important beneficiaries are not only Greece, Ireland and Spain, but also Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium, some of the richest EC members. This is so despite the UK's controversial rebate. The EC's role as a Robin Hood in reverse was not intended. The most important single reason for the outcome has been spending on the Common Agricultural Policy, which has fallen from 80 per cent of total spending in the 1950s to 58 per cent in 1991. It is expected to fall to less than 50 per cent by 1997, on the Commission's plans. But it will remain much the most important single category. The pattern of spending is not the only problem. When the EC's 'own resource' system was first introduced, it consisted of import duties and levies, along with a top-up element related to VAT. The distribution of revenue from import duties was particularly arbitrary, although this became less important as tariffs were lowered and the VAT contribution increased. Perverse pattern The EC has taken a pragmatic approach to remedying the absurdities. The perverse pattern of spending was remedied by the addition of new cornucopias, such as the regional fund, which was added in 1973, and structural funds for the poorer member countries. The package proposed by Mr Delors plans to increase structural funds still further, from Ecu18.6bn in 1992 to Ecu29.3bn in 1997. Within that proposal falls the cohesion fund, which is, in essence, a bribe for acceptance by the poorer member states of the Maastricht treaty's commitment to economic and monetary union. Revenue has been tinkered with as well. In 1988, for example, the VAT contribution was pegged at 1.4 per cent of the VAT base and another resource introduced, related to GNP. This was the first, cautious attempt to relate contributions to relative wealth. The Commission has now proposed that the VAT element be reduced and the GNP-related contribution increased from about a quarter of total revenue to 40-45 per cent. Need for success In addition to tinkering with the pattern of spending and revenue, the EC also imposed a specific ceiling on the budget in 1988. Currently set at 1.2 per cent of GNP, the dispute that will come to Edinburgh is over whether it should rise to 1.36 per cent of EC gross product by the end of 1997, as in the Commission's official proposal, or 1.32 per cent by 1999, which is Mr Delors' latest suggestion, or to 1.25 per cent by 1998, this being the much condemned proposal from the UK presidency. These differences are not worth a breakdown, especially when the EC needs a success. Splitting the difference between the poorer countries and the richer ones must be the right answer. Meanwhile, a modest reduction in its rebate might be the UK's contribution to a successful outcome. Such pragmatism is not enough. The EC's budget needs more radical rethinking. In a valuable pamphlet for the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Sir Michael Franklin suggests a corrective mechanism designed to bring about an acceptable redistributive outcome. Given such a corrective mechanism, the UK would no longer be a special case. If there were a redistributional override in the budget, the EC's spending could also be focused where it would make a contribution additional to that of national exchequers. Spending that helps integrate the EC economy would be an obvious priority The Edinburgh summit must, first and foremost, split the difference between what the poorer countries demand and what the richer countries feel they can afford. But it needs more. The heads of government should commission a study that will suggest ways of eliminating the main anomalies in the present budget. The aim is clear: the budget must be made both more rationally redistributive and more demonstrably supportive of the wider economic goals of the EC.</p>

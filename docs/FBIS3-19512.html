This is the  conclusion that the Bundesbank has drawn in view of the dramatic  deficits of the communes, which rose to 10.5 billion German  marks [DM] in 1993. In the previous year, it was DM9.7 billion,  in 1990 DM3.6 billion, and in 1989 even a surplus of DM2.2  billion was produced. The overall debts of the communes stand at  DM140 billion.    In spite of considerable contributions from the "German  Unity  Fund," the east German communes produced a deficit of DM7.5  billion in 1992. The deficit per inhabitant is three times as  high as in the old laender, especially because of the required  additional expenditure for infrastructure.    Both a stronger rationalization of the administration and  the  transfer of communal tasks to private enterprises are required,  the Bundesbank stressed. It is possible to achieve a balanced  budget, like in the first half of the 1980's. According to the  Bundesbank, the strongly differing financial situation of the  towns in western Germany puts in proper perspective the  impression that the rise in expenditure that occurred in the  past few years is a "phenomenon that can hardly be averted" from  the communes.    On the average, personnel costs rose by approximately 8  percent between 1990 and 1992, which was caused by wage  increases and the hiring of new personnel. The increase in  expenditure for material rose approximately 9 percent, and the  costs for social welfare increased by 12 percent in 1992 alone.  The receipts of the communes, however, rose by only 6 percent,  and the transfers from the federal and provincial budgets by 8  percent.</p>

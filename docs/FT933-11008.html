			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sapporo Breweries lifts payout SAPPORO Breweries, Japan's third biggest brewer, is boosting its dividend for 1993, a year in which it has been increasing its share of a flat market for beer and will benefit from special gains. First-half parent company results released yesterday showed sales 3.9 per cent higher at Y256.3bn (Dollars 2.42bn) and pre-tax profits ahead 5.1 per cent to Y4.93bn. A 43.6 per cent jump in net earnings to Y2.98bn was achieved because of a Y2.1bn credit from the liquidation of a can-making subsidiary. On a per-share basis net earnings were Y8.91 against Y6.21, from which an interim dividend of Y3.50 is being paid, up from Y2.50 a share. The annual payout will rise accordingly to Y7 from Y5, a level which will meet a pledge made by Sapporo as part of a bond issue last year that it would distribute at least 35 per cent of earnings. Full-year profits are forecast to be unchanged at Y10.7bn before tax and 44 per cent higher at Y5.3bn net. Revenues are projected to grow 5.1 per cent to Y580bn. In the six months to June its beer division increased interim revenues 3.7 per cent - volume sales were 3 per cent higher although the domestic market as a whole shrank 1.1 per cent. The overall performance was also assisted by 22.3 per cent growth at its soft drinks side.</p>

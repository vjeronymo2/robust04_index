			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WAGES OF DEREGULATION;  </P> <P> DOES PUBLIC SAFETY FLY WITH EASTERN?  </P> <P> The Justice Department has obtained criminal indictments against Eastern  Airlines and nine of its managers on charges they failed to maintain passenger  aircraft properly, then lied to conceal their negligence. The department's  announcement is a welcome sign of federal authorities' willingness to attack a  problem to which The Times first drew attention more than three years ago.  </P> <P> In March, 1986, Times writers Richard E. Meyer and Ralph Vartabedian reported  that deregulation of the airline industry and a diminution in federal oversight  forced by budgetary restraints had combined to seriously erode the commercial  air fleet's margin of safety. Their story documented not only the increasing  average age and use of passenger aircraft, but also the decline in maintenance  spending as an overall percentage of the airlines' operating expenses.  </P> <P> As James M. Dimin, an aircraft engineering and maintenance expert hired as a  consultant by The Times, put it: "Deregulation has been a disaster both in  terms of its effect on maintenance practices and, ultimately, in its effect on  safety."  </P> <P> If the allegations contained in the government's 60-count indictment of Eastern  and its supervisors are proven at trial, the troubled airline's situation will  stand as a striking example of the threat to public safety created by the  federal government's sloth in arresting the trends set in motion by  deregulation. "Thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk every  day by the actions of these defendants," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said in  announcing the indictments.  </P> <P> Eastern, one of the airline industry's most troubled carriers, has been the  target of a strike by unionized mechanics for more than a year. As a  consequence, the company has filed for protection from its creditors under  Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> The government charges that between July, 1985, and October, 1989, officials at  Eastern's Miami headquarters, who were themselves under intense financial and  competitive pressure, intimidated supervisors at maintenance centers in New  York and Atlanta "to keep the aircraft in flight at all costs." To that end,  the government alleges the supervisors failed to inspect fuel tanks, knowingly  installed faulty cockpit gauges and improperly maintained landing gears, fuel  systems, automatic pilots and radar. To conceal this conduct, the government  says, they altered work cards and log books and forged other employees' names  to maintenance records.  </P> <P> Vigorous prosecution of such alleged conduct will, as the assistant U.S.  attorney handling the case said, "Send a clear signal not just to Eastern, but  to the entire airline industry." It also ought to send a message to Congress  and the Bush Administration that the government's approach to airline  regulation also is in need of preventive maintenance.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Three major Russian banks are  already working with the national currencies of former Soviet  republics, including the "Rossiiskiy Kredit", "Menatep", and  "Alpha". They are handling cashless settlements and  transactions with the cash money of some republics of the former  USSR. These banks are risking quite a lot, but their main  purpose is to get a foothold on this promising market.    The Central Bank of Russia is constantly stressing that this  is, indeed, a very promising business. It has issued an  instruction, saying that the Russian commercial banks are  permitted to carry out, without any special agreement,  transactions with the national currencies which it quotes.  Today, the Central bank fixes the exchange rates of the  currencies of all the republics of the former USSR, except the  Caucasian states and Turkmenistan.    The recent attempts to effect settlements among the former  Union republics in freely convertible currencies and through  bank correspondence accounts have proved futile. In the  meantime, the need for the active financial interaction of the  new sovereign republics is dictated by their cooperation links  in production, trade, travel, and the need to remit money from  one republic to another. This is why Russian experts  persistently recommend the active use of national currencies in  mutual settlements. What is preventing this? Assistant Head of  the Foreign Transactions Department of the Russian Central Bank  Andrey Vernikov told ITAR-TASS that the work of the national  banks with local currencies was complicated by the high rates of  inflation in the newly independent states, unpredictable  currency regulations, restrictions and bans on export and import  trade. Vernikov and his colleagues believe it is most important  for surmounting these obstacles to guarantee the "smooth work of  the currency market".    "This means," Vernikov explained, "that all the national  currencies should be sold on the markets of each of the newly  independent states. A bilateral union must be concluded to make  our money sell freely in Kazakhstan and vice-versa. The union  becomes multilateral if several such agreements are intertwined.  It may be joined also by the east European states. Russia has  already concluded agreements with the national banks of Bulgaria  and Hungary, allowing their enterprises to effect settlements  with Russian partners and make payments in national currencies.  Poland, Mongolia and Slovakia are displaying interest in such  agreements."    The concept of a payments union was received with  understanding by a recent meeting of representatives from the  central banks of the republics of the former USSR and their  governments. Then it was approved by the heads of CIS  governments, which authorised corresponding bodies to draw up an  agreement on a payments union in accordance with this concept,  which is to be a voluntary association of states, intended to  ensure uninterrupted payments on the basis of mutually  convertible national currencies.    "The implementation of the system of mutual convertibility  of  national currencies of the former republics of the Soviet Union  must without doubt proceed stage by stage. The payments union  may be joined by countries that deem themselves ready to accede  to it and are prepared to assume concrete commitments," the  representative of the Russian Central Bank believes.</p>

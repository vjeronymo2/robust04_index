			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Halifax chief executive named HALIFAX Building Society has completed an eight-month search for a new chief executive by appointing Mr Mike Blackburn (right), chief executive of the Leeds Permanent Building Society, to take over in August. Mr Blackburn, chief executive of the Leeds for the past five years, has attracted controversy by criticising aspects of government policy. He will take over at the Halifax when Mr Jim Birrell, the current chief executive, retires at 60. The appointment of a new chief executive of Halifax has been the subject of much speculation as it is the largest society with assets of Pounds 59bn and it appointed a firm of headhunters last June to aid its search. Mr Jon Foulds, Halifax chairman, was thought to have been seeking an outsider to ensure innovation. Mr Blackburn is respected for having improved Leeds' performance since he joined it from the Access Joint Credit Card Company. Mr Foulds said yesterday that Mr Blackburn was 'ideally placed to build on the culture and values' of the Halifax. He said Mr Blackburn would be 'working with an excellent management team and going forward from an enviable base'. Mr Blackburn is to leave the Leeds, the fifth biggest society with assets of Pounds 16.2bn, at the end of this week and will probably join the Halifax this summer. Leeds announced that Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, would take over as acting chief executive from March 1. The board is expected to consider whether to make the appointment permanent after that.

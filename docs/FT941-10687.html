			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety held back by fall in Pot Noodles Falling sales of Pot Noodles and low pig prices held back interim results at Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group. Pre-tax profits were slightly ahead at Pounds 56.4m, against Pounds 56.2m, in the six months to December 31. Mr Richard Clothier, the new chief executive, said he expected improvement in many areas in the second half. This was underlined by an increase in the interim dividend from 7.85p to 8p, in spite of a 7 per cent fall in earnings per share to 17.2p (18.5p). The shares fell 3p to 487p, holding up against the market. The consumer foods division was affected by the supermarket price war but not severely, according to Mr Clothier, as only half the division's business was with the UK multiple retailers. The division's trading profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 27.5m, with acquisitions contributing Pounds 200,000. A cut in crisp prices at Golden Wonder had been largely recouped through higher volumes and market share. Food ingredients profits rose 21 per cent to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.0m), with Pounds 1.1m of the gain from acquisitions. Food distribution profits were 16 per cent up at Pounds 8.1m, helped by exchange rates, and agribusiness profits were 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 15m, thanks to a Pounds 1.4m contribution from acquisitions. In total, acquisitions added Pounds 1.8m after associated finance costs of Pounds 1m - which offset a Pounds 900,000 reduction from lower interest rates. Together with Pounds 1.1m from the fall in sterling against the dollar and a saving of Pounds 600,000 from the sale of Federal Bakeries, the gains slightly exceeded a Pounds 4.2m reduction in trading profits on a comparable basis. Of this reduction about Pounds 2m was due to Pot snacks - whose figures compared with a strong period when new product launches had boosted volumes - and about Pounds 1m to low pig prices. Mr John Martyn, finance director, said Pounds 80m spent on acquisitions, higher working capital and investment led to a Pounds 99m rise in net debt to Pounds 208m. With a Pounds 50m goodwill write-off, this lifted gearing to 54 per cent. Mr Martyn said this should fall to around 36-38 per cent by the year-end. The tax charge rose from 25 to 30 per cent as the group's surplus ACT was dwindling and profits rose in the higher tax rate areas. Lex, Page 22</p>

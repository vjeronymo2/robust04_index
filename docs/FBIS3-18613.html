The arrest of the Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP)  parliamentarians has caused great concern all over the world.  It is a violation of principles that also have to be observed  by Turkey as a member of the Council of Europe, Fischer said.    The Kurdish problem in Turkey cannot be solved by arresting  deputies and by using the military, but only by looking for  political solutions and by means of negotiations, Fischer  stressed and came out once again against the use of force -- no  matter by which side -- in solving the problems of the Kurds.</p>

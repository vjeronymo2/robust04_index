			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Personal View: A case of cut and thrust - Russia's record of economic management In early 1994, Russia's economic prospects looked bleak. Industrial production and gross domestic product had fallen dramatically, inflation was running at almost 20 per cent a month and there were plans for a costly monetary union with Belarus. Critics said the government had given up on economic reform, an assertion seemingly given new life last week by the dive of the rouble to almost Rbs4,000 to the US dollar. In fact, the Russian authorities have implemented an unprecedented austerity programme during 1994: policymakers have responded to shortfalls in revenue with severe expenditure cuts, and high real interest rates have been maintained. As a result, inflation is at its lowest levels since the economic reforms began and lending by the central bank has been so low that Russia has for the first time met its IMF monetary policy targets. At the same time, economic recovery is under way. One reason for the critics' gloom is the fall in government revenue. Budget revenue has fallen from 29.5 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 1993 to 26.3 per cent in the first half of 1994. This was due to changes in legislation, a profit squeeze as GDP fell and real wages stayed constant, and an increase in tax evasion. However, the response to low revenue was not the widely-expected hike in central bank lending to government. Instead, government expenditure was cut from 35.3 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 1993 to 32.8 per cent in the first half of 1994. This is, by any standards, a serious fiscal austerity programme. It has been matched by successful efforts to increase tax compliance. Another argument raised by critics is that monetary policy has been 'loose' because the central bank is lending to the government at 10 per cent a year, well below market rates. However, the amount of central bank lending to the government is restricted by credit ceilings. Because of these, quarterly central bank lending to government fell over the first half of 1994 from 8.8 per cent of GDP to 7.9 per cent. Meanwhile, lending to other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States has stopped. And lending to commercial banks is at high real interest rates, since the central bank has maintained high real refinance rates since November 1993. The last batch of central bank credits at low interest rates - the so-called 'soft credits' - was allocated in the spring. Since then, soft credits have been counted as part of federal government expenditure and are no longer a source of monetary expansion. True, government borrowing from the Central Bank of Russia rose in July and August. But this was a deliberate move. The government is required by the parliament to make annual expenditure equal to the sum of tax revenues and approved borrowing. In 1992 and 1993, pressures from the former state enterprises and farms led to high levels of borrowing in the fourth quarter and a resurgence in inflation. This time, the government borrowed more in the third quarter to head off lobby pressures. By September nominal borrowing had fallen to half the level of August. The October figures, in line with government targets, are similarly low. Officially agreed credit limits for the fourth quarter are at a record low and could be as little as 3 to 5 per cent of GDP if some borrowing is replaced by sales of governmental currency reserves, as planned. Thanks to such restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, the Russian authorities have met the IMF monetary base target - even with the spring's soft credits and additional borrowing in the third quarter. Despite the higher inflation rates of recent months and the recent collapse of the rouble, annual inflation this year is not expected to exceed 180 per cent, down from over 800 per cent in 1993 and over 2,400 per cent in 1992. Monetary growth at the end of 1994 could average 3 per cent a month - providing ideal conditions for stabilisation in 1995. In spite of this restrictive policy stance, unemployment remains low and a recovery seems under way. Official GDP for August 1994 was 20 per cent higher in constant prices than in January, and 12 per cent higher than in August 1993. Industrial production troughed in May 1994 and has grown by around 1 per cent a month since. These figures are supported by statistics on energy consumption and evidence of a construction boom. What prevents the country from taking off even faster are outstanding reforms in the energy and agricultural sectors, hidden subsidies to powerful lobbies and enterprises, and the failure to make enterprises bankrupt when they have no future. The lack of an institutional framework for investors, such as registers to establish title to land, also means there is a lack of capital. Domestic saving has been low and Russia has remained a net exporter of capital. The government has been working on macro-economic policies for the next 10 years to pay back foreign debt. These include commitments that should help to attract long-term investment. Furthermore, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, rejected the first budget and monetary programme for 1995, which aimed at an average inflation rate of 5 per cent a month. Instead, on October 9, the government, supported by the president, set a budget deficit target for 1995 of 4-5 per cent of GDP. The government plans to finance a large part of this deficit by issuing Treasury bills and with what could well be the last significant injection of foreign credits, rather than through central bank lending to government. At the same time, a stable exchange rate is to be maintained. As a result of these plans, inflation should be down to less than 1 per cent a month by the second half of 1995 and annual inflation is forecast at 27 per cent for 1995. This is the culmination of a two-year policy of a gradual but substantial reduction in inflation. Given economic fundamentals, the government's tough policy, and the increase in the central bank's refinancing rate, the recovery of the rouble after its fall last week is no surprise. The real exchange rate is, in fact, no lower than it was in December 1993. However, last week's rapid devaluation is a warning to policy-makers against any return to loose policies. Genuine exchange rate stability is thus more politically feasible. Russia is on the brink of moving beyond crisis management and could soon be a G8 country with low inflation, low inflationary expectations and low medium-term interest rates.

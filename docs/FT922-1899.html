			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Tax-free letting scheme announced THE government yesterday announced a 'rent-a-room' scheme to encourage householders to let out rooms. The scheme, promised in the Conservative election manifesto, allows rental payments of up to Pounds 3,250 a year to be free of tax. Up to Pounds 62.50 a week of gross rent paid on furnished lettings in the taxpayer's only or main home will be tax-free. If the gross income exceeds Pounds 3,250, the taxpayer can choose to pay tax on the excess (with no allowance for expenses) or to pay tax on the whole profit after deduction of expenses. The tax relief comes into effect this financial year.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> HIGHWAY CLOSED FOR EXCAVATION ON BLUFFS  </P> <P> After several delays, a mile-long section of El Camino Real was closed Monday  as work crews began heavy excavation work on the unstable bluffs edging the  coastal highway.  </P> <P> City officials say the north-south artery into the city will be closed for up  to a month as 310,000 cubic feet of earth are removed from the crumbling  cliffs.  </P> <P> The highway was closed during February when city workers noticed that the  bluffs were riddled with large crevices.  </P> <P> The closure created traffic jams as motorists looked for alternate routes and  merchants located near the barricaded highway complained that their businesses  suffered.  </P> <P> City Manager Michael W. Parness said crews on the project will work six days a  week, 12 hours a day until it is completed.  </P> <P> The project is expected to cost the owner of the area above the highway, the  Lusk Co., a development firm, about $2 million.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, 16 Jun (MAP)--The permanent military court of  the Royal Armed Forces in Rabat has passed jail sentences  ranging from five to 20 years on eight defendants, six of whom  are Moroccans and the other two Algerians, who were all charged  with "violating laws on weapons and ammunition."    After six hours of deliberation, the court sentenced the  defendant Ighiri Hassan to 20 years imprisonment and a 2,000  dirham fine and Abdelouahed Najm to 18 years and a 1,500-dirham  fine. The two Algerian defendants, Hamaz Sa'id and Omar  Cheblal, both received a 15-year jail sentence and a  1,000-dirham fine. Houcine Mouaden was sentenced to 12 years in  prison and a 1,000-dirham fine, and both Kassou Ouali and  Abdelkader Benjilali received a 10-year jail sentence and were  ordered to pay a 1,000-dirham fine. Abdelkader Labsir was  sentenced to five years imprisonment and a 1,000-dirham fine.    The court also ruled in favor of the confiscation of the  weapons, ammunition, equipment, and foreign currency recovered  and the restitution of the other equipment seized, namely a car  and a video camera, to their rightful owners.    In the trial that began on 6 June, the main charges brought  against the defendants included the possession of automatic  weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment. The weapons  and equipment found aboard a French-registered Mercedes car that  had been driven through a number of European countries, all the  way to Spain, and then to Morocco, were destined for individuals  abroad.</p>

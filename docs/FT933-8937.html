			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rise STERLING interest rate futures enjoyed a modest rise yesterday as dealers took the view that the low inflation outlook in the UK made a cut in base rates more likely, writes James Blitz. In its quarterly inflation report published on Tuesday, the Bank of England said that the prospect of underlying inflation dropping to the lower part of the government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next four years was 'within reach'. The Bank was also relatively upbeat about the chances of a strong UK recovery in the first half of this year. Yesterday was the first opportunity that interest rate dealers had to digest the contents of the report. They pushed the September short sterling contract up 5 basis points to a close of 94.26. But traders continued to think there was more likelihood of a base rate cut at the turn of the year, with the December contract closing at 94.76. Nevertheless, one London money market dealer said that, at current levels, the September contract was fairly priced and might be worth buying. Sterling cash markets were quiet. A Pounds 900m shortage was removed with no need for late assistance. Three month money closed more or less unchanged at 5.78 per cent. European markets were dominated by the second cut this week in the Bank of France's overnight rate of lending, this time from 9.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent. The  1/2 percentage point cut confirmed the French central bank's policy of slowly easing monetary policy in the wake of the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands. But it led to a very strong rise in the September French franc interest rate contract, up 27 basis points to close at 93.38. Three month money fell by 0.40 percentage points from 8 per cent to 7.60 per cent. The Bundesbank yesterday surprised some market participants by adding a net DM10.3bn of liquidity in its weekly money market operation, instead of draining funds in the wake of the recent intervention in support of the French franc. With a fixed rate repo set at 6.80 per cent this week, that should ensure that call money fluctuates between 6.80 per cent and 7 per cent over the next week. Call money was yesterday hovering at around 6.81 per cent for most of the day.</p>

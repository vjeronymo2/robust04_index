			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Bechtel in Chinese port venture Bechtel of the US and China International Trust and Investment Company yesterday set up a joint venture to expedite the multi-billion dollar development of port facilities and services at Daxie island south of Shanghai. Citic, China's largest investment conglomerate, last year secured the right to develop the 31 sq km island as a gateway to China's central provinces. It plans to spend about Dollars 500m on Daxie's basic infrastructure, with expected investment from the private sector of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 6bn over the next 15 years. Daxie will offer 40 berths for container and petroleum cargo vessels in excess of 200,000 tonnes. Annual capacity will be 5m containers and an overall 100m tonnes of cargo. Investment opportunities will include petroleum and chemical processing; storage and trans-shipment facilities; industrial and high-technology manufacturing; commercial and residential site development; and privatised infrastructure. The Bechtel-Citic joint venture - Xinde Joint Development Company - will serve as a marketing, operating and services organisation for Daxie, which is situated 140km south of Shanghai and lies 600 metres offshore. A railway and highway will connect the island with the mainland and the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan, which have been disadvantaged by poor transport links with the outside world. International companies are reported to have shown a keen interest and are expected to conclude agreements for 'first phase' projects by early next year. Mr Riley Bechtel, president of the Bechtel Group, said Bechtel was involved in other large projects, including Jubail in Saudi Arabia. It was also a consultant for the new Hong Kong airport at Chek Lap Kok. Bechtel and Citic established a joint engineering consultancy in the early 1980s.</p>

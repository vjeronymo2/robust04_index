			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Defence quietens music at Thorn Thorn EMI yesterday announced half-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 105m, in line with City expectations, but its shares fell 35p to 914p. Investor dissatisfaction arose from a poor showing from the defence electronics business, which Thorn failed to sell to the General Electric Company earlier this year. An operating loss of Pounds 14.7m in the technology subsidiary, compared with a Pounds 1.4m loss last time, overshadowed strong performances from the main music and rental businesses. The technology subsidiary includes defence and commercial electronics activities and security. The pre-tax figure for the six months to September 30, virtually unchanged from Pounds 105.2m last time, included exceptional costs of Pounds 10m, most of which arose from the sale of Thorn lighting and of Thames Television. Total turnover was up slightly to Pounds 2.1bn from Pounds 1.9bn. Some investors were upset at the group's conservative dividend policy. The interim payout was a maintained 9p on earnings per share of 13.8p, against 16.6p. The group said the final dividend would be increased at least in line with inflation. Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst at Smith New Court, focused on the defence losses. He said: 'The defence business let the side down. People expected the loss to be a lot smaller. If you're in Thorn, you're in Thorn for music and rental, but these other businesses keep getting in the way.' Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, agreed that the continued presence of the defence business made it difficult for investors to concentrate on music and rentals. He said the question of demerging the music and rental arms could not be addressed until the defence business had been sold. He said, however, that Thorn had demonstrated over the past few years that it would not sell its defence business for less than the group thought it was worth. Operating profits at EMI Music grew 48.3 per cent to Pounds 89.9m, aided by a strong performance from Virgin, which Thorn purchased from Mr Richard Branson last year. Sir Colin said Virgin had now been fully integrated into the group, except in Spain, where Thorn was building a new distribution centre. Rental operating profits were up 17.7 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Sir Colin said the group was confident it had the right procedures in place to deal with any malpractice at Rent-A-Center, its US rental subsidiary. He said that Mr Warren Rudman, the former US Senator investigating newspaper allegations of unorthodox money collection at the subsidiary, would recommend ways in which the procedures could be strengthened.

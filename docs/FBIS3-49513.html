			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech </F> President Vaclav Havel with an unidentified moderator at Prague  Castle -- live]    [Text] [Moderator] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech President Vaclav Havel  have just finished their talks, which lasted 45 minutes. They  are prepared to make short statements and after that they will  answer two questions. I would like to ask President Havel to  make his statement.    [Havel] I would like to say that the Czech Republic is  extremely honored by the visit of the U.S. President as well as  by the fact that Prague was chosen as the location of the  meeting with the representatives of neighboring countries.    During the talks we had either as delegations or  individually, we made it clear that the Czech Republic welcomes  the Partnership for Peace project and is ready to immediately  start giving this project a concrete content. The Czech  Republic considers this project to be well-balanced and good.    At the same time, we expressed our will to cooperate with  our  neighbors. We noted the similarity of our stances with our  neighbors, and we stressed that we also attach great importance  to regional cooperation.    We discussed several other topics, including economic  cooperation. On behalf of the Czech side this is all for the  time being.    [Clinton, in English with simultaneous Czech translation]  First I want to express my thanks to President Havel for his  warm welcome. I am paying only my second visit to Prague. I  was here 24 years ago in the same week but in a totally  different role. The progress that Prague and the Czech Republic  have made has made a great impression on me. Likewise, my  conversions and meetings with your president, prime minister,  and other representatives have also made a great impression on  me.    I confirmed that the security of this republic and other  members of Central and Eastern Europe is very significant for  the security of the United States and European countries as well  as of the Atlantic alliance. The Partnership for Peace is the  beginning of a genuine security relationship which could lead to  full membership in NATO.    Of course, we must also think about the economic dimension  of  security. Without this, it would be difficult to achieve good  policy and develop genuinely democratic relations in the name of  the success of nations in all Partnership countries and the  development of society. We have been talking about these  things; further talks await us tomorrow, when we will talk,  perhaps in more specific terms, about how to attain these aims.  In any case, I thank President Havel for his support for  Partnership for Peace.    [Moderator] Your questions, please. Czech Television, [name  indistinct].    [Question] I am [name indistinct] from Czech Television.  Gentlemen, do you think any East European country could join  NATO ahead of the rest?    [Havel] We interpret Partnership for Peace as a door open to  all, but, of course, a lot will depend on each individual just  how soon he passes through that door. This projects wants to  deal with each country individually.    [Clinton] This issue has not been resolved. [Passage  indistinct] As regards Partnership for Peace, one has to  emphasize that with immediate effect it will provide for joint  exercises, joint preparation of the armed forces, and joint  solutions to a number of issues which could lead to full  membership.    [Moderator] [Word indistinct], please.    [Question] [passage indistinct]    [Interpreter] Apologies from the interpreter. I can't hear  the question.    [Havel] Developments in the Russian Federation have been  complex, dramatic, and painful and we are naturally following  them most attentively. But we firmly believe that in the  Russian Federation too, democracy and the market economy will  gradually prevail, despite all the complex stages and episodes  of this development.    [Moderator] The presidents have a further program ahead of  them. Thank you for your questions and your attention. Good  bye.</p>

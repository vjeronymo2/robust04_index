			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pacific BBA stands firm on bid price for Siddons PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday said it would not increase its ADollars 88m (USDollars 59m) takeover offer for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group. The announcement leaves the field clear for a rival bid by WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group, which has offered shareholders ADollars 94m. Mr Graham Kraehe, Pacific BBA managing director, said the company's ADollars 1.81 a share offer would remain open, but would not be increased or extended beyond the existing deadline of January 27. Mr Kraehe said the offer was 'good for the share-holders of both companies, but any increase would not necessarily be in the best interests of Pacific BBA shareholders'. He said Pacific BBA intended to pursue other expansion plans with an Asian focus. 'It is important that we allocate our resources where we expect to gain the best long-term benefits,' he said. The WA Deutsher offer is conditional on 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders. It has been rejected by Siddons' board.</p>

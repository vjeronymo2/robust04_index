			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE BOARD URGES FIRING OF OFFICER IN BAR BRAWL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police board has recommended the firing of a patrol sergeant who  was involved in a brawl last year in a Burbank restaurant during which he and  several other off-duty officers fought with patrons and employees.  </P> <P> A six-day Board of Rights hearing ended Thursday with Sgt. Christopher Bonilla,  32, being found guilty on three counts of misconduct, Police Cmdr. William  Booth said.  </P> <P> The board recommended to Chief Daryl F. Gates that Bonilla be fired.  </P> <P> A Board of Rights hearing is similar to a court trial but is presided over by a  panel of three high-ranking officers.  </P> <P> Gates is expected to act on the recommendation next week. He can choose to fire  Bonilla or take a lesser disciplinary action.  </P> <P> "The board makes the decision of guilty or not guilty," Booth said. "He was  found guilty of all three counts. The decision is now the chief's."  </P> <P> The disciplinary action stems from a fight on May 10, 1989, in the bar of the  Black Angus restaurant at 235 S. 1st St.  </P> <P> Burbank police said the brawl started after a patron, Robert Martinez, 29, of  Burbank walked by a table where six off-duty officers were sitting and knocked  over a bottle of beer.  </P> <P> A shouting match followed and the officers began fighting with Martinez. Police  said two cocktail waitresses, two bouncers and a bartender joined in.  </P> <P> During the fight, police said Martinez was dragged outside by the officers and  kicked while he was on the ground.  </P> <P> Three of the officers -- Bonilla, Oscar Jiminez and Arthur Placentia -- pleaded  guilty to disturbing the peace in February and were fined $470 each.  </P> <P> Bonilla, who was originally charged with battery, was also placed on three  years probation.  </P> <P> None of the bar employees were charged with any crime.  </P> <P> Bonilla, who was relieved of duty without pay, was charged with three counts of  misconduct because an internal affairs investigation found that he had been  drinking, had made threats during the incident and had kicked Martinez.  </P></p>

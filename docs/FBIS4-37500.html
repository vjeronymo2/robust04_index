			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Excerpt] Israel will propose that the PLO to extend the  civilian activity of the Palestinian police force to the entire  West Bank as part of the early empowerment to be discussed soon.  A recommendation in this spirit is included in a study  conducted by Major General Dani Rothschild. Our political  correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] The next stage of the  negotiations with the PLO will begin soon, and its highlight  will be the early empowerment of Palestinians in the West Bank  in five civilian spheres. The PLO has not yet made up its mind  what and how much it wants from Israel. Nabil Sha'th spoke in  very general terms about this issue in his meeting with Amnon  Shahaq two days ago.    The staff work in anticipation of the negotiations is  coordinated by Maj. Gen. Rothschild, the coordinator of  activities in the territories. We have learned that the staff  work, conducted in conjunction with the General Staff's Planning  Branch, includes a recommendation to enable a Palestinian police  or another Palestinian policing force to operate in the entire  West Bank.    Knesset Member Ori Or today confirmed the existence of such  a  recommendation.    [Or] I do not want to go into too much detail, but we are  talking about one of the five main issues which will be  transferred to the Palestinians, which is taxation. Although  there is yet nothing definite, when we talk about taxation that  means that somebody must enforce it. I think it is also in our  best interest to agree that the body dealing with taxation  should possess the tools and the ability to collect the money.  This body will need a police force -- we shall call it that for  the sake of this argument -- to enforce taxation.    [Rosen] The staff work, which will soon be submitted to the  prime minister, includes several suggestions for cooperation  between this police force and the Israel Police and security  forces.

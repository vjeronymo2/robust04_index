			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> IT'S TOO LATE TO TRADE FOR A PASS RUSHER  </P> <P> With the Oct. 16 trading deadline approaching and defensive players at a  premium, Ram Coach John Robinson said he doubts a deal can be made for the pass  rusher they need.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're going to make any trades; we would not disrupt ourselves  at this point," Robinson said.  </P> <P> "We've got to come up with the solutions ourselves.  </P> <P> "No one wants to trade a good player. And nobody really wants to trade a good  defensive player, particularly a good defensive lineman."  </P> <P> Robinson was interested when he heard that the San Francisco 49ers, needing a  running back because Roger Craig is sidelined with a knee injury, are  reportedly making offers for the Raiders' Marcus Allen.  </P> <P> "Well, it's none of my business," Robinson said about the 49ers' interest in  Allen. "I don't have any comment on it. As the President says, I can't comment  on speculation." But when Robinson was asked if Allen seems to fit the 49ers'  offensive scheme, he just nodded his head and quietly said, "I think so, yes."  </P> <P> Injury Report: Ram wide receiver Aaron Cox, whose troublesome hamstring put him  on the deactivated list last week, should be able to play Sunday night against  the Bears. Defensive tackle Alvin Wright was kept out of practice because of a  sore knee. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

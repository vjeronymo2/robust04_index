			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to revamp diamond sector THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday approved a blueprint for reorganising the country's diamond industry that could cause further damage to the country's already troubled relationship with the De Beers cartel. Among other things, the blueprint foresees the creation of a Federal Diamond Centre which would give parliament ultimate control over the diamond industry, including the country's international dealings. Mr Leonid Gurevich, the deputy who steered the project through parliament, has frequently complained about Russia's arrangements with De Beers, which allows it to sell only 5 per cent of its rough diamonds independently of De Beers. He has also said that the independent sales, stipulated by an agreement that expires in 1995, are limited by the fact that they are held in Moscow.</p>

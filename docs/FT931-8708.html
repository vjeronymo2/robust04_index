			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Institute advances 'opt-out' pensions THE GOVERNMENT could allow people to 'contract out' of the basic state pension without breaking its manifesto pledges, the free-market Adam Smith Institute says today, Ralph Atkins writes. Setting out plans for extending the government's privatisation programme, the institute says the state pension is poor value for many people. It also calls for greater choice when council services are privatised. The institute says, as an example, that contracts for refuse collection could be given to two companies - with each paid according to how many local people chose their service. Citizens, not just local authorities, would then be making decisions about services, the think tank argues. The report comes as the government embarks on its wide-ranging review of public spending. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has said no areas are sacred, but has promised to honour 1992 election pledges. On pensions the Tory manifesto said: 'The basic state retirement pension will remain the foundation for retirement.' But the institute says the basic state pension could remain for those who did not want to provide their own, so its proposals would 'in no way contradict the government's manifesto pledge'.</p>

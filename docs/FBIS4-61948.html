			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 10 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Boris  Yeltsin of Russia signed a federal law 8 May "On the status of a  deputy of the Federation Council and the status of a deputy of  the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly." In  this connection the president of Russia also sent a letter to  deputies of the Federation Council and the State Duma. The text  of this document, which was released by the presidential press  service today, follows:    "Esteemed deputies!    "Today I signed the federal law `On the status of a deputy  of  the Federation Council and the status of a deputy of the State  Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly'.    "This was a difficult decision, in as far as some juridical  aspects evidently require further revision and some are not in  line with the Constitution; and there are prerequisites which  the electorate could justifiably condemn.    "But there is something else I understand, too: you and your  aides need of the law as a whole, it is necessary for effective  legislative work.    "At the same time I understand that we need to live not only  in accord with one another, but also in accord with the  Constitution and the law. I am therefore following up this  letter with a list of amendments which would have been submitted  to you had I rejected the law. As guarantor of the  Constitution, I propose you should suspend the validity of those  normative acts which contravene the Constitution. Following  this, I believe it to be necessary to examine the proposals  submitted, including those which fall within the context of  conciliation procedures, and to adopt these as amendments to the  law currently in effect without waiting for decisions of the  Constitutional Court.    "I regard this decision as one of the steps toward  implementing the Treaty on Public Accord. I therefore believe  it is necessary to make this letter public.    "Esteemed deputies! I am counting on your wisdom and  understanding, and I hope for further fruitful cooperation."    [Signed] B. Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricio Gonzalez from the "Informative Antenna" </F> newscast]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The government is making its  first assessments of the situation of the nationwide strike.  Government Minister Marcelo Santos Vera expressed a few minutes  ago that it is not necessary to declare a state of mobilization  [estado de mobilizacion] in the country, because protests have  not been violent. He said the situation is calm -- a view we do  not share. Let us listen:    [Begin recording] [Santos] We are receiving constant reports  on the strike. Obviously, the situation is not normal. Urban  transportation has been largely reduced in some of the most  important cities of the country. There are demonstrations.  There is uncertainty. Nevertheless, I do not think this should  take us to the extreme point of thinking about more drastic  measures.    [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct]    [Santos] Not so far. As the situation now stands, there is  no reason to decree a mobilization. We do not know the plans of  the FUT [United Workers Front] leaders. I hope that in response  to appeals from government officials and media representatives,  they conduct their protests peacefully. [passage omitted]</p>

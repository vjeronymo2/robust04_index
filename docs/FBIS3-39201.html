			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Khol, foreign policy spokesman of </F> the Austrian People's Party and executive secretary of the  European Democratic Union: "Austria Negotiates All Obstacles in  Its Path"]    [Text] Austria applied to join Europe in July 1989 -- when  the Cold War and the iron curtain still divided the continent.  It was a logical step for a country which had always felt in  tune with the goals and objectives of western democracies.    Today Austria is on the last lap of an exhausting marathon  to  become a full member of the European Union [EU]. Despite some  remaining pitfalls, the signs are that membership will be won at  the beginning of 1995.    Before then, however, there is much work to be done and time  is running out. A great deal is at stake and failure would  result in a serious setback for the EU and the other European  Free Trade Association applicants. It would also adversely  affect the hopes of the new democracies of central and eastern  Europe.    On the positive side, Austria has negotiated satisfactory  terms with the EU which allow it to retain its higher  environmental standards. It is also to continue its antinuclear  policy. This is especially important to an electorate who, in  1978, voted against commissioning a nuclear reactor near Vienna.    In addition, agreement has been reached on the regional fund  and relative financial benefits. Arrangements with Japan worth  62 billion schillings ($5bn) on Austrian-made components in  imported Japanese cars have also been confirmed.    The Austrian interpretation that Maastricht is compatible  with neutrality has also been accepted. Austria adopted  permanent neutrality in a constitutional law passed by  parliament in 1955.    This means it will never accede to military alliances, nor  permit the establishment of foreign military bases on her  territory.    Most Austrians associate neutral status with peace,  stability  and prosperity. With the end of the Cold War, neutrality cannot  have the same meaning as in the past, nor offer the same  guarantees of security for the future.    With the prospect of increasing regional and ethnic  conflicts  Austria's position is more vulnerable than ever. Its security  can be found only within the framework of a common policy with  the European Union.    As regards EU membership, Austria will agree to join the  West  European Union [WEU] as an observer. It is keen to develop  comprehensive security arrangements emerging out of the EU, WEU,  NATO and CSCE. Austria intends to make a full contribution and  to show solidarity with its partners.    Despite this progress, some hard-core issues are yet to be  settled. The most delicate of these relate to agriculture,  secondary residences and transit traffic.    Several problems remain. Does the internal market come into  effect immediately on entry or will Austrian produce and markets  be granted a transitional period? The government is pushing for  a transition of four years because there are adaptation problems  for many farmers who would go to the wall, or have to be  supported by generous subsidies. The question is whether the EU  would be prepared to share the burden. Austria will be a net  contributor to EU coffers and a suitable arrangement seems  likely.    The second agricultural problem concerns quotas for future  Austrian production in the Union, namely beef, milk, sugar,  pork, wine, wheat and other agricultural products. On this the  EU has so far failed to make a satisfactory offer. A solution  will probably be found.    On the delicate issue of transit traffic, the EU must agree  to continue with the present valid agreement. Secondary  residences is more a psychological than an economic or political  question. Here one has to respect the Alpine people's wishes  not to be submerged or destroyed by rich city people.    These last points are essential preconditions if the  government is to go ahead with a referendum, which could take  place on 12 June. Austria is prepared to negotiate beyond the  March deadline and even into the autumn to achieve the best deal  for its farmers and the Tyroleans. This is vital not only for  their well-being but also for a positive outcome to the  referendum. If the coalition government of Social Democrats and  Christian Democrats feels its conditions have not been met and  the referendum is likely to go against membership, it would  prefer to wait. Much hinges on Austria, because then Sweden and  Finland would be unable to organise their own referendums.    Austrian negotiators, however, are optimistic all will work  out on the day. Polls show a consistent, albeit narrow, pro-EU  majority. They show that Europe is now seen as the most  important Austrian issue -- above immigration, jobs and  terrorism.    Pundits are predicting a 55 percent majority in favour of  Europe, but many voters are still undecided and the government  cannot count its chickens before they hatch. The small Green  Party is divided, but opposed to Maastricht. Joerg Haider's  Freedom Party is difficult to assess. The new Liberal Party is  pro-European.    Come 28 February, exhausted negotiators will sign an  agreement with the EU. It is inconceivable that this will  falter over 50,000 tonnes of milk, or six or nine years for  transit traffic, or ECU50 million more or less of subsidies.  After June, Austria can look forward to becoming a full member  of a united Europe -- which is where it has always belonged.</p>

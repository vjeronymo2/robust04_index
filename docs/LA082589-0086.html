			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TO SEND MANY RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES TO LOW-LEVEL RURAL JOBS  </P> <P> As part of a crackdown aimed at enforcing ideological discipline on China's  restive youth, recent university graduates holding positions with the central  government are to be transferred to low-level provincial or rural jobs for up  to two years, according to Chinese sources.  </P> <P> The transfer order, reminiscent of the massive exile to the countryside of  intellectuals and some factions of the youthful Red Guards in the late 1960s,  is said to be intended to increase awareness of China's economic and social  realities among the nation's future elite.  </P> <P> But the new regulations -- which are to apply to all people working in  government or Communist Party jobs at the national level who graduated in or  after 1985 -- also provide a method of demanding ideological orthodoxy from  members of a generation that generally favors rapid relaxation of political  controls.  </P> <P> It is also possible that the order may be selectively enforced, with the  harshest consequences falling on those perceived as critical of the hard-line  leaders now in control of China's government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Backed Demonstrations  </P> <P> Many young employees of central government ministries supported the  pro-democracy student demonstrations that took place in Beijing this spring.  The protests were suppressed with hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths the  weekend of June 3-4 when the Chinese army was ordered to clear demonstrators  from Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> One Chinese official, quoted this week by the Hongkong Standard in an article  about the new policy, said that job prospects "after working at the grass-roots  level for two or three years" will depend "on their work and, most importantly,  their political stand."  </P> <P> Young people will be judged for promotion at the end of this period largely on  whether they have displayed support for the principles of socialism and  Communist Party rule, the official said.  </P> <P> The order, which has been passed to government and party institutions over the  last several weeks, has provoked intense anxiety among many of those likely to  be affected by it. Some of the people ordered to grass-roots-level jobs are  expected to be required to transfer their residence registration from Beijing  to provincial towns. It can be extremely difficult to regain official  permission to live in the capital, or in other major cities, having once lost  urban registration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Still in Countryside  </P> <P> While most of the Red Guards sent to the countryside in the late 1960s have now  returned to their cities of birth, a significant minority have never been able  to get approval to move back.  </P> <P> Under the new order, it appears that most of those sent to new jobs will work  in lower-level government or enterprise offices, or in factories.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether any of the recent college graduates will be ordered to  work alongside peasants in villages, but some of those who are aware of the  order fear that this could happen.  </P> <P> One young employee made half-joking reference to these fears when the new order  was announced to a group of workers in a central government office.  </P> <P> "Don't worry, we'll protect you -- we'll say you're a 1984 graduate," the  employee's older colleagues said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Be Raising Pigs at 60  </P> <P> "It's all right," the more recent graduate said, in an attempt to be  lighthearted. "I can see myself when I'm 60 years old, raising pigs and being  the village party leader."  </P> <P> But after drinking beer at a party later that evening, this same person broke  into tears and said: "What's the point in living? I can't go on anymore. If I'm  sent to a village, I can't go on living."  </P> <P> It has long been part of Chinese Communist ideology that intellectuals should  increase their sense of unity with the masses by performing manual labor. This  principle was carried to an extreme during the chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural  Revolution, when not only student Red Guards but educated people of all  professions and many Communist Party officials were required to perform manual  labor in factories or work in the countryside planting rice and raising pigs.  </P> <P> For the past decade, China's leaders have held that educated people must be  allowed to concentrate on developing technical skills to contribute to the  nation's modernization. But there have also been periodic attempts at promoting  the idea that technical competence must be combined with political reliability.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, education officials made plans to require all college  graduates to spend a year at grass-roots-level jobs before joining central  government agencies, but the rule was never enforced.  </P> <P> Preparations to enforce the new order appear to be moving forward. This week's  edition of Culture News, published by the Ministry of Culture, said that  college graduates assigned to work in the ministry must first join in special  study sessions and then spend one to two years working in state-run enterprises  under the ministry's control.  </P> <P> The ministry newspaper said that the residence registration of the recent  graduates will be transfered from Beijing to their new places of employment and  that those who do not perform well will not be able to return to ministry jobs  in the capital.  </P> <P> In a similar order announced earlier this month applying to another category of  young people, the State Education Commission ruled that most of this year's  college graduates who intend to pursue post-graduate study must spend one or  two years working before resuming their studies.  </P> <P> Nick Driver, The Times' research assistant in Beijing, contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Business Law: Burning question of unfairness In few countries is 'fair' such a hallowed concept as in the UK. Indeed, this English word has been adopted in most languages as a convenient label for behaving in good faith and without seeking undue advantage from a stronger bargaining position or exploiting technicalities of law. Yet English law is almost alone in not recognising a general and overriding duty of performing contracts in good faith and fairly, a principle which is of crucial importance in the legal systems of all civil law countries and of a number of common law countries, including the US, Australia and New Zealand. An optimistic view of this dichotomy has been best expressed by Lord Justice Bingham in 1989 in the case of Interphoto Library v Stilleto. After pointing out that the civil law principle of good faith means a great deal more than that the parties ought not to deceive each other, he said: 'English law has, characteristically, committed itself to no such overriding principle but has developed solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.' To this one must add that it does not do so always and that many such burning problems of unfairness remain unanswered. These problems are likely to become less tolerable after the ratification by the UK of the UN Convention on International Contracts for the Sale of Goods. This convention, which came into force on January 1 1988, has now been ratified by 30 states, including all leading trading partners of the UK. Seven more are in the process of ratifying it and, in a year or two, the total number of ratifications is expected to reach 50. Although the traditionalist faction of UK's legal establishment is opposed to it - partly because the convention, like all products of compromise, has a number of weaknesses, and partly because of an irrational fear of novelties - ratification by the UK appears to be almost unavoidable for the simple reason of business expediency. In deference to the feelings of the UK's negotiators, the convention does not say explicitly that contracts governed by it must be interpreted and performed in good faith, but it achieves almost the same result by providing (in Art. 7/1) that it should be interpreted with regard to the need '. . . to promote . . . the observance of good faith in international trade'. Once it is ratified, the convention will provide for international contracts of sale governed by English law - as it already does for contracts governed by laws of 30 other jurisdictions - common rules likely to enhance the certainty of the contract clauses and the correct understanding of them by sellers and buyers trading in different countries. The weaknesses of the convention need not cause any alarm as the parties will have the possibility of opting out of the convention or, better still, to supplement it by incorporating into their contracts standard terms of their own choice. One such set of terms, designed for this purpose, will shortly be published by the Centre for Commercial Law Studies of the Queen Mary and Westfield College in London. There is yet another reason why one should not be shy of the convention. The resurgence of masochistic traditionalism among English judges, which followed the retirement of Lord Denning, is now receding. It is being reversed by the ascendancy of judges who look beyond the narrow confines of English law and are guided by Lord Reid's 1963 dictum that 'the common law ought never to produce a wholly unreasonable result . . . '. This new generation includes, but is not limited to, Lord Griffith and Lord Goff in the House of Lords, Lord Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justices Bingham and Steyn in the Court of Appeal, and by Chancery judges represented by Mr Justice Warner and Mr Justice Hoffmann. There are many more, and this narrow selection of names reflects only a relatively small number of decisions which have caught the public's attention recently. As a rule, the views of judges must be gleaned from their judgments as they are not much given to public speaking. However, one of them, Lord Justice Steyn did speak up recently on the hot subject of the role which good faith and fair dealing have in contract law, when delivering the 1991 Royal Bank of Scotland Law Lecture at the University of Oxford. The straitjacket of the medieval literal interpretation of contract clauses has been despised for centuries and the struggle of English judges to loosen it found a reflection in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice: Portia is the portrait of an ideal English judge. Had she been really Venetian, she would have had no need to seek an artificial construction of the contract; in real Venice, influenced by Roman law, Shylock's petition would have been thrown out without much ado, seeing that the contract was contra bonos mores, and could not be performed in good faith. It is because these two notions are still anathema to traditionalists that judges, who do not want to preface their judgment by the hateful phrase 'with the greatest regret . . . ', have to, Portia-like, force the facts so as to achieve a just result in spite of the ridiculously rigid doctrine. Relying on his experience in the resolution of international trade disputes, Lord Justice Steyn concluded that by using a roundabout route an English Court reached, as a rule, the same result as a foreign court applying the principle of good faith, but that ' . . . in a number of cases the rule requiring good faith has enabled the foreign court to adjust relations between the parties more equitably than an English court in similar circumstances'. The striving for a fair and just solution, notably by Lord Denning during his long tenure of the office of the Master of the Rolls, led to piecemeal introduction of the concept of good faith and fair dealing in the statutory law, particularly by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. It is ironical that the one contract requiring under common law 'the utmost good faith' from both parties, has been excluded from the impact of this statute by the operation of the powerful insurance lobby. Lord Mansfield, one of the most European of English judges (he was a Scot), attempted in 1766 to extend the requirement of utmost good faith to all contracts. His view was soon rejected and the label of 'utmost good faith' remains attached only to the contract of insurance. But even here, as Lord Justice Steyn pointed out, the label does not correspond to reality. This misleading description is attached to what is probably the largest body of contracts in which businesses as well as individual citizens face a party with an incomparably greater financial muscle than they possess and which may easily bring financial ruin on those who take it to court. The scales were loaded against the insured by the Court of Appeal in the 1984 case of Container Transport Inc v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting, when it was held that repudiation of the contract of insurance by the insurer is justified by any non-disclosure of relevant facts which the insurer would take into account even if it was so minor and innocent that it would not affect his decision. This ruling was based on the restatement of common law in the Marine Insurance Act 1906, but, as Lord Justice Steyn pointed out, it was equally applicable outside marine insurance law. 'It is difficult to understand,' he said, 'why an underwriter should be able to avoid a contract for non-disclosure, when he would have written the risk anyway. . . . Moreover, how can avoidance on grounds of a non-disclosure, which was causally irrelevant . . . be squared with the proposition that the parties owe each other reciprocal duties of utmost good faith? And why should an insured's position under a contract of utmost good faith be less favourable than under the general law of misrepresentation which requires proof of actual inducement?' Why is this part of the English insurance law so difficult to reconcile with duties of good faith and fair dealing? Victtorin Cornel ze Vsehrd, a 16th century Czech jurist, provided the answer: 'Law is a thin cobweb, a beetle breaks through but a fly is caught.'

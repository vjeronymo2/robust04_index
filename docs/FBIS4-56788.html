			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro by Caribbean </F> Broadcasting Union reporter Sharon Marshall in Barbados, date  not given; Marshall in English with simultaneous translation  into Spanish; Castro in Spanish with simultaneous translation  into English -- recorded]    [Text] [Marshall] Comandante, your presence here in  Barbados is an indication of the importance you attach to the UN  Global Conference. Now that it is over, how would you evaluate  its success?    [Castro] I believe this conference is but the continuation  of  the Rio de Janeiro conference. The Rio conference was extremely  important because it helped build an awareness about  environmental issues. Politicians are not usually very well  informed about these issues. I think that for the first time in  Rio, politicians faced up to the tragedy that degradation of the  environment means to the world. I would say they were in the  process of learning at that time, but at this conference, I  would say there was a greater awareness among the politicians as  well as a greater awareness among the industrial nations, more  than in Rio, and in a rather short period of time.    Of course, the politicians from the small island states were  more aware than anyone else at the Rio conference. I remember we  had acted as contact between members of our delegation and  representatives of those small islands. They were truly  anguished over the future prospects for their islands because of  climatic changes, warming of the atmosphere, the frequency of  hurricanes, and drought. All these are real phenomena that we  are witnessing, and they constitute a question of natural life  or death for these nations. I was able to perceive in Rio that  they needed something, they needed to strive to obtain some hope.    Because they are isolated, these countries also have many  economic problems. They are small countries, although they have  large areas of sea. Communications are very difficult. It takes  over 20 hours to travel from Samoa, near New Zealand; or from  here to Barbados. It takes over 20 hours of flight. Maritime  communications are very complicated. They do not have  communication -- practically none. If a natural phenomenon  occurs, it is a national disaster. It is not like a hurricane  hitting Florida. A strong hurricane can hit Florida, but the  rest of the country is enormous. It does not ruin the country.  But to a small Caribbean island, a hurricane can mean ruin.    To this, we can add the fact that since that hurricane that  I  said hit Florida, insurance policies have been going up to 500  percent. A very adverse combination of factors have been  affecting these small island states. Moreover, their waters are  being polluted. They are polluted by petroleum residues spread  by tankers, and by solid and nuclear wastes. If the Third World  has a tragedy, the tragedy of these small island states is three  times greater. This was reflected in the conference. Each and  every one of them raised its own problems with great  seriousness. It was really dramatic in some cases the way they  described their problems, such as with St. Kitts and Nevis, the  Marshall Islands, and other islands. They said that if the sea  level rises only three meters, the islands will disappear. They  addressed the conference with great sincerity and great passion.  I think they reflected the hope that the world will take care of  them. I think this conference was very successful, both the  Barbados Declaration and the action plan. There was a very  strong appeal, and I observed among the industrialized nations a  greater awareness, a growing awareness, more than I could  perceive in Rio. I could perceive some changes in the positions  of the United States, positions they did not hold in Rio. In  general, the donor countries have demonstrated more  understanding. For this reason, I believe a step forward has  been taken, and this conference will be of great benefit to the  small islands.    [Marshall] But a great deal has been said about the fact  that  the industrialized nations, the donor countries, were not highly  represented. How optimistic are you that small countries will  get the kind of financial assistance they need to improve their  situation?    [Castro] To the extent that we work, to the extent that we  denounce all these problems, to the extent that we act upon  these issues in international forums, and to the extent that we  try to bring public opinion over to our side, we shall get more  help.    The industrialized countries, as a rule, have not been very  generous. The famous percentage of gross product they were to  contribute to development has never been met. There are a few of  those countries that take more generous positions, countries  that have provided up to 1 percent of their Gross Domestic  Product for assistance, but the richest and the more powerful  ones have not.    We must continue striving with the United States and  hammering on these issues, especially concerning pollution in  general, and environmental problems because these are not just  imaginary threats. These are real threats. Our own generation is  already witnessing how the environment is changing, how the  waters are warming up, how hurricanes are more intense, droughts  more intensive. We are all witnessing this. Scientists have  mathematically proven that this is a reality. But there is  selfishness.    I would like to say something else, if I may. I would say  that selfishness is intrinsic to the system, to the system that  is prevailing in the world today, known by the name of  capitalism. I hope to be forgiven for using this word. This is  an time of euphoria, but those immensely rich countries are  doomed to grow. If they do not grow, they fail, they cannot  survive. But if they grow, they deplete the natural resources of  the world, and those countries that are just now beginning to  grow are posing a greater problem because they are not  increasing the number of jobs.    Many of those countries need to grow at a rate of 4 percent  annually in order to create one job. That is why I consider it a  system with no future. How can the matter of sustainable  development be explained if the underdeveloped nations need to  grow, have the right to grow, while the overindustrialized  countries do not need more wealth than they already have. What  they need is to redistribute what they have. We need to defend  the concept of redistribution of wealth in the world because  when you think of it, Bangladesh has over 120 million  inhabitants, and in 20 more years, will have 200 million. It is  one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and  with very low land. What will happen to Bangladesh if the sea  level rises? But there are small nations like Switzerland -- I  have nothing against Switzerland. It is a country with very  positive attributes, but it has a gross per capita income of  $34,000, while Bangladesh has approximately $210. Switzerland  has a gross per capita income 200 times that of Bangladesh.    Why do such wealthy countries need to continue growing? Why  must the philosophy be one of continuous growth rather than  better distribution? Why not distribute the wealth of the world  in a better way, since the world is one big family? Why do they  not distribute it among the countries that need to develop? They  cannot continue with this insane race toward development because  in addition to depleting the natural resources of the world,  they will also deplete the resources of mankind. Cooperation is  needed more than ever, and that is something that should be  said. In the few minutes that I used for my address, I mentioned  that problem because the differences between rich and poor are  increasing. For 40 years, we have heard talk about narrowing the  gap, but that gap has grown; it has widened.    It was believed that with the end of the Cold War, the arms  race would disappear. But the arms race goes on. The great  powers continue producing sophisticated weapons, and the weapons  trade continues to grow. The United States has become the major  weapons exporter in the world. Everyone is manufacturing and  selling weapons. So wars occur, and the United Nations has to go  play the role of international policeman and put out the fire.  Is it not absurd that on the one hand, the United Nations is  playing the role of world policeman, while on the other hand,  the weapons trade continues to grow? How can this absurdity be  explained?    These are very serious problems on which we must work  because  it is not one single problem. There was no mention of education  in the world, about famine in the world, about the millions of  children who are dying every year from curable diseases.    Nevertheless, I can assure you that the assembly was very  successful; it was a very fruitful conference, and Barbados  certainly played a brilliant role in the organization and  development of the conference. Barbados deserves the success it  has experienced at this conference.    [Marshall] Your presence here in Barbados is seen as an  indication of the importance that Cuba attaches to closer  relations with the rest of the Caribbean. What hopes do you  harbor for the Association of Caribbean States?    [Castro] My presence here is due to several factors. First,  we had contact with the small island states. I realized how  anguished they are. They were able to hold an international  conference to broach these issues. We are also an island nation,  vulnerable to a significant portion of the problems threatening  all of us.    Then, the prime minister extended an invitation to me, so I  felt it was my duty to attend this conference. That is why I  came. I am interested in ties with the Caribbean. It is logical,  natural. We appreciate that the Caribbean countries were the  first to breach the blockade against Cuba. These were Guyana,  Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. I cannot forget that  these were the first four countries to challenge U.S. pressures  and reestablish ties with Cuba. I admire the spirit of  independence shown by Caribbean countries, I admire their  efforts towards integration. I like these countries with which  we share blood and solid historic ties. This is why I felt it  was my duty to modestly contribute to the conference.    Regarding the Caribbean states, we have a need to come  together. We are stronger if we unite. Divided into dozens of  small nations, we will not be able to have an influence in the  world. Through cooperation, integration, we will be able to play  a role in the world, to the benefit of our countries.    [Marshall] Some people argue that Cuba has only turned to  the  Caribbean because of the fall of the Soviet Union. How would you  respond to those charges?    [Castro] Go figure. After all these things we have been  talking about. Relations were reestablished with the Caribbean  15 years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. We established  very close ties with Jamaica when Michael Manley became the  prime minister of Jamaica. We had relations with Guyana since  Cheddi Jagan, before Forbes Burnham. First there was Cheddi  Jagan. Then with Burnham, ties developed a great deal more. We  have had relations with Grenada. We have ties of one kind or  another with almost every country and have always cooperated  whenever we could. When they breached the blockade, they  established ties with Cuba, many years before the collapse of  the Soviet Union. I have visited several of these nations a long  time ago -- Jamaica, for instance.    Once, I came to Barbados. We were en route to a Nonaligned  Countries meeting in 1973, 21 years ago. A group of Caribbean  leaders also traveled on the same plane that has brought us from  Cuba: Burnham, Barrow, and several other leaders. I believe  Bishop was also among them. It was a time when no one would have  dared dream of the collapse of the Soviet Union.    So here we are. We have worked with the Caribbean for many  years. Besides, the Caribbean could not replace the socialist  bloc, nor our economic relations with the USSR. We are small  countries. Our ties are historic, cultural, moral; not  commercial or of an economic nature. Of course, the economy and  commerce can profit from our relations. A statement of that kind  is unsubstantiated, however.    We also established ties with Africa a long time ago and  participated actively in Africa's struggles against colonialism  and neocolonialism. We also fought and cooperated to the maximum  for the independence of Namibia. We cooperated in the struggle  against apartheid. Cuban blood was being shed for a long time in  Africa. We have very strong ties of brotherhood, and they are  much farther away than the Caribbean. At that time, the USSR and  other countries existed. Our relationship ties with the African  nations existed, however. We have ties with Vietnam, the PRC,  the Middle East, Arab nations, with India, and many others.    Given that the United States has always tried to isolate us,  we have expanded our ties with the rest of the world. Our  doctors, engineers, and workers have served in dozens of Third  World countries. We were president of the Nonaligned Countries  movement in 1979, a long time before the disappearance of the  USSR. No one developed ties with the Third World more than we  did. No one has fought for the interests of the Third World at  the United Nations more than we. No one denounced unequal trade,  foreign debts, nor the injustices against the Third World as we  did at every turn. This was the role of Cuba since the triumph  of the Revolution. We feel truly proud and pleased at having  discharged that role that no one can deny.    [Marshall] You mentioned Morris Bishop. What do you think of  Bishop and what he was trying to accomplish in Grenada?    [Castro] I loved Bishop as a brother. His death and  disappearance pained and pains me. Bishop was an extraordinary  man. He was a very honest, noble person. He wanted to do the  best for his country. We did everything we could to cooperate  with him. Since it is a small country, we could cooperate. I am  speaking of Bishop, the person. He had the backing of an  organization, a party. They divided and we have always condemned  the attitude assumed by Bishop's adversaries within the party. I  do not want to overstate my criticism because these are people  who are in jail, and a basic sense of chivalry forces me to be  cautious with my words. We strongly condemned however, with the  utmost irritation, the death, the assassination of Bishop. I  keep and shall always keep a great memory of him as an  exceptional, extraordinary man. I should not be the judge of his  mistakes because we all make mistakes, but I can assure you that  Bishop tried to do the best he could for his country. That is my  opinion.    [Marshall] April 27 was a great day in South Africa. Some  people would argue that without Cuba's intervention in the  liberation struggles in southern Africa, that day would not have  been possible. Are you proud of the role Cuba has played in  Africa's liberation struggles?    [Castro] That is a delicate subject. We should not be the  ones speaking about this. We felt, out of our own conviction, as  a matter of doctrine and revolutionary passion, a great  solidarity with the whole of Africa and a deep hatred for the  slavery and historic crimes committed against Africa. All of our  nations experienced this. Out of a spirit of solidarity, we  fought and worked for Africa. We gave then all the help our  small country could provide. We did not have much money, but  many patriots.    When South Africa invaded Angola, we did not hesitate to  send  our troops to fight against the racist South African invaders.  This took place in 1975, almost 20 years ago. Cuba, over 10,000  km away, sent troops. It was the only country to do this when  the South Africans were advancing on Angola. The Angolan people  had just attained their independence and were weak. They fought  courageously. We fought together, Cubans and Angolans. We  managed to halt the advance of the South Africans and later push  them back to the Namibian border.    Of course, later on, we began to withdraw, and South Africa,  with the support of the West, organized counterrevolutionary  guerrillas and subversive plots. When it felt at its most  powerful and when the Cuban presence was smaller, it expanded  its attacks on Angola. We spent 15 years in Angola. I believe it  is great proof of our loyalty to the Angolan people.    That was the reason for our differences with South Africa --  our support for Angola. In 1975, we were able to reestablish the  borders. Years later, as a result of South Africa's actions, the  situation became complicated once more. This forced us to  reinforce Angola. More recently however, in around 1987, the  South Africans launched one of their largest attacks, using  planes, tanks, and modern artillery. A very difficult situation  was created. We had two choices -- to withdraw or to reinforce  our presence. What we did was to play all our cards. We  reinforced our troops, and then the Cuito Cuanavale battle.  Angolans and Cubans waged a very difficult battle. In that area,  we had few communications options. We wanted to halt the South  Africans there however.    What happened in Cuito Cuanavale? Cuito Cuanavale is to the  east. The communications are very poor there. We did not want to  wage the decisive battle there, but to resist and keep Cuito  Cuanavale between us and the Angolans. The Angolans are  excellent soldiers, outstanding battle comrades. There, we  managed to halt the South African offensive. Then we organized a  thrust to the west, where we had better communications. From  Cuba, we sent every supply required to master the situation.    Think about it. Angola is farther from Cuba than Moscow is.  The flight between Havana and Moscow takes 14 hours. From Havana  to Luanda, it takes almost 16 hours. Do you know how many men we  sent? Over 50,000 troops, a small country like Cuba. This does  not demonstrate our military might, but our moral force, our  spiritual power. In that struggle, Cuba played all its cards. We  advanced to the west and got closer to the Namibian border. The  situation of the war changed. We did not want the war to be  decided, however, by a large battle at an elevated cost in human  lives on both sides. The appropriate conditions were created for  negotiations. We supported the negotiations. Diverse countries  also supported the negotiations, the South Africans were willing  to negotiate, and that is how the implementation of Resolution  435, the independence of Namibia, was achieved.    Logically, all those political and military events also had  a  bearing on South Africa. I believe, in answering your question,  that the efforts made helped maintain Angola's independence,  accelerated Namibia's independence, and also accelerated the  process of the disappearance of apartheid. It helped. It  accelerated the process. Anyhow, sooner or later, Namibia would  have been independent; sooner or later, apartheid would have  disappeared because apartheid was unbearable in today's world.  The South African people, like the Namibian, fought long and  hard, made many sacrifices, and met their goals.    I believe they had great leaders. They are a great people, a  very courageous, militant, strong, intelligent, resourceful  people. They have achieved this victory. We have to study the  period following the war, and the time of the elections, the  extraordinary role played by Mandela -- his leadership, and  wisdom. He was capable of uniting, overcoming every obstacle,  remaining firm while resilient, to attain this political miracle  in which everyone participated, the elections, in which such a  resounding victory was attained.    This was, first of all, a great victory for the South  African people, a great victory for Africa, the world, and the  liberal movement. I believe that now, we all have to contribute  to upholding harmony and peace. We all have to work and struggle  so that the emerging multiracial state is successful and  prospers, so that everyone finds safety, and South Africa  embarks on the long road towards development, a road on which it  could get very far.    South Africa has great natural resources. It is a very  wealthy nation; yet there is much poverty among most of the  population. I believe South Africa is destined to play a  decisive role in Africa. I am convinced they chose the right man  for that job, a man with talent, wisdom, and patience. I am a  great admirer of Mandela. Next to everything they did, Cuba's  modest contribution is nothing but a grain of sand in that 27  April victory.    [Marshall] I would like to turn to your relations with the  United States. What conditions are necessary, in your opinion,  for improvement of that situation?    [Castro] If we are going to talk seriously, first of all,  for  the blockade to end. It is an unfair, harsh, cruel blockade,  which includes medicines, and foodstuffs. It has been imposed on  Cuba for 35 years. It is one of the longest blockades in  history, and the most unjustified of all.    Second, the United States must resign itself to the fact  that  Cuba is an independent, sovereign country.    Third, respect for our people's right to choose the  political, social, and economic systems they believe most fair.  These are the three essential factors. We do not have anything  against the United States. We have not blockaded the United  States. We do not want to change the U.S. social system. We do  not seek to establish socialism in the United States. In any  case, that would be as complicated as establishing capitalism in  Russia. They must be similar things, given the characteristics  of each of those two countries. We are therefore not trying to  rule the United States nor diminish its independence one iota.  It is not that we have a problem with the United States. It is a  problem the United States has with us.    [Marshall] Cuba recently introduced some economic reforms,  such as the legalization of foreign currency. What success do  you believe that has had?    [Castro] Success does not come easy. There are very strong  U.S. pressures. The U.S. blockade is international; it bans not  only trade with Cuba, but pressures, with all its economic and  political might, all countries that want to trade with Cuba.  They try to sabotage and block every economic endeavor Cuba  conducts abroad. Under those conditions, it is always much  harder to introduce certain changes and initiatives. Despite all  that however, we are getting along and there is a growing number  of people in the world who dare to challenge the influence of  the United States. We could move much faster without the  blockade.    There have been dramatic changes in the world. We do not  want  to relinquish our ideals, do not want to abandon our political  system. We wish to preserve our Revolution, our independence,  and the accomplishments of socialism even under the present  difficult conditions. Sometime ago I used this example: You are  aboard a ship and the ship breaks apart and sinks. That is what  happened with the socialist bloc and the USSR. Thus, one has to  adopt measures, find a lifeboat, find an inner tube or a piece  of wood, to try to make it ashore. That is what we are doing.  When the socialist bloc and the USSR vessel sunk....[pauses] The  entire ship, however, did not sink. The PRC is still a very  powerful vessel; Vietnam is a very strong vessel; and other  countries.    I give you this example because we are not planning to  relinquish our ideals. We would rather drown. We prefer to  perish in our struggle to make it to shore than to renounce our  ideals. This is what we are doing. The USSR disappeared four  years ago and Cuba is still standing, alone, confronting, like a  little David, a colossal giant. There we are and there we are  planning to remain. Dead or alive, we shall still be there. And  if our generation is not be victorious, future generations will  make it. I have absolute certainty, however, that our generation  will be victorious.    [Marshall] Sometime ago you hinted that you might retire.  How confident are you that the Cuban youth will choose a path  you would approve of?    [Castro] I think you are refering to a question by Sawyer,  an  American journalist, who asked me if I was planning to run in  the next election, and I told her that I wish I would not have  to, I wish that that would not be necessary. I also said I was  willing to negotiate everything but the Revolution and Cuba's  independence. I said that. This was the context in which that  issue arose. I belive that I have, like any other human being,  the right to do with my life as I please. I have been a  revolutionary to this day. I would like to have the right to  retire whenever I wished. However, we do not retire when we want  to, but when we are allowed to retire. In other words, we are in  the government not for the pleasure of being in the government,  but because it is imposed on us. If we were in normal times,  everything would be easier. In difficult times, to retire would  be tantamount to defecting, and I am not a defector, nor will I  ever be one. As long as my comrades in the party and the  government, as long as people demand that I discharge certain  responsibilities, regardless of my personal wishes, I will have  to fulfill what I am told to do. What I wish for already is  something else. Government work is very hard, very difficult,  very bitter, very tense. I do not believe many people want to  voluntarily take up that job. That work must simply be  undertaken as a duty. If they demand that I be there until my  last day, I will do so. If at any time I am given the  opportunity to regain my freedom, then I would not miss the  chance to do so.    I want to stress that if I can tolerate my work, it is  because I share it; it is very widely distributed. No man alone  can do the things you need to do in a Revolution. Tens of  thousands of people work, more or less in a coordinated fashion.  A great part of our work is to coordinate and help to coordinate  work. Not to do the work of others. Work in Cuba is shared. Many  people do their parts. I also do my small share. In the world,  there is a trend to believe that there are providential  individuals who can do everything themselves. Individuals,  however, can do very little as a person. I truly believe that my  contribution is modest, and one could say, my work in Cuba is  basically symbolic.    I try to fulfill my role as well as possible, however.  Recently, as you know, they began to spread rumors abouth my  health. They have me dead every so often. I do not know who the  people are who are wishing for my death so intensely. I am  convinced that the day I am dead, my enemies are going to miss  me. Do you understand? They are going to find themselves with  nothing to do. My friends, however, are not going to believe I  am dead because I have been killed so many times. Yesterday, at  the conference, certain journalists from Miami kept asking about  my health and my thoughts on what the local media said about my  health. To tell the truth, the day before yesterday, I worked 14  hours. Yesterday, I worked another 14 hours.    I listened to every minute of every speech. If someone can  listen to over 100 speeches, that is ample evidence of good  health. If anything is able to kill someone, it is 100 speeches  in a row. [chuckles] The conference has therefore been the best  evidence of my good health.    I do not truly concern myself with that type of propaganda.  It does not bother or stress me. Rather, I take it with a dose  of humor and laugh at all those rumors. I already know that I  will have two great advantages the day I die. What I told you:  The sorrow of my enemies and the skepticism of my friends.    [Marshall] Many years ago, you made a famous speech in which  you said: History will absolve me. At this distance, in the 35th  year of the Revolution, do you think it has?    [Castro] History is very capricious. You should not believe  that history is the best judge. I do not know if, on the final  judgment day, justice will be met, but in this world, it does  not work that way. What I meant to say was that the ideas I was  defending were just, and that even under those very difficult  conditions, in a prison, and being tried, I was sure that it  would not be those judges, but history that would absolve me.    You are asking me a very personal question: What do I think?  In general, what happens when people die is that they are  forgotten. Only their closest relatives remember them. Time goes  by. Many people, however, have lived worrying about history and  glory. He who has read a little something about world events  knows that in the end, all the glory of the world -- as Marti  said -- fits into a kernel of corn.    I do not think any glory lasts over 2,000 years except that  of Christ, or Julius Caesar, or Charlemagne, or other  personalities from antiquity. No history, however, has lasted  over 5,000 years. No history has lasted over 10,000 years. No  history will last 1 million years. No history will last 1  billion years. When the sun goes out, what history will be left?  Why worry then about history? I do not worry much about history.  I ask myself: What is my duty? What should I do? To be honest,  in my opinion, that worth much more than anything else. To be  modest is worth more than everything else. To enjoy the  privilege of having been born to do good is the greatest glory  anyone can enjoy. This is why I am not thinking, like others:  what is going to be said about me? What has been said to date is  enough for me. Some good things and many bad things. In the end,  people will have to acknowledge that we were steadfast, defended  our beliefs, our independence, wanted to do justice, and were  rebellious.    David is remembered because he fought against Goliath.  Cubans  will be remembered, who are an even smaller David against a much  larger Goliath; will have to be remembered at least as much as  David is remembered.    If movies are made someplace other than Hollywood, or the  United States, perhaps a few good movies will be made about the  Cuban Revolution. [chuckles]    [Marshall, in Spanish] Commandante, thank you very much and  good luck.    [Castro] Thank you.</p>

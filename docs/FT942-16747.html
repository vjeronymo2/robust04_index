			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Amec Given that at the interim stage the City expected Amec to make Pounds 30m in 1993, a full year profit of Pounds 21m is a real disappointment. That is especially true because the company looks unlikely to beat the Pounds 30m target this year, despite the gathering improvement in the UK housing market. The result only underlines how far market enthusiasm for cyclical stocks exceeded their capacity to deliver. Not only are contracting profits much further out in the economic cycle; the tax charges for companies which have run up losses in the recent past will rise as recovery comes. Earnings performance may well be pedestrian over the next two or three years. With contracting remaining difficult it is odd that Amec's shares are trading at a premium to pure UK housebuilders. They are more obvious early beneficiaries of low interest rates and economic recovery. Construction companies also generate uncertainty because timing of profits over long contracts makes profits hard to model. The sector as a whole might benefit from an accelerated trend towards greater disclosure. A more detailed breakdown of Amec's North Sea and mechanical engineering businesses might help reassure. Even so, as Amec points out, excess capacity in construction is likely to dog the industry for some time, making positive surprises even less likely. Shareholders might have greater justification for the last year's enthusiasm if the shares had managed more than a 2 per cent annual compound capital growth rate over the last decade.</p>

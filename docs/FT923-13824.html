			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: Music and funding in Zurich - The city's June Festival While most cities have taken Rossini, Columbus or other open-ended themes as the starting point for their 1992 festivals, Zurich belatedly chose Brazil - effectively ruling out any useful contribution from its music institutions. Just as other European cities are latching on to the festival concept as a form of international marketing, Zurich wants to stop subsidising its annual June Festival. Whereas most arts companies thrive on strong leadership, Switzerland's biggest city seems unable or unwilling to attract suitable candidates. Here is a city with a high international profile in banking and commerce, with a cultural tradition at Europe's crossroads, with a beautiful lakeside setting and the raw materials - in quality of buildings, repertoire, audiences and musicians - to match most rivals. Yet its musical potential remains largely untapped: Zurich lacks a dynamic or distinctive profile. The June Festival (running from late May to early July) has become a dead duck. This year's Brazil theme may have thrown up one or two surprises, but it suffered from short-term planning and offered no scope to the Zurich Opera House. When the Tonhalle Orchestra tried to venture beyond the music of Villa-Lobos, it found itself footing a SFr25,000 bill for a special Brazilian concert which sold only 200 tickets. As in previous years, the major companies were left to market their festival wares independently. The cash-strapped city government has now announced plans to cancel its SFr700,000 subsidy after 1994. All this is in marked contrast to other Swiss cities with less impressive resources. Basle, with a tradition based on the work of Felix Weingartner and Paul Sacher, boasts an outgoing contemporary music programme and has just appointed Walter Weller as music director of both opera and concerts. The Geneva-based Orchestre de la Suisse Romande may not match the quality of the Tonhalle but, unlike its Zurich counterpart, it tours and records regularly, and has a respected chief conductor in Armin Jordan. This summer's open-air concert series in Geneva - promoted by the city government and entitled 'Dialogue between Europe and Latin America' - has just the kind of broad scope that the Zurich festival lacked. Despite the economic squeeze, Zurich's problem is not lack of money. The main arts companies continue to receive two-thirds of their budgets from the city and cantonal governments, and audience figures have not been affected by higher seat prices. Nor is there a lack of ideas: the 1991-2 season had some good concert programmes, and the city's orchestras occasionally excel themselves. No, the real problem is the dearth of strong artistic personalities. There has never been a driving force behind the June Festival such as one finds at Lucerne, Edinburgh or Salzburg, because it is treated as little more than an administrative function of the Zurich city government. Likewise the Tonhalle, which has a near-monopoly on concert life: artistic decisions are made through a series of slow-moving committees (as if Switzerland's democratic principles had ever been conducive to art). Since Rudolf Kempe in the mid-1970s, the orchestra has had a string of weak music directors, and the post is now vacant. The organisation lacks vision, spark and flexibility. The musicians have no incentive to do more than turn up for their weekly subscription concerts. There is little pressure for change. Zurich seems to like it that way, which is why - beneath the sophisticated exterior - it remains a provincial city in the heart of Europe. But the potential is there. Just what can happen when a dynamic personality arrives has been demonstrated at the Opera House these past 12 months. Alexander Pereira, the company's young Vienna-born director, has persuaded a nucleus of world-class singers to devote a substantial amount of their working time to Zurich, for smaller fees than they receive elsewhere. He is nurturing talented representatives of the younger generation and building performances around a small stable of conductors of the calibre of Santi, Harnoncourt and Inbal. He has found SFr3m from banks and other sponsors. The repertoire has been an attractive mix of the modern, the exotic and the popular. Next season opens with Bellini's Il pirata with Mara Zampieri, followed by Massenet's Herodiade with Carreras and Bumbry and a Jonathan Miller staging of Schreker's Die Gezeichneten (to coincide with a Klimt exhibition at the Kunsthaus). True, the past season's new productions - including Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre - offered few interpretative insights. But the Zurich public has responded enthusiastically, and there's a buzz about the house that has been lacking since the early 1980s. It was bad luck that the end-of-season production of Capriccio did not show the Opera House at its best. Strauss's Konversationsstuck is a work that should thrive on the company's ensemble policy and the intimate, traditional atmosphere of its theatre. But Cesare Lievi's production, designed by Paul Lerchbaumer and Luigi Perego, treated the work like an anti-opera. The characters and entertainments of Countess Madeleine's chateau were transposed to a semi-abstract theatre setting of our own day - on the premiss, perhaps, that the opera's aesthetic arguments deserve closer attention than its music or visual trappings. The stiff, doll-like costumes and a few select props paid lip-service to the 1770s period intended by Strauss, but otherwise the performance unfolded in an atmosphere of extreme artificiality, with little sense of context or style. The music fared better, thanks to an orchestra on top form and to the conductor, Ralf Weikert, whose fluent tempi and sense of instrumental balance showed exemplary understanding of the meanderings of late Strauss. Gabriele Lechner's Countess was ample and feminine, with enough whimsical dignity, vocal elegance and stage presence to carry off the final scene. Cornelia Kallisch, another young artist promoted by Pereira, made a courageous stab at Clairon, but missed the diva-like hauteur of the glamorous actress. Roland Hermann's gauche, melodramatic Count was totally misjudged. Douglas Ahlstedt's tight-voiced Flamand and Olaf Bar's disappointingly pallid Olivier were lacklustre suitors. The Countess would have been better turning to Robert Holl's La Roche, a sturdy man-of-the-world who used his rich timbre and wide expressive range to create a genuine character.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES GALORE LINE UP TO SUCCEED LATE MAYOR TUCKER;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THREE OF FOUR COMPTON CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS DECLARE INTEREST. SO DOES  TUCKER'S SON, SAYING, 'IT'S THE LORD'S WILL.'  </P> <P> Three of the four City Council members have announced plans to run for mayor in  a special election in April to replace Mayor Walter R. Tucker, who died of  cancer Oct. 1.  </P> <P> As council members began announcing their intentions Tuesday during the council  meeting, Councilman Maxcy D. Filer, acting as chairman, turned to the audience  and remarked, "Is there anyone else that wants to announce for mayor?"  </P> <P> Filer and Councilwomen Bernice Woods and Patricia A. Moore said they plan to  run. The fourth council member, Jane Robbins, announced that she will seek  reelection to the council in April. Filing for the election does not begin  until February.  </P> <P> Tucker's son, Walter Jr., also said he plans to run. Tucker, a 33-year-old  lawyer, has set up a committee to begin raising money for his campaign.  </P> <P> "After a lot of prayer . . . and contemplation, I believe that it's the Lord's  will," Tucker said. "And also I believe that it would be in honor of my father  to take the baton and carry on the dream and the principles that he began."  </P> <P> The council unanimously agreed Tuesday to combine the special mayoral election  with the April 16 municipal elections. Under the City Charter, the council  could have appointed a new mayor or ordered a separate mayoral election before  April.  </P> <P> Personal ambitions and a 2-2 split on the council, however, made it unlikely  that the four could agree on an appointee. And City Clerk Charles Davis  insisted that it would be too expensive and too time consuming to hold a  separate election before April.  </P> <P> The decisions by Moore and Woods to run for mayor had been expected. However,  Filer's entry into the race comes as a surprise to many. Filer, 60, had been  telling people that he would not seek reelection to the council when his term  expired in April. He and Robbins, 71, were first elected to the council in a  special election 14 years ago.  </P> <P> Filer said he decided to stay on and run for mayor because winning would offer  him a better chance to influence city policy. People perceive that the mayor's  position has more authority than it actually has, Filer said.  </P> <P> "I want to move Compton forward, and the only way to do it is to shift over to  the other seat," he said.  </P> <P> In Compton, the mayor is elected by the voters, performs ceremonial duties, is  chairman for council meetings and represents the city with other government  bodies. But the mayor has just one council vote.  </P> <P> The campaign is expected to be lively. Moore and Woods, a former school  trustee, were elected to the council last year, ousting longtime incumbents.  However, the two quickly became rivals, sniping at one another during council  meetings and voting on opposite sides of many issues.  </P> <P> Filer and Moore have been political allies on the council. On Tuesday, however,  Moore cast the only negative vote when the council selected Filer to serve as  mayor pro tem until after the election. She said the job should be rotated  among the four council members.  </P> <P> The winner in April will fill out the remaining two years of Tucker's term.  There are no provisions in the charter for a runoff, if one candidate fails to  receive a majority of votes in a special election.  </P> <P> In the race for council seats, however, regular election procedures will  prevail. If one candidate fails to get a majority, the top two vote-getters  would be forced into a runoff. The council seats held by Robbins and Filer will  be on the April ballot.  </P> <P> If Woods and Moore are losers in the mayoral contest, they will still hold  seats on the council. Filer, however, would be out of office if he loses. His  term expires in April, and mayoral candidates cannot run for that office and  for election to the council at the same time.  </P> <P> In Compton, council members run for four district seats. They must live in the  district they represent but are elected in a citywide vote.  </P> <P> A long line of council candidates is already forming. Two of them -- Basil G.  Kimbrew and the Rev. Walter Goodin -- are political allies of Moore's.  </P> <P> Kimbrew, 37, is a community activist and professional political consultant  working as assistant political director of Democrat Dianne Feinstein's  gubernatorial campaign. He managed Moore's campaign last year. He is running  against Robbins in District 4.  </P> <P> Goodin, 39, is assistant pastor of Faith Chapel Baptist Church in Los Angeles  and is a member of Compton Block Club Commission. He is running in District 1  for the council seat Filer is vacating.  </P> <P> Moore and the two council candidates said they are not running as a slate, but  they acknowledged that they are supporting one another.  </P> <P> Also running in District 1 is John Steward, a trustee in the Compton Unified  School District. Steward, a probation officer, announced his candidacy Tuesday  when he heard that Filer would not seek reelection to the council.  </P> <P> Richard Bonner, who owns a beauty salon in Compton, repeated Tuesday that he  will run for Robbins' seat.  </P> <P> Fred Cressel, who owns an office supply business in Compton and has run  unsuccessfully for office before, said he is considering a mayoral or council  bid.  </P> <P> Chuck Esters, who forced Tucker into a runoff last year, said he did not know  if he would enter the contest this time. He said he would not make a decision  until early next year, when he returns from Africa, where he is scheduled to  travel in December on business for his new commodities trading company.  </P></p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia set to climb copper output league INDONESIA WILL be catapulted into third place among the western world copper producers by a USDollars 545m scheme to boost annual output at the Ertzberg-Grasberg mines in the highlands of Irian Jaya to 1bn lb or 454,000 tonnes. Not only will the mines produce more than 6 per cent of the world's mined copper requirements, the project will also place Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold, which owns them, among the very few companies with gold output above 1m troy ounces a year. The expansion will boost gold production to between 1.2m and 1.5m troy ounces. Freeport said yesterday the project would be completed by the middle of 1996 and, as its cash reserves would be about Dollars 400m by the end of this year, it would mainly be financed from its own resources. The Ertzberg-Grasberg mines have been under constant expansion since 1989. A Dollars 504m scheme which lifted ore processed from 20,000 to 57,000 tonnes a day had scarcely been completed before a further expansion to 66,000 tonnes was announced. The Indonesian company, which is 74.2 per cent owned by Freeport McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources group, said yesterday that the expansion to 66,000 tonnes should be completed in the second half of 1993 at a cost of Dollars 90m. The cost of the proposed expansion to 90,000 tonnes of ore a day does not not include about Dollars 175m for infrastructure work because Freeport expects to sell some of the houses and shops to be included. Mr George Mealey, president of Freeport Copper, said that based on present reserves, the mines would have a 23-year life at a 90,000 tonnes-a-day rate. However, an aggressive exploration programme is continuing and the company expected to find much more copper and gold nearby. The expansion programme still has to be approved by the Indonesian government and is subject to an environmental impact assessment. However, if it is completed, it will put Indonesia ahead of Zambia, which mined about 423,000 tonnes of copper last year, as the world's third-largest producer (but still well behind Chile, 1.8m tonnes, and the US, 1.7m tonnes).  ------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium      -2,900  to  1,338,500 Copper           +650  to    262,975 Lead           +2,775  to    153,325 Nickel           +228  to     42,960 Zinc             -450  to    347,675 Tin               -65  to     14,585  ------------------------------------------</p>

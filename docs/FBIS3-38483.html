			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Elisabeth Rehn by </F> Arto Astikainen; place and date not given: "Rehn Would Be Open  in Relations With Russia"]    [Text] Swedish People's Party presidential candidate  Elisabeth Rehn believes that she as president would bring more  openness into Finnish foreign policy and would give political  decisionmakers more information on what was happening. Rehn says  that such openness would also apply to relations with Russia, so  that it will not interfere in internal Finnish affairs. "I would  build very well-operating ties with Russia."    Labeled an extreme right-wing conservative, Rehn sees  herself  as adjusting well to liberal debate, "although sometimes I can  be rather extremist."    [Astikainen] In the first round you did poorly in Paltamo.  Also, how could a middle-aged Paltamo farmer find reason to vote  in the second round for Swedish People's Party's Elisabeth Rehn?    [Rehn] He is now going to have to ponder whether he is in  more agreement with the things I think about and that I am  enthusiastic about than those issues Ahtisaari represents. He  has to make his choice on this. It's not just a matter of  feeling enthusiastic about supporting me, but rather it is  necessary to look at the alternative and see who is most  suitable.    [Astikainen] Where is Martti Ahtisaari better than you?    [Rehn] He has strong experience as a Foreign Ministry and  international organization official, also with UN administration  experience. Of course I have none at all in these.    [Astikainen] Within the Swedish People's Party you are  considered belonging to the moderate conservative wing. How does  this differ from the party's centrist wing?    [Rehn] My conservatism is [to be understood as supporting]  business, privatization, the right of individual ownership and  generally of ownership, strong patriotism, and national defense.  These things made up my conservativeness when I came into  parliament. But already at that time I was a strong upholder of  human rights and cared about helping those less well off; I had  a global perspective and realized that not everyone was doing  equally well. For this reason I fit well as a centrist, even  somewhat as a liberal, although I can sometimes even be a  conservative.    [Astikainen] You got into parliament in 1979 under the  slogan  "Woman from the right." Will this also be enough to get elected  this time?    [Rehn] No, because this does not encompass more than a small  part of me.    [Astikainen] Is Mauno Koivisto a dangerous socialist?    [Rehn] In no way. I think rather highly of Koivisto. He has  been a wonderfully good cooperating partner with me. There are  many such qualities in him that I hold in the highest respect.  But since this is such a clearly nonsocialist country, it would  be a little strange if again an individual clearly aligned with  a leftist party were elected president.    [Astikainen] Is Ahtisaari a socialist?    [Rehn] He himself is strongly advocating this [socialism].    [Astikainen] What is your thinking on the welfare state?    [Rehn] It is the sort of thing where there are good  features,  in which room is be made for inventiveness and flexibility, not  to take care of as many people as the typical leftist society is  doing. Welfare is connected with seeing that basic rights are  preserved: education, basic economic security, and targeted  health care services. But many creeper vines have grown out over  the years. We ought to use this awareness right away and look at  what is dispensable and how it can be pruned. I don't want to  make cuts on the level of service delivery, [for example] by  nurses and day care personnel.    [Astikainen] Is foreign policy now being decided too much by  ministry officials?    [Rehn] They have been deciding rather much. I believe that  this is going to change. At least I can assure that in my  presidency, policy decisions will be of chief importance. The  preparation given by ministry officials is vital, and there are  excellent foreign and security policy experts handling both  these areas.    [Astikainen] Then the situation will change if you are  elected?    [Rehn] I have said that in policy aspects there is certainly  going to be noticeably more information, openness. Currently the  situation is a little like information should not be given out  regarding what has happened and is happening.    [Astikainen] Were you afraid when you heard about Russia  having handed a [protest] note to Finland?    [Rehn] In reality I became irritated that the government had  not been particularly aware that these discussions had been  going on. The note emerged at a little inconvenient time. There  are those who still have not come to understand that the old  days are gone. These people are still found in Russia's embassy  in Finland.    [Astikainen] Could you as president revoke the Paris Peace  Treaty completely?    [Rehn] This is not necessary, since it has become obsolete  on  its own. Aspects regarding border questions are still relevant.  New agreements--all human rights agreements, UN special  treaties--are replacing it. Forty-seven years have passed since  the peace treaty. Conditions have changed much. All the world  has changed. The treaty's significance is extremely limited.    [Astikainen] How as president would you prevent Russia from  interfering in Finnish internal affairs?    [Rehn] Through openness. I would make it clear what  Finland's  position is regarding its own sovereignty. I would build good,  very good operating relations with Russia. These must be built  anew, no matter what happens there. This will be the task of the  next president in any case.  <H5>  Russian Uncertainty Is Danger Factor </H5>   [Astikainen] The Estonians fear Russia. Has the threat  regarding Finland been eliminated for all time?    [Rehn] Not surely for all time. We have learned over the  past  years that nothing is eternal, nor especially durable. Perhaps  we have reason to manifest a little fear regarding what is  happening with the Baltics. Their fear also might be a little  anticipatory. Uncertainty regarding the eastern neighbor is a  danger factor for us too, but I would prefer not to speak of  there being a threat.    [Astikainen] What is your vision: What will Russia be like  at  the end of your presidential term in the year 2000?    [Rehn] Surely it will be democratized, but it is a long  road.  The biggest error they have made was perhaps in assuming that  everything would just convert to a market economy with just a  ping and there it is. They have such an old glue of tradition as  to how things are done there. One doesn't need do more than go  shopping in Moscow or Leningrad: First you go and select  something, then you go to the cashier to pay and finally you are  able to ask for your item. This will go on until all of this  strange bureaucracy is gotten rid of. But they have embarked on  the right direction.    [Astikainen] Is the border between Finland and Russia then  just as easy to cross as is now the border between Finland and  Sweden?    [Rehn] I doubt this is the case.    [Astikainen] Do you really want to grant asylum in Finland  to  all applicants from Russia and Estonia?    [Rehn] No. From where did you get this idea?    [Astikainen] You have opposed the government's decision to  declare those countries as so-called safe countries.    [Rehn] First of all, it should be kept in mind the  dimensions  of which we are speaking. Last year some 700 people from Russia  and Estonia asked for asylum. Since over the same period well  over a million people came on passports and visas, then in my  view we are just not speaking in the same in unison rearding  these phenomena. We ought to be much more strict and careful in  deciding to whom we justly grant visas. Those asylum applicants  who have committed crimes can be turned away very fast, if the  police will only act. I do not support criminals in any way. And  the government's decision was drafted in such terms that Russia  is to be considered a safe country for only Russian citizens,  that is, just as I had hoped. Of course in Russia are small  groups--draft evaders, homosexuals, Jews--who still are  persecuted, but perhaps this will be after all brought under  control.    [Astikainen] Why don't you use the word neutrality in  describing Finland's foreign policy?    [Rehn] Because in my opinion this is not relevant. We have  sought membership in the European Union [EU] and said that we  support supplemental provisions regarding a joint foreign and  security policy. We have not presented any reservations on this.  And I think in general that the word neutrality is slightly  obsolete after disappearance of the blocs.  <H5>  Partnership for Peace Won't Increase Finnish Security </H5>   [Astikainen] How can Finland keep talking about joining a  Western military alliance although even you speak of  nonalignment?    [Rehn] We can't add [to our security]. For example, in the  PFP (Partnership for Peace) we were participating only in a  contributory member. We aren't getting anything; we aren't  getting security guarantees; we aren't even asking for these. We  regard the work of bringing about peace in Europe as being this  important. Finland is working to realize the possibilities for  this.    [Astikainen] First there was NATO's joint consultative body  NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], and now there is  Partnership for Peace. Surely cooperation is being increased.    [Rehn] In NACC we are observers and attend committees that  are specifically involved in peace-maintaining issues.    [Astikainen] How will a signing a Partnership for Peace  agreement increase Finnish security?    [Rehn] It will not increase it. We are to act as a  contributory member if we join.    [Astikainen] You are quite actively bringing Finland closer  to the West. Is this based on logic or feelings?    [Rehn] It is clearly based on logic that we have always been  part of Europe. I have always considered Finland a Western  country. When I was able to go abroad for the first time in 1953  as a new student, I was horrified that Finland was considered an  East bloc country. An American university woman student I met in  Venice surprised me by saying: "Are you Finnish? I didn't know  that you were allowed to travel freely." Then I thought: "My  God!, I'll show you that Finland is still a Western country." Of  course one's feelings can also be involved about this.    [Astikainen] What would staying out of the European Union  mean for Finland in your estimation?    [Rehn] Concretely, I think that we would not be able to have  a voice in decisionmaking regarding issues of concern to  ourselves. Especially, if there is an expansion in the area of  security policy decisionmaking, it would be extremely vital to  be participate, because at issue is security for all of our  Europe. Regarding economics, investors surely will avoid  countries that are outside. In addition, there are educational  programs in which we cannot join as just a member of the  European Economic Area.</p>

They  added, "Japan has to say what it has to say to the United  States."    Such criticism was touched off by TCCI Vice President Oga,  who said: "I was surprised at hearing Bentsen's remarks because  the U.S. economy is improving." He added: "The United States'  computer industry is one of the driving forces of its economy,  but such computer parts as liquid crystal displays [LCDs] are  all Japanese made. Unless industries producing such computer  parts are established in the United States it has to continue to  import them from Japan, and therefore its trade deficit with  Japan will continue to increase if the yen continues to rise.  The Japanese Government should make the United States  understand this." He indicated that, not only for Japan but  also for the U.S. economy, the yen's appropriate rate against  the dollar is 120.    JCCI President Inaba said: "The United States is an  importing country. Its attempt to raise exports by making use  of the appreciated yen is merely a partial effort." He  stressed: "Japan, in its past relations with the United States,  weakly threw back the ball cast by the United States. From now  on, we have to cast back the ball properly."    This indicates the verbal intervention into the yen's  exchange rate by the U.S. high-raking official has irritated the  industry leaders who seem to be nervous about the U.S.  Government's move because Japan is still in a serious depression.</p>

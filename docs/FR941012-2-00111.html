			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Contracts provide retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans qualified for federal income tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. Holders of the Contracts will direct purchase payments to one of several Divisions of the Separate Account or to the Guaranteed Interest Division (which is part of First ING Life's general account). Payments directed to the Separate Account then will be invested by the Divisions in shares of corresponding portfolios of the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for a non-qualified Contract and $1,000 for a qualified Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified Contract, $250 for a qualified Contract, and $90 for a qualified Contract on a monthly program of purchase payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken during the six year period from the date First ING Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge is determined by the number of Contract anniversaries that have passed since the purchase payment that is being withdrawn was made. The charge is 7% if no Contract anniversary has passed with respect to the payment. 6% if one Contract Anniversary has passed, and declines by 1% per year thereafter. No surrender charge applies to a purchase payment that has been held for 6 Contract anniversaries or more. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount withdrawn. Proceeds from the surrender charge may not cover the expected costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be recovered from First ING Life's general assets, which may include revenue from the proposed mortality and expense risk charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The administrative charges to be assessed will be (a) an annual administrative charge of $30 per Contract year, during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments paid in the first Contract year are less than $100,000, and (b) a daily asset charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15% assessed against each Division of the Separate Account, during both the accumulation and annuity periods. First ING Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts. First ING Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average, excluding costs that are properly categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. In addition, each transfer in excess of 12 in a Contract year will be subject to a charge of $25. Applicants indicate that the partial withdrawal transaction charge and excess transfer charge will meet the ``at cost'' requirement of Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

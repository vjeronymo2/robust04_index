			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lyudmila Vartazarova, chairman of the </F> Socialist Labor Party, by Lidiya Timofeyeva, under the rubric  "The New Left"; place and date not given: "Socialism With  Vartazarova's Face?"]    [Text] It appears that, having had enough "bad" communism  and being poisoned by "inedible" neoliberalism, Russian society  is timidly trying to taste modern socialism. Last year an  attempt was made to unite the democratic left of Russia. This  movement was headed by Lyudmila Vartazarova, the current  chairman of the SPT [Socialist Labor Party]. Her personality is  as out of the ordinary in the party milieu as it is mysterious.  There were rumors to the effect that this female intellectual  from Moscow, a doctor of economic sciences and a person from the  "backwaters" of academia, was being paired as a vice president  in the possible early presidential elections with Air Force  General Rutskoy and then "general of the military-industrial  complex" Yu. Skokov. The future elections may serve up some kind  of surprise in her person.    [Timofeyeva] Does it appear paradoxical to you that the  motherland of "real socialism" has not produced an authoritative  left-wing democratic party since the disintegration of the CPSU,  actually, until now? The leaders of the giant party have gone to  all kinds of quarters: Some went into commerce, some turned  liberal, others--orthodox communists and nationalists, leaving  the leftist idea an orphan....    [Vartazarova] This is not quite true. When after the  troubled  wait for a "paddy wagon" in August 1991 I decided to check who  was still alive for thinking and for work, and who had not  ultimately been "annihilated," I was happy to learn that there  were such people even among the former party elite, for example,  First Secretary of the Russian Communist Party Valentin Kuptsov.  We tried to bring back the leftist idea and cleanse it of lies  and mistakes together with him and other like-minded people.    [Timofeyeva] What is the "leftist idea?" Is it social  democracy or socialism, or perhaps social liberalism?    [Vartazarova] Yes, in the broader meaning of the word.  Everything that unites people around the ideas of justice,  freedom and equality, democracy, and solidarity may be  classified as the notion of the leftist idea, adding to it  reinforcement of the regulatory role of the state in the economy  and greater social protection for the people.    [Timofeyeva] Your colleague and SPT cochairman, the  historian  and essayist Roy Medvedev, who was considered the domestic  precursor of "socialism with a human face," distinguished  between social-democrats, socialists, and communists as early as  the stagnant 1970's.    [Vartazarova] Of course, there is a difference between us.  There are many leftist parties in Russia. With the exception of  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, they are not all  that big, and some number altogether three or four dozen people.  The SPT of Russia is a liberal party emphasizing the issues of  freedom and entrepreneurship. Pavel Kudyukin's United  Social-Democrats advocate the idea of self-management socialism  while sharply restricting the centralizing role of the state.    [Timofeyeva] How are you, the Socialists, different from the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation of Gennadiy Zyuganov?    [Vartazarova] Unlike the Communists, we have socialism as  our  goal rather than communism. We consider relations that ensure  distribution of the social product in proportion to the quantity  and quality of socially necessary labor, rather than on the  basis of the need to be just. We come out in favor of a socially  oriented mixed economy and do not believe that the market is a  concession of the period of transition. Both economic pluralism  and the market are features of socialism. However, in view of  the fact that modern production calls for a considerable  concentration of material and labor resources, we have a  preference for various forms of collective ownership. This makes  it possible for the members of the labor collective to act as  co-owners of their enterprise.    Unlike the Communists, we do not maintain that class  solidarity is the only one: It is merely one of the types of  solidarity. Besides, we do not have a preference for the ideas  of patriotism over the ideas of internationalism, but see them  in their harmonic integrity....    [Timofeyeva] How do your principles of justice and equality  go along with freedom and democracy? Will you be able to strike  a balance between them?    [Vartazarova] There is the notion of "solidary  responsibility." This is when you are free to do everything you  like but in the process should relate your actions to the  interests of those around you. I like a particular parable on  which I reflect continuously. A man went out to hunt in the  mountains. A misstep caused an avalanche which destroyed a hut  and claimed the lives of the people residing at the foot of the  hill. The question is: Who is to blame? On one hand, it was his  free choice and an absurd random occurrence. On the other hand,  there were the grave consequences of this freedom, and the need  to think about how our words may resonate. This is how the  strategy and tactics of the SPT are structured--we walk on a  razor's edge: between freedom and necessity, freedom and  responsibility, law and morality....    [Timofeyeva] Your party is sometimes accused of excessive  altruism, "eggheadedness," and the inability to put your best  foot forward. For some reason, few people know that  representatives of 19 parties with a socialist orientation from  the CIS countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland,  Poland, and Bulgaria gathered for your Fourth Congress...and  that you held an authoritative international conference on  prospects for the development of the socialist idea throughout  the world....    [Vartazarova] This is true, we did not engage in  self-promotion. However, we did not set this goal, either. We  did what we considered necessary. We are now busy with our own  business. We have developed and adopted a new party program, and  prepared a program for urgent measures to stop the crisis in the  country, "New Priorities--the Negotiating Process--Crime  Security," and forwarded it to the Duma. We will try yet again  to gather all democratic left-wing forces, this time at the  Second Congress....    [Timofeyeva] What about your participation in the future  presidential campaign? There have been rumors that they saw you  as a vice president together with Rutskoy, and then with Skokov.    [Vartazarova] This is the first time I have heard of this.  Our party conducted negotiations with the Civic Union; we joined  the Coalition of Civic Forces, one of whose tasks was to achieve  accord in our society. However, this idea quietly passed away  later. Subsequently, we negotiated with Yuriy Skokov about  forming a centrist movement in Russia, and I became a member of  the Accord for the Motherland committee in September 1993.  Unfortunately, this committee also gave its soul to God.... This  is it. Our party may support someone running for president, but  only after we familiarize ourselves with his program and come to  know him well. We will not select a pig in a poke.</p>

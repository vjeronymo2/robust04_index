			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current rule at 7 CFR 277.19 requires FNS approval prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition of any ADP equipment for SAVE. The proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate 7 CFR 277.19 modifies this requirement so that ADP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment for SAVE would require prior approval by FNS only if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost is above the cost thresholds in &sect;277.18. Under current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules in &sect;277.19, non-ADP equipment for SAVE having a net unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of $25,000 or more must receive prior FNS approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, with the elimination of &sect;277.19, the net acquisition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost threshold in Section (B)(3) of Appendix A to 7 CFR Part 277  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would apply. This provision provides that prior FNS approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required for the acquisition of equipment having a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life of more than one year and a net acquisition cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than $5,000 per unit after allocation to FNS as projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for one year after purchase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> State Agency Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To implement this provision as of April 1, 1994 with minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disruption to the Program, State agencies may wish to begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking appropriate steps early. State agencies may wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the additional State funding from their State legislatures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to offset the reduction in the Federal rate of reimbursement, cut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> back total administrative expenses prior to Federal cost sharing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as of April 1, 1994, reallocate resources to or realign functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maintain current levels of effort and to ensure the efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and effectiveness of overall operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Delaying the Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13971 of the Leland Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows the April 1, 1994 effective date for the change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal reimbursement rates to be delayed by the Secretary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agriculture in the case where a State's legislature meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biennially and is not scheduled to meet in calendar year 1994. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay may be obtained for such a State only if the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no mechanism for appropriating additional State funds prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next legislative session.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the Department's intent that State agencies submit their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests to delay the effective date early, and not wait for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of the rulemaking process. It is in the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's interest to apply early for a delay in the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date so a decision on the State agency's request may be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promptly. To allow adequate time for the review of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests prior to the effective date, FNS instructed its regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices to notify State agencies that they would need to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their requests to FNS by December 31, 1993. State agencies were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of this deadline in letters which were issued by FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional offices during the last week of October 1993 and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first week of November. The Department will, however, consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests submitted after the deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

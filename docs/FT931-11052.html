			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kwik Save moves into Scotland KWIK SAVE, the discount grocery retailer, is moving into Scotland and plans to open up to 100 stores in the next few years. The expansion will intensify competition in the Scottish discount retailing market, where Isle of Man-based Shoprite is also expanding and is set to increase its stores from 38 to 59 this year. Worries about competition and price cutting knocked Shoprite's shares down 30p to 753p yesterday. Kwik Save shares were unchanged at 799p. Kwik Save had delayed opening in Scotland, seen by analysts as a natural market for the company, until a five-year development programme for London and the south-east was 'up to speed', according to Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive. 'We didn't want to be losing money on two fronts,' he said, adding that the south-east was expected to be profitable this year. Kwik Save will today begin advertising for high street and edge-of-town sites. Costs of the expansion would depend on whether sites were acquired leasehold or freehold. Mr Seabrook said funding would come from existing resources. Distribution will be handled from Kwik Save's warehouse site north of Manchester. Despite higher distribution costs, Mr Seabrook said Kwik Save would 'not be beaten on a value for money basis' against Shoprite. Kwik Save's decision follows a report last month from Verdict, the retail market research company, predicting that discount food retailers were becoming a significant force in the UK and could double their sales by 1996. Other analysts estimate the sector will also become more competitive, especially if foreign discounters target the UK market. Mr Seabrook said he hoped the Scottish expansion would become profitable more quickly than the south-east programme. He would be disappointed if losses were sustained for more than two or three years. 'We weren't understood in the south-east and we're a very different company now to then,' he said. The Scottish move will not affect the programme of store openings throughout England.</p>

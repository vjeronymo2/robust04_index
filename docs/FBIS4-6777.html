			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists  conducted aerial mobile deployment exercises on 21 April by  flying various aircraft, including fighter-bomber planes loaded  with nuclear weapons, to South Korea from its overseas bases.    On 21 April, some 10 fighter-bomber planes, pursuit-assault  planes, and vertical take-off and landing attack planes loaded  with nuclear weapons took off from Okinawa and Yokosuka bases in  Japan for deployment to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South  Korea. The frantic war exercise was aimed at evaluating a speedy  deployment to the Korean peninsula and actual fighting  deployment capabilities.    On the other hand, on 20 April, KC-135 refueling planes flew  from overseas bases over the sea off Kunsan, South Korea, and  were frenzied with war fever by refueling tens of fighter-bomber  planes and pursuit-assault planes, which were running wild in  night aerial war exercises, from 1900 [1000 GMT] to 2200 [1300  GMT].    On 21 April, the South Korean puppets frantically exercised  gun firing and helicopter sorties right in front of our nose  near the DMZ. That day, 105-mm large-caliber artillery groups,  which occupied firing positions in Naedae-ri, Chorwon County,  Kangwon Province, and Magori, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province  in South Korea, fired tens of bomb shells near the DMZ. The  puppet Army's armed gangsters, which occupied combat positions  in Yongsan-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and Kangsan-ri and  Yangjae-ri, Chorwon County in the South Korean Kangwon Province,  wielded a horrible war frenzy by randomly shooting some 1,000  shots of large-caliber machine guns.    In addition, on the same day, the puppet Army's armed  helicopters and transport helicopters ran wild in exercising  ground support and air transport in the skies over areas  adjacent to Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of the South Korean  Kangwon Province.    The fire game commotion of the U.S. imperialists and South  Korean puppets is further aggravating the war risk on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

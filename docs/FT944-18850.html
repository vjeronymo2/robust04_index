			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Headquarters sale winds up Metallgesellschaft disposals Metallgesellschaft yesterday completed its assets fire sale with the disposal for an estimated DM500m (Dollars 324.7m) of its Frankfurt headquarters to Difa, a Hamburg-based property investment fund. Final legal details were hammered out yesterday, the last day of the current financial year, allowing the consideration to be included in the 1993-94 accounts. Metallgesellschaft will lease back the building, on a prime 25,000 sq metre site next to the Alte Oper opera house and between the banking quarter and fashionable West End area, for three years. Unofficial estimates had earlier suggested it might earn about DM700m from the sale. Although the price was not disclosed, officials said DM500m was 'plausible'. It is understood Deutsche Bank, one of the group's main shareholders and its leading creditor, was also interested in buying the site, which is rated as one of the most desirable in Germany's financial capital. Difa, which is closely associated with DG Bank, is ranked among the top five open-ended property funds in Germany, with total assets of around DM7.5bn. It was advised in the Metallgesellschaft deal by Jones Lang Wootton. The announcement of the disposal followed a confident statement from Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman, who said the group's liquidity situation had never been better. In a letter to staff, he said the disposals programme started early this year as one of the conditions of a DM3.4bn rescue package assembled by creditor banks and share-holders was by and large complete.</p>

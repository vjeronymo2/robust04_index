			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Woolworths rises 17% in year to beat forecast Woolworths, Australia's largest food retailer, yesterday announced an increase in profits which was well above forecast. After tax and abnormal items, profits increased to ADollars 200.3m (USDollars 148.3m) in the year to June 27, a rise of 17 per cent on the previous year's ADollars 171.2m, and comfortably above the ADollars 188.5m forecast made when the company's shares were floated on the stock market last year. The group is not connected with the US company or UK stores of the same name, Its sales - up to ADollars 11.5bn from ADollars 10.5bn - also beat the forecast of ADollars 11.3bn, as did profits before interest and tax of ADollars 318.9m. Trading profits in the previous year were ADollars 282.2m, and had been forecast to rise to ADollars 310.2m. The 1993-94 figures relate to a 52-week trading period, while the previous year took in 53 weeks. Woolworths said that same-store sales, adjusting for the extra week, rose by 10.7 per cent, compared with a national retail sales increase of 5.7 per cent and an inflation rate of 1.7 per cent. All divisions saw higher profits, with the contribution from the core supermarkets chain rising by 9.4 per cent, the general merchandise group by 12.2 per cent, and the specialty retail group by 42.9 per cent as the Dick Smith electronics retail business recovered. During the year, eight new supermarkets and several new variety outlets were added. Woolworths said sales since the year-end had been 'particularly strong', although the health of Australia's retail market generally remained patchy. Capital expenditure in the current year is likely to edge up to about ADollars 260m, with an increased share going on the new store programme.</p>

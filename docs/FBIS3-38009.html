			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- "The use of peace-keeping  forces to settle the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina is  necessary," Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the upper chamber  committee on international affairs, said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS here on Friday.    He noted that he was in the Dniester area where there were  hostilities between the Moldovan Government and the breakaway  Dniester Republic, and in Nagorno-Karabakh. He also visited  other "flash points" in the world and drew the conclusion that  it is impossible, as a rule, to settle such conflicts without  the participation of peace keepers.    The upper chamber committees on international affairs as  well  as on security and defence will discuss, at a joint sitting, the  question on dispatching an additional military contingent to the  U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia.    The committees will debate a request by the U.N.  secretary-general addressed to the Russian president to send an  additional military contingent to the U.N. Protection Force  stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in connection with the  conclusion of agreements on a peaceful settlement of the  conflict and a ceasefire in the Sarajevo zone.    In compliance with the Russian Constitution, the province of  the Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian parliament)  includes "the question on possible use of the Russian Armed  Forces outside the territory of the Russian Federation".    The preliminary debate on the issue will be conducted by the  committees which will submit their proposal to a plenary session  of the upper chamber. The Federation Council will debate the  question on dispatching an additional military contingent  numbering 300 to participate in the U.N. Protection Force to  ensure control over the implementation of the agreement on a  peaceful settlement of the conflict.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Fund to boost small business proposed MR Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, is trying to persuade G7 countries to provide Dollars 500m to help start small businesses in Russia. The EBRD is concerned at growing unemployment in Russia, and the small business sector is undeveloped, following decades of centralised economic control. To date the EBRD, set up to help develop the private sector in former Soviet bloc states, has provided only tiny amounts for investment in small and medium sized enterprises. Investing in small business carries greater risks than EBRD's national shareholders want the bank to take. Mr Attali therefore wants a new pool of money, which could invest in these riskier enterprises. A second obstacle to investing in the small business sector is the lack of an effective network for distributing small amounts of capital, because the Russian banking system is so antiquated. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, EBRD's director of the cabinet and of corporate planning and the budget, said young westerners would be sent all over Russia to assess local entrepreneurs wanting funds. These westerners would train Russians to become venture capitalists, so that eventually the Russians could disburse funds themselves.</p>

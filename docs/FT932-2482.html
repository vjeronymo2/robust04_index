			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: Shuttle gossip Never let it be said that London is a graveyard of a posting these days for aspiring foreign diplomats. Yoav Biran, Israel's ambassador to the Court of St James these past four and a half years, is moving on later this year to a pivotal position in his country's foreign ministry: deputy director-general in charge of the Middle East and the peace process. With the peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in Washington still making exceptionally heavy weather, the job could hardly have come up at a more critical time in Middle Eastern affairs. There is a hitch, though: Israel's tortuous inter-ministerial politics. Relations between those perennial Labour party sparring partners, foreign minister Shimon Peres and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, are as prickly as ever. Biran is said to have good relations with both his boss and the prime minister. But he must be worried that he will be forced to spend less of his time on the Middle East negotiations than on shuttle diplomacy between Peres and Rabin.</p>

The preservation and expansion of  microelectronics research and production in Germany is thus  particularly important, indeed an absolute necessity," stressed  Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger at the laying of the  foundation stone for the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon  Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe. All economic forecasts in the  major industrialized regions placed information technology at  the top of the market size and growth rate league over the next  30 years, he continued. As a country with few raw material  resources of its own, Germany could maintain its position as one  of the leading industrialized countries only by virtue of  advanced technological achievements. "Our chance lies in  investing in our intelligence and creativity," said Dr. Krueger  during his speech, which we print below in a slightly abridged  form.  <H5>  Our Chances Lie in Research-and-Technology-Led Innovation </H5>   With the founding of the new Fraunhofer Institute, the  Federal Government and the Land of Schleswig-Holstein have  decided on an investment in one of the major areas that will  safeguard the future of our country: The establishment of the  new research institute is a contribution to the preservation of  Germany's status as a center of microelectronics research and  production. It is an important landmark in the midst of a  difficult economic situation.    Many general economic factors have contributed to the  economic slump that Germany has experienced in 1993, although  this slump also reveals structural weaknesses in German economic  competitiveness. The Federal Cabinet has adopted the Report on  German Economic Competitiveness, which addresses this issue.  Companies in Germany have reached the point where they can bear  no further costs. The economic framework conditions -- and  regulations in particular -- place them at an international  disadvantage. Germany is also facing increasing competition  from suppliers with more favorable cost structures and from  high-tech supplies of better and better quality from Southeast  Asia. We must grasp opportunities to improve these framework  conditions -- such as rendering work schedules more flexible --  although our chances of achieving a profound change in our  locational conditions are limited. As a country with few raw  material resources of its own, Germany will therefore be able to  maintain its position as a leading industrialized country only  by virtue of advanced technological achievements. Our chance  lies in investing in our intelligence and creativity. Our  opportunities will come from research-and-technology-led  innovation.  <H3>  Preserving Germany's Status as a Center of Microelectronics  Research and Production </H3>   The preservation and expansion of microelectronics research  and production in Germany is particularly important, indeed an  absolute necessity. Microelectronics is an indispensable key  technology for major markets. All economic forecasts in the  major industrialized regions place information technology at the  top of the market size and growth rate league over the next 30  years. Although a semiconductor chip often accounts for only a  few percent of the value of an overall system, it acts as a  catalyst for development in many areas of technology. In 1990,  electronic components worth 3.5 billion German marks [DM]  influenced sales worth DM726 billion in the mechanical  engineering, electrical engineering, precision mechanics, and  office equipment/EDP [electronic data processing] sectors.    A few days ago, I presented the results of a comprehensive  Delphi survey on science and technology development trends over  the coming 30 years. Indeed the survey was carried out by a  Fraunhofer institute on behalf of the BMFT [Federal Ministry of  Research and Technology]. It points to dynamic growth prospects  in microelectronics, although it also reveals that, in the view  of the experts interviewed, Germany has fallen considerably  behind Japan and the United States in research and development.  <H5>  Ground Lost in Research Is a Cause for Concern </H5>   Ground lost in research is a cause for concern, as it will  lead to loss of ground in tomorrow's markets. Germany and  Europe already present competitive weaknesses in  microelectronics, as we know. German industry currently accounts  for a mere six percent of the world market in information  technology goods. Only two-fifths of Western Europe's  semiconductor chip requirement can at present be produced in  Europe.    However, Germany still has a good chance of acquiring a  substantial share in the growth of the microelectronics market.  To this end Germany's strengths -- such as the microsystems  engineering sector -- should be built on. This in turn means  that the state, science, and industry must maintain a dialogue  on common goals and strategies to ensure that the new  technologies will be developed and put jointly into practice.  <H5>  ISiT Expands the Microelectronics Research Infrastructure </H5>   By funding the ISiT, the Federal Research Ministry is  expanding the public microelectronics research infrastructure.  The new institute will take its place among the BMFT-funded Max  Planck Society institutes, the major research facilities, the  Fraunhofer institutes, and the Blue List establishments. The  BMFT currently spends nearly 40 percent of its information  technology budget on funding nonuniversity research facilities.  Microelectronics research capacities in the new federal laender  have already received a considerable boost in recent years with  the founding of new Blue List institutes and seven Fraunhofer  Society institutes or regional branches. One of the BMFT's  purposes in funding research facilities is to enhance regional  research capabilities.    As we all know, research does not take place in a vacuum. It  thrives on a multiplicity of contacts and on the exchange of  ideas. Links with the local environment are particularly strong,  as many studies show. The ISiT will have a considerable impact  on industry in Itzehoe and northern Germany and will, I am  pleased to say, make a major contribution to growth in this area.  <H3>  The German User Industry Needs Guaranteed Access to  Microelectronics </H3>   The new Fraunhofer Institute forms an integral part of the  Federal Ministry of Research and Technology's information  technology funding strategy. I am firmly convinced that the  ISiT is a viable, pioneering concept. The institute will work  at the interface between public research facilities and  corporate research, focusing on technologies that integrate not  just circuits but whole microsystems with various functions --  mechanical, electrical, optical, or chemical -- into silicon.    The user industry in Germany needs guaranteed, timely, and  formality-free access to these microelectronic systems. The  technical skills required to master the large number of  difficult technical processes involved in producing these  application-specific components ought to be preserved in  Germany. The ISiT provides research capacity primarily for  firms that cannot embark on long- term research of their own,  nor wish to do so; primarily small and medium-sized enterprises,  I imagine. I hope that industry will take up this offer and  play an active role in shaping the institute's future program.  <H5>  Great Opportunities for Regional Growth </H5>   Once the investment phase, funded, in accordance with the  successful Fraunhofer Society model, by the federal and land  governments, has been concluded, the ISiT will earn its living  on the contract research market. The institute's long-term  future lies in the entrepreneurial responsibility of the  Fraunhofer Society. The success of the ISiT will contribute to  the development of a successful microelectronics research scene  in Germany, which will enable Germany to claim its share in  future markets. As a country with high labor costs, Germany can  only safeguard its prosperity if it is at the forefront of  international technical development.    The production of high-technology goods creates great  opportunities for regional growth, which should be exploited.  Achieving this goal requires a joint effort in all quarters. It  is essential that targets and strategies be established on a  joint basis. An unconventional example of how this can succeed  has been achieved with the establishment of the ISiT.</p>

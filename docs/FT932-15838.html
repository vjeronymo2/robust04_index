			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise of UK tractor sales cheers equipment industry TRACTOR sales in the UK rose by 13 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, raising hopes that the equipment industry might enjoy a better year after sales reached a record low in 1992. According to the Agricultural Equipment Association, tractor registrations reached 3,910 units in the first three months of this year, up 13 per cent on a year earlier. Registrations for 1992 were 14,296. Investment in machinery had been running at very low levels in recent years, leading to a real need to re-equip, but uncertainty over reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Gatt negotiations had held the market back. Improved farm incomes last year plus lower interest charges on farm borrowing have brightened prospects but the real stimulus has been the higher agricultural support prices resulting from devaluation of the Green Pound, says the association. Mr Chris Evans, its economist, said there had been a change of mood over the past two months. Earlier, uncertainty about the future seemed to be the main concern for farmers. In March, however, there was a surge of orders. The association remains cautious on equipment prospects.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXANS PICK MAYORS; EL PASO RUNOFF SEEN  </P> <P> The mayors of Dallas and Ft. Worth easily won reelection Saturday, and San  Antonio's former mayor regained her office by a commanding margin as elections  were held in four Texas cities.  </P> <P> The least predictable contest appeared to be for mayor in El Paso, where  political observers forecast a runoff from the six-candidate race.  </P> <P> In Dallas, with 151 of 299 precincts reporting, Mayor Annette Strauss had 73%  of the vote to 20% for attorney Peter Lesser.  </P> <P> In San Antonio, former Mayor Lila Cockrell won with 59% of the vote to 31% for  insurance executive Carl Mauthe.  </P> <P> Cockrell, who was mayor of San Antonio from 1975 to 1981, was supported by the  man who replaced her, Henry G. Cisneros, a leading Latino political figure.  Cisneros, beset by personal problems, decided against seeking a fifth term.  </P> <P> Ft. Worth Mayor Bob Bolen, who faced no serious opposition in his bid for a  fourth two-year term, won with 89% of the tally.  </P> <P> In El Paso, with only absentee ballots counted, City Council member Suzy Azar  had 32% of the vote total to 27% for Mayor Pro Tem Ed Elsey. The other four  candidates did not receive significant votes. If no one gets a majority of the  vote, the top two finishers will face off May 27.  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Ex-BCCI manager to face charges Mr Swaleh Naqvi, formerly the second ranking manager at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is expected to be charged with fraud by the US authorities and stand trial later this year, the US Justice Department said yesterday. Mr Naqvi will face Federal fraud charges brought in the District of Columbia, Mr Gerald Stern, the Justice Department's special counsel for financial institution fraud, said. If acquitted there, Mr Naqvi could then face separate charges brought in state courts in New York, Georgia and Florida, Mr Stern added. The move follows the agreement reached over the weekend between the US authorities and the Abu Dhabi government. Under this, a civil action against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, the Abu Dhabi ruler, is to be dropped in exchange for allowing US prosecutors access to Mr Naqvi. The prosecution would be the first to be brought in the US against a senior Bank of Credit and Commerce International official. It follows last year's acquittal of Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer accused of fraud over the BCCI takeover of First American, and the dropping of charges against Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary. The deal will also give a kickstart to US inquiries into others suspected in the BCCI fraud, which have stalled in recent months. Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, has agreed to hand US investigators the 'Naqvi files', representing more than 1m papers which detailing how BCCI perpetrated one of the biggest banking frauds in history. Mr Naqvi has been under house arrest in Abu Dhabi since late in 1991. He will be handed over to the US authorities within 120 days. In legal moves in London, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former chief operating officer in London of National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, yesterday issued a High Court writ claiming up to Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds 7bn) from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The Sheikh alleges that both the authority and its senior official, Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, were knowing parties to BCCI carrying on its business with the intention of defrauding creditors. The action is in effect seeking an indemnity for Sheikh Mahfouz in the event of Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, winning a civil action against him for Dollars 10.5bn.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, climbing back above 3,100, but trading volume remained woefully thin, writes Jeffrey Brown. The market passed a listless morning but picked up once Wall Street came into the picture. There was a reasonable two-way business from 3pm onwards but contract numbers stayed low. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,101 at the close of put trading, up 28 points. The premium to the cash market was around 13 points, with fair value some 6 points. A number of major houses, notably NatWest and GNI, were in action during the afternoon but contract numbers totalled just 8,545, little better than the 8,073 traded on Friday when large parts of the Continent were closed. In late, screen trading the December future moved ahead a few more points to 3,108 but again there was no real enthusiasm, with contract numbers for the day staying under 10,000. Stock option activity was also little changed from Friday, with 31,163 contracts dealt, against 31,129. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for 23,000 lots. Lonrho was again far and away the busiest individual stock option, turning over 2,350 lots. J. Sainsbury (855 contracts) and BT (530) were also active.</p>

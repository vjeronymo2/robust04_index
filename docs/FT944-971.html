			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Private-sector initiatives for swaps taking shape - Laurie Morse examines two schemes in the US The push to make the private bank market in swaps and other derivatives more transparent and easily tracked is gaining momentum in the US, where the Federal Reserve has openly advocated a swaps clearing house, and where two private-sector initiatives are taking shape. Those initiatives, being undertaken separately by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), promise to blur further the lines between the standard definitions of commodities, securities and banking activities. The most ambitious of the proposals, a two-year-old initiative by the CBoT, is still held up in a controversial filing at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the exchange's chief regulator. The CBoT is proposing a centralised body that would guarantee the private trades of member dealers, limiting the systemic credit risks inherent in the over-the-counter market. The biggest swaps dealers are lukewarm towards the CBoT proposal, because they rely on their top-quality credit ratings to bring them the lion's share of the world's derivatives dealings. A clearing house that would guarantee the credit quality of all trades - the cornerstone of listed derivatives markets - would eliminate the dealers' credit advantage. The CBoT last week modified its proposal to the CFTC. The modifications would still involve the CBoT in clearing as well as valuing swaps transactions. The agency is likely to require many more revisions before the CBoT initiative can progress. Two weeks ago the CME said it would open a swaps collateral depository that would serve some valuation and global custody needs of the OTC derivatives market, but would stop short of guaranteeing trades. Explaining the decision not to clear swaps trades, Mr Jack Sandner, the CME's chairman, said: 'The big dealers like JP Morgan and Bankers Trust are our biggest (futures market) customers. They bring us a lot of business and we don't want them to think we're competing with them. The idea of a (swaps) clearing house would be embraced wholeheartedly by the smaller players, but we've decided it is not up to us to level that playing field.' Mindful of the obstacle the CBoT has encountered at the CFTC, the CME is planning to snub its chief regulator. It hopes to set up its global custody facility as a trust company, independent of the exchange, and is seeking regulatory oversight from the US Federal Reserve. Avoiding CFTC regulation for the swaps custody operation is crucial to its success, CME insiders say. They fear none of the big swaps dealers will come to the table if they are required to report to the CFTC, as well as banking and securities regulators. CME officials claim that a non-clearing swaps custody operation can be unregulated. However, they are seeking the Fed's imprimatur to give the facility international credibility. Privately, they also say that if they were successful with the swaps custody business, it would be a small jump into clearing. 'At that stage, we'd want the Fed as regulator,' says one CME official. The CME facility will be for dealer-to-dealer transactions only, and will not serve end-users. The technical considerations in consolidating the valuation and collateralisation of OTC derivatives trades, let alone clearing them, are daunting. Although both futures exchanges have long histories of guaranteeing listed derivatives and handling the vast amounts of collateral, over-the-counter trades have far more variables, and are much less easily accounted for. Furthermore, dealers already have sophisticated bilateral systems for tracking collateral and valuing trades and their concurrent risk exposures. To be successful, the exchange efforts would have to be less expensive than those existing systems. The CME and CBoT plans are aimed predominantly at interest rate swaps. Since derivative dealers must have custody arrangements for their entire portfolio, this one-product approach might make the facilities less attractive, industry sources say. On the other hand, 'there is no question there are opportunities for economies of scale' in a centralised swaps-tracking facility,' says one trader for a large dealer. Some of those economies are controversial, and are being discussed gingerly by the exchanges. One of these, cross-margining, would allow interest rate exposures on exchange-traded futures to be netted against swaps exposures tracked by the derivatives clearing house. If allowed, it would vastly reduce bank capital requirements, and be a powerful incentive for dealers to participate in a centralised facility.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are 28 days left until the election and the  political debate, a task which until now has been entrusted to  the party leaders, is becoming ever more lively and sharp.  Marco Fritella reports:    [Fritella] Sure -- no, very sure -- of victory, the leaders  nevertheless continue to argue without even taking a pause. In  other words there is continual bickering on the Right. We will  end up like Renzo's capons [as heard], said Pierferdinando  Casini, leader of the Christian Democrat Center party, inviting  the parties to call a truce. However, no one is willing.  Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, said that  the Northern League will lose votes, in fact it will collapse,  and after the elections Umberto Bossi would be left holding a  worse hand than before. Bossi retorted during the presentation  of the League's manifesto that Fini was and remains a fascist,  and as for Forza Italia, it is an instrument of the old regime.  He said that the League had made a pact with Silvio Berlusconi  only because otherwise the party's vote would have split.  Raffaele Costa from the Liberal Party observed rather worriedly  that a little more unity was necessary.    The reality is that both the Right and the Left have created  artificial alliances which will shatter immediately, Giorgio La  Malfa, secretary of the Republican Party, maintained, weighing  in for the center parties.    The Left has breathed a sigh of relief at the fact that  today  Fausto Bertinotti, secretary of Communist Renewal, said that he  wanted at all costs to maintain the unity of the progressive  alignment. It is a pity then that he has different ideas on  treasury bonds and NATO from the other members of the alignment.  However, the Right means reaction, Lucio Magri and Armando  Cossutta, of Communist Renewal, stated, and so it is necessary  to stick together.    And what of Achille Occhetto? Tomorrow he is leaving for  Brussels and NATO headquarters -- the umbrella which was so  liked by Enrico Berlinguer [former Communist Party leader].</p>

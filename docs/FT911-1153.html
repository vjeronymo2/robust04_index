			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: High profile for Mexican sell-offs THE high profile of newly-privatised Mexican companies in the international capital market has been maintained with a Dollars 425m bond issue by Cemex, the formerly state-owned cement company. The issue is the biggest bond offering by a Latin American private sector company since the early 1980s. The bond issue, lead managed by JP Morgan, was launched last week as Mr Pedro Aspe, the Mexican finance minister, was in London to promote the final stages of the privatisation of Telmex, the country's telephone operator. The government is reducing its stake in Telmex from 26 per cent to 12 per cent through an international offering of shares. The share sale, which is expected to raise around Dollars 2bn, is among the largest international equity offerings. It is also the first time a developing country has used an international share sale to privatise a state-sector company. In December, control of Telmex passed to a consortium led by Mexican businessman Mr Carlos Slim Helu and backed by Southwestern Bell of the US and France Telecom, the French state-owned operator. The international share sale, co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs, involves the offering of 25m American Depository Shares, each representing 20 non-voting shares in Telmex. In addition, 40m ADS packages are being sold in the US and 5m in Japan. The shares will be priced later this month. The stock comes on a strong recommendation from equity analysts at Salomon Brothers. A research document published this week by Salomon analysts Ms Stephanie Georges and Mr Richard Ryder said Telmex offered 'an attractive investment opportunity because of the outlook for formidable expansion of the local telephone network and its usage; the stock also represents a reasonable proxy for growth prospects in Mexico'. In London, Mr Aspe said that 138 companies had been privatised since President Carlos Salinas came to power in 1988 and that a further 67 companies remained to be privatised. He added that seven of Mexico's 18 state-owned banks should be in private sector control by the end of this year. The government currently holds a 64 per cent stake in the banks, the rest being held private sector stockholders. After privatisation, foreign banks will be allowed to own up to 30 per cent of a Mexican bank or financial services holding company. However, Mr Aspe said it had not been decided whether the bank privatisations would include an international offering of equity. The 18 banks had total assets of 190,000bn pesos (Dollars 60.9bn) at the end of June 1990, about 70 per cent of which are held by Banamex, Bancomer and Banca Serfin - the three dominant players. Banamex is one of the seven banks that will be privatised later this year. Last week's bond issue by Cemex may have set a benchmark for other Latin American companies looking to tap the international market. The paper carries a coupon of 9.41 per cent and was launched at a discount to face value to yield 15 per cent. This compares with a yield of around 10 per cent on a recent Dollars 125m bond issue, also lead managed by JP Morgan, for Nacional Financiera, the Mexican government development bank. JP Morgan said that around Dollars 180bn of the Dollars 425m Cemex issue was placed in the US under Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a. Buyers included institutions with no previous exposure to Mexican companies.</p>

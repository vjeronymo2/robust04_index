			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> POLICY ON VIET REFUGEES TIGHTENED  </P> <P> The Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations announced today that Vietnamese refugees  arriving in their countries will no longer automatically qualify for  resettlement.  </P> <P> In other words, those who cannot prove they are fleeing political persecution  will be returned to Vietnam. A Foreign Ministry statement said the new policy  will take effect Tuesday "and will be applied region-wide." Since Vietnam "boat  people" began fleeing their country a decade ago, all the ASEAN countries --  Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore and the Philippines -- have  accepted any Vietnamese who arrived as a refugee.  </P> <P> Refugees were given temporary asylum and put into camps to await resettlement  by the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other Western nations.  </P></p>

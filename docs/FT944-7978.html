			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Soros pulls out of UK property market Mr George Soros, the international financier, is pulling out of UK commercial property only 18 months after announcing plans to make a 'long-term' investment of up to Pounds 250m. He is selling British Land the 50 per cent it does not already own in their joint venture in the UK property market for Pounds 142m in cash. Quantum UK Realty, the offshore fund set as the vehicle for the investment, is effectively being wound up. The joint venture has spent Pounds 600m building a commercial property portfolio since June 1993. Mr Soros said yesterday: 'Although we are satisfied with the real estate portfolio assembled in co-operation with British Land, as investment advisers we . . . consider that more attractive long-term investment opportunities have opened up since the joint venture was formed.' Many of the funds run by Mr Soros have had a difficult year as a result of turbulence in currency and bond markets. Shares in his flagship Quantum fund have fallen from Dollars 25,282 to Dollars 19,670 during 1994. The 200 shareholders in Quantum UK Realty, mostly wealthy individuals and institutions which invest in other Quantum funds, are expected to receive around Pounds 109 for every Pounds 100 invested last year. Shares in the fund had been trading at around Pounds 102, a discount to net asset value. Quantum funds have traditionally traded at a premium to net assets. Quantum said that the discount was not acceptable to shareholders. British Land and Quantum originally planned to invest Pounds 250m each in the joint venture, which was expected to run until 2003. Quantum also bought 5 per cent stake British Land which it said was a long-term holding. These shares were sold in July at a 35 per cent profit. Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said: 'We have got the other half of a portfolio which we already know inside out at a good price and with no acquisition costs.' Included in the portfolio is a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, the property developer which owns half of London's Broadgate office complex and which is in refinancing negotiations. Although British Land's gearing is expected to rise to more than 80 per cent, Mr Ritblat said that the company had substantial credit lines at its disposal and was still interested in buying Broadgate. Property shares fell back yesterday. British Land's was among the hardest hit, falling 3 per cent to 384p. Lex, Page 24</p>

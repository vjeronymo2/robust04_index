			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Multilateral trade proposal must not be forgotten in Gatt talks Sir, The struggle over the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade between the European Community and the US continues. Yet while the detail of agricultural subsidies receives extensive coverage, an accompanying proposal to create the new Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) has been given scant attention. As representatives of leading environment and development organisations in the UK, we urge immediate action to rectify this. We are extremely concerned that the proposal for an MTO which would govern some Dollars 6,000bn of world trade - or over a quarter of the world's GNP - has been published in an ambiguous and flimsy annex to the Gatt draft final act, and without the benefit of full public debate. As it stands, the MTO will simply come into being on completion of the Uruguay Round. We recognise the need for new institutional arrangements governing world trade. The Gatt is not equipped to deal with the increasing complexity of trade. However, the current MTO proposal just institutionalises many of the faults inherent in the current system of trade. A new trade institution must be equipped to ensure that trade contributes to the protection of the environment and human health and the eradication of poverty. The MTO should incorporate a legal commitment to sustainable development and mechanisms to integrate trade with environment and development policies. Without these, the social and environmental costs of any boost in trade will be intolerable. We believe that such critical issues merit wide public debate. We therefore ask for the government to give full publicity to the text of the proposed MTO, and urge parliament to undertake a full debate on the setting up of the MTO before the completion of the Gatt negotiations.

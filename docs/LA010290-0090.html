			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WILDLIFE. THE FIGHT FOR SPACE. ;  </P> <P> AS HOMES MARCH UP HILLSIDES AND OFFICES SPROUT ON FIELDS, ORANGE COUNTY'S  WILDLIFE BATTLES FOR ITS DWINDLNG HABITAT.;  </P> <P> AUDUBON, IRVINE CO. PROTECT THE HERONS  </P> <P> Peter Bloom used to watch the great blue herons on Irvine Lake when he played  there as a child.  </P> <P> Today, Bloom is vice president of the Sea and Sage chapter of the Audubon  Society and he is working with the Irvine Co. on a plan to build new homes in  his childhood playground without disturbing the county's largest colony of the  giant, graceful birds.  </P> <P> Bloom and Ginny Chester, also of the Audubon Society, helped negotiate the East  Orange General Plan, which was approved by the Orange City Council in December,  so that the Irvine Co.'s development plans would not endanger the heron.  </P> <P> At Bloom's suggestion, the company agreed to relocate two housing tracts and  preserve 200 acres of wild oak groves near the proposed Limestone Canyon  Regional Park. It also agreed to a five-year study and relocation plan for a  colony of great blue herons that nest on the north shore of the lake where the  company wants to build a road.  </P> <P> About 30 pairs of herons nest in sycamore and oak trees along the shore of the  Irvine Lake, also known as Santiago Reservoir. The Irvine Co. has agreed to  either get the birds to move to new nests or abandon its plans to build a road  there, said Lee Jones, resource specialist for Michael Brandman Associates,  which prepared the environmental impact report for the development.  </P> <P> In the study, biologists will determine where the herons eat, how many are  breeding successfully and where they go in the winter. They will also  coordinate the study with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the state  Department of Fish and Game, Jones said. Leg bands will be placed on the young  birds to keep track of them, he said.  </P> <P> After studying the birds, the biologists hope to encourage the herons to nest  somewhere else, either along the southwest edge of the lake, on an island in  the lake or elsewhere in Orange County.  </P> <P> In Orange County, herons are found along the Santa Ana River, Bolsa Chica  Reserve, Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Marsh, Anaheim Lake and Dana Point  Harbor. Bloom said the Irvine Lake rookery is the largest in the county.  </P> <P> Jones said the relocation program might include the planting of vegetation at  other sites and the use of nesting platforms or heron decoys to encourage the  birds to breed elsewhere.  </P> <P> After monitoring the new nesting site for three years and conducting annual  counts of the breeding colonies, biologists will decide whether they can  develop in the area without damaging the heron colony.  </P> <P> Under an agreement between the Audubon Society and the Irvine Co., the road  could be built if at least 50% of the birds from the Irvine Lake rookery are  nesting elsewhere. If not, the company could continue the relocation program or  abandon its plans to build the road.  </P> <P> "If the Irvine Co. does this right, meaning funding the study properly, this  could be a one-of-a-kind study," Bloom said. Not much is known about the habits  of great blue herons, he said.  </P> <P> Adult great blue herons stand three to four feet high, with a wing span of  about six feet. Sometimes mistaken for cranes, herons can be distinguished from  other birds by the U-shape of their neck in flight.  </P> <P> Although they were hunted for their colorful blue-gray plumage earlier in the  century, great blue herons are not now listed as endangered or threatened. But  biologists say that development has reduced the habitat of herons, putting them  at risk. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

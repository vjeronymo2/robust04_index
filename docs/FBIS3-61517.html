			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Semenov, under the title: RThe Fruits of </F> Abortions: The Transplantation of Human Embryonal Tissues:  TKnow-howU and EthicsS, under the rubric: RWhatUs New in  MedicineS]    [Text] An International Institute of Biological Medicine  [MIBM] has been created at the Russian Scientific Research  Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology.  Investigations and treatment of patients suffering, as commonly  believed, from incurable and fatal illnesses, e.g., Down  syndrome, diabetes, ParkinsonUs disease, AlzheimerUs disease,  and many others, including various immune system deficiency  syndromes, will treated in it. Doctor of Medical Sciences,  Professor Gennadiy Sukhikh, who has become its General Director,  has headed the Institute. The transplantation of human embryonal  tissues is the method of treatment of so extensive spectrum of  diseases.    The first studies in this sphere appeared as far back as the  1920s, and moreover, in the USSR, recounted Chairman of the  Council of the MIBM, Dr. Michael Molnar, an American of  Hungarian extraction. But due to the exceptionally powerful  anti-abortion movement in the US and Western Europe,  governmental support of research projects, including the use of  human fetal tissues, is so restricted that the progress achieved  by Western medicine in this field is very slight for practical  purposes. As a result, the development of new treatment  technologies along these lines has not been noted. Russia is a  different business.S    Russia is in fact a different business. Abortions had  already  been permitted in the Soviet Union for several decades, and  until the present, have unfortunately remained the main method  for the regulation of the birth rate; this is supported by the  existing public health system. About four million abortions are  carried out annually within the walls of medical establishments,  and presumably as many criminal abortions. Thus, the resources  of human embryonal tissues which are intended for use in the  MIBM are comparable only with the reserves of oil and gas.    At first there were funds, and facilities, equipment, and  personnel as well. The Russian Scientific Research Center of  Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Health and the Biocellular Research  Organization, Ltd. (USA) created the Russian joint-stock  company, RMIBMS, officially registered in Russia. The charter  fund was distributed in the following manner: Biocellular  Research Organization, Ltd. - 51 per cent; Center - 49 per cent.  Such a distribution of contributions will undoubted be  reflected, sooner or later, in the economic policy of the MIBM  and the level of interference in its affairs of the Russian  Ministry of Health.    The Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology is a  recognized leader in the country in this field, and it has been  entrusted with the development of medical indications and  technologies for the interruption of pregnancy at various points  of the gestation period. It has been decided that the Department  of Human Reproduction will supply the MIBM with the necessary  quantity of embryonal tissues and carry on medical research and  the treatment of patients.    The obligations of the Biocellular Research Organization  include the equipping of the laboratory for the isolation and  preparation of the fetal tissues for the purpose of their  subsequent transplantation.    Leading specialists of Russia, Europe, and the USA form the  medical personnel of the MIBM. A Scientific Consultation Council  has been formed, consisting of 15 major scholars of various  fields of medicine, the overwhelming majority of whom are  members of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. An agreement  has been reached with the Russian GovernmentUs Medical Center  regarding the use of its facilities. Thus, there is no doubt  that the Institute's development will not encounter serious  impediments, regardless of the contentions and objections of  ethicists, legal scholars, and the church. Is this for good or  ill? The dispute has already heated up. The German magazine, Die  Stern declared the following in its article on the work of the  MIBM: In the majority of countries the use of fetal cells for  these purposes is generally prohibited out of the considerations  of elementary ethics. And those scientific centers which conduct  research along these lines utilize individual embryos... which  the obtain after the decision of competent commissions, with  observation of all ethical norms and with the full and voluntary  consent of the women. Moreover, the German journalists accused  MIBM specialists of using five-month fetuses.    The Director of the Russian Scientific Research Center  [RNITs], Vladimir Kulakov, has been compelled to justify himself  and to prove that only nonviable embryos, weighing up to 500 g,  the results either of spontaneous abortions or medical  abortions, have been used for medical purposes. Such  manipulations with embryos that have not reached the  half-kilogram boundary do not contradict either Russian law or  the international system of calculating infant mortality.  Previously this valuable biological material was simply liable  to be thrown out.    The Russian Ministry of Health has granted the Institute the  right of expert review in the field of transplantation of human  fetal tissues. The new technology has also obtained in the RF  governmentUs Department of Medicine.    The mechanism of treatment has not yet been studied  completely. Nevertheless, there already are available, in the  words of MIBM researchers, statistics and clinical data that  indicate the high degree of effectiveness of preparations of  embryonal tissues.    We have at our disposal Tknow-howU which enables us both to  store and to prepare tissues for transplantation, says Gennadiy  Sukhikh. They are reduced to pharmaceutical form (something like  a jelly) and are placed in test-tubes, from which the material  for injection is taken.    We obtain liver, pancreatic, brain, kidney tissue... Up to  27  types of tissues are used. Special preservative solutions are  added.    Preliminarily we carry out histological, biochemical, and  virological analyses. Testing for the presence of hepatitides,  HIV infection, and syphilis is obligatory. The list of analyses  will be expanded continually.    RA preparation from a specific types of tissues or their  combination is administered to a patient, depending upon his  illness.    RWhat is the percent of useful outcome out of the total  volume of tissue you obtain?S    RI thinks 10-15 percent. But, taking the effectiveness of  the  preparations into account, that is not so low. For the treatment  of burns, for example, there is enough tissue from one fetus;  three to four fetuses may be required for the treatment of  female infertility, when there is the possibility of  compensating the ovaries.    How many first-class fetuses does the Institute need in  a year?    About 500 abortions are required. There already is an  agreement with several of the capital's regional antenatal  clinics. When the system will be organized and the women  recognize that the abortion can be done at the highest medical  level, without detriment to reproductive function, the problem  of supplying the Institute will be solved. However, at first we  expect some shortage.    Physicians throughout the word are struggling to reduce  the number of abortions, while today it seems that you are  interested in increasing their number. Isn't this amoral?  The number of abortions in the world and here in Russia will  decrease. This is inevitable. And our interest infetal tissue  will hardly affect the statistics. Moreover, humanity will never  entirely relinquish abortions.    Do you not fear criticism of your activities?    What we are doing of course destroys many moral stereotypes.  But we are physicians, and thus, rationalists.    Aren't you in danger of the fact that commercialization  of this type of treatment may lead to moral catastrophe, or even  to crimes?    Human embryonal tissues will never be the object of  commerce,  since this field has always been under the professional control  of the health protection system. That means that nowhere and to  no one should the thought occur that abortions could at some  time become an object from which material benefit is extracted,  if medical science discovers an opportunity for the use of human  embryonal tissues in treatment technologies.    All of our pediatric patients will be hospitalized together  with their parents in the pediatric unit of the Central Clinical  Hospital of the Russian Government's Medical Center. Adult  patients will undergo treatment in the corresponding departments  of the Central Clinical Hospital [TKB], which, from the point of  view of its material and technical level, is equipped and  staffed in accordance with the standards of the US and the  countries of Western Europe.    RI would like to note that the WHO has been familiar with  our  project since the beginning of its existence, follows its  development, collaborates with us at present, and intends to  preserve it in the future. When the methodology will be  definitively developed and standardized, the WHO may recognize  the MIBM as a collaborative center.</p>

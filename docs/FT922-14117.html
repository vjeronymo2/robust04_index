			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Volatile Fujimori's step back is a lonely one: The air of a return to the bad old days in much of Latin America is more apparent than real THE dissolution of Peru's congress by President Alberto Fujimori, two months after a failed military coup in Venezuela, has re-awakened images of Latin America's autocratic past. The Peruvian president's apparent extra-constitutional act also cast a pall over the general air of optimism surrounding the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. The meeting yesterday celebrated an important debt breakthrough for Argentina, the region's third-largest debtor after Brazil and Mexico, but was left pondering the problems for democracy in the region created by the economic reform movements that have swept the continent. However, the air of a return to the bad old days is more apparent than real. Latin America, unlike in the 1970s, is overwhelmingly a democratic continent. The Rio Group of the 11 main Latin American governments joined the widespread unequivocal international condemnation of Mr Fujimori's move. 'It's become very hard to argue in Latin America that you are taking extra-constitutional action for a good cause,' said one official in Santo Domingo. There is a significant similarity between Peru and Venezuela - in all South America they have perhaps the most underdeveloped political systems. One academic in Washington last week described Venezuela as 'a city state with an oil well'. The very idea of the nation is very weak in Peru. However, an unravelling of the events in Peru and Venezuela, where a high level of anxiety continues about further military challenges to the government of President Carlos Andres Perez, shows important differences. The Venezuelan coup attempt was triggered in large part by special factors in the military largely unrelated to the government's economic programme supported by the International Monetary Fund. Events may yet derail the programme, but there appears to be a strong realisation that if there were compromises to satisfy perceived political pressure, there would be costs to other parts of society. In Peru on the other hand, if Mr Fujimori's statements are to be believed, the actions of this elected leader were taken to defend and deepen his economic programme. The condemnation of his move externally contrasts strongly with the apparently favourable reaction inside the country. Nonetheless, Mr Fujimori's attempt to deepen economic reform may well be frustrated by the suspension of aid and other financial and technical assistance from important donors, in particular the US and Japan. Unless he moves quickly to restore constitutional order, Peru risks becoming once more as isolated internationally as it was under the populist government of President Alan Garcia. In this respect, the international community can have a significant influence. Peru is heavily dependent on newly re-established financial flows from the international community and the threat of effective sanctions could have a significant impact. This may provide some comfort to governments all over a continent that has been wringing its hands over the inability to restore Haiti's short-lived democracy. This sense of helplessness had been reinforced by the hypothetical difficulties which many saw in putting international pressure on a military government in Venezuela. Since Venezuela is the second-largest supplier of oil to the US and is the US's second-largest market in Latin America, sanctions against it would have a far greater economic cost to Washington than the action taken against an economically-backward Haiti. In short, unless Mr Fujimori's action was meant either to pre-empt the army or to be short-lived, he may have miscalculated. He has a reputation as a lonely and volatile man: outbursts at the recent Latin American drugs summit in San Antonio, Texas, surprised the other leaders present. 'Fujimori is no Machiavelli,' said one Peruvian in Santo Domingo yesterday.</p>

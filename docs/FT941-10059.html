			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Driver warning scheme approved A Pounds 16m scheme of advance signs to help drivers avoid traffic jams on motorway links to the Midlands was announced by Mr Robert Key, roads minister, yesterday. Variable message signs will be installed at 20 important junctions to provide motorists with information about road conditions. The signs will be installed over a three-year period on the M1, M6, M11, M25, M40 and M42 motorways as well as on the A1 and A604/A14 between Cambridge and the M1. Feasibility studies have shown that benefits in time saved by drivers would cover the cost of the scheme.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETROIT FEELING THE PINCH IN BRAZIL;  </P> <P> AUTOMOBILES: THE FREEZE IN AUTO OPERATIONS BY BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT IS HURTING GM  AND FORD, WHICH HAVE MAJOR OPERATIONS THERE.  </P> <P> With their Brazilian automotive operations frozen in place for the last three  weeks, General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen are suddenly relearning an old  lesson -- that there can be a downside to going global.  </P> <P> The three auto giants, which dominate Brazil's auto industry, have been forced  to shut down all of their car and truck assembly lines throughout the country  since Brazil's Draconian anti-inflation measures were put in place by the  nation's new president. Overnight, the idlings brought to a complete standstill  a huge industry that normally produces 600,000 cars and 200,000 trucks a year.  </P> <P> As a result, Ford and Volkswagen, which have merged their Brazilian operations  into a large joint venture called Autolatina, have been forced to furlough  28,000 workers with full pay and now have just 17,000 employees still on the  job.  </P> <P> GM, meanwhile, has laid off, with pay, most of its 21,000 workers in the  country. GM's only manufacturing operation that has not shut down there is a  factory that produces car engines for export to the United States.  </P> <P> "Our sales in Brazil have been non-existent," said Ronald Theis, a spokesman  for GM's international operations.  </P> <P> Already, Ford and GM are starting to feel the pinch on the bottom line. For  Ford, Brazil represents one of its largest foreign markets outside of Europe --  its Autolatina venture accounts for 58% of Brazilian car sales. For GM,  meanwhile, its 210,000 sales of cars and trucks in Brazil account for nearly  10% of its total overseas sales of 2.4 million vehicles per year.  </P> <P> GM has yet to comment officially on how Brazil will affect earnings, but  earlier this week, Ford told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that  the economic crisis could have a "substantial adverse effect on Ford's  earnings" worldwide.  </P> <P> Ford officials on Tuesday refused to say just how big an impact there will be.  But Wall Street analysts said that if the shutdown lasted for the rest of 1990,  Ford and GM would stand to lose anywhere from $400 million to $700 million  apiece.  </P> <P> But even if they reopen their plants soon, the dramatic reduction in buying  power among most Brazilians that will result from the anti-inflation program is  almost certain to prompt a long-term slump in Brazilian car sales.  </P> <P> Their Brazilian troubles could hardly have come at a worse time for GM and  Ford, which have become increasingly reliant on overseas earnings to offset the  slump in U.S. car sales.  </P> <P> Tuesday's announcement by the Brazilian government that it plans to unfreeze  some funds so that consumers can take delivery of new cars already on order  when the anti-inflation measures were imposed was greeted cautiously by the  auto makers. The government said it would unfreeze funds previously locked into  auto "consortiums," a complex retail system that accounts for more than half of  Brazil's car sales and that grew up as a result of Brazil's fierce  hyper-inflation.  </P> <P> Industry officials said they don't believe the liberalization will allow  potential car buyers to place any new orders for cars in Brazil, and so it  isn't likely to speed the industry's recovery. "Both of them need overseas  profits to protect themselves against cyclicality here," noted Raymond Mucci,  an automotive analyst with Baird Patrick in New York.  </P> <P> The severity of Brazil's inflation-fighting measures -- especially the dramatic  shut-off of liquidity and credit by the nation's central bank -- has apparently  caught the major auto makers off guard, and officials at both GM and Ford  acknowledged that they don't know how long they can keep their workers on full  pay while they sit at home.  </P> <P> Rex Greenslade, a spokesman for Ford's international operations, said  Autolatina has tentatively scheduled to resume operations on April 23. But he  conceded that the joint venture's shutdown has so far been extended on a  week-to-week basis and could be continued if economic conditions in the country  remain unchanged.  </P> <P> "It is almost a day-to-day thing," said GM's Theis. "When we will start back up  has not been determined. And how long we can keep paying people is a good  question."  </P></p>

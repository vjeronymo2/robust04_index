			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The price of knowledge - Bethan Hutton on ways for parents to meet soaring university costs IF YOUR child started at senior school this week, finding the money for an eventual university course might not be uppermost in your mind. But, as growing numbers of teenagers opt to stay in full-time education after age 18 and more parents need to find thousands of pounds for a student offspring's living costs, now could be the time to start planning. While you can choose whether to pay fees for an independent school, you will not have a similar choice about paying for your child's living expenses when it comes to university: grants are means-tested and based on parents' gross income, with deductions allowed for interest on mortgages up to Pounds 30,000, and some other expenses eligible for tax relief. Parents with a joint residual income of more than about Pounds 14,000 must start contributing to their children's maintenance at university. With an income of more than about Pounds 33,000, they must meet one child's full costs. Some parents may have been alarmed by the London School of Economics' announcement earlier this year that it was considering charging students (or their parents) top-up tuition fees. While the proposal was rejected, the possibility remains for other institutions. Later this month, the Committee of University Vice-chancellors and Principals is due to discuss four proposals to change the way higher education is funded, all of which would involve graduates paying for courses in some way. The option most likely to be favoured is one based on the recently-introduced Australian system where students take out a loan - either interest-free or with a low rate - to pay tuition fees in advance. These are provided by the government and they are paid back through the national insurance or tax system once students graduate and find jobs. Graduates on low incomes can defer payment. In the UK now, most students struggle to manage even with a full grant (now Pounds 2,845 in London and Pounds 2,265 elsewhere) and the maximum student loan (Pounds 940 in London, Pounds 800 elsewhere). Total state support has not kept pace with inflation, particularly when social security benefits are considered - students can no longer claim income support during vacations, or housing benefit. Grants for students in London are weighted to take account of higher housing costs, but rents can be almost as high in some other university towns, such as Brighton and Oxford, where students get no extra help. If you are the kind of parent who would prefer to shield your children from such debt, you could have to find Pounds 4,000 or more per student a year - similar to independent day school fees. Tuition fees, if imposed, could push up costs to the level of exclusive boarding schools. Financial planning for school fees has spawned its own small industry. Planning for university costs is not yet so widespread, but interest is growing as more parents realise how much they are likely to have to spend. Specialist school fee advisers usually can help with higher education, as can most non-specialist independent financial advisers. Making provisions in advance can also reduce the amount you actually pay if you make the right choice of investments. Flexibility is greatest if you can start planning at least 10 years in advance; but even five years ahead, you can take advantage of some tax-free savings schemes. The range of products to consider will depend on each family's circumstances, but it usually includes personal equity plans (Peps), pensions, building society accounts, tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), National Savings, unit and investment trusts, and with-profits endowment policies. Some insurance companies offer educational planning advice, but their solutions tend to be biased towards endowment policies rather than using the full range of investments available to independent financial advisers. Advisers stress the importance of diversifying, and tend to emphasise less risky investments. Tony Murrell, of financial adviser Fraser Marr, usually goes mainly for low-risk products, even for parents starting to save very early on. He does not recommend that more than 50 per cent of the portfolio should be put into equity-based investments - the stock market has a nasty habit of taking a dive just as parents need to draw on their investment. Charles Levitt-Scrivener, divisional director of Towry Law, which has produced an information sheet on planning for university costs, says parents of potential university students can be divided into three categories: low earners, whose children are likely to get a full grant; medium earners, who will have to pay some maintenance; and high earners, whose children probably will not be eligible for any grant assistance. He says the first group is unlikely to be able to save much, even if it wants to provide additional support on top of the grant to keep its children out of debt. Planning is a realistic possibility for the second group, but care must be taken that savings do not reduce the amount of grant assessable. Tax-free investments - such as Peps, Tessas, with-profits endowments and some forms of National Savings - should be used as far as possible. Those in the third group must resign themselves to paying the full costs but planning can make things easier. The range of possibilities is similar to the second group, with the addition of some of the more sophisticated investment options, such as offshore roll-up funds. Levitt-Scrivener says these can be useful because no tax is payable during the lifetime of the investment. If the parents make a gift of the investment to their children, tax will be assessed against their income when the investment is cashed - and this income will usually be low enough to avoid paying tax. The two main National Savings products recommended are the yearly plan and children's bonds, both of which are tax-free if held for five years. The yearly plan allows parents to save up to Pounds 400 a month for 12 months, while the maximum deposit in the children's bond, available to under-16s, is Pounds 1,000. Tessas, available at most banks and building societies, earn tax-free interest if the capital is not touched for five years. A maximum of Pounds 9,000 can be invested, staggered over five years. It is also sensible to keep back-up savings in another building society account with fewer penalties for early withdrawal. A maximum of Pounds 9,000 a year can be invested in Peps, of which Pounds 6,000 can be in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company one. Income and capital gains from Peps are tax-free. Income from unit and investment trusts is taxable, but capital gains are not counted when the grant entitlement is being calculated. Business expansion schemes, such as the popular contracted-exit ones offered by a number of universities, are a highly tax-efficient investment at the moment, but they are due to be abolished at the end of the year. They could be worth thinking about for higher-rate taxpayers who expect to have a child at university in five years' time, when the present batch of schemes matures. Parents who expect to qualify for some grant may want to consider increasing contributions to a personal pension scheme, or additional voluntary contributions to a company or free-standing scheme, as this will reduce the amount of residual income against which the grant is assessed.</p>

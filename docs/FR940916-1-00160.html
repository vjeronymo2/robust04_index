That train shall not proceed beyond the point where its next Class 1 brake test is due with a car containing a power brake defect still part of the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air flow indicator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When a train is equipped with an air flow indicator calibrated in cubic feet per minute, if the air flow exceeds 80 cfm, the engineer shall stop the train to determine the cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Excessive pressure gradient. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When a train is equipped with an end-of-train or equivalent device, if the gradient exceeds 20 psi after recharging following a brake application, the engineer shall stop the train to determine the cause.

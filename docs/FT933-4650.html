			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / People: Non-executive directors The merchant bank Lazard Brothers, which is 50 per cent-owned by Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has appointed another non-executive director, Michael Orr, thus increasing the number of non-executives on the board to eleven. The chairman of Molins, manufacturer of specialist machinery for the tobacco and packaging industries, Orr, 56, is a very active City figure, having already notched up non-executive positions at WH Smith, Granada Group, Sketchley, Govett's Strategic Investment Trust, the Throgmorton Trust, and the Staffordshire-based brewers Marston Thompson and Evershed. Is Lazard's chairman, David Verey, confident that Orr (right) will be able to squeeze some extra time into an already busy schedule? 'That is his (Orr's) agony and to some extent mine too,' says Verey. 'But he is very conscientious and we reckon on him spending about a day a week with us,' he adds. Verey alighted on Orr 'because he presents an unusual mix for a merchant bank; he is someone who understands merchant banking but is also plugged into the industrial scene'. Having spent time with Grand Metropolitan - as finance director - and with Merrill Lynch, Orr is 'energetic, active, intelligent and well regarded, an unusual combination,' feels Verey.</p>

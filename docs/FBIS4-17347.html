			<p>BFN     [Text] LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy is planning to hand the party's own plan of  economic recovery to the Russian president as Yeltsin and  parliamentary leaders meet on Friday. It provides for a one  party government led by LDP as the party winning the December  election. If not, six of the incumbent ministers(Chubays,  Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev and Yerin) must be replaced  by LDP representatives, the paper says. The party also wants  its own candidate to be elected as speaker of the lower house  offering Yeltsin to take an indefinite leave to shed  responsibility in the event of tension.    LDP also calls for a new administrative-territorial division  of the country by abolishing national autonomies and restoring  Russia to the former Soviet Union's borders under the 1975  Helsinki Accord on inviolability of frontiers. It opposes the  reduction of the armed forces and demands that the  military-industrial complex be restored in full and arms exports  expanded.    LDP demands a sharp reversal of Russia's foreign policy by  lifting the blockade of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and sending  Russian troops to be withdrawn from Germany to the Balkans. "The  lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia can help saturate the  Russian market with cheap clothing, footwear and foodstuffs",  the authors of the plan believe. LDP is strongly opposed to any  agreements with NATO or joint military exercises on Russian  territory.    The party offers an integrated program to combat crime to  root out all criminal rings within three months. It also calls  for a crucial change of domestic propaganda by removing  anti-Russian ideologists and campaigners, foreign preachers,  advertising and erotics from the mass media.    "Russia is in deep crisis. The Russians are perishing while  your entourage is deceiving you. Lying ahead is a powerful  social upheaval followed by chaos and a total ungovernability of  the country. Mr President! LDP calls on you to accept its  program in the name of Russia's salvation", says the appeal.</p>

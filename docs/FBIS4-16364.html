			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has declared  that although the UN Secretary General has requested the  deployment of yet another 300 Russian peacekeepers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moscow, in light of the recent developments  in former Yugoslavia, should think twice before taking a  decision on this issue. However, he admitted in a conversation  with journalists on Friday that 200 Russian servicemen are ready  to be dispatched to former Yugoslavia.    Grachev is convinced that currently there can be no talk  about replacing Russian peacekeepers in "hot spots" across CIS  with UN "blue helmets". Firstly, he explained, the UN has no  money to send peacekeepers to the CIS. Secondly, one is not  likely to find troops willing to be in volatile CIS areas.  Thirdly, CIS heads of state want to see only Russian troops and  UN observers in Commonwealth trouble spots.</p>

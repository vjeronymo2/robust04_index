Schwenk Named Director </F> for Development''; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Zurich, 20 Dec (ATSA) -- Aircraft manufacturer  Pilatus based in Stans (Nidwalden demicanton) has appointed a  new director to replace Walter Gubler, who was fired last March.  Oerlikon-Buehrle, the group to which Pilatus belongs, announced  that Oscar J. Schwenk will take up duties on 1 January 1994.  Ernst Thomke, who temporarily managed the company after Mr.  Gubler left, will resume his responsibilities as president of  the administrative council.    Oscar Schwenk has been working for Pilatus since 1981, most  recently as a member of the board of directors responsible for  the division ``operations.'' His predecessor had been dismissed  with immediate effect on 26 March 1993. Mr. Gubler was blamed  for having authorized a second delivery of aircraft to Burma,  although he knew that the planes in the first delivery had been  equipped with arms.    With this dismissal, Pilatus wanted to start anew. At the  time the company declared that in the future it wanted to avoid  at all costs the possibility of its planes being equipped with  arms. Pilatus wants to establish itself more strongly in the  small civil airplane market. For instance, during the summer,  the manufacturer had tried to take over the American company  Piper.    This past summer, Ernst Thomke together with Hans Widmer,  head of Oerlikon-Buehrle, had strongly committed themselves to  exporting training planes to South Korea and Nigeria. At the  end of September, the federal council had agreed on the delivery  of 20 PC-9 planes to South Korea and to seven PC-7 planes to  Nigeria.    Ernst Thomke, a Swiss manager, had left the board of SMH  [Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking  Industries Ltd.] on 1 June 1991. He had played an important  role in the success of Swatch. One year later he became manager  of operations for the group Motor-Columbus.    Mr. Thomke, who lives in Granges, is a member of the  administrative councils of ATEL, SAEG Refindus, Studer Revox,  and Swissmetri. Rumour has it that he might succeed the  director of Ascom, Leonardo Vannotti. He himself denies being  contacted by Ascom.</p>

Of 1,664 cooperatives, 229 face the  threat of liquidation or bankruptcy. Nor is the situation of  private banks any better; only foreign banks may be said to have  no problems. A commission has begun work, its aim being the  creation of a new banking law and a study of ways to counteract  the crisis situation.    Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was born in 1952 in Warsaw. She is a  graduate of the Department of Law and Administration of Warsaw  University, a Ph.D. in legal theory, and a specialist in the  area of banking law. She attended the Sorbonne for one year on a  scholarship from the French Government. She was an adjunct  professor at Warsaw University and at the Department of Canon  Law at the Academy of Catholic Theology. In 1992, she was named  director of Warsaw University's Institute of Law and National  Economic Management. Earlier, beginning in 1989, she was the  Sejm and Senate expert on public law affairs. From January to  March 1992, she was the adviser to the director of the Analysis,  Budget, and Finances Group of NIK [Supreme Board of Inspection].    The first time Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz stood before the  Commission on Economic Policy and Finances was in December 1991.  At that time, her candidacy was dismissed by both the commission  and the Sejm. In March 1992, supported by President Walesa, she  was accepted and took on the position of president of the  National Bank of Poland. The first major decision she  implemented in that position was beginning the process of  liquidation of the Bank of Commerce and Trade in Katowice.</p>

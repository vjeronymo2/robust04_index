			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / George Michael loses court fight over contract George Michael, the pop singer, yesterday lost his legal battle with Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment group, to have his recording contract ruled unenforceable. In a case which attracted small armies of media and dewy-eyed fans to the High Court, Mr Michael argued he should be allowed greater freedom to pursue his career as a creative artist. The pop star had claimed his contract with Sony to produce eight albums should be declared void because it amounted to unreasonable restraint of trade and was contrary to competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome. Mr Justice Jonathan Parker yesterday rejected the singer's claims - ruling his contract with the record company was 'reasonable and fair'. The singer had access to expert legal advice when he signed the contract, the judge said. A disappointed Mr Michael said it was likely he would appeal against the judgment which, he claimed, in effect upheld 'professional slavery'. But the ruling was widely welcomed by members of the recording industry. Some have argued, that had the judgment gone the other way, it would have led to the renegotiation of many performers' contracts and to companies being discouraged from investing in new and untried talent. Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI Music and chairman of the British Phonographic Industry trade body, said: 'As an industry, we invest substantial amounts of money in this country. If the judgment stands, we will be able to continue to do so.' Sony appeared to offer an olive branch to the vanquished superstar. 'We have great respect for George Michael and his artistry and look forward to continuing our relationship with him,' it said. Mr Michael, however, told a press conference he was confident the court's decision could be overturned. He said that under the terms of his contract with Sony, he had no control over how his work was exploited and no guarantee it would even be released. The court has yet to decide how much of the bill for the action should be picked up by Mr Michael. One unofficial estimate put the cost of bringing the case at Pounds 3m. Mr Michael was formerly in the group Wham] which had a string of hits in the early 1980s. His first solo LP Faith, released in 1987, sold 14m copies worldwide.

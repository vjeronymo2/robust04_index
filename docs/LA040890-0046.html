			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS DELAY FOR AIRPORT PLANS  </P> <P> The Senate on Thursday approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to  temporarily exempt cities in Los Angeles County from a tough new law designed  to ensure orderly growth around airports.  </P> <P> Current law, which took effect this year, requires the county to formulate  comprehensive land-use plans for 17 airports by June 30, 1991.  </P> <P> Until the plans are completed, the county must approve permits for major  projects as far as two miles away from the airports.  </P> <P> Under the bill, approved by a 32-1 margin, the county's deadline to complete  the plans would be extended six months, and cities would be exempted from  submitting a project-by-project review to the county.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), who is carrying the bill, said it  provides extra time for the county to prepare the plans to ensure that building  projects near airports are compatible with flight traffic. The bill, supported  by the League of California Cities, had already been approved by the Assembly.  </P></p>

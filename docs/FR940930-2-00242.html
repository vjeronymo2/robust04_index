Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA published a Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27290) (``May 26 Notice'') which implemented a new program under which GNMA guarantees real estate mortgage investment conduits (``REMICs''). GNMA began its program with an ``initial stage''. During the initial stage, participation was limited to firms selected through a Competitive Application Procedure (``CAP''), standard documents were drafted, internal control procedures and information gathering and retention processes were developed, and a Multiclass Securities Guide was produced. This Guide will be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the policies governing the program, in accordance with usual GNMA procedures, and consistent with any regulations established for the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GNMA received two comments regarding participation by minority and women-owned firms, both of which recommended that GNMA mandate participation by minority and women-owned businesses. GNMA considered these comments in the development of its policy as discussed below in section IV. One of these comments also recommended that GNMA pay the transaction costs from its guaranty fee. GNMA has decided not to take this approach, for the reasons discussed in section II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GNMA is now commencing the full participation stage, which GNMA is implementing with the publication of this Notice. Changes in GNMA's multiclass securities program are noted in this Notice. Any provisions in the May 26 Notice that are not revised in this Notice remain in full force and effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Program Revisions for Full Participation Stage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Types of Eligible Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the full participation stage, GNMA is expanding its multiclass securities program to include multiclass securities in addition to those issued by trusts electing REMIC status. Section 306(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)), authorizes GNMA to guarantee ``securities .&blank;.&blank;. based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages. *&blank;*&blank;*'' This language does not limit GNMA to any specific type of security so long as it is based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of eligible mortgages. In addition, section 3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which revised GNMA's statutory provisions relating to guaranty fees, referred to fees charged for GNMA's guaranty of ``multiclass securities backed by a trust or pool of securities or notes guaranteed by the Association under this subsection. *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Sponsors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA is willing to undertake a variety of transactions, provided that GNMA determines in its sole discretion that they enhance the goals of the program and provide protection against any loss to GNMA for which it would not otherwise be responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The obligations of Sponsors with respect to any particular type of GNMA multiclass securities transaction will be established from time to time by GNMA and will be set forth in the Multiclass Securities Guide. In general:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Sponsors are required to demonstrate their capacity to accumulate those MBS needed for a securities issuance as to which GNMA has committed to issue its guaranty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sponsors are required to represent the structural integrity of the issuance under all cash flow scenarios and demonstrate to GNMA's satisfaction their ability to indemnify GNMA for a breach of this representation. Sponsors are required to have sufficient assets to back their representations and commitments to GNMA, as specifically set forth in the GNMA Multiclass Securities Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

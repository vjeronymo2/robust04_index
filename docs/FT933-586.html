			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report TIN and NICKEL prices reversed last week's rallies at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Tin suffered what dealers termed a 'mini-collapse' in late trading as a flurry of European selling found buyers thin on the ground. Final business for the three months delivery position was at Dollars 4,505 a tonne, down Dollars 105 from Friday. Meanwhile nickel's more cheerful appearance gave way in the face of predictions of further increases in exchange warehouse stocks, which are already at a record level. The three months price closed Dollars 122.50 down at Dollars 4,267.50 a tonne, in spite of sellers being cautious following Inco's announcement last week that it was talking to unions about output cuts. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices fell back further from recent highs, with near December futures losing Pounds 13 at Pounds 903 a tonne. 'I don't think it's anything specific, said one traders. 'It's time to take a little bit of profit.' At the London bullion market the GOLD price lost early gains on perceptions that the Moscow crisis had eased slightly. The price finished at Dollars 354.25 a troy ounce, down Dollars 3 from Friday.

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / A swashbuckling player no longer: The declining fortunes of Malaysia's Bank Negara For several years Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has been known as one of the more swashbuckling players in the world's foreign exchange markets. Not any more. At the end of last week, Bank Negara disclosed that it had lost more than MDollars 5.7bn (Pounds 1.45bn) through foreign currency transactions last year. In 1992, the bank was out of pocket by more than MDollars 9bn after similar ill-judged forays into foreign exchange markets. Like a down-at-heel punter finally admitting the error of his ways, Bank Negara has announced its withdrawal from the big-time forex business. The losses have sent shock waves through Malaysia's financial community. Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, has been forced to resign. Other heads are likely to roll. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, has said Bank Negara's losses will not have an adverse effect on the national economy. 'Even in business, there are times when losses are incurred,' he said. Others are not so sanguine. Opposition politicians have described the news from Bank Negara as 'the greatest financial scandal in Malaysian history'. Bank Negara itself has admitted that the forex losses of more than MDollars 15bn during the past two years could have rendered it technically insolvent but for the financial backing of the government. Mr Jaffar, who will stay on until early May, has taken full responsibility for the losses. 'In the absence of perfect hindsight, mistakes will be made: indeed, mistakes were made' said Mr Jaffar. 'When I realised the extent of the losses, we started to unwind the whole thing . . . an unfortunate chapter in the bank's history is now closed.' Mr Jaffar is one of the country's most respected bankers. Under his nine-year stewardship of the central bank Malaysia's banking sector has been radically overhauled. Many feel Mr Jaffar has been made a scapegoat. They say ultimate responsibility rests high up in government. The government should not have allowed its central bank to indulge in large-scale forex trading. In the mid-1980s Malaysia tried, and failed, to corner the world tin market. 'The government had massive losses then but didn't learn,' said a foreign banker based in Singapore. 'A central bank should be the custodian of the country's currency. I can't believe the finance ministry did not know what was going on. It must have encouraged the bank to become one of the big time players in the forex market.' One of the ironies of recent events is that Bank Negara has recently been battling to drive speculators out of the Malaysian dollar market. At the same time the bank itself is accused of being a speculator in other currencies. Bank Negara began stalking the forex markets in the late 1980s. The good times came to an end in 1992 when the bank went heavily into sterling and the D-Mark. The consequences were disastrous. The European Monetary System crisis erupted. In 1992, the Malaysian dollar appreciated by nearly 30 per cent against the pound and by more than 11 per cent against the D-Mark. The 1992 losses - amounting to MDollars 9.3bn - were only disclosed after some energetic prodding by economists and journalists. Bank Negara said it did not want to disclose the size and details of the loss as this might have endangered the bank's position in the forex market. Anyway, said bank officials, the 93 per cent plunge in special reserve and contingency funds shown in the bank's accounts was 'only a paper loss'. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, told parliament he was satisfied there had been no mismanagement at Bank Negara. 'I have confidence in the integrity of Bank Negara in managing the country's reserves,' said Mr Anwar last year. The opposition compared the affair to an early 1980s scandal when Bank Bumiputra, a state bank, had lost millions of dollars through lending to speculators in the Hong Kong property market. The opposition said the 1992 forex losses were four or five times bigger than those incurred by Bank Bumiputra. Calls for an inquiry were rejected. Presenting its 1993 accounts, Bank Negara decided to come clean. It said most of the 1993 losses were the result of costs incurred in unwinding forward postions adopted in the previous year. Bank officials rejected criticism that they had been too adventurous. 'Our reputation is exaggerated,' said one bank official. 'You have to do something to preserve the value of your currency. You have to be in the market. You cannot simply sit on your hands and do nothing.' Bank Negara said all forward forex trading positions had been unwound and that the bank in future would confine itself to spot trading in managing its international reserves. The central bank also announced its first ever net operating loss, of MDollars 712m for 1993, mainly caused by the costs of mopping up the very large amounts of foreign funds that had flooded into the country. The funds, attracted by Malaysia's strong economic growth and soaring stock market, threatened to unleash an inflationary spiral unless they were stopped from entering the financial system. While Bank Negara appears to have made a clean slate of things, there are still some unanswered questions. A main point of interest is what happened in the last days of 1993 when the Malaysian dollar fell by more than 5 per cent against a basket of currencies. Analysts say Bank Negara was behind the fall in the currency: it sold large amounts of the Malaysian unit and bought dollars. The move improved the 1993 accounts by raising the value of foreign currency in Malaysian dollar terms. It is estimated that, without this fancy accounting footwork, forex losses in the 1993 accounts would have been up to MDollars 3bn higher. The bank has admitted that there were internal deficiencies in the way forex trading was monitored. The head of the forex trading department, the number three in the bank hierarchy, is said to be 'on long leave'. But is Bank Negara the only one responsible for the losses? Critics say senior government figures were a party to what was going on. Mr Daim Zainuddin was Malaysia's finance minister for much of the 1980s. Mr Daim, a close confidant of the prime minister, is one of the country's most influential and wealthy businessmen. He is also a special economic adviser to the government. 'It's a huge loss,' said Mr Daim. 'I would like to forget about it . . . those responsible have resigned.' Not everyone would agree.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Midland to cut 300 jobs MIDLAND BANK is to cut 300 more jobs from its 27,000-strong UK workforce, David Barchard writes. The bank said yesterday that the cuts were being made throughout its operation, but applied mainly to back-office staff. A number of managerial posts will be among those to go. Midland hopes to keep redundancies to a minimum by not replacing staff as they retire and by transferring staff whose jobs are to be cut to new positions. Last year the bank shed 4,000 jobs to cut its costs, which are among the highest in the UK banking industry. Midland made a loss of Pounds 71m in the first half of 1991 and is due to announce its full-year results next month. Banks have been making large cuts in their workforces for several years because of of the introduction of new technology.</p>

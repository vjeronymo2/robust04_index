			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Two guilty in BP fraud case TWO businessmen who sold confidential details about tenders received by British Petroleum to steel and engineering companies competing for North Sea contracts were convicted of corruption yesterday in London. The convictions at Southwark Crown Court mark a success for the Serious Fraud Office which brought the prosecutions as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into a number of alleged corruption cases. Mr Josef Szrajber and Mr Paolo Sorelli were both found guilty on seven counts of conspiring to defraud BP by their use of information relating to tenders for pipes and pumping equipment. Sentencing was adjourned until April 23. Both men were remanded in custody until then. The court heard how Mr Sorelli, an Italian businessman based in Bayswater, London, cultivated staff in BP's procurement department and paid them to pass over details of tenders received through the company's sealed-bid system. The information was passed to Mr Szrajber, a Polish businessman based in Mayfair, who sold it on to companies competing for the business. The companies benefiting from the fraud included Thyssen, the German steelmaker, Sulzer Pumps GB and several large Japanese engineering concerns. Both defendants had argued that their actions had not been dishonest and had been normal commercial behaviour. After returning their verdicts, the jury heard that Mr Szrajber had earlier pleaded guilty on another corruption charge for which he had received a nine-month suspended sentence. The trial was the first in a series being brought by the SFO. Other separate trials pending include those of four men accused of defrauding Shell UK and two others arrested in connection with contracts awarded for the Channel tunnel project.

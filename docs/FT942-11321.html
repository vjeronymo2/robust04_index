			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Computer company bids to run Crest Hoskyns, one of the UK's leading computer services companies, is to compete with the London Stock Exchange to become the independent supplier of full operational facilities for the Crest paperless share settlement system. The Bank of England, which is overseeing the development phase of Crest, has said there will be a role for an operator of the system but has not spelt out whether that role is technological, administrative or both. The Stock Exchange was rebuffed this week in its request for a significant minority stake in Crest but the Bank said there was a good case for awarding it the operator's contract. However, several groups of prospective Crest users have expressed concern about appointing the exchange as operator, saying it may use its role to the advantage of its own members. It is thought that, in addition to Hoskyns and the exchange, potential competitors for the Crest contract include American Telephone and Telegraph, British Telecommunications and EDS. Yesterday Hoskyns released results of a survey of 27 prospective Crest shareholders showing that 19 of them preferred an independent operator or staff of a newly formed CrestCo. Only three preferred the Stock Exchange and another three preferred the Bank of England. Mr Ian Jackson, head of Hoskyns' financial sector operations, said the company was qualified to run Crest because of its track record in managing computer systems for financial services groups. Its customer list in the UK includes TSB, the London Clearing House, the European Clearing House Operation and National Westminster Bank. Hoskyns is one of the UK's oldest computing services companies. The French company Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computing services group, took a majority stake in the company in 1990 and now has the entire equity. Hoskyns, along with EDS of the US, was the pioneer of facilities management, the business of managing and running a customer's computer operations to an agreed level of service for a fee.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> TV PULLS PLUG ON DEBATE BETWEEN WILSON, FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> The second televised debate between gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein  and Pete Wilson was abruptly canceled Tuesday, two days before it was to occur,  after a topsy-turvy day of negotiating.  </P> <P> The candidates at one point agreed to a satellite-assisted, bicoastal contest  only to have their television sponsors pull the plug.  </P> <P> At day's end, Republican Wilson and Democrat Feinstein were mulling over a list  of five days and times offered by KPIX-TV, the San Francisco CBS affiliate that  was to sponsor the hourlong contest at 8 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> The fate of the debate has been up in the air for days. Originally, the second  debate was to be held last Thursday, but it was pushed back a week when Wilson  returned to Washington to cast votes in the Senate.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, with the Senate still in session and expected to remain so through  the rescheduled debate night, Wilson suggested in a letter faxed to Feinstein  and reporters that the two hold the session from studios 3,000 miles apart.  Wilson would be in Washington and Feinstein at KPIX-TV.  </P> <P> Feinstein quickly faxed back her response, accepting the offer of a bicoastal  debate and challenging Wilson to a third session.  </P> <P> At that point, KPIX-TV bowed out.  </P> <P> "It's canceled," said station spokeswoman Jennifer Barnett. "It's going to be  too difficult for us. . . . We'd have to do it from another facility. There's  too many complexities."  </P> <P> Barnett said the station gave Feinstein and Wilson five alternate dates --  Saturday or Sunday at 3 p.m., and the following Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday  at 8 p.m. The station gave the candidates until today to make a decision and  stipulated that they agree on a time when both could be present in the San  Francisco studio.  </P> <P> Already, there were potential problems with rescheduling the debate.  </P> <P> The Senate is expected to be in session through the weekend and possibly until  Tuesday. Wilson could conceivably leave Washington while the Senate was  meeting, but he would then be playing into Feinstein's recurrent criticism of  his absences during the campaign.  </P> <P> The latter of the dates suggested by KPIX would put the debate within five or  six days of the election, a move that either side might see as limiting its  flexibility.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Wilson's campaign ruled out a third debate and accused Feinstein of  raising the possibility as a diversion.  </P> <P> "Feinstein knows that she's trailing the senator, she's coming out with  negative hits (advertisements) today -- she's desperate," said Wilson spokesman  Bill Livingstone.  </P> <P> Feinstein said in her letter to Wilson that a third debate would be helpful to  California citizens.  </P> <P> "With Election Day just two weeks away, there is increasing interest in the  campaign and I believe another debate would be very valuable," she said.  </P> <P> The first of the candidate debates was held Oct. 7 at the Burbank studios of  KNBC-TV, where Feinstein and Wilson dueled for an hour. The debate earned a  respectable television audience after the California Assn. of Broadcasters  worked for months to secure agreements to air the event on more than two dozen  stations.  </P> <P> The second session was expected to have a much narrower viewership. No large  Los Angeles television outlet was planning to air the debate live on Thursday.  </P></p>

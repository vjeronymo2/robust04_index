			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly passed a new National Assembly  Law designed to implement sweeping reform in operations of the  legislative body in a special session that opened Saturday.    The revised law stipulates the establishment of the National  Assembly Intelligence Committee which will audit the budget of  the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) and oversee  overall activities of the powerful intelligence agency.    Under the law, the committee will have 12 lawmakers as  members. Rep. Chong Chae-mun of the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party was reportedly tapped to become chairman of the committee.    The Assembly also passed a revision to the Law on Additional  Punishment for Specific Crime which stipulates punishment of up  to a five-year prison term or 5 million won in fines for  intelligence committee members and their secretaries accused of  leaking official secrets.    According to the new law, lawmakers are not allowed to  interpellate Cabinet members at the Assembly plenary session  longer than 15 minutes. Thus far, the maximum duration of the  interpellation was 30 minutes.    The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from making  harangues or asking same questions as those already asked by  other lawmakers previously.    Instead, the law introduced the "four-minute free speech  system" under which any lawmaker can make a speech for up to  four minutes during Assembly plenary sessions. The Assembly  speaker is allowed to preside over the free speech session for  one hour.    Assembly standing committees are obliged to hold two regular  meetings every month under the law.    The law bans lawmakers owning businesses from being  affiliated with Assembly standing committees related with their  businesses. For example, a lawmaker owning a construction firm  is barred from being a member of the Assembly Construction  Committee.    The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from seeking  profits by taking advantage of their status as members of  related standing committees.    The new Assembly law introduced a clause aimed at  discouraging lawmakers' absenteeism. Lawmakers who skip plenary  or committee sessions without good reasons will see their  allowances curtailed.    Under the new law, lawmakers will be able to ask for  government documents even while the Assembly is in recess.    To encourage Assemblymen's legislation activities, the  Legislation Information Center was set up at the National  Assembly in accordance with the new law.    The revised law also allows live broadcasting of Assembly  plenary and standing committee sessions through cable news  networks.</p>

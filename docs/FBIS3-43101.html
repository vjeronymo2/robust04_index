Kalman filtration is carried out in an  on- board digital computer which is subjected to upsets and  failures. Upsets, failures and interference when information is  transferred can cause the computer to produce incorrect results.  Among the several possible control and diagnostics methods, the  method chosen is based on analytical redundancy, which is  algorithmic in nature. To test this method, the dimensions of  the filter are increased by one unit of measure in order to  establish the control. This allowed the whole range of control  relations to be obtained, including algebraic invariants which  are used to locate and localize defects. This methods occupies  relatively few resources of the computer and makes it possible  to discover failures and mistakes in the operation of the  digital computer as they occur, which allows distorted results  to be blocked, as well as prohibits mistakes from multiplying. 2  tables and 16 references.</p>

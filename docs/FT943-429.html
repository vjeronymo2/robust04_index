			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Observer: Moor or less After David O'Brien's abrupt departure from National &amp; Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent may well be congratulating itself on its lucky escape. The Leeds's doubts about O'Brien's management style - which now seem to be shared by the N&amp;P - were one of the rocks on which the planned merger between the two foundered last year. However, the Leeds mob ought to be careful about crowing at the misfortune of their Bradford rivals. N&amp;P has lost and found a chief executive almost instantaneously, whereas the Leeds is still looking for a permanent successor to Mike Blackburn who escaped across the moor to the Halifax more than 18 months ago.</p>

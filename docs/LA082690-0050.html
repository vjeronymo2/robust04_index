			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS: MURALS IN COIT TOWER GIVE VIEW OF THE '30S  </P> <P> Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill is endowed not only with the best 360-degree view  of San Francisco, its bay bridges and other natural wonders, but also with a  splendid inner lookout on California history in its recently restored  Depression-era murals, "Aspects of Life in California, 1934."  </P> <P> The Diego Rivera-influenced Social Realist frescoes have undergone a three-year  restoration and are open to the public after a long period of neglect.  </P> <P> The 27 frescoes and recessed lunette paintings are a time capsule of life in  California in the '30s, depicting sports and agriculture, home life and heavy  industry, labor unrest and newspaper headlines, and scenes from street life,  even including an auto accident and a stick-up.  </P> <P> "Aspects" was an extraordinary collaboration of 26 master painters and their 19  assistants in a pioneer federal arts project that followed the completion of  the tower -- a memorial to San Francisco's volunteer firemen bequeathed by  Lillie Hitchcock Coit -- in 1933. Most visitors think the murals are the work  of one artist, so skillfully blended were the many talents.  </P> <P> In these days of uproar over federally funded art and the disintegration of  Communism, the murals are doubly fascinating, for "Aspects" was controversial  when it opened for its supposed Communist undertones.  </P> <P> In one mural, for example, a man reaches for a book by Karl Marx; in another,  grim workers demonstrate in a May Day parade. The exhibit closed a few days  later while a debate raged, and some of the offending art was actually  destroyed.  </P> <P> Coit Tower sits above North Beach and the waterfront, within walking distance  of the best Italian cafes in town, cable car lines, the financial district,  Fisherman's Wharf and Chinatown. It is open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to  5:15 p.m. LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY  </P></p>

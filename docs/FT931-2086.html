			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bitter meeting for Clark on bids THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark the family held shoe manufacturer riven by shareholder dissention, faces a potentially acrimonious meeting today as it attempts to decide which of three bids for the company it will recommend. Berisford, the commodity and property group, tabled its formal offer on Friday, thought to value Clark's at about Pounds 160m. It is believed to be an all-share offer, underwritten for cash. The bid is conditional on approval from a majority of the nine-strong board and the grant of exclusive due diligence rights to Berisford. Fii is believed to be offering a similar deal, which values Clark's at about Pounds 140m. Finally, an investment consortium comprising existing institutional shareholders and backed by Electra Investment Trust, is thought to have offered about Pounds 2 a share, or Pounds 154m. A member of the Clark family, which owns or controls 80 per cent of the company, said he was opposed to the planned sale. It is believed that a group of family members is seeking to co-ordinate opposition to the sale at the AGM later this month. 'My concern is that it (a sale) is being presented as something which has been agreed by the company - which it has not,' he said. The extraordinary general meeting in October had agreed only to determine the best price for Clark's, following a bid approach backed by Electra. The board had also promised to investigate options for those who wanted to sell their shares. The dissident shareholder said that an outright sale of Clark's had 'very little to do with the interests of the company.' 'Furthermore, he added, 'the current prices being talked about are terribly low.' Even if the family wanted to dispose of the company, he said 'it seems a crazy time to sell'. At least 40 per cent of the family shareholders are thought to oppose the sale of Clark's. Four members of the nine-strong board - who are also of the Clark family and sought to unseat the chairman and a director last year - are likely to object to the sale. At least two of the bidders have indicated that some or all of the management at Clark's would remain.</p>

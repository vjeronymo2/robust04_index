			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dishonest and Rude Act"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities refused to take over our letter to the South Korean  authorities, political parties, organizations and individual  figures and overseas Koreans.    Commenting on this unreasonable act of the South Korean  authorities, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says:    If they had had a shred of patriotism and desire to achieve  peace and peaceful reunification of the country, they should  have positively responded to our fair proposal for the  convocation of a national conference for seeking a way of great  national unity.    The South Korean authorities, however, refused to take over  our letter, preposterously claiming that the proposal "ignores  North- South dialogue" and it is not "conducive to improving  North-South relations." This is, in every respect, an  unreasonable, rude act and a challenge to the entire fellow  countrymen desirous of reonciliation, unity and reunification.    By turning down our proposal and balking the convocation of  a  national conference, the South Korean rulers are fully revealing  their criminal nature as the very one who does not have dialogue  for reunification but keeps others from having dialogue and  seeks only confrontation, division and a war against the North.    The South Korean authorities would be well advised to look  squarely at the reality, act with discretion and stop such anti-  national acts as obstructing the convocation of a national  conference.    The whole nation will keep tabs on their follow-up action.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Kuwait workers on rampage Foreign workers at a Kuwait refinery went on a rampage during a strike over poor conditions, overturning vehicles and smashing their residence, Reuter reports from Kuwait. The disturbance - unusual among Kuwait's foreign labour community - occurred on Saturday during a one-day stoppage by about 2,000 maintenance workers at Kuwait's Mina al-Abdullah refinery. Their nationalities were not given but most maintenance crews are staffed by Filipinos, Indians, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. The strikers complained of inappropriate living conditions, a lack of suitable food and said annual holidays were not long enough for them to attend to family business back home, the Al-Watan newspaper said.</p>

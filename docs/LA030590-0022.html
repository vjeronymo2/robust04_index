			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORMAN SHOOTS 62, SINKS CHIP TO WIN PLAYOFF  </P> <P> Greg Norman chipped in for an eagle on the first extra hole and won a  four-player sudden death playoff Sunday in the Doral Open at Miami.  </P> <P> Norman's 20-foot chip from behind the first green beat Paul Azinger, Mark  Calcavecchia and Tim Simpson and capped a spectacular day's play in which he  was 12 under par for 19 holes.  </P> <P> Norman, who so often has seen remarkable last-round performances go for naught,  rallied from seven strokes back with a course- and tournament-record 62, 10  under par.  </P> <P> The Australian capped that effort with a 35 foot par-saving putt on the final  hole and completed the regulation 72 holes at 273, 15 under par on Doral's Blue  Monster course.  </P> <P> But Norman, who has found such remarkable methods of letting titles slip from  his eager grasp, had to have some help to even reach the playoff.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, who beat Norman in a playoff at the 1989 British Open, was 16  under par with one hole to play. He bogeyed the 18th to give Norman a chance.  </P> <P> Simpson joined the playoff with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th that  completed a 66.  </P> <P> Mike Reid and Tom Purtzer tied for fifth at 275, two shots out of the playoff.  Reid had a closing 70, Purtzer 68.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel birdied the final two holes to win the Women's Kemper Open in  Wailea, Hawaii, her second consecutive tournament victory.  </P> <P> Laura Davies of Great Britain missed an eagle attempt on the final hole which  would have forced a playoff. She tied for second with Rosie Jones.  </P> <P> Daniel shot two-under-par 69 on the Wailea Blue Course to complete a  seven-stroke comeback over the final two rounds.  </P> <P> Daniel, who won $75,000, finished the 72-hole tournament at 283.  </P></p>

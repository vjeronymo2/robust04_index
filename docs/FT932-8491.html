			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UN calls for new priorities in development aid INDUSTRIALISED and developing nations need a new agenda to make sure that development benefits people, not governments, according to a United Nations report. Warning that 90 per cent of the world's people are excluded from participation in the economy or in politics, the annual Human Development Report, prepared by economists for the UN Development Programme, calls for development to benefit women, rural dwellers, ethnic minorities and other groups that have been shut out. 'Many of today's struggles are more than struggles for access to political power. They are struggles for access to the ordinary opportunities of life - land, water, work, living space and basic social services,' said Mr William Draper, UNDP's administrator, in a foreword to the report. The report uses a composite index of life expectancy, educational achievement and purchasing power to gauge the level of human development in each country, and warns that income levels do not always equate with human development. 'Several countries - such as Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Uruguay - have done well in translating their income into the lives of their people: their human development rank is way ahead of their per capita income rank. 'Other societies - such as Algeria, Angola, Gabon, Guinea, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Africa and United Arab Emirates - have income ranks far above their human development rank, showing their enormous potential for improving the lives of their people,' the report says. The report ranks Japan's level of human development highest, ahead of Canada, Norway and Switzerland. Barbados, Hong Kong and Cyprus are the highest ranked developing countries. But adjusting for gender disparity pushes Japan down to 17th position because of high maternal mortality rates and wage discrimination. The report notes that whites in the US would rank first, but that US blacks and Hispanics have lower development rankings than many third world countries, with far worse levels of mortality, education and income than whites. The report sees some signs of encouragement, however. Global military spending has declined by a cumulative Dollars 240bn (Pounds 160bn) since 1987, for example, and if developing nations merely froze their military spending at 1990's level, they would release another Dollars 100bn over the next decade. It calls for accelerated disarmament, new patterns of economic development to combat the 'jobless growth' that has emerged in recent years, and a pragmatic middle way between the advocates of free markets and of state intervention. The report calls on industrialised countries to reorient their aid towards the poorest countries and away from high militar spenders.

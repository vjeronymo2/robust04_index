The joint communique issued by  Iran and Pakistan before her departure for Turkey emphasized  increasing cooperation between the two countries in areas of  economics and the arts. The situation around Iran and Pakistan,  including the Kashmir issue, the situation in Afghanistan, and  the people's struggle in Azerbaijan, were also discussed in  depth. Iran decided to offer special oil rates to Pakistan.  Madam Bhutto started the second phase of her tour after this  welcome support from Iranian leaders. Many agreements were  signed during her stay in Turkey, and plans to increase  cooperation in different areas were also discussed. Turkey  agreed to open a bank in Pakistan for cooperation in economic  areas. Relations between Pakistan and Turkey in commerce have  always been good. Turkey has expressed a willingness to increase  imports of rice and leather. Both countries have agreed to form  a free zone for exports of goods to each other. Additionally, a  joint committee will be established to discuss various plans.  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Madam  Tansu Chahlar held bilateral talks about regional and  international issues. The political cooperation between Turkey  and Pakistan will help obtain Turkey's support for the struggle  of Kashmiri Muslims. Madam Bhutto said in a statement that she  was very impressed with the Turkish prime minister's  decisiveness. She said that she considered the visit to Turkey a  success because of the Turkish prime minister. The Turkish prime  minister also said that she considered Benazir her sister.    Relations between Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey are based on  several factors. In the past, these countries have had some  agreements for regional development. The three countries have  participated in communication and commerce agreements. Iran and  Turkey have always helped their Pakistani brothers openly in war  and peace. They have also supported Pakistan's principled stands  in international forums. Even now, these three countries are  cooperating with each other in religious, political, and  economic areas. Pakistan was proud of its friendship with these  two countries yesterday, is proud today, and will be proud  tomorrow. The people of Pakistan have always been with their  Iranian and Turkish brothers in good and bad times. The people  of Pakistan are waiting for the response to the invitation given  by the Pakistani prime minister to the Turkish prime minister  and the Iranian president. We pray that relations among  Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey improve day by day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Guy de Jonquieres article: "Mood Swings and Trade Winds"] </F>   [Text] When ministers from more than 120 countries gather  in Marrakesh, Morocco, next week for a four-day conference of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], they will be  striving for a show of harmony. But behind the scenes, many  delegations seem more likely to be scowling at each other.    The uncertain mood reflects deep strains in a world trade  system torn between conflicting impulses. One set is propelling  economies towards steadily greater interdependence; but another  threatens to drive them further apart.    The cause of closer integration has been powerfully advanced  by last December's Uruguay Round agreement, which ministers will  sign next Friday. The most ambitious trade liberalisation deal  in history, it is expected by some forecasters to enrich the  world by about $3OO billion annually.    Due to take effect next year, the round promises to step up  the onslaught on economic frontiers which are already crumbling  under the impact of technological innovation, freer capital  mobility and instantaneous information flows.    However, achieving these gains is likely to prove far from  painless. The fiercer global competition grows, and the broader  its impact, the tougher the industrial adjustments it requires.  As a consequence, many governments face mounting domestic  pressure to protect threatened interests. One symptom is this  week's mass protests against the round in India.    Still more serious is the threat of a lurch towards more  aggressive unilateral policies and managed trade, which would  strike at the basic principles of the GATT system. Its  persistence has been underlined by the Clinton Administration's  recently renewed pressure on Japan to open its market further or  face possible U.S. trade sanctions.    Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the GATT, has  condemned the trend as misguided and dangerous. "A new outbreak  of bilateral trade tensions is putting the achievements of the  Uruguay Round to the test even before they are fully  operational," he said last month.    Against this background, it is remarkable that a deal has  been concluded at all. The more so since recession and  stubbornly high unemployment in many industrialised countries  make trade concessions harder to sell at home.    As well as cutting tariffs, the round aims progressively to  free trade in services -- a fifth of total world trade --  agriculture, textiles and government procurement. Though  concrete liberalisation in some of these sectors has yet to be  agreed, all have for the first time been brought firmly within  the framework of GATT rules and disciplines.    The round has also given birth to a new institution, the  World Trade Organisation [WTO]. Due to take over from the GATT  next year, the WTO will have greater authority to adjudicate  international disputes and is intended as a permanent forum for  trade negotiations.    However, the power of any club to enforce rules is no  stronger than its members' willingness to respect them. In  future, attitudes seem likely to be influenced not only by  swings in the economic cycle, but by a steadily accelerating  shift in the world's economic centre of gravity to the south and  east.    Since the Uruguay Round was launched in 1986, a wave of  liberalisation has swept across much of the developing world.  It has paid off in faster growth and soaring exports,  particularly of manufactured goods. As the table shows, gains  in Asia have been particularly striking.    The most potent element in the ascendancy of the emerging  nations is the explosive growth of China which, on recent  trends, could become the world's largest economy early next  century. China's weight in international policy will be felt  well before then if it succeeds in its plans to join the WTO  this year.    It is far from clear that the older industrialised powers  which have long dominated world trade policy have yet come to  terms with the implications of these developments. As they  confront them, international frictions could intensify. One  risk is of a retreat into protectionism. In several richer  countries, job losses and declining industrial performance are  already blamed on "unfair" competition from emerging economies  with lower costs.    Social and political issues may prove another source of  divisions, to judge by the recent row over U.S. attempts to  place labour conditions on the WTO agenda. The move has been  attacked as a protectionist ploy by developing countries, some  of which openly scorn Western notions of democratic values and  human rights.    However, the fault lines do not only run from north to  south.  Relations between the world's biggest trading powers are also  strained most obviously by continuing bilateral tensions between  Washington and Tokyo.    Dealings between the U.S. and the European Union are marred  by bickering over specific issues and by more general mutual  suspicion. This has so far thwarted a common interest in working  together to try to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Brussels  remains deeply nervous about Washington's motives, while the  U.S. decries the EU as cowardly and hypocritical.    Underlying this mistrust are growing uncertainties about the  direction of both powers' future policy. The biggest centre is  in the United States, where the Clinton Administration has  embraced a neo-mercantilist approach giving priority to  government-backed promotion of exports and selected industrial  sectors.    "U.S. attitudes are undergoing a sea-change," says an  international trade policy expert. One recent manifestation was  the administration's decisive role in the $6 billion sale of  Boeing airliners to Saudi Arabia. Another was its retreat from  earlier demands that the Uruguay Round restrict government  subsidies because it wanted the freedom to support U.S.  high-tech industries.    The export drive has added impetus to attempts to prise open  foreign markets. As impatience for quick results grows, U.S.  officials are increasingly disposed to view unilateral measures  as preferable to the often slow and unwieldy mechanisms of the  GATT.    To its supporters the approach is a robustly practical  defence of national interest. To its critics, who include many  other GATT members, it amounts to bully-boy tactics which  threaten to replace multilateral trade rules with the law of the  jungle.    Across the Atlantic, the balance is more delicately poised.  Fears of a "Fortress Europe" have proved overdone. Yet France's  readiness last year to take the Uruguay Round to the brink over  farm trade underlines the fragility of the EU consensus.    That it has remained intact and broadly liberal is due  partly  to the influence of Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner.  But his successors may not be as committed to upholding free  trade. If the United States drifted further towards  unilateralism, the task might prove impossible.    It is, however, by no means certain that will happen.  Optimists point out that the Clinton Administration, while  talking tough, has shrunk from pushing bilateral disagreements  to the point of crisis.    Furthermore, the Uruguay Round will meet U.S. criticisms of  GATT disputes procedures by speeding them up. It will also curb  use of unilateral weapons, such as U.S. section Super-301 trade  sanctions, though Washington claims it will still have the right  to invoke Super 301 in certain conditions.    But probably the strongest safeguard of the integrity of the  multilateral trade system lies in the changed attitudes of  emerging economies. Once suspicious of GATT as a tool of  Western capitalist exploitation, many now see it as a guarantee  of their national interests.    "At the start of the Uruguay Round, countries such as Brazil  were still focusing heavily on a defensive third world agenda,"  says a Western diplomat in Geneva. "By the end, they were much  more eager to press ahead with liberalisation of trade."    As well as keeping markets open for their exports, GATT  disciplines provide their governments with useful leverage to  push through politically controversial reforms at home.    The fact that these countries are also among the world's  fastest-growing markets should, at least, give pause for thought  to industrialised powers wavering in their commitment to  multilateral trade policies. That, however, seems unlikely to  prevent further stresses and strains between GATT's members. On  recent evidence, the road from Marrakesh will prove no less  tortuous than the one leading up to it.</p>

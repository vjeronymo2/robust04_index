			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Terpenes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Terpenes are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal environmental concern with terpenes is their toxicity to aquatic life. In applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for terpenes in adhesives, coatings, and inks, however, the terpenes are both used and bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the product formulation, meaning that there are no discharges of wastewater effluent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could present a risk. Other potential environmental hazards associated with these compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arise from their flammability and unpleasant odors, but these can be controlled by good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Water-based formulations/high-solid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water-based formulations and high-solid formulations are acceptable substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The Agency did not identify any environmental or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health concerns associated with use of these products. These formulations do contain small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of VOCs, but the increase in VOC loadings from these products is expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely small in comparison to VOC contributions from other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Alternative processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative processes, including powder formulations, hot melt, thermoplastic plasma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray, radiation-based formulations, and moisture-cured, chemical-cured, and reactive liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives, are all acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency did not identify any health or environmental concerns associated with use of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes. Since this grouping includes such a wide variety of products for which it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to complete an in-depth risk screen, the Agency solicits additional detail on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential environmental or health effects that merit further investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) The Agency must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communitites;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine the effects of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an agency is required to publish a final rule-making, it must prepare a regulatory flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of the Agency certifies that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that this final rule will not have a significant effect on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities and has therefore concluded that a formal RFA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary. Because costs of the SNAP requirements as a whole are expected to be minor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule is unlikely to adversely affect small businesses, particularly as the rule exempts small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sectors and end-uses from reporting requirements and formal Agency review. In fact, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that information gathering is more expensive and time-consuming for small companies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule may well provide benefits for small businesses anxious to examine potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes to any ozone-depleting class I and II substances they may be using, by requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to make information on such substitutes available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and have been assigned control number 2060&hyph;0226.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 166 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 25 hours per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeper. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW., (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XI.

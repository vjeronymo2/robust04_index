			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Investors hope to strike lucky on dividend - Hanson With the US coal strike apparently moving towards a settlement, Hanson may have some good news for its shareholders when it reports annual profits on Thursday. The strike cost Hanson Pounds 29m in the third quarter and it predicted it would cost Pounds 60m-Pounds 80m in the fourth, to the end of September, so the total cost could be Pounds 100m for the year. Investors are keen to see a settlement, the only question is what the coal producers will have had to give to the mineworkers to achieve that. The market is also hoping for a dividend increase, although forecasts are for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn (FRS3 basis) in 1992 to Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.07bn, and around Pounds 50m less excluding disposal profits against Pounds 1.09bn. Either way earnings per share will be significantly lower. Hanson pays its dividends quarterly, and has paid 2.85p for each of the last four payments. Some feel an increase is due, perhaps to 3p a quarter, while others think a rise will not be forthcoming. Another concern is the level of gearing following the Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) purchase of Quantum Chemical, which went through on the last day of the financial year. Gearing could top 80 per cent, depending on provisions and asset revaluations. Underlying cash flow is not expected to be strong enough to make a sizeable dent in the debt in the short term. This explains Hanson's current drive to make disposals. After last week's two deals worth Pounds 166m, there may be more news. The City will no doubt read into the disposals something more about Hanson's future strategy. It may also hope for further hints on management succession following the recent promotion of Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, to the title of deputy chairman apparently making him front runner to succeed Lord Hanson when he retires in 1997.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Jailed Nissan UK chief loses appeal plea Mr Michael Hunt, the former Nissan UK managing director jailed for eight years after being convicted of the largest corporation tax fraud in UK history, yesterday lost his appeal against both conviction and sentence. Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the majority verdict reached by the trial jury last June convicting Mr Hunt of conspiring to cheat the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m. The fraud involved Nissan UK, former importers of the Japanese cars, using an intermediary company and false invoices to artificially increase freight charges and so avoid corporation tax over a nine-year period. The total loss to the Revenue, including interest, was Pounds 85m, making the case the largest ever brought by the organisation. The Court of Appeal rejected all arguments by Mr Hunt's lawyers against conviction and refused to reduce his sentence. Giving judgment, Lord Justice Stuart Smith said the eight-year sentence was 'not a day too long'. He told Mr Hunt's lawyers: 'Those who indulge in fraud on anything like this scale are playing for very high stakes. The potential profit is enormous, the punishment if they are caught must be condign. It is inevitable that those who are brought to justice face deterrent sentences.' The judge said that Mr Frank Shannon, the former Nissan UK finance director jailed for three years for cheating the Revenue, had been entitled to a substantial discount to his sentence because he had admitted the charge before the trial. The failure of Mr Hunt's appeal opens the way for the Revenue to resume its efforts to gain repayment of unpaid taxes from Nissan UK. It is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which the company's profits were understated. The company has appealed against the Revenue's tax assessment, and this appeal may be heard by the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue in the second half of the year.</p>

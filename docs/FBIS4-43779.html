			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ewa Svensson: "Great Happiness in Denmark"] </F>   [Text] Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister  expressed great satisfaction with the Swedish bridge decision on  Thursday [16 Jun], while the Christian People's Party, a member  of the coalition government, said that it can only accept a  tunnel and is demanding new Oresund negotiations after this  fall's Danish elections.    "I am happy that we can continue with the project with full  security for the environment," Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen said, adding that from the environmental viewpoint the  Oresund bridge is best-investigated bridge project ever.    "The work on the coast-to-coast link can now get under way  at  the same time that the work on land on the Danish side can  resume," the prime minister said.    "I am extremely happy," said Transportation Minister Jan  Trojborg, who believes that the timetable for the construction  of the bridge and the financial framework for the project will  hold, despite the "tardy" Swedish decision.    "Compared with the link across the Great Belt, the Oresund  bridge is a much simpler technical construction," Trojborg said.    Kaj Ikast, his predecessor, was the man who signed the  agreement with Sweden in 1991, and he called the Swedish  decision "strong, important, and courageous."    In 1991 the Christian People's Party did not back the bridge  decision, and Ole M. Nielsen, the party's environment spokesman,  is calling for new negotiations within the government on the  Oresund bridge after this fall's elections.</p>

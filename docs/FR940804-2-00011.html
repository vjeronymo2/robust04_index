			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more (in purchase price situations) as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping (see Silicon Carbide). Since the preliminary estimated dumping margins for exporters of coumarin in the PRC are in excess of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping to the importers of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive pursuant to section 353.16(f)(2) of the Department's regulations. Three respondents have responded to the Department's request for the quantity and value of monthly exports to the U.S. To determine whether there have been massive imports of coumarin from the PRC, we compared each respondent's volume of shipments for the period following the petition (January through June 1994) to the period immediately preceding the petition (July through December 1993). Based on an analysis of these export data, we find that imports from Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native have been massive, while imports from Jiangsu Native have not been massive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to share of domestic consumption, the information available to us at this time does not allow us to evaluate whether the increase in absolute volume of coumarin shipments can be accounted for by a change in domestic consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native, because the preliminary dumping margins are sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping, and because we have found that imports of coumarin have been massive, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances do exist for these two exporters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to Jiangsu Native, because we have found that imports of coumarin have not been massive, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances do not exist for this exporter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As regards the firms covered by the ``All Others'' rate, we have used BIA as the basis for determining whether critical circumstances exist for non-respondent exporters. The BIA margin exceeds the 25 percent threshold for imputing a knowledge of dumping to the importers of the merchandise. In addition, we have adversely assumed, as BIA, a massive increase in imports from these non-respondent exporters. We, therefore, determine that critical circumstances also exist for these exporters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

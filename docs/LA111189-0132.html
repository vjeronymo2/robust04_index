			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> RENOVATION PLANNED FOR FASHION SQUARE  </P> <P> Fashion Square will undergo a transformation over the next 12 months if the  City Council moves forward with an aggressive redevelopment plan, officials  said.  </P> <P> In its role as the city redevelopment agency members, the City Council approved  an owner-participation agreement with Hopkins Development Co. for a project  that will result in the demolition of existing buildings and the construction  of new stores on the west side of the mall. The shopping center is at the  corner of Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> City Manager Lee Risner said final plans for the project will be presented at a  December meeting. Mayor William D. Mahoney spoke for the project, saying that  "it has been a long time in coming. I know that Hopkins and the city manager's  office have worked hard together to make this happen. I think it's definitely  going to benefit the community."  </P> <P> Jeffrey B. Armour, Hopkins' development manager and partner, explained that  demolition of a large portion of the existing mall, including Buffum's  Department Store, is scheduled to begin in March. Construction of new  facilities, including four major stores, should start in April. A grand opening  is tentatively slated for Nov. 15, 1990.  </P> <P> Risner said businesses scheduled for replacement by the new project generate  about $15 million in retail sales each year. He projects that the new stores  will generate about $53 million in their second year of operation. The  Bullock's store is expected to remain and Risner predicts that it will enjoy a  10% increase in business as a result of proposed improvements.  </P> <P> Sales and property tax revenues will be used to repay a bond issue providing  Hopkins with $2.5 million to help with the $32-million project. The debt will  be repaid over 30 years, according to Armour.  </P> <P> Fashion Square was developed by Bullock's in 1968. Armour explained that the  development of other malls, including those in Brea and Puente Hills, resulted  in a decline in sales for Fashion Square businesses. DAVID BURKE  </P></p>

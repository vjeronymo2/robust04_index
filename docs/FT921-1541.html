			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Observer: After-kill Fresh from the Macabre Notebook - a new form of countering human pollution. Well . . .post-human, to be exact. W. Canning, the speciality chemicals maker which reported yesterday, is always on the look-out for an innovative use for its products. It has found one in Spain, for its biocides. They are chemicals which kill off biological growth: algae is an obvious example, bacteria in industrial waste is another. Less obvious is the use in a funeral parlour. The biocides mop up body fluids. No seepage from the grave. No post-human pollution. A new meaning for dust-to-dust, ashes-to-ashes.</p>

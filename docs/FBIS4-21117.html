As a  result of this operation more than 20 kg of drugs and raw  materials for their manufacture were confiscated from  criminals.    As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at the Moscow GUVD  [City Administration of Internal Affairs], the greatest  consignment of narcotic raw materials was confiscated in the  lobby of the Kiyevskaya subway station by the Fedchik  brothers--officers of the UVD's 3rd Department for Subway  Security. They detained Ukrainian citizen Igor Belov; during the  subsequent search, 13 kg of poppy straw was found in his  possession and confiscated. At the same time, at the  Komsomolskaya subway station operatives detained Rostov Oblast  resident Igor Roshchin, on whom they found--and confiscated--500  g of marijuana. In addition, 30 g of poppy straw, four liters of  pervitin, and a sawn-off shotgun were found in the possession of  watchmen at an industrial warehouse on Dorozhnaya Street.    According to militia data, suppliers of drugs and materials  for their manufacture have changed their tactics lately. They  now do not go directly to Moscow from contiguous states on  long-distance trains but instead disembark in oblast centers  such as Kaluga or Tula. From there they usually hitch a car ride  to the capital. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year  militia personnel have confiscated about 200 kg of poppy straw  at Kievskiy Railroad Station alone. According to operatives, the  size of the average supplier's consignment of poppy straw these  days is 60-70 kg.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The military government of General Sani Abacha in  Nigeria is coming under increasing pressure to declare its  intentions and to set a timetable for a return to civilian rule.  His proposal to hold a national conference took the heat off for  a while, but now a military man, Lieutenant General David Mark,  who was a member of former President Babangida's government and  one of the officers retired after Gen. Abacha seized power last  November, has launched an attack on the military regime, talking  of hidden agendas. But there are those asking if Gen. Mark  might not have a hidden agenda of his own. From Lagos, Sola  Odunfa reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] Lt. Gen. David Mark described the  Abacha government as a betrayal of the military officers who  took part in installing the government and as a betrayal of hope  and aspirations for all Nigerians. The general told the  magazine, NEWSWATCH, in an interview published in Lagos that he  was one of the officers who met towards the end of last year to  decide what to do about the interim national government headed  by the civilian business executive, Chief Ernest Shonekan. He  said that most of the officers favored giving full military  backing to Chief Shonekan to conduct another presidential  election, but, under pressure from Generals Sani Abacha and  Oladipo Diya, they agreed to sack the interim government and  install a full military government to rule for no longer than  one year. He said that the option for a return to full military  government was supported by leading politicians.    Lt. Gen. Mark said that the strongest support came from  close  political associates of Chief Moshood Abiola, the SDP [Social  Democratic Party] candidate who was believed to have won the  annulled presidential election held last June. Lt. Gen. Mark  said, however, that since the restoration of full military rule,  the Abacha government had repudiated the original plan that it  should last only a maximum of one year. He said that all its  actions showed that the new rulers were seeking to be in power  for at least five years but they were finding it difficult to  tell Nigerians their real intentions.    The interview contains harsh criticisms of Gen. Abacha and  his second in command, Gen. Oladipo Diya, and praise for the  ousted president, Gen. Babangida. These have led many people to  regard the entire piece as another propaganda work by former  officers still loyal to Gen. Babangida in the same vein as some  of the ex-president's former aides talked Chief Abiola into  writing a private letter to him as a friend and then they leaked  it to the press to show him up as a person who cared only for  his personal interests.

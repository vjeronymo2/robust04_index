Ritums Rozenbergs reports about  these talks over the telephone from Moscow.    [Rozenbergs] A meeting between Latvian Ambassador to Russia  Janis Peters and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering was  held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Monday afternoon. The  main topic of the talks was the present state of relations  between Latvia and Russia, especially in the wake of the  Latvian-Russian treaties initialled on 15 March as well as the  Yeltsin order on military bases published on 6 April.    During the talks with Pickering, Mr. Peters stressed that  signing the package of agreements should in no way contradict  the interests of the Latvian people. Pickering confirmed  Washington's readiness to grant $2 million for the dismantling  of the Skrunda radar station. The ambassadors discussed the  possibility of granting vouchers to Russian military pensioners  who express the wish to move to live in Russia, to obtain  apartments. The United States is not yet ready to specify the  amounts of money which it is to earmark for such vouchers. A  serious discussion was held on the possibility of attracting  foreign capital to a Skrunda fund.</p>

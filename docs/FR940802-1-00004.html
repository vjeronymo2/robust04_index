			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sixty-two percent of the parents in the follow-up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations reported that the child used the walker more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once a day. For each use, 37 percent reported that the child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically was in the walker for less than 30 minutes; 45 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported that for each use the child typically was in the walker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for about 30&hyph;60 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. The Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission knows of 18 manufacturers or importers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baby walkers and jumpers. The leading manufacturer sells several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times as many walkers as the next largest, and the top 9 brands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or private labels are thought to account for about 60 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Risks of Injury and Death  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deaths. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission is aware of 11 deaths related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baby walkers that have occurred between 1989 and 1993. Of these,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four children drowned, four suffocated, two fell down stairs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one fell out of a walker and received a fatal head injury. In one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these incidents, the seat loosened, allowing the child to slip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downward and suffocate when his trachea was compressed against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the walker's tray. In all the other incidents, the walker may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have provided the child with the mobility to access the hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deaths reported to CPSC are not statistically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative, and may not include all the deaths associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with baby walkers during this time period. Also, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of 1991, CPSC received death certificates from deaths  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as ``falls'' from only one or two states. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of fall-related baby walker deaths known to CPSC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably an undercount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Injuries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In 1993, there were an estimated 25,000 baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walker-related injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States. Baby walkers account for higher numbers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries annually than does any other type of nursery product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in 1991, there were an estimated 10,400 injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to strollers and carriages, the nursery product category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the next highest number of estimated injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on an estimated 27,000 emergency-room-treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries to children under 15 months of age in 1991 and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 4 million walkers in use, the estimated annual rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury is 6.75 injuries per 1,000 walkers in use. The most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current data show a 12 percent increase in baby walker-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms for January through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1994, compared to the same period in 1993.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

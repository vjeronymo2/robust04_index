On 29 December 1993, officials from the People's Bank of  China announced: As of 1 January 1994, China will unify  exchange rates and practice a unitary, well-managed, and  floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand.  This major measure taken by the Chinese Government for the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure is  undoubtedly a relatively thorough change to the double-track  system of exchange rates, under which official rates and rates  quoted at foreign exchange swap markets coexisted, and which has  been practiced in China for several dozen years.    In fact, the exchange rate of renminbi has undergone several  changes since reform and opening up. Prior to 9 April 1991, an  adjustable "pegged" exchange rate system was practiced in China  for official exchange rates. Starting 9 April 1991, the  official rates of renminbi were quoted under a managed floating  rate system with the rates between U.S. dollar and reminbi at  about 1:5.2 then floating to about 1:5.8 at the end of last  year. At the beginning of 1988, China set up foreign exchange  swap markets, allowing enterprises to buy or sell foreign  exchange at the prices determined, to a certain extent, by  market supply and demand. In December 1991, China again set up  foreign exchange swap markets for residents inside the  territory, allowing them to trade foreign exchange within a  certain limit. Comparing the present reform with the above  progressive changes, people can see that there are distinctive  differences in terms of range and intensity.    The current reform of foreign exchange system also includes  the practice of a banking system in settlement and sales of  foreign exchange; revocation of foreign exchange to be retained  and turned over to the state by enterprises; establishment of an  exchange market for transactions among banks; improvement of  exchange rate formation mechanisms; prohibition of foreign  exchange priced, settled, and circulated inside the territory;  suspension of issuing exchange coupons; improvement and  perfection of managing settlement of internal and external  remittances; realization of renminbi convertibility under  current accounts; cancellation of mandatory planning for revenue  and expenditure in foreign exchange; and exercise of macroscopic  regulation and control by the state over foreign exchange and  international payments mainly through economic and legal means.    This major reform measure will have a far-reaching impact on  China's economy. Experts maintain that judging from the  economic situation in China now, conditions for unified exchange  rates have matured. According to the latest figures released by  the State Statistical Bureau, China's GNP broke through 3  trillion yuan last year, representing an increase of 13 percent  over the previous year, and the total volume of imports and  exports reached $190 billion, increasing by approximately 15  percent over the previous year. Since Chinese commodities are  acceptable to the world, it is natural that renminbi, which  represents the value of Chinese commodities, should be accepted  by the world too. This has provided favorable conditions for  unification of the renminbi exchange rate from the point of  balancing international payments.    People also discovered that at the time when the exchange  rates were being unified, a "consumption craze" emerged in large  and medium cities in China, but it was very soon quenched. This  was attributed to the following arrangements of the government.  Foreign exchange retained by enterprises was allowed to be used  again, exchange coupons were allowed to be used indefinitely  after the suspension of their issuance, the price difference  between renminbi and exchange coupons was maintained, and  others, to avoid encroaching upon the interests of enterprises,  localities, and individuals. In the meantime, people realized  more clearly that although the unification of exchange rates  might still cause labor pangs, after all, advantages outweighed  disadvantages. It will be conducive to China's openness to the  outside world, importing of foreign capital, building of the  socialist market economic structure, and enhancement of  efficiency in all capital liquidity. It will also contribute to  restoring China's signatory status in GATT as it has removed a  major obstruction on the road to reentering GATT. In addition,  the practice of a unified exchange rate system also has opened a  path for renminbi to become a freely convertible currency,  thereby moving toward achieving the ultimate goal of linking  China's markets with the world market.    Economists here maintain that in the course of abolishing  the  old structure and establishing the new, there are still a lot of  concrete tasks to do. China's new exchange rate system has just  begun to operate, so the government should be very prudent in  its actions and chiefly employ economic and legal means to  achieve macroscopic regulation and control over foreign exchange  and international payments, with a view to preventing great  fluctuations in exchange rates and ensuring China's economy  develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner.</p>

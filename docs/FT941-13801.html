			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Cleveland carve-up sets off election row A fresh controversy has grown from last week's decision to replace Cleveland County Council with four unitary authorities. The argument is over whether elections for the four should be held in May this year or next. The new councils will come into being in April next year and will have the same boundaries as the present four districts. The argument about the election date has split local parties. Cross-party district councillors tend to favour delaying elections until the new unitary authorities are in place next year. But some county councillors believe that district representatives who expect to start handling county work soon should seek a mandate from the electorate as soon as possible. District councillors will play an important role between now and April next year in determining how their authorities absorb the roles of the doomed county council, including education and social services. The council has 21,865 employees and a Pounds 404m annual budget. County council Tory group leader and Middlesbrough district councillor Mrs Hazel Pearson, who is 'sad and disillusioned' by the government's handling of the reorganisation, said: 'It would be totally wrong that a council elected at district level takes on the mantle of a county role without going to the electorate.' Cleveland's Labour leader Mr Paul Harford agrees. 'People who are going to dictate the level of services should put their manifesto to the electorate before, not after,' he said. Mr Bryan Hanson, Labour leader of Hartlepool district council, said: 'We're always getting new duties to perform, like Care in the Community last year. I see this as us recovering those duties we lost in 1974 (the last reorganisation). Whether we have elections before or immediately after is irrelevant.' The timing of elections in Cleveland has wide implications as it is the first mainland county on which a reorganisation decision has been made.</p>

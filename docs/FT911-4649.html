			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): Growing appeal of overseas assets - Why managers are succumbing to the attractions UK PENSION funds have been steadily expanding their holdings of overseas assets during the last decade. At the end of 1979 - the year in which exchange controls were dramatically lifted by the incoming Conservative government - only 6 per cent of the average UK fund's portfolio was represented by overseas equities. By 1986 this had jumped to 20 per cent, and though the UK subsequently swung back into favour again, the upward trend in the overseas asset mix now looks set to resume. Latest figures from the WM Company show that in 1990 the proportion dipped from 21 per cent at the start of the year to 18 per cent by end-December: this was mostly due, though, to the sharper fall in overseas stock markets than in the UK during the period. Since 1987 overseas bonds have also begun to attract interest - accounting for 2 per cent of average assets by the end of 1989. In the view of many observers - though by no means all - they are set to become a permanent asset class in their own right in the 1990s. The growing proportion of overseas holdings can partly be explained by the greater percentage of cash flow being earmarked for non-UK assets by pension fund managers, and partly by the relatively strong investment performance of non-UK markets during the last 10 years. Both domestic UK and foreign equities have shown far superior returns to UK gilts and property since the early 1980s. Overseas investment is justified by pension funds on the grounds that it enables them to spread their risk through diversification, and obtain exposure to strongly performing markets. 'We take the view that it dampens the volatility effect,' explains Mr Richard Fitzalan Howard of Fleming Investment Management. 'History shows that the effect of having a diversified portfolio in different markets is to lower the risk, without having to have a lot of bonds and cash.' Fleming, whose Pounds 14bn of UK pension fund assets were roughly 25 per cent invested in overseas equities and 6 per cent in overseas bonds in mid-March, reckons that a weighting of more than 50 per cent could be justified outside the UK if full investment freedom were granted by trustees. As it is, the group is aiming for 35-40 per cent in the medium term. In the early days of overseas investment the US tended to be the most popular home for the overseas part of a pension fund portfolio. Relative to the world index, funds have always tended to be underweight in Japan. To some extent this has reflected prejudice on the part of trustees, though who can say that they were wrong in 1990 when Japan was the poorest performing equity market of all, turning in a negative 42.7 per cent return? Continental Europe, meanwhile, previously neglected and little understood, is now the most popular region outside the UK for pension fund managers. According to WM, no less than 38 per cent of the average overseas pension fund portfolio was invested in Europe at the end of 1990, against 29 per cent in the US, 18 per cent in Japan, and 15 per cent in other Asian markets. The big question for the 1990s is likely to be the impact on thinking of sterling's full entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS. This is merely the latest - but at the same time the most striking - sign of the way in which European economies are becoming more closely integrated into a single market. The 1992 programme has set Europe firmly on a new course; the plan to turn the EMS into a single currency by the mid to late 1990s has provided an exciting pointer to the final destination. If currency risks are diminished - either through even narrower bands in the ERM or through the ultimate triumph of the ecu - the distinction between UK and European equities will lose much of its significance. Some pension funds are already beginning to consider the UK and continental Europe as one geographical area rather than two when setting investment constraints and guidelines. The more interest rates, inflation and economic growth rates converge, the more sensible that policy is likely to look. Fund managers seeking to buy the best insurance companies, for example, would hardly be wise to confine themselves to the five leading UK composites. They are not only medium-sized by European standards, they are arguably less capable than their continental rivals of meeting the challenges which will be posed by an increasingly unified insurance market. With many British companies already earning a considerable proportion of their profits in continental Europe, the case for looking at the European Community as a single investment bloc can only get stronger. But where does one stop? A typical UK pension fund now invests around 57 per cent of its assets in UK equities, a proportion which would have to be more than halved if one looks at the relative market capitalisations in different European countries. There are many other questions for pension fund managers to address in the 1990s. How, for example, can they improve their country and stock selection, which has been distinctly mixed to date. When the percentage of funds invested overseas was relatively low in the early 1980s, this was not a particularly serious issue. With a fifth of assets outside the UK today, it certainly is. It is noteworthy that pension funds which put their money into an equity index fund would have done much better overseas than most of its peers in the last decade. As market efficiency increases, stock selection gains will be more difficult to achieve. There is also the question of how emerging markets - the Pacific Rim, Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe - fit in. Such markets exhibit different risk/reward characteristics but hold the promise of much faster growth and better returns than developed countries.</p>

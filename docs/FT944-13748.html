			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak declines further despite sales rise Eastman Kodak, the US photographic manufacturer, announced a further decline in operating profit in the third quarter and said restructuring of the company might be necessary in the fourth quarter. Profits from the company's imaging business, which forms almost its sole activity after an Dollars 8bn disposal programme, were down 25 per cent in the quarter in spite of a 12 per cent rise in sales. Net earnings fell 33 per cent to Dollars 193m, or Dollars 0.57 a share, excluding last year's restructuring charge of Dollars 353m. Kodak said charges stemming from the write-down of assets - principally stocks - had cost 12 cents a share in the quarter. First-time consolidation of its Qualex photo-finishing business had cost a further 6 cents a share. Before Qualex's contribution, group sales were up 8 per cent. Kodak's shares, which had largely discounted the news, closed up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 48 in New York. The shares are about 11 per cent off their peak in mid-September, when the market was enthusiastic about the rapid progress being made in asset disposals by Mr George Fisher, the new chairman. The company said yesterday that besides its stock problems, it had been affected by pricing pressures and cost increases in advertising, administration and employment benefits. Mr Fisher, who described the results as mixed, said: 'Our cost management efforts continued during the third quarter and will carry into the fourth quarter . . . Kodak will not inventory its problems and carry them forward. We will emerge from 1994 with a strong balance sheet and a solid benchmark for measuring future performance'. The commercial imaging division suffered a particularly sharp profits fall of 39 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 94m, with margins down to 4.9 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Performance in copiers was hit by sluggish sales, Kodak said. Profits from consumer imaging were down 19 per cent to Dollars 269m, with margins down to 16.7 per cent from 24.6 per cent. Kodak said it was 'hard to speculate' on the size of any restructuring programme, since nothing had yet been decided. Last year's Dollars 353m restructuring programme came before Mr Fisher's arrival, it pointed out.</p>

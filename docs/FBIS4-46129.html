			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas] </F>   [Excerpt] The questioning of abducted "Believers  Resistance" leader Mustafa al-Dirani is progressing as expected,  senior army sources said yesterday, and he is cooperating with  his interrogators and has already provided useful information on  various issues.    At the same time, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and South  Lebanon Army units were put on a heightened alert following  Hizballah threats and corroborating intelligence indicators that  the Shi'ite organizations plan to avenge the Saturday kidnapping  of al-Dirani.    In the aftermath of the al-Dirani abduction, OC Northern  Command Maj. Gen. Yitzhaq Mordekhay said that warnings and some  indications of a possible reprisal necessitated taking all  precautionary measures. Similar precautions in towns and  kibbutzim in the north will be made, pending developments in the  next few days.    Israeli diplomats and Israeli offices and installations  abroad were also put on alert for fear of possible retaliation  from Hizballah or proxy organizations.    Meanwhile, al-Dirani's interrogation continued in an  undisclosed location in Israel.    The chief of Intelligence Branch, Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, told  yesterday's cabinet meeting that al-Dirani's intelligence value  exceeds the issue of missing navigator Ron Arad. [passage  omitted]    Army sources said that al-Dirani himself, and documents  found  in his house in Qasr Naba, may shed light on Hizballah  activities, as well as financial networking and relations with  Iranian and Syrian agents.

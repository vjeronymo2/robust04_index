			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / India caught in new cellular network bid row THE Indian government has taken steps to end controversy over awarding licences for cellular telephone networks by withdrawing licences granted last autumn and handing out new ones. But the new decision could be as hotly contested as the original. Already, one unsuccessful bidder has started court action and another has said that it might follow suit. The controversy illustrates how India's efforts to modernise and liberalise its economy can fall foul of bureaucratic and political interference. The ambitious proposals for establishing cellular telephone networks in the four largest cities - Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras - were first announced two years ago. Telecommunications groups from Europe, East Asia and North America rushed to bid in partnership with large Indian companies. But when the Ministry of Telecommunications finally announced the results last year, the losers protested against the evaluation of bids. Three losing bidders - including Hutchison Max Telecom, a joint venture involving Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong - challenged the ministry in court. Hutchison Max Telecom was particularly aggrieved because its bid had been rejected on the grounds that its tender documents contained a typographical error. The court in March ordered the ministry to re-evaluate aspects of the bids. In particular, the judge said officials had been wrong to turn down Hutchison Max for a typographical mistake and ordered them to reinstate the company. Hutchison Max's bid came top in the re-evaluation: it was therefore entitled to one of the two licences for Bombay, potentially the most lucrative market and most bidders' top target. This then entailed redistributing most of the other licences. After months of deliberation, officials finally informed bidders last week. Hutchison Max was delighted. Mr Bhai Mohan Singh, head of the family-owned group which is the local partner in the venture, said yesterday: 'This has gone on too long. I'm glad we can get started at last.' But Tata group, India's largest conglomerate, which had been granted a licence for Delhi in the original awards and was given nothing, filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the ministry.</p>

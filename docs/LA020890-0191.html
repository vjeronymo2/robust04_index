			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING, FOREMAN SPAR OVER TYSON FIGHT  </P> <P> The critics scoff and sneer, but pay-per-view exhibitors are lining up already  to buy it.  </P> <P> Mike Tyson vs. George Foreman.  </P> <P> However, Tyson's promoter, Don King, sought to pop that inflating balloon  today, claiming that Foreman already has turned down an offer that might have  earned him $30 million to fight Tyson later this year.  </P> <P> "I offered George Foreman blank paper (a contract) in December, and it was for  $5 million against 30%," King said.  </P> <P> "This was before he knocked out (Gerry) Cooney. If he beats a ranked  heavyweight and sets up a title fight with Mike, George Foreman is very  promotable. He's a former champion. He's got two generations of fans. If he  takes the 30% and the fight goes through the roof, he's lookin' at $30 million.  </P> <P> "So, when George turns that down, what he's tellin' you is, he doesn't want to  fight Mike Tyson, and we're gonna accommodate him."  </P> <P> This is all gamesmanship, of course. Pay-per-view's exhibitors around the  country are all but panting for a Tyson-Foreman bout.  </P> <P> Foreman told reporters last month that King had offered him a $5-million  contract to sign for a Tyson fight, contingent upon his beating Cooney and a  ranked heavyweight -- Foreman is expected to fight Jose Ribalta in April. He  did not say King had offered him a percentage.  </P> <P> "If it had been Bob Arum, I'd have signed for a dollar down," Foreman said.  </P> <P> King, who is here with Tyson for Sunday's Tyson-Buster Douglas fight, was asked  if another offer would be made to Foreman should he defeat a ranked opponent in  April.  </P> <P> "I already handed him a blank contract," King said. "I can't offer him anything  better than a deal made in heaven, and that's what that was. He talks a lot  about fighting Mike, but he really doesn't want it. He's just not in Mike's  future."  </P> <P> What happens if the pay-per-view people tell King that a Tyson-Foreman bout  could do, say, $200 million?  </P> <P> "If we want to make $200 million, we'll go get (wrestler) Hulk Hogan," King  said with a shrug.  </P> <P> King was asked if he fears that too much Tyson-Foreman talk will diminish the  promotion of the June 18 Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight, for which Donald Trump  has paid $12 million. It is reported that pay-per-view sales to exhibitors for  that one are moving slowly.  </P> <P> "Not at all," King said. "That fight would do $50 million tomorrow, right out  of the chute, with no promotion at all. The reason the pay-per-view deals  aren't moving is because I'm over here, not there."  </P> <P> Tyson, King said, sees a Foreman fight as one he can't win. "Mike says if he  beats him, people will tease him about beatin' up on a 42-year-old man, and  they'll laugh at him if he loses," King said.  </P> <P> Tyson said Wednesday that Foreman belongs in a seniors' league.  </P> <P> "I don't think much of him as a fighter," Tyson said. "But if you put him in a  40-and-over league, he'd kill everybody. And that stuff about wanting to eat  all the time . . . he reminds me of that wrestler, what's his name? Hillbilly  Jim?"  </P> <P> King said Foreman's refusal of his December offer reminded him of Foreman's  late-hour holdout for more money at the 1974 Foreman-Muhammad Ali fight in  Zaire.  </P> <P> "This is all vintage George Foreman; he's done this before," King said. "The  day before the Ali fight, he sent someone to tell me he wanted another $500,000  or he wouldn't fight. So we sent one of his men, Leroy Jackson, to London, to  see our banker there.  </P> <P> "I called the banker before Jackson got there and told him to stall him, but to  let him think he'd get the money.  </P> <P> "In the meantime, George gets a visit by the Zaire Army. About 20 soldiers come  bustin' through George's door with machine guns, and one of them tells George:  'You can't embarrass our President like this.'  </P> <P> "George picks up a Bible and starts reading some psalms out loud. Then he  starts to pray. Then he looks at the soldiers and says: 'The light came to me  -- I'm gonna fight.'  </P> <P> "Meanwhile, in London, it's amateur night for Leroy Jackson. Our banker has him  believing the extra $500,000 is on its way. Leroy calls George and tells him  not to worry. So George goes in the ring against Ali, believing he's got  another $500,000 on ice somewhere.  </P> <P> "Nothing has changed with George."  </P></p>

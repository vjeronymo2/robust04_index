			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan to introduce ministerial policy teams - Civil Service LABOUR will raise the public esteem of civil servants, review but not revoke the move to administrative agencies and broaden the political input to decision-making through ministerial policy teams, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday. The proposals came in what was Labour's first important statement on government administration, delivered in a keynote speech last night to the Royal Institute of Public Administration. In a clear effort to differentiate Labour's approach from that of the Tories, Mr Smith argued that the 1980s had seen a fashion for disparaging the work of the public sector. 'The case for efficient, adequately resourced and highly motivated public services is neither hard to explain nor difficult to justify,' he argued. Yet in recent speeches, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, had continued to stress that the government was still committed to reduce the size of the administration. 'It is certain that significant cutbacks will be necessary if the Conservatives are to achieve their goal of a basic tax rate of 20 pence,' Mr Smith warned. Putting the case for devoting the 'growth dividend' to investment and improvement in public services, he said that Tory efforts to achieve private affluence 'ignore the risks of public squalor.' Labour would attempt to keep pay 'broadly comparable with equivalent movements elsewhere.' Acknowledging that there remained scope for improved efficiency, he endorsed a recent speech by Lord Armstrong, the previous head of the civil service, for more training. Tackling the issue of political input to policy making, Mr Smith backed the Treasury select committee's recommendation of Ministerial Policy Units comprising both political appointees and career civil servants. On new administrative agencies, he hinted that Labour would not scrap the system, though their role would be reviewed. What was vital was that agencies were not a first step to privatisation. In his concluding remarks, Mr Smith emphasised that at least some of the problem of accountability would be resolved by a new Freedom of Information Act, to be introduced by Labour in the first session of a new parliament.</p>

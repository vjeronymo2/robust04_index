			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown barracked by Militant MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liber-al Democrat leader, was jostled and barracked yesterday by Militant sympathisers supporting Mr Terry Fields, who was expelled from the Labour party but is defending Liverpool Broadgreen as an independent. Mr Ashdown - who was campaigning on housing policy in Liverpool - challenged Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to confront Militant. Continuing the hectic pace he has set himself, Mr Ashdown said that bad housing was a cost of the government's anti-inflation strategy. 'Anybody can bring inflation down by stopping the economy dead in its tracks,' he said. He called for councils' capital receipts to be freed in order to kickstart the construction industry. Mr Ashdown, who is thankful that his party has not been squeezed by Labour or the Tories in the first week of the campaign, also called for an independent central bank and for sterling to be moved to the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in order to bear down on inflation. Later, at his official adoption meeting in his Yeovil constituency, Mr Ashdown complained of the 'arrogance' of the Labour and Tory parties 'who have spent these last weeks and months of their campaign not debating about the future, but arguing about the past'. He added: 'The Liberal Democrats are the only party in the election which has recognised the seriousness of Britain's current situation. There is a real danger that, under either of the two other parties, that situation could well become catastrophic.'</p>

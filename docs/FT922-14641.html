			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Roche to raise payout as earnings jump by 56% ROCHE surpassed Ciba-Geigy last year to become the largest of the big three Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical groups in terms of net profit. Roche yesterday reported a 56 per cent jump in consolidated net income in 1991 to SFr1.5bn (Dollars 995m), comfortably surpassing the SFr1.28bn revealed last week by Ciba. Net income of Sandoz, the third largest, was SFr1.1bn. Ciba remains by far the largest of the three in terms of sales, with turnover last year of SFr21bn, compared with Sandoz's SFr13.4bn and Roche's SFr11.5bn. Roche described its profit last year as 'a very good result' and proposed raising the dividend by one third to SFr28 per share or dividend right certificate. The profit was well above analysts' expectations, but indications were that a large part came from non-operating items, notably exchange rate movements. Roche said that 'the continued healthy development in the non-operating sector has also been a major contribution to the very good result'. The relative weakness of the Swiss franc was another contributing factor, it added. The group said profits in its operating business improved in spite of a considerable increase in spending on introducing new products, and substantial restructuring costs. Mr Nigel Spence of Baring Securities said the growth of profits from operations was probably higher than the 18.4 per cent growth in sales. The group's dividend right certificates (genusschein) rose SFr40 yesterday to SFr3,120. Roche said its cash flow rose 41 per cent to SFr2.26bn and capital spending was up 26 per cent to SFr1.1bn, with much of it directed at projects in the US and Switzerland.</p>

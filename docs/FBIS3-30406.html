Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, in  remarks quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, added that  if Serb observers were not present, "the airport could be used  as a channel for arms deliveries to Moslems." He welcomed  Russia's proposal to send observers to the airport but added  that "the presence of Serb observers" was "vital."    It appeared unlikely the Moslems would agree to such  conditions, observers said. It also seemed surprising that the  rump Yugoslavia's army should announce the Bosnian Serbs'  conditions on reopening the airport. Although Serbia openly  backs Bosnia's Serbs, it does not officially have authority over  them. Until now, Bosnian Serbs have steadfastly refused to  yield on the airport issue.    Their leader Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday [1 February] it  was up to the Bosnian Serb "parliament" to decide what to do on  the issue.    While Tuzla itself is controlled by Moslems, the airport  zone  is within firing distance of Serb forces, whose positions are a  few kilometers (miles) from the town.    The United Nations is considering authorising air strikes  against besieging Serb forces to obtain the reopening of Tuzla,  which is considered an essential channel for humanitarian aid.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Man In The News: Superman, or just a grey man of steel - Brian Moffat There is something about the way Brian Moffat has reached the chairman's office at British Steel that resembles the ascent of another 'man who came from nowhere' - Prime Minister John Major. Like the prime minister, Moffat's public persona was scarcely visible when he added the job of chairman to that of chief executive - a step he says British Steel never intended to take. But his profile is higher after a week which saw him lambasting state subsidies in Europe and 'ostriches' in the US  -Big Steel and its unions. Like Major, too, Moffat owes a considerable debt to a predecessor whose style could hardly be more different: the ebullient Sir Bob Scholey. A man with a legendary temper and an ability to arouse strong emotions has given way to a man who inspires respect but is described as reticent and aloof. 'I don't smile too much,' says Moffat, who has been silver-haired as long as anyone at British Steel can remember. 'But at times it's been grim. Perhap's there'll be more opportunity to smile as things pick up.' The analogy with Downing Street should not be pursued too far: Thatcher went because she was pushed; Sir Bob served out his contract. Moffat, aged 54 and named chief executive in 1991, took on the additional role of chairman this year after the new non-executive chairman, Sir Alistair Frame, resigned for health reasons. Moffat's style may contrast with Sir Bob's but his message - spelled out on Monday as the company announced a Pounds 149m annual pre-tax loss - picks up many of the same themes: free markets, level playing fields, cost control, competitiveness; above all, the refrain, 'We've cut capacity, now it's somebody else's turn.' But a big question remains: does Moffat have the political skills and the charisma for the top job? Running British Steel is a highly political task. The company may have been privatised in 1988, but no big integrated steelmaker can operate in a vacuum: witness the outrage in Scotland last year over the final closure of the Ravenscraig plant, this week's dispute over US anti-dumping duties, and the tortuous progress of the European Commission's restructuring plans for the industry. Some observers believe British Steel might appoint another non-executive chairman to replace Sir Alistair, but the ideal solution, says Moffat, would be for him to remain chairman and a new chief executive to be appointed from within the company. The City would prefer the roles to be split, but at present British Steel is sticking with Moffat in both. 'Two institutions have raised the question,' he says. 'We've seen one and written to the other. We've had understanding replies.' One role or two, British Steel characteristically makes no attempt to puff up the image of its chairman, who is no self-promoter. The company's bald biographical note does scant justice to his career. Born and raised in Scotland, Moffat is a chartered accountant who joined the former British Steel Corporation in 1968, a year after it was nationalised, from Peat Marwick Mitchell. Starting as deputy controller, finance, at head office, he moved through a succession of posts before becoming managing director of finance in 1986. Moffat's big break - especially for an accountant - was his appointment by Scholey in 1976 as director of the sprawling Port Talbot works in South Wales. 'Bob Scholey was never frightened to use youth, and neither have I been,' he says. Moffat spent 10 years at Port Talbot, weathering the national strike in 1980, cutting jobs from 13,500 to 4,700, and masterminding its restructuring and capital spending programme. 'We rebuilt it from end to end, turning something that was third class into a first-class plant,' he says. By this stage, he says, he enjoyed making steel more than being an accountant, and he was initially reluctant to go back to head office as managing director, finance. But the move gave him the opportunity to become involved with the 1988 privatisation of British Steel, and established his strong reputation in the City. Three years later, Moffat's ascent through British Steel received a surprise boost. Martin Llowarch, destined to be chairman, resigned suddenly as chief executive and Moffat replaced him. Today, as chairman and chief executive, Moffat retains his strong reputation in the City, but a succession of reduced or passed dividends and the difficulties over EC restructuring and US trade friction raise the question of whether the job is too big for him - or for any one person. One consultant familiar with British Steel calls the decision to combine both posts 'scandalous . . . Moffat is a very good chief executive, he's a tough son-of-a-bitch, but he doesn't have the vision to be a chairman'. Sir Alistair's departure, he says, not only gave British Steel a chance to retreat back into its shell, but robbed the company of a chairman with immense experience in dealing with politicians. Moffat responds: 'If the whole burden of British Steel rested on my shoulders, that would not say much for its management depth. I can bring the company the benefit of my experience and set the agenda. Other people will have to carry it out.' And his vision of the future? Moffat may be an accountant-turned steelman, but his message to long-suffering shareholders suggests he has not gone entirely native. 'I'm not interested in making steel, I'm far more interested in making money,' he says. 'We've been cutting costs very seriously since 1980, now we've got to concentrate on the revenue side.' This means raising prices, improving the product mix and further enhancing quality. To satisfy the doubters, the man who came from nowhere has to prove that he is a somebody on the public stage and that he can deliver on this strategy.</p>

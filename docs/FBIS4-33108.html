			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bolivian Armed Forces command yesterday reported  on an alleged political plot against the military institution  and denied that the high command and the executive branch are  planning to "relocate" a large portion of its troops.    The Armed Forces issued a communique in which they warn that  alien interests seek to discredit the high command and to create  an appropriate climate to eliminate the institution. They assert  that this will not be allowed to happen.    Information disclosed yesterday states that military and  executive branch authorities, in complete secrecy, discussed the  alleged plan to "drastically reduce" the number of troops and  that this initiative is allegedly supported by the U.S. Embassy.    The alleged plan would have the financial support of the  U.S.  Government and would allegedly seek to convince officers and  soldiers to accept a "voluntary retirement" through the payment  of illegal bonuses, like the procedure used to "relocate"  thousands of workers.    The Armed Forces command, after regretting the spreading of  distorted information, states: "The military career is based on  a strong professional desire to serve the nation, a task which  is fulfilled with dignity, based on honor and respect, whose  strength even contemplates sacrifice if circumstances so demand."    The communique adds: "In our capacity as the main  protagonists for the creation of the fatherland, our fate is  linked to that of the nation and no misinterpretation or  political plot will threaten our existence because the Armed  Forces' noble mission cannot be modified or distorted."    The Armed Forces communique continues: "Despite this  concealed provocation, which has the evil purpose of  discrediting the high command by accusing it of being aware of  such an ignoble plan, we clearly state that we will loyally  fulfill our commitment to preserve dignity and institutional  integrity."    Admiral Julio Molina, the Bolivian Navy commander, minimized  the press report, stating: "I don't know anything about a plan  of this sort, moreover, that information is not explicit because  it does not mention a source."    Molina added: "This sort of information must be investigated  and documented by the media because if not it will cause unrest  in any involved institution."    Other military high command sources stated: "The information  is completely false and designed to cause problems for the  government. It creates false expectations among officers and  sergeants due to the irresponsible mention of alleged economic  compensations. The military high command never discussed or  talked about such a proposal."    More than two years ago the Armed Forces command ordered the  compulsory retirement of some 600 civilians, which is the most  recent rationalization of the military institution's personnel  which, at that time, was interpreted as the beginning of a  gradual process to establish "a smaller but more efficient and  operative Armed Forces."    At that time the military authorities rejected rumors and  justified the measure by pointing out "it was just an  administrative measure that by no means represented the  beginning of a process to purge military personnel."    FIDES NEWS AGENCY states that the U.S. Embassy has said that  "the decision to determine the size of the Armed Forces belongs  to Bolivia," and denied exerting any pressure to reduce the  number of troops.    U.S. Embassy officials have stated: "The United States does  not have any financial plans regarding an alleged reduction by  paying Bolivian officials to retire."    The diplomatic authorities recalled that Barry McCaffrey,  commander of the South Command headquartered in Panama, paid a  protocol visit in March. When consulted about the reduction of  the Armed Forces in Latin America, he answered: "I cannot  imagine anything more unlikely. High-ranking U.S. leaders are  aware that security in Latin America relies greatly on having  Armed Forces that are strong, disciplined, subordinated to the  civilian power, and that act within the framework of the law."</p>

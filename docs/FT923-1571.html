			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STRONG demand for stock index futures early in the session tailed off at mid-morning, leaving the contract to move erratically for the rest of the day, writes Joel Kibazo. The December contract on the FT-SE was in demand from the moment it opened at 2,620, with Salomon, the US securities house, said to have been the main buyer, sending the contract sharply forward. The buying interest, however, tailed off by mid-morning, leaving December to drift lower over the next few hours. By lunchtime the contract had fallen to 2,590, which proved to be the low of the day. Renewed buying shortly after led to a squeeze which helped curtail some of the earlier losses, but this only proved to be a temporary respite. A dull Wall Street, poor trading in the fixed interest markets and profit-taking all combined to send December into retreat. December closed at 2,607, around its fair value estimate to cash of about 45. Turnover fell to a modest 13,200. Traded options remained busy though total volume, at 44,058 lots, was down from last Friday's impressive 73,698. Some 19,998 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, while Tesco was the day's busiest stock option.</p>

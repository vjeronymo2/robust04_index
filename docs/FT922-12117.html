			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Nationalist enclaves in a community of fear The conflict in Bosnia illustrates the need for the international protection of minority groups If you live in a part of the world that is still relatively comfortable and secure, how do you react to the troubles of less fortunate people whose homes and lives are being wrecked by conflict? One way is to try to understand, to sort out the rights and wrongs, to become emotionally involved. Sooner or later, this almost inevitably leads you to take sides. Another way is to take refuge in a general condemnation of violence, blaming the conflict on the economic backwardness or primitive political culture of the people concerned. In the former case, one will easily become the dupe of the self-deceptive and self-righteous arguments of one side, since conflicts where one side is wholly in the right and the other wholly in the wrong are rare. In the second case, one can slip into self-righteousness oneself, looking patronisingly on innocent and guilty alike, and failing to take seriously the fears and grievances of people who, in most cases, do not embark on violence for fun but in the sincere belief that only by doing so can they protect themselves and their 'community' from extinction. In reacting to events in Yugoslavia, the outside world has oscillated, perhaps fatally, between the approaches described above. Broadly, the latter approach prevailed until last December. The US treated the issue as a regional one best left to regional institutions, notably the EC. The EC presented itself as an impartial mediator and would-be peacekeeper. But the fighting in Croatia went on, with the Serbs and the federal army appearing more and more obviously the aggressors. Public opinion was increasingly inclined to the 'goodies-and-baddies' approach, and in December this carried the day. The EC took sides, to the extent of recognising Croatia and Slovenia and maintaining sanctions only against Serbia and Montenegro. The US, at the time, made clear its disagreement with this approach. Now, however, it recognises not only Croatia and Slovenia (three months behind the EC) but also Bosnia-Hercegovina (simultaneously with the EC) and is putting the blame very loudly and publicly on Serbia for the continued fighting. If I were a member of any of the three communities in Bosnia, I should find this procedure profoundly irritating. The best argument for not taking sides in Croatia was that the secession of Croatia from Yugoslavia was bound to be followed by the attempted secession of Bosnia and the extension of the conflict to that republic. The Moslem and Croat communities in Bosnia, forming a comfortable majority between them, were never going to agree to remain in a rump Yugoslavia which would be in effect nothing more than a greater Serbia. The Serbs in Bosnia - a much larger minority than the Serbs in Croatia - were not going to let themselves be carried out of Yugoslavia, and thus separated from Serbia, by a decision of the other two communities. Thus it was fatuous for the EC to make its decision on recognising Bosnia's independence contingent on the result of a referendum, since the result was predetermined by the size of the three communities. The traditional grounds for recognising a state would be that it exercises effective control over a given territory. By that criterion, Bosnia would surely have failed, given the presence on its territory of a large number of units of the federal Yugoslav armed forces, which so far have not recognised its authority. There was, no doubt, a case for using recognition as a lever to help produce a non-violent settlement between the communities. But if that was the goal, the requirement should have been that the request for recognition come from a government representing all three communities, not that the numerical superiority of two of them over the third be demonstrated by a vote. It is that notion of 'community' which lies at the root of so many conflicts. If one member of a community kills another, that is deplorable but we expect the community to deal with the matter according to its own procedures. But if we feel that the killer and the victim belong to different communities, then all of us in the victim's community see ourselves as threatened: we require protection against, or reassurance from, the killer's community. Nations and states are particular forms that a community can take. States are institutions, capable of defining law and imposing it on their citizens; capable also - or claiming to be capable - of defending those citizens against attack by non-citizens. 'Nation' is a word which, in the modern world, makes a community sound respectable and permanent. A nation, in most people's minds, is entitled to be represented by its own state. To side with your own 'tribe' against another tribe sounds primitive. To rally to the defence of your 'nation' is normal, even honourable. Nations began as a way of identifying citizens with a state. But once the nation is postulated as a pre-existing entity, from which a state can be derived, there is no obvious place for the process to stop. Why should not Serbs be able to secede from Bosnia, just as Slovenes, Croats or Moslems have the right to secede from Yugoslavia? It would not matter so much, if the process were not almost inevitably accompanied by violence. The essence of a state is that it monopolises the use of force on its own territory, and that is a monopoly which each self-defined 'community' is naturally reluctant to concede to another. In the end, the only solution seems to be for communities to regroup, each on 'its own' territory, separated from others by state frontiers. But that involves the wholesale uprooting and transplanting of populations: something seldom if ever accomplished without large-scale bloodshed. There must be a better way. 'Communities' should be able to feel safe even when outnumbered by other communities within the state of which they are citizens. States should be able to recognise self-defined 'communities' on their territory without feeling that they have opened the door to secession and disintegration. An internationally accepted regime of minority rights and obligations is indispensable if much more chaos and bloodshed in eastern Europe is to be avoided. The Dutch proposal for a High Commissioner for Minorities, tabled at the current Helsinki Follow-Up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) deserves serious and urgent consideration. If it is true that Britain is blocking it for fear that such a High Commissioner might interest himself in Northern Ireland, that is surely a mistake. The need for the minority to be assured of its rights, and for the majority to be reassured that those rights do not threaten it, is as acute in Northern Ireland as in many parts of eastern Europe.</p>

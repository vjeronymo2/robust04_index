			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: Singular concertos - Royal Festival &amp; Queen Elizabeth Halls The first performance of Benedict Mason's BBC Symphony Orchestra commission was originally planned for last year, but postponed for mysterious scheduling reasons. The delay brought its own rewards, however, for in place of the premiere the BBCSO performed Mason's immensely attractive Lighthouses of England and Wales from 1988, which was subsequently recorded and released as a CD single. The large, enthusiastic audience that gathered in the Festival Hall on Monday night for the BBCSO's unveiling of the Concerto for the Viola Section, conducted by Lothar Zagrosek, might well have been more familiar with Mason's music than a year ago, and known perhaps if not what to expect, then at least what not to expect. The new concerto shares at least one property with Lighthouses - an approach to orchestral writing that pays fond homage to 19th-century traditions, while coming up with a grammar and sense of continuity that are very much post-modern. In the earlier orchestral piece it was the impressionist view of the sea that lay behind so many of the textures; in the Concerto it's a whole history of orchestration ranging across 19th-century romanticism that informs its workings. It is essentially a work about scoring and about the role of the violas in the middle of a traditional string texture, sometimes defining the pulse of the music, sometimes sharing its melodic contours, yet rarely finding themselves in the spotlight. In the concerto the violas are amplified and rise through the textures as if the orchestral balance had suddenly been turned inside out, while Mason sets up an extraordinary series of inventions, conceits and musical jokes around them. There are six movements, alternating fast and slow with fond yet oblique references to the viola's orchestral past in all of them. The huge orchestra, with percussionists hovering over everyone from the choir stalls, contains all manner of exotica, as well as a pair of singers among the wind sections who masquerade as instrumentalists until their moments arrive. At first hearing the overall structure was not entirely convincing; one wonders whether the work does justify its length and proportions. But there are wonderful ideas along the way, some of them arising directly from the extra-prominence of the viola line, others purely inspirational: textures coloured by swanee whistles at one point, synthesiser at others, and the soprano soloist unwinding some exquisite vocalise. Setting these surreal events within a soundworld that audibly derives from the 19th-century gives the concerto a crisply defined character and very positive tang. ***** Dominic Muldowney's Percussion Concerto, which the Bournemouth Sinfonietta introduced to London in the Queen Elizabeth Hall a week ago, is the latest in the line of works in which Muldowney has utilised his techniques of tempo layering, setting up ratios of metronome speeds between the sections of an ensemble to produce highly complex yet perfectly playable rhythmic patterns. The most ambitious exploration of these ideas promises to be his Violin Concerto, due to be heard in Liverpool next month, but in the meantime the percussion piece seems the most successful and cogent example so far. The single-movement piece was written for Evelyn Glennie, who plays it with wonderful flair and accuracy. The percussionist stands at the centre of the platform with the chamber orchestra divided into groups around her; players take their lead from either the soloist or the conductor, so that the music builds up complex polyrhythmic layers as it runs through the precisely geared tempo ratios. The idea may sound dry and cerebral, but isn't at all in performance; the music is a glistening web of ever-changing textures and motives, tinged occasionally with echoes of popular song and jazz accents. There is a good deal of repetition, of material revisited from a different perspective, hence the work's Birtwistle-like subtitle, 'Figure in a Landscape'. From that point of view it seems to be Muldowney's most Birtwistlian piece for some time: full of intriguing possibilities, flashes of revelation, and the strange, hidden rituals so characteristic of his former teacher. Muldowney conducted the performance, which was part of a concert for the Arts Council Contemporary Music Network. Tamas Vasary took charge of the rest of the programme, which brought the London premiere of James Macmillan's diffuse and overlong Tryst. It also included Stravinsky's Danses concertantes (written 50 years ago) and Prokofiev's Classical Symphony (75 years old); just what are those works doing in a touring programme supposedly devoted to 'contemporary' music?</p>

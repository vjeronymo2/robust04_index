Analysis of more than 168 joint ventures in six countries reveals considerable differences in perceptions between western and eastern partners, and between headquarters and local staff. Nearly two-thirds of western managers based in eastern Europe would not recommend joint ventures to new investors, while all of their headquarters' managers still would. Eastern partners believed their counterparts had too high and too short-term expectations for profit. More than a third of western partners admitted their decision to invest in the east was based on unrealistic expectations.</p>

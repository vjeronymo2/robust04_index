			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Recession worse than expected, admits Major: PM defends Lamont's performance MR JOHN MAJOR admitted yesterday that the UK recession was proving 'deeper and longer' than he had expected and warned that harsh international trading conditions were holding back the recovery he believed was under way. However, the prime minister firmly backed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, against recent attacks on the Treasury's handling of the economy - signalling a determination to ride out the political storm over the recession. He dismissed a sterling devaluation as a 'silly way to proceed' and said interest rates would rise if necessary to defend the pound. He ruled out taking 'short-term risks' with the economy to boost Tory support ahead of the general election. Despite his relative gloom about UK prospects and his fears of a developing international recession, he insisted that a 'jagged and irregular' recovery had started in the UK. 'If for example one looks back at the 1981 recession, we can now see, in retrospect, that recovery was starting at exactly the moment most people were gloomy and believed they would never see it,' he said. He hinted, however, that downward revisions to official growth forecasts could result from the gloomy world economic climate. Speaking on BBC Radio he implicitly accepted that Mr Lamont was facing fierce pressure from within Tory ranks and outside. But he said: 'This criticism focusing upon the chancellor is not fair and I myself do not share it.' Mr Lamont was doing a 'difficult job extremely well'. Mr Major said the US, Germany and Japan were 'all moving towards recession. Growth is falling away in all those countries.' Many other countries were either in recession or are moving towards it. 'That international environment is holding back recovery in this country.' His wariness at painting too optimistic a picture for the economy at this stage will add to speculation that he plans to call the general election for May or later, rather than early spring. He spoke of Britain 'moving out of recession in the months ahead towards an acceptable level of growth' - a view partially endorsed by most economists who believe the recession will drag to a close in 1992. The prime minister faces mounting pressure at Westminster as Labour seeks to intensify political activity in the run-up to the election and pin blame for the recession on the prime minister. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, said it was 'preposterous' for the government to blame other countries for Britain's problems. 'In the past they have blamed Labour governments and the trade unions, now it appears it is foreigners once again,' he said. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, said: 'Britain has great opportunities but it will never seize those opportunities if it pretends that recession will simply go away.' On the precariousness of Treasury economic forecast, the prime minister went further than Mr Lamont's comments in an interview with the FT earlier this week. Forecasts depended on the assumptions on which they were based - including the economic performance of international trading partners, Mr Major said. 'If the assumptions change. . . then clearly it blows back on what happens in this country - and that is happening.' In November's Autumn Statement, the Treasury was more upbeat than most independent forecasting groups, predicting gross domestic product would grow by 2.3 per cent in 1992 after a fall of 2 per cent last year (1991). Mr Major used the interview to distance himself further on the broader political stage from the ideology of his predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, setting out a vision of 'one nation' Toryism. Asked if he believed greed and materialism had gone to far in the 1980s boom years, he replied: 'I think that is probably true, often perhaps for understandable reasons.' He said he did not object to people getting very rich, 'if they do so by their own efforts'. But earlier he had hinted in a new year message to Conservative party activists that the government planned to cut inheritance tax allowing the affluent to pass on a greater proportion of their wealth. In the BBC interview, he saw no scope for private medical insurance replacing the NHS. 'This is one of the few countries in the world where you can be guaranteed good and prompt health treatment if you are seriously ill. Nothing I would do now or in the future would damage that,' he pledged. Future imperfect Page 10 UK signs not encouraging Page 11 Lex Page 12</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / China returns to 'Great Game' in Central Asia: Beijing's greatest fear is a rising tide of economic and ethnic turmoil in the emerging states AFTER a 50-year break, the 'Great Game' has recommenced in Central Asia. The players have changed but, as in in the 19th and early 20th centuries, ethnic separatism and regional security are the issues. Now, as then, Islam provides the focus for political aspirations, and China, a weak player during the era of British and Russian colonial domination, has emerged as potentially the most formidable Central Asian force. The People's Republic of China is an empire, as any visitor to Xinjiang can readily observe. China's vast north-west province abuts both Mongolia and three of the five new Central Asian republics, while Chinese citizens of Uighur, Kazakh, Uzbek and Tadjik 'nationality' live uneasily under Han Chinese control. Most members of the 12 main ethnic groups living in Xinjiang are Moslems who look to Turkey and the Middle East as their spiritual home, not to China, whose control over them has always been tenuous. But Xinjiang is enormously valuable to China as a buffer against what it fears is a rising tide of Middle Eastern and Central Asian turmoil. Moreover, the agricultural and mineral resources of the region are critical to China's economic development. Six million Han Chinese immigrants, most of whom arrived after 1949, and vast petroleum resources ensure that no Chinese government could consider relinquishing Xinjiang. Chinese officials, political analysts and religious authorities are reluctant to speak about ethnic unrest in Xinjiang or the influence of Central Asia on China's minorities. But nationalist sentiment has been reinforced by independence in Central Asia, as well as by China's 'open door' economic policy which, since 1978, has brought increased contacts with the Middle East. China is deeply anxious about Turkish ambitions among Turkic ethnic groups in Central Asia and about Iranian and Pakistani stimulation for Islamic fundamentalist sentiments. For the Chinese government, 'spiritual pollution' wears Islamic as well as western garb. Pervasive security measures in Xinjiang and the frequent anti-Han 'incidents' provide a constant reminder that China faces a growing and long-range problem. Several persons died when a bomb exploded on a bus in February. Further anti-Han demonstrations were reported in several parts of Xinjiang in early March. The mood is sullen, fuelled not only by Han Chinese political ascendancy but by Han assertions of cultural superiority. For now, Beijing is basing its hopes for stability on economic incentives. Living standards are rising in urban Xinjiang and home use of a larger percentage of the profit from the regions's resources is at least being discussed. China has recognised all five of the new Central Asian republics and is building economic ties with them. But Beijing fears that the Central Asian states may not be economically viable and that present secular governments will not remain long in power. However, Beijing officials discount fears of Chinese military intervention in the event of serious unrest in Central Asia. How would China react in the face of a flood of economic refugees or crossborder incidents? Beijing officials say that refugees would not be allowed in, and that China 'will never interfere in Central Asia, even if asked by Central Asian governments'. Nearly 20,000km of frontier with Middle Eastern and Central Asian states and overlapping ethnic and tribal ties suggest that it will be difficult for China to avoid deeper involvement. But at the same time there is little doubt China would prefer a passive political and military role, one which does not undermine its self identification as a champion of the developing world. There are signs, nonetheless, that China's West Asia policy is in transition. Despite its suspicions or perhaps because of them, Beijing is reaffirming economic and military links with Iran and Pakistan in what could emerge as a quasi-alliance with the Middle East's northern tier. In January, moreover, China formalised relations with Israel, a state with long if frequently clandestine ties to Pakistan and Iran. The present plethora of Israeli delegations to China and contacts with the Central Asia republics underscore Israeli interest in inserting itself into the equation. Should Central Asia collapse, under the pressure of economic problems and religious aspirations, the impact on China, the Middle East and even on Europe through Turkey would be severe. The strongest power in Central Asia has always filled the vacuum. China, which is already more active economically in the region, may find itself drawn into a broader political, perhaps even military, role. This is not something western governments or those of surrounding states would view with equanimity. The author, recently in Xinjiang, has just completed a book on China's relations with the Middle East.</p>

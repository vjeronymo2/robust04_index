			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Balancing the scales This year's skirmishes in the Bay of Biscay are the latest reminder that the world has too many fishermen chasing ever fewer fish. Intimidating the competition is no solution. But neither is a policy regime which feeds the pressure it purports to regulate. Faced with what they considered to be slipshod enforcement of the European Union's existing net-size restrictions, Spanish fishermen last week took matters into their own hands. Although the Spaniards' tactics cannot be condoned, member governments are correctly concluding that they must tighten their enforcement of the rules, if others are not to take the same route. What they are reluctant to consider is fundamental changes to the rules themselves. A larger, more vigilant force of inspectors may calm the waters for the time being. But the Spanish will still feel aggrieved at the sight of British, French and Irish boats using drift-nets to catch tuna, while the native fleet boasts only old-fashioned rods and lines. Spain has long argued, with the European Commission's support, for an all-out ban on drift-nets. The UK successfully resisted this in the spring, but will have to face the issue again when the Commission discusses it in the autumn. For those wishing to avoid a repeat of this week's on-board disputes about the size of particular nets, an outright ban has a clear appeal. But, as yesterday's House of Lords committee report points out, the environmental case against such nets is not clear-cut. In fact, the Commission's support for the ban has all the hallmarks of a band-aid solution. A policy of prohibition would be easier to enforce, certainly, but it would not tackle the underlying problem. Net technology In the event of a ban, users of drift-nets would understandably feel that they were being penalised for reacting rationally to the incentives provided by the current regime. Permitted to catch fewer and fewer of the white fish closer to home, they have diversified towards tuna, for which there is no quota, using the latest net technology to catch as many as possible. For all their complaints, the Spanish have done much the same. What they lack in technology they make up in numbers, with 17,000 vessels, a third of Europe's entire fishing fleet. In both cases, it is the incentives to fish which must be changed, not merely the way fish are caught. Europe currently has 40 per cent more boats than it needs to catch a sustainable number of fish, because governments have not yet found a way to make fish as valuable to fishermen alive as dead. Owing to that worldwide failure, the UN estimates that more than half of all of the world's major fisheries are in decline. All have reached, or exceeded, the maximum safe yearly catch. Fishing communities A sustainable world fishing industry would be a much smaller one. European and other governments are politically, and morally, committed to helping fishing communities adjust. Yet they are also obliged to ensure that the industry does not first extinguish the world's fish population. As currently pursued, the two strands of policy are at odds. By and large, fishermen are being subsidised to fish themselves out of a job. This must stop. The focus of subsidies should be on inducing exit from the industry, not on helping to shore up the dwindling revenue that the industry provides. Yet even a more vigorous effort to reduce the industry's size will take considerable time. And a smaller industry will tend to over-fish existing stocks if the fishermen who remain are not given a stake in doing otherwise. Ideally, existing members of the industry should be awarded individually tradable rights to a certain percentage of the allowed catch. Each fisherman would then have to decide whether it makes sense to sell these to someone else, or pay an additional licence fee to take up those rights. Experiments along these lines in New Zealand and Iceland have shown that a determined government can overcome the numerous obstacles involved. Even so, without international agreement on reducing the size of the world's fishing fleet, a country or even a region can only go so far in preserving tomorrow's fish supplies. What is needed is a global framework. Next week's UN convention on the subject ought to provide a start.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: NEW ALL-STAR GAME PROPOSED  </P> <P> Last week, John Shacklett, presiding over a special meeting of the San Diego  High School Sports Assn., announced his group's intentions to create an  all-star football game that would rival, if not replace, a game played between  San Diego and Los Angeles County all-stars last August in San Diego.  </P> <P> Shacklett, head football coach and athletic director at Morse, said the group  would like to establish its own game to attract community interest and raise  revenue that would be returned to the community.  </P> <P> Shacklett and the association said the Southern California College Prep  All-Star game, played at Mira Mesa High, Aug. 4, accomplished neither.  </P> <P> "We're very concerned with the all-star football game that's being played and  the people who are promoting it," Shacklett said.  </P> <P> Shacklett said his group's game would include only San Diego County players in  a division 2-A vs. 3-A format, including top 1-A and eight-man players, and  would take place shortly after the 1990-1991 school year. He said the  association is "in the process" of obtaining sanctioning rights and securing  sponsors.  </P> <P> When one of the top cross country programs in the state fails to have any  freshman come out, it is, in Coach Dan Schaitel's words, "unbelievable."  </P> <P> Although there are reasons for the lack of freshmen with the Poway girls cross  country team this season, Schaitel said "it's very unusual and very shocking."  </P> <P> Every summer, Poway has a summer cross country program that attracts many  freshmen. This year, however, renovation of the training facilities restricted  the coaches from "executing the camp to its fullest potential."  </P> <P> Whether it was the program, change in interest or both, two freshmen Schaitel  expected on the cross country team decided to play tennis, and 11 others chose  volleyball.  </P> <P> Just last week, a couple freshmen did join the team, and Schaitel said he hopes  to have them ready to compete at the Mount SAC Invitational in three weeks.  </P> <P> "We usually have a good mixture of ages," Schaitel said. "For a program that's  traditionally as balanced as ours, it's kind of a rude awakening."  </P> <P> Poway, which has gone to the state meet two of the last three years and ranked  sixth in the preseason state coaches' poll, is currently being led by sophomore  Monica Callan, an all-Section pick last year.  </P> <P> Two seniors, Tara Barnhart and Emily Reinys, also are previous all-Section  selections.  </P> <P> The Titans began dual meet competition Friday by defeating Torrey Pines, 22-35.  </P> <P> Although the season is young, it's not premature to predict that the Poway boys  team will be the first team to win a fourth consecutive San Diego Section cross  country title.  </P> <P> The Titans, who finished ninth at the state meet last year, were ranked third  in the preseason state coaches' poll. In 1988, Poway placed third at the state  meet and the previous year placed fifth.  </P> <P> Poway returns three all-Section runners with junior Nate Arnold, who placed  third at the Section meet last season, senior Sean Finn, who placed fourth, and  senior Spence Shoemake, who finished eighth.  </P> <P> El Camino and Lincoln, the two 2-A football finalists last year, have combined  for an 0-7 record. Lincoln hasn't lost its first four games since 1969.  </P> <P> El Camino plays at Carlsbad (3-0) in Avocado League opener Friday and Lincoln  is off.  </P> <P> When Dominique Walltower, a Hoover cornerback, intercepted a pass in Hoover's  28-0 victory over St. Augustine and ran it back 60 yards for a touchdown on  Friday, it was the second time he has done just that this season. Walltower  also has a 72-yard touchdown return among his three interceptions.  </P> <P> Academics are supposed to come before athletics, but the new Rancho Bernardo  High played a tennis match and a football game before the school even opened.  </P> <P> John Geis, Dana Haddad, Martin Henderson and Jim Lindgren contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

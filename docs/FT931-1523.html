			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / EC agrees scheme for voluntary ecological audits EUROPEAN Community environment ministers yesterday agreed on a Community-wide ecological audit scheme. This will enable industrial companies to sign up voluntarily to environmental protection goals they themselves would set, but external auditors would verify. The logic of the scheme is to use the market to stimulate continuous improvement in environmental management by industry. Companies participating in the scheme will have to make fully public the details of their environmental performance, within agreed norms of commercial confidentiality. When the European Commission first drafted its proposals in 1990, eco-audits were to have been mandatory for all industrial companies above a certain size - and some industrialists fear the voluntary scheme will in time become obligatory. But the Commission and some companies which have already introduced environmental auditing believe the voluntary mechanism will gradually be seized on by businesses searching for competitive advantage in an increasingly eco-conscious market. It is parallel to the similarly market-based 'eco-label' scheme, agreed in December 1991, whereby companies will apply for endorsement of their products as environmentally friendly according to common EC standards. Under the audit scheme qualifying companies would be able to publicise their 'green' credentials - probably through the EC emblem of 12 gold stars and a statement indicating their participation. But they will not be able to use the endorsement on product advertising or on products or their packaging. The main qualifications for participating are: putting in place environmental policies, goals and management systems; systematic self-assessment, through site audits at intervals no greater than three years; full provision of information to the public on the results; independent verification by external auditors - who will be put on licensed registers by each member state, within 21 months of the scheme's start. The regulation should come into force towards the end of this year, once common standards are agreed by the Commission and the 12 member states. Audits will contain, for example, figures on each site's pollution emissions, waste output, consumption of raw materials, energy and water, and noise levels; company policy, goals and eco-management of the site; and the name of the accredited external auditor. Failure to meet deadlines or serious auditor's queries could result in disqualification from the scheme. The last remaining hold-up to yesterday's agreement was Germany's insistence on higher qualifying thresholds. Companies, in Bonn's amendment, would have had to 'reduce environmental impacts to levels not exceeding those corresponding to best available technology'. Several member states baulked at the potential cost implications of this threshold and, led by the UK, inserted the nullifying qualification of 'economically viable' best available technology. At Spain's insistence, small to medium-sized companies should get technical assistance and training to help them participate.</p>

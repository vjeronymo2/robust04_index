			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: A suburban sort of Toryism - Political Notebook MR JOHN MAJOR is a politician who has thrived on instinct. He prefers personal intuition to philosophical blueprints. He is convinced that the values which underpin his outlook match the aspirations of a broad swathe of the electorate. The prime minister is also a cautious man. He wants to hear every view before reaching a decision. He needs to be sure that his decisions will attract the widest possible support from colleagues. Back in 1979 Mr Chris Patten - now Tory party chairman - likened an election manifesto to a peace treaty which a political party had to negotiate with itself. Under Mrs Margaret Thatcher they more often came to resemble unilateral declarations of war. But Mr Major's manifesto has been as painstakingly negotiated as any in living memory. Mr Patten and Mrs Sarah Hogg - head of the prime minister's policy unit - plan to complete the drafting later this week after a flurry of meetings at Downing Street. But no member of the cabinet can claim he has been left out of the exhaustive consultations to lay the foundations for the final rhetorical flourishes. Mr Major's combination of caution and instinct has proved a powerful one. During the 1980s it allowed him to slip quietly to the front rank of contenders for the Tory leadership. Since then it has ensured that he remains far more popular than his party. The proportion of voters who blame him for the economic recession is minuscule. The number who would prefer him in Downing Street to Mr Neil Kinnock is correspondingly large. It is hardly surprising that Mr Patten will mount as presidential a campaign as is possible in Britain. Presidential but not regal. His campaign tours will be qualitatively different from those of his predecessor. Mrs Thatcher energised the party faithful at rallies that came too close to stirring parallels with pre-war Germany. Mr Major will be seen in the high street, in hospitals, mixing with the people - his people. Photo-opportunities will be designed to show a prime minister 'in touch' with the mood of the country. His manifesto will echo the same theme. Mr Major's politics are those of the hard-working nuclear family. They want to get on with their lives without too much government interference. They are vexed by insensitive bureaucracies. They seek security in home ownership and a savings account. Their ambition is to pass on something to their children. It is a suburban Toryism. For the chattering classes that is a label to be applied disparagingly. Not so for Mr Major. Those who know him well insist that others who still seek to slot him into one or another grand Tory tradition are missing the point. His view of the world owes everything to a childhood in the dull security of Worcester Park, an unexpected tumble into tough adolescence in Brixton and a single-minded climb back to adult prosperity in sedate East Anglia. Personal experience constantly touches his politics. The clues are there in his speeches as a backbench MP, his policy decisions as chief secretary to the Treasury and chancellor, and his priorities as prime minister. The officials who wondered why as chancellor he was so determined to double the tax allowance for the blind would have found the answer in the failing sight of his father. His enthusiasm for tax relief for working mothers has been nurtured by the struggle faced by his sister. The broad themes were there in his maiden speech to the Commons during the 1979 Budget debate - the need to encourage saving, to reduce taxation, to allow people to pass on their wealth between generations. A prudent approach to life should be rewarded with security in old age and something to pass on to the next generation. Inflation is an evil not merely because it wrecks economic decision-making but because it threatens this concept of social equilibrium. It is not, though, an outlook that excludes a role for the state. For all his commitment to privatisation, Mr Major has shown himself to be a fiscal interventionist. Public spending overall must meet the test of prudence, but the government does have a role as social engineer - providing more money for teachers, tax incentives for small investors. He is easily (too easily for the Treasury's liking) convinced that money can be well-spent. But there is one decision that might not sit easily with this manifesto from and about the everyday concerns of middle England - a Budget cut in the basic rate of tax.</p>

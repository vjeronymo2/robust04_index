He said that "the affirmation of our right for consulting and  coordinating our approaches and acts with Albania marks one of  the greatest results of the Albanian political movement."    Later on, Mr. Agani commented the statement of the Serbian  prefect of Pristina, Simovic, in his meeting with American  diplomats, saying that the Democratic League is allegedly  exercising its activity freely and is not being hindered. "In  the context of the Serbian state terror, no one of the Albanian  political parties, including the Democratic League, is not  operating freely or being not hindered," Mr. Agani said. Agani  mentioned the cases of blocking of the activity of the DLK  [Democratic League of Kosova] and the ill-treatment of its  activists. "The police has intervened into almost all the  activities of the Democratic League, from Pristina to communes,"  he said. Dr. Agani pointed out that three chairmen of DLK  branches of Pristina, Ferizaj, and Suhareke, are still in  prison, as well as other activists of this party, from education  area, and from the Chamber of Commerce of Kosova.    Dr. Agani rejected the statement of the General Perisic who  have said that "some 20,000 Albanians who are not serving in the  Serbian Army are being trained in centres abroad and come to  Kosova for provoking incidents." Dr. Agani said that "how the  Albanian youngsters will serve and why will they serve an army  whose leaders has a totally hostile approach toward them?"    The DLK deputy president, Agani, answered the questions of  the journalists.</p>

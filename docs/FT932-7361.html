			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / EC envoys cancel Tibet banquet EUROPEAN Community envoys visiting Tibet abandoned a planned banquet at the weekend for their Chinese hosts in protest over the arrest of Tibetan dissidents. In Beijing, Ambassador William Friis-Moeller of Denmark, leader of the EC delegation, said it would have been 'inappropriate' to hold the banquet in view of the arrests. Negative publicity associated with the EC mission in Tibet is likely to prove an embarrassment for the Chinese. Beijing had been seeking a favourable account of conditions in Tibet to balance recent bad publicity about alleged human rights abuses there. The EC mission is preparing a report which will be presented to their governments by the middle of this week. The EC envoys had spent about a week in Tibet at the invitation of the Chinese authorities. The diplomats were due to hold a reciprocal banquet for Chinese officials in Lhasa on Saturday before their return to Beijing yesterday.</p>

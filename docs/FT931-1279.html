			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK coal However hard the government struggles, it seems unable to produce a black and white plan for the future of the coal industry. Indeed, if the smoke signals are to be believed, the past few weeks have been spent hammering out the final details of the basic coal contract with the electricity companies which was supposed to have been agreed last September. That deal by itself will not save any of the threatened pits. And while the generators are, in principle, happy to take some extra coal, provided that it is at world market prices, they have not yet agreed to do so. The government thus has to produce a proposal to subsidise coal without firm commitments from the generators. It seems likely to underwrite the production of an extra 12m-15m tonnes for the next two years, reprieving around 11 pits. But they will have to cut costs to world prices in that time if they are to survive. Another half dozen pits may be mothballed to make up the numbers. A few may even be sold off to contractors who would rip cheap coal out as quickly as possible, and then close the mines. Given that British Coal has failed to cut its costs fast enough in the past three years, it is tempting to assume that the government is only postponing part of the agony. Yet 19m tonnes of coal were imported to the UK last year, so there is a potential market, at least, for some of the threatened output. Meanwhile, the generators, National Power and PowerGen, seem to have faced down Mr Heseltine and his threats of legislation. The recent run-up of their shares to all-time highs thus looks justified. After this debacle, any enthusiasm for an early monopolies and mergers inquiry into the generation duopoly must have wilted.</p>

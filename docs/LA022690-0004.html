			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFER STREETS ARE PRICELESS: LESS-PAINFUL ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE, TOO;  </P> <P> POLICE: L.A.'S FORCE MAY KEEP US BETTER PROTECTED THAN NEW YORKERS, BUT THERE'S  A PRICE IN CIVILIZED BEHAVIOR.  </P> <P> About a week ago, I read an article by a woman living in New York City -- a  place where the cops long ago lost control. In the story, titled "Being Safe,"  a Manhattan mother describes how she has been robbed of her wallet 11 times;  her son has been mugged and had two bikes stolen; her car has been broken into  three times and stolen once; and her husband has been held up at gunpoint while  walking the dog. As a result, she is now quite deliberately teaching her  children not only how to protect themselves but how to be fearful as well.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, those of us living west of La Brea or in the city's numerous  middle-class suburbs don't face such problems, at least on a daily,  rule-your-life basis. I feel comfortable, for example, when my wife takes our  2-year-old to parks in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills near our home. One  reason is the hyper-segregation and great distances that shield the middle and  upper-middle classes here from the underclass that commits so much of the  street crime that we all -- of whatever race or origin -- so fear. And there  is, in addition, another reason. The police in Los Angeles have not given up as  they seem to have in New York. Instead, they continue to be aggressive,  hard-working and responsive.  </P> <P> But as James Fyfe, a former cop and now a professor of justice at American  University in Washington, has pointed out, it's not enough for a police force  in a democratic society to merely be responsive. It must, like all government  institutions, be accountable as well. In the 1960s, for example, the cops in  Selma, Ala., were responsive but unaccountable when they attacked-civil rights  demonstrators on the Raymond Petty Bridge. So, too, with the Chicago police who  attacked demonstrators during the 1968 Democratic Convention.  </P> <P> Recently, it's been hard to pick up the Times without wondering if the Los  Angeles Police Department, the Sheriff's Department and local elected officials  have any interest in accountability.  </P> <P> In the past several months, for example, we've seen the city offer $3 million  in settlement of a federal lawsuit brought by the victims of a 1988 drug raid  on Dalton Ave., near the Coliseum, in which 80 LAPD officers terrorized 55  citizens and literally destroyed four apartments in two buildings. The Red  Cross had to provide temporary shelter, as if some vast natural disaster had  occurred. In spite of all this, city officials have expressed little public  outrage, leaving unquestioned the leadership of Chief Daryl Gates in the  matter.  </P> <P> We've also had Mayor Bradley urge, and the City Council unanimously vote, to  have the city pay a $170,000 judgment leveled against Gates personally by a  federal jury in a suit by an Eastside man, Jesse Larez, whose nose was broken  during a search of his home in 1986. During the trial of the suit, two years  later, Gates said, "(He's) probably lucky that's all he had broken. How much is  a broken nose worth? . . . I don't think it's worth anything." As with the  Dalton Ave. raid, there has been almost no criticism of Gates' remarks by city  officials or by a liberal community that has been vociferous about human rights  in South Africa, Central America and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Nor have we heard any real criticism of the gang sweeps, which are, after all,  just the random shaking down on a mass scale of young black and Latino men by  the LAPD. Indeed, a just-published Times poll shows that more than one-third of  blacks in Los Angeles and Orange counties said that "they or a family member  had been intimidated or harassed by law-enforcement officers."  </P> <P> And when the LAPD used brutal "pain compliance" holds and nunchaku sticks on  anti-abortion demonstrators, the silence from city leaders and liberal  activists was deafening.  </P> <P> Nor has any city official publicly questioned the latest of several stake-out  shootings by the Special Investigations Section, a unit of the LAPD that  recently shot and killed three robbery suspects and wounded a fourth (none of  whom ever fired their weapons, later found to be pellet guns) outside a Sunland  McDonald's. One of the officers involved had shot seven other suspects since  1978; two others had each shot three suspects.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has, since the new year, fired 26 shots at a woman who  refused to drop her gun, killing her; shot and killed a black Muslim during a  routine traffic stop; and shot and killed an unarmed Lynwood man, hitting him  12 to 15 times.  </P> <P> The reluctance of the mayor, City Council and Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors to speak up on these matters is, to be sure, rooted in the special  autonomy enjoyed by both the police chief and the sheriff, and in the  historically conservative political nature of Southern California.  </P> <P> But I have a further explanation. It has to do with Reaganomics, Proposition 13  and the failure to replace thousands of lost manufacturing jobs. It has also to  do with the benign neglect of a mayor, City Council and Board of Supervisors  who watched South Central and other areas fester and erupt in terrible gang  violence, then told the cops to get in there and do something about it. Police  accountability -- always on shaky ground here -- has once again gotten lost in  the shuffle.  </P> <P> All of which brings me back to the streets of two cities.  </P> <P> Given the choice of walking them without fear or accepting unnecessary police  violence, most people will take safe streets every time. It's hard to fathom  why, however, with police departments as highly trained as the LAPD and the  Sheriff's Department, and in a nation as rich as ours, we have to choose  between the two.  </P></p>

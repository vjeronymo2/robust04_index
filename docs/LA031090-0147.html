			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COOL AS ICE: AIMEE MCDANIEL QUIETLY BECOMES A FORCE FOR BREA-OLINDA;  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL: SHE MIGHT NOT LOOK THE PART, BUT SHE PICKS APART DEFENSES TO  BECOME TOP SCORER ON NATION'S FOURTH-RANKED TEAM.  </P> <P> She has inspired the nicknames "ice" and "baby-faced assassin," definite clues  to the type of basketball player Aimee McDaniel is.  </P> <P> They call her "ice" because Brea-Olinda High School's senior point guard is  hard-edged and cool under pressure on the court. And baby-faced assassin? Well,  she's only 5-6, wears her blonde hair in a ponytail, and has the face of a  cherub. But her passing, the most potent weapon in her arsenal, has riddled  opposing teams like bullets from an automatic.  </P> <P> It was assistant coach John Hattrup who first called her the baby-faced  assassin.  </P> <P> "It (the nickname) is not too bad," McDaniel said. "It just bugs me for some  reason because it reminds me of a killer and I'm not a killer. I mean I have  been called worse things.  </P> <P> "On the court I'm like a, how do I put this nicely, I'm very aggressive. Off  the court, I'm sort of hum-de-dum, but on the court I'd do almost anything to  win. Well, not anything bad."  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh agrees: "She's very free-spirited, not very  intense, fun-loving. Something happens when the ball is tipped off. She becomes  the total antithesis of that."  </P> <P> Though nobody would mistake her for a quick runner or explosive jumper, she  knows how to play off screens or create openings for her shot. That, and her  ability to shoot the three-point shot, has helped her become the leading scorer  (16.5 points a game) on a team that gets double-figure scoring from three other  starters and is ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today.  </P> <P> McDaniel broke the school's career scoring record of 1,778 points Tuesday in  the opening round of the Southern California Division III regional basketball  playoffs in Brea-Olinda's victory over San Diego Lincoln. She has 1,807 points,  breaking the record set by Carrie Egan from 1984-87.  </P> <P> "Luckily I had a chance to learn the three-point shot and lot of them go in,"  McDaniel said. "A lot of it is just teamwork. When you have the great team I  played on for four years everything just clicks." With McDaniel running the  point, the Lady Cats won their first state championship (Division III), had a  player named the most valuable player in the division -- McDaniel -- and got  their first national ranking last season.  </P> <P> They are favored to repeat as Southern California regional champions today when  they face Palos Verdes at 9:30 a.m. at the L.A. Sports Arena. They also are  heavily favored to repeat as state champions.  </P> <P> "I think the first (title) is the most cherished one," McDaniel said, "but  back-to-back would be nice. I'm not going to say it wouldn't be. There is a lot  more pressure this year. Like, at the beginning of the year people were already  planning to go to Oakland.  </P> <P> "It's hard because it is just playing under pressure and we get a little  big-headed sometimes, and I think Palos Verdes is the perfect team that could  upset us. We have to keep our heads in it."  </P> <P> The Lady Cats are working on a school-record winning streak of 54 games, second  in Southern Section girls' basketball history to the 84-game winning streak set  by the Cheryl Miller-Riverside Poly teams of 1978-82.  </P> <P> For the first time, the Lady Cats toppled national powers outside Orange  County, beating Morningside (then top-ranked nationally) and Los Angeles  Washington to win the Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara in December.  </P> <P> "Aimee is responsible for bringing our program up a notch and making us a  national power," Trakh said.  </P> <P> It is against ranked city teams that McDaniel's game seems to rise a level  along with her intensity. She may bury a three-point shot at the buzzer to send  a game into overtime as she did against Washington, she may talk trash, if  invited to. She may just give the icy stare.  </P> <P> Against Morningside, with Brea-Olinda in control late in the game, McDaniel was  fouled intentionally and hard as she went to the basket, Trakh said.  </P> <P> "The kid got up in her face and said something to her and Aimee said, 'Didn't  you guys used to be the No. 1 team in the nation?'  </P> <P> "She does it to show she is not intimidated by them. Her attitude for those big  teams is our equalizer."  </P> <P> McDaniel's greatest strength is her passing. She averages 5.4 assists a game.  </P> <P> "She has a tremendous sense for the game," Trakh said. "On the fast break, if  she doesn't have a pass, she can wait that split second later for the pass to  develop and hit that player. She is the best high school passer I have ever  seen. She throws it soft so the kids can catch it and leads them perfectly."  </P> <P> Though USC, UNLV, Cal State Long Beach were among the schools that came  calling, McDaniel chose Pepperdine.  </P> <P> "I wanted to stay at a smaller school," she said. "I don't plan to play  basketball after college and a good education would be nice to start off with  in life."  </P> <P> DIVISION III GIRLS' CHAMPIONSHIP GAME LINEUPS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brea-Olinda

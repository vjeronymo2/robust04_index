			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada plans to announce before the month's end the  lifting of the aid embargo imposed on Cuba 16 years ago, when  Cuban troops gave their internationalist help to Angola.  Canadian Government sources in Ottawa have said that Christine  Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, will  make the announcement during an economic conference in Havana on  20 June. Canadian aid will not be between governments but will  consist of assistance to nongovernmental organizations that work  in Cuba.    The Canadian Government gave approximately $576,000 in  urgent  assistance to humanitarian organizations in Cuba last year,  including the Red Cross. Ottawa never broke diplomatic  relations even though it suspended all governmental aid to  Havana in 1978. The same source stated that the lifting of the  aid embargo on Cuba has been generally well received.</p>

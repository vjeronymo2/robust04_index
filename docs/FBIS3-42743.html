			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Confrontation Between the Command of </F> the 14th Army of the Russian Federation and the Leaders of the  Self-Proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic Continues"]    [Text] The pretext: new accusations of corruption and abuse  leveled by the commander of the 14th Army, Lieutenant General  Lebed, and Commandant of Tiraspol Mikhail Bergman against the  leaders of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic.    In response, anonymous leaflets were pasted this week all  over Tiraspol, in which General Lebed is accused of preparing  for a state coup in the Dniester Area. The leaflets' authors  maintain that the coordinators of this coup are Konstantin  Borovoy, leader of the Russian Economic Freedom Party, and  Sergey Manukyan, head of this party's regional branch and a  well-known entrepreneur in the region.    A correspondent of the INFOTAG agency reported from Tiraspol  that Aleksandr Lebed described the distributed leaflets as  "total nonsense." He emphasized that some members of the local  leadership, mixed up in machinations and abuse, are trying in  such a way to blame the Russian military for their own mistakes  and the deteriorating economic situation in the region. Lebed  emphasized that the 14th Army command is ready to cooperate in  this respect with any organs in order to find out the truth of  the matter.    In the opinion of Tiraspol observers, the author and  distributor of the leaflets is the Dniester Area Ministry of  Security, whose chief, Vadim Shevtsov-Antyufeyev, is at odds  with Lebed. Speaking at the latest session of Tiraspol Supreme  Soviet, he publicly accused the 14th Army commander of preparing  for a "state coup."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The provisional government of Judge Emile Jonassaint  signed an agreement with the Vatican for a grant of $32 million.  The minister of information, culture, and coordination informs  the nation that following approaches made by Haitian Foreign  Minister Dr. Charles Antony David, the agreement was signed in  Italy on 27 May 1994 between the representatives of the  provisional government of Haiti and the state of the Vatican.  The terms of the agreement are that Haiti will receive 75  thousands metric tonnes of hard wheat worth $32 million.    The Ministry of Information note asserts that Judge Emile  Jonassaint, provisional president of the Republic, putting  himself in the role of the interpreter of the entire Haitian  people who are subjected to a criminal embargo and an  unjustified blockade, thanked the state of the Vatican and the  Holy Father John Paul II for the great understanding and  solicitude. At a time when the international community,  practicing systematic disinformation, misrepresents the Haitian  realities and shows a total misunderstanding of the drama that  the Haitian population faces, the generous gesture of the  Vatican comforts us and confirms for us the permanence of the  Christian values of truth, honesty, and justice, continues the  note from the Ministry of Information. The note adds in  conclusion that the Haitian people will always remember  gratefully that in the horrifying agony that has fallen on the  country -- on Haitian men, women, children, and elders -- the  state of the Vatican offered its hand in order to relieve their  material and moral sufferings and allowing them to survive with  dignity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Israel has changed its stand regarding Russia's  involvement in the peace process. This emerges from remarks  made by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres in yesterday's cabinet session. Peres said that  "we should treat the Russians with respect," reminding the  ministers that there are 1.5 million Jews in Russia. "We have  no business expressing reservations about Russia's involvement,"  he said.    Rabin said that the United States praised the role the  Russians played in the activity vis-a-vis the Serbs in the  Bosnia crisis. "We have special relations with the United  States, expressed through aid and strategic cooperation, but  Russian foreign policy is more active than in the past and is  not negative," Rabin said.    The prime minister did not reiterate the claim he made  during  the past several weeks that Russia should coordinate its moves  on the peace process with the United States. [passage omitted]</p>

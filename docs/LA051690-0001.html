			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUGE PROJECT PLANNED FOR BARRIO LOGAN  </P> <P> A group of San Diego businessmen will make public today plans for a $300- to  $400-million redevelopment project in Barrio Logan that would include a massive  parking garage, a retail center, an international trade complex and possibly a  sports arena.  </P> <P> The proposed Barrio Pacific Rim Project, which would cover a 17-to 20-acre  tract near the waterfront in Barrio Logan, is dependent upon the group winning  low-cost bonds that would reduce land acquisition and construction costs, said  Luis Garcia, one of the businessman involved.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for the project to include a 6,800-car garage, a retail  center, 500 owned and rental housing units, office space, a hotel and an  entertainment complex that might include a sports arena. The site was not  specified Tuesday, but it would be near the waterfront and the Barrio Logan  trolley stop.  </P> <P> The project's office space would be dedicated largely to international trade,  its backers said. The parking garage would serve shipyards in the neighborhood  as well as commuters who would park there and take the trolley to jobs  elsewhere in the county, according to Garcia.  </P> <P> The project would be 51% owned by minority businesses and individuals, he said.  Backers also hope that nonprofit organizations, such as the Chicano Federation  of San Diego, will own as much as 15% of the project, Garcia said.  </P> <P> Garcia, the owner of a San Diego construction company, and San Diego  businessman Mateo Camarillo have formed Barrio Enterprise Zone Inc. to develop  the project. Camarillo, who owns restaurants and a wholesale fabric company,  also serves on the San Diego Convention Center's board of directors. Joseph  Martinez, a San Diego architect, is acting as architect and project manager.  </P> <P> The plan is to be unveiled today at a 6 p.m. meeting of the Barrio Logan  Project Area Committee, an organization that was formed to consider  redevelopment plans for the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a Cinderella project," Garcia said, adding that it would  transform Barrio Logan, long used by San Diego as a dumping ground for  "wrecking yards and toxic chemicals," into a "showcase."  </P> <P> The project's backers have won the support of Harry Cooper, the La Jolla  businessman who wants to build a sports arena in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I think these guys can make things happen down there," Cooper said. "I want  that site as an option. It's a possible site, even though I know it has lots of  (construction-related) problems."  </P> <P> Cooper earlier this year won City Council approval to consider building a  sports arena on land he owns in Sorrento Valley. But Tuesday he said he would  keep the Barrio Logan site as an alternative.  </P> <P> "This project should happen," Cooper said. "And it's not dependent upon a  sports arena."  </P> <P> With or without an arena, the project faces several substantial obstacles.  Perhaps the largest is winning congressional approval to use development bonds  the federal government earmarked in 1983 for construction of the controversial  Sander project, a proposal for a trash-to-energy plant that voters defeated in  1987.  </P> <P> The bonds were authorized by the federal government, but most of them were  never sold. An estimated $225 million worth of the bonds are still available  for use in San Diego, Cooper said.  </P> <P> BEZ Inc. is pushing the city of San Diego to obtain congressional approval to  reappropriate or redesignate those unsold bonds, Garcia said. A San Diego tax  attorney said that Congress might be willing approve the redesignation even in  the midst of the current budget crunch because the action "would be revenue  neutral" and would not hurt the federal budget.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, the San Diego City Council authorized city staff members to  seek federal approval to "somehow take advantage of the bonds that were  allocated but never utilized," said Mike Jenkins, an official in the city's  property department. "We think there may be a chance of getting them  reauthorized."  </P> <P> However, city officials Tuesday made it clear that the reauthorization is  independent from the Barrio Logan project. The city hopes to win the  reauthorization, which would clear the way for the bonds to be used for some  redevelopment projects, Jenkins said.  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) is working to win reauthorization of the bonds, a  spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Catching up with Europe - Great British Eating / When in Stonehenge try the rock cakes Anyone visiting Britain after an interval of even a few years cannot help but notice the marked change in attitudes to food: supermarket shelves filled with bottles of virgin cold-pressed olive oil and pots of own-label creme fraiche; food and cookery programmes on every television channel and young British born and trained chefs at the stoves of brasseries, restaurants and hotels. In all of this the UK is finally catching up with the rest of Europe and if, gastronomically, Britain is not quite the equal of France or Italy yet, the rate of improvement is marked. But the range of locations in which good food can be bought is now perhaps even more striking than the quality of the meals. In the last 20 years many castles, stately homes, lighthouses, churches, chapels and coach houses have been adapted to serve food to the public. There are several reasons for this. Imaginative caterers such as Michael Milburn, Justin de Blank and Johnathan Silver saw the potential of these locations. At the same time, the owners and governing bodies of the sites, such as the National Trust, English Heritage or the Church of England needed to generate extra revenue. Caterers and site owners were helped by the growing realisation that good food does not mean complicated cooking. It can be simple, using local ingredients, thoughtfully prepared and courteously served. This approach has helped to reduce many of the logistical problems that confront caterers in these locations, particular in old buildings. Thirty-six such venues - good examples of how this type of catering has developed in Britain - are listed in a leaflet entitled 'Eat at Cathedrals &amp; Churches' compiled by Lesley Bridge, catering manageress at St Albans Abbey, Hertfordshire, AL1 1BY. (The leaflet is free but please enclose a stamped, addressed envelope - it is also available from any British Tourist Authority office.) Bridge took on this role 12 years ago when the abbey's governing body decided to try to re-establish the role of host and provider which the monks used to fulfil in days gone by. This has proved such a success that by last year catering, book and gift shops earned Pounds 30,000 for the abbey, a quarter of its annual income. This leaflet highlights the wide range of food on offer. For example, in London, Pizza Express operates in Southwark Cathedral's chapter house (071-378 6446) and Bill Sewell's vegetarian restaurants are at The Place Below, St Mary-Le-Bow, EC2 (071-329 0789) and the Saint Marylebone Cafe (071-935 6374). At one of the few locations open in the capital in the evening, there is live music in the Cafe in the Crypt at St Martin-in-the Fields, WC2 (071-839 4342) on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings. Gloucester Cathedral, in contrast, offers medieval rooms for private parties while in Hereford Cathedral you can eat in a 13th century bishop's cloister. Catering has become a significant source of income for the National Trust and English Heritage. Last year the National Trust's catering division contributed Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 11m. Catering concessions at English Heritage earned almost Pounds 200,000. I recently spent a morning in one of English Heritage's busiest catering operations, The Stonehenge Kitchen. This is situated in a bunker-like 32 sq m kitchen in the underpass that leads to the standing stones on Salisbury Plain. The site receives 700,000 visitors a year and is home to that most unusual confectionery, the Megalithic Rock Cake. I came away full of admiration for the staff - not so much for their culinary prowess as for their eagerness to look after and please their visitors, and their unabashed pride in their famous landmark. More significant was the realisation that in rural areas such as Wiltshire, catering is one of the few industries capable of offering new job opportunities. When plans for the site by Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, are implemented, the restaurant at Stonehenge will be on one of the most remarkable sites in the world.</p>

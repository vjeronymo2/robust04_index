			<p>BFN     [Text] Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the Peruvian  Popular Front of Workers, Peasants, and Students, met Kim  Kyong-ho, our country's ambassador to Peru, on 13 May.    In the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il to Chairman Genaro Ledesma Izquieta. The chairman  expressed deep gratitude for this and asked the ambassador to  convey his heartfelt greetings to the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The chairman said as following: Recently, the Japanese  reactionaries are clinging to anti-socialist, anti-Republic, and  anti-Chongnyon [the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan] suppression in collusion with the South Korean puppets,  instead of apologizing to the Korean people for its past  criminal acts. The world should heighten its vigilance against  the Japanese militarism. The Japanese reactionaries' any kind  of maneuvers cannot frighten the Korean people who are following  the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We will send invariable  support and solidarity to the socialist cause of the Workers'  Party of Korea and the Korean people's cause for reunification.</p>

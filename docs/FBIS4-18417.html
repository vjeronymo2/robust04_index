			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed H.M.: "Mitterrand and Balla Ask Elf To </F> Cooperate With the Germans"]    [Text] A moving scene in the world of business on 25  February in a discreet waiting room at the Dusseldorf airport.  The boss of the Elf oil company meets with Birgit Breuel, the  boss of Treuhand, the group responsible for the privatization of  industry in the former East Germany.    The Frenchman tells the German of his intention to renege on  the construction of a gigantic refinery, a 15 billion-franc  project launched by Philippe Jaffre's predecessor, Loik Le  Floch-Prigent. Jaffre explains that he no longer believes the  refinery can be profitable given the collapse of oil prices.  According to the gossip going around, he thinks that Elf funds  would be much more use fully invested in the large groups  privatized by [Prime Minister Edouard] Balladur.    Reacting to Jaffre's remarks, Birgit Breuel brandishes the  draft of a letter denouncing the irregularities that, in her  view, occurred during the privatization of Elf. She threatens to  send a copy of the letter to the French commission on stock  exchange operations and to its U.S. counterpart, the Securities  Exchange Commission (SEC), if Jaffre does not start work on the  project on 28 February, as envisioned in the contract.    Three days later, surprise surprise, Jaffre receives a  notably less acrimonious missive containing no more threats of  denunciation. As for German officials, they affirm they will do  everything possible to avoid the worst, that is, demanding from  Elf the 5 billion franc-indemnity envisioned in case of  non-compliance with the contract.    What happened after the stormy meeting at the airport that  made the Germans soft-pedal the issue? The deal had almost  become an affair of state. Chancellor Kohl, who expected that  the refinery would symbolize his policy of maintaining  employment in the former East Germany, was furious. At the  Elysee, Francois Mitterrand's advisers contended that Elf's exit  would complicate the already deteriorating Franco-German  relations. And at the Matignon [office of the prime minister],  Ambroise Roux, one of the old "justices of the peace" for  management, had asked Balladur to compel Jaffre to respect his  obligations, because French credibility was at stake.    Fortunately, the Germans understood they would not easily  find someone to replace Elf, given the drop in oil prices.    Therefore, in early March, the Elf boss received a second  letter from Germany granting him another postponement. According  to the PETROSTRATEGTES magazine, the French company now has  until 30 April to lay the cornerstone. And a Russian oil  company, Rosneft, has promised to participate in the project to  the tune of 20 percent by furnishing crude oil.    Between oilmen, it is perhaps normal to pay in liquid.</p>

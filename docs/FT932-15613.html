			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: In search of the good earth AS A holiday destination, Lemnos has not had a very good press. A large island about 30 miles off the Turkish coast, its scenery is not particularly spectacular, and it has few ancient remains. It is garrisoned by several thousand Greek troops, and the military presence is always evident, though as compensation there is a decent road from one end of the island to another. Its small metropolis, Myrina, is a bustling town crowned by the ruins of a massive medieval castle; its long, sandy beaches are far better than most, and its countryside is well farmed and look prosperous. Lemnos is not as well-known as the smaller and more obviously pretty Greek islands. Yet until a century ago it was among the most famous, renowned as the source of 'Lemnian earth', a cure-all for almost every conceiveable disorder. Dug from a hillside pit on the north side of the island, this magical substance was made into small lozenges, which were exported all over the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century AD, Galen, the Greek father of modern medicine, made a special journey to Lemnos to investigate the earth. It was believed to be effective against poison and snakebite. In the 16th century Terra sigillata (sealed earth) or Terra Lemnia was used against dysentery and the plague, and was so popular that quack doctors took the trouble to fake it. Until the end of the 19th century it was still dug and made into pills, as described by the Rev Henry Fanshawe Tozer in his book on the Aegean islands, published in 1890. Tozer was one of those Victorian clergymen who travelled for months at a time - presumably leaving their curates in charge - - and were happy to go anywhere. He set out from Myrina with three hired horses and a guide, and took a day-and-a-half to travel the 15 miles to the pit, shadowed by suspicious Turkish soldiers. In Galen's time, Tozer wrote, the earth was kneaded and moulded by the priestess of the moon goddess Artemis, who was the only person allowed to handle it. It was then divided into small pieces, each stamped with the seal of the goddess. Under Christianity the ritual took on Christian overtones. In Tozer's time it was overseen by the Turks, who still ruled the island. The annual ritual, attended by about 3,000 islanders, took place on August 6 and was conducted by both Greek and Turkish priests. The earth had to be dug before sunrise, otherwise it would lose its medicinal powers. The Turks sacrificed a lamb, which they ate, while the Christians had to make do with fish, as August 6 fell during a fast. After a service recited by Orthodox monks, the mouth of the pit was cleared, and five or six sacks were filled with the earth. They were handed to the Turkish authorities, who sent most of the earth to the Sultan in Constantinople, though the Greeks were allowed to keep a small proportion. Last summer, armed with Tozer's book, I went in search of the pit. The journey from Myrina today takes well under an hour, mainly along the military road. Tozer described exactly where the pit was - below the summit of a 200-ft hill, about a mile south of the village of Kotchino (today's Kotsinas) and above a spring called Phtelidia. I had no problem finding the spring: it has been diverted into a series of drinking troughs and was in constant use. On the hillside above, I found all sorts of thistle-filled hollows where the earth might have been dug. But even in his day the farmer who owned the hill was threatening to plough over the pit, and the quest was obviously hopeless. So I walked down the hill again, had a swig of the marvellously fresh Phtelidia water and went back to Kotsinas. On my return to England, I tracked down a remnant Lemnian earth. It is called simply 'Terra sigillata, ref 1939.956', and is kept in a drawer of the Natural History Museum's mineralogy department. It is an insignificant reddish cylinder about 1in across and  1/2 in deep, like a small terracotta basin plug or a large Rolo. Its upper surface is stamped with the words 'Terra Lemna' (a mis-spelling for 'Lemnia'), with a crescent moon and three stars above, and a pair of crossed palm branches below. The Rev Tozer is dismissive about the earth's medical properties, quoting an analysis that found it to consist of 'silex 66 per cent, alumina 14.5 per cent, oxide iron 6 per cent, water 8.5 per cent, natron 3.5 per cent', together with small quantities of lime and magnesia.</p>

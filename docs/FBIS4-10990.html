			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 0030  GMT on 20 April features its regularly scheduled 30-minute Open  Agenda program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Rene Mujica,  adviser to the foreign minister, on "The Nation and the Emigre  Community" conference.    The program begins with a video of Antonio Aja Diaz, deputy  director of the Political Alternatives Study Center of Havana  University, who points out that the United States is the main  destination of Cuban emigration, approximately 1.0439 million  Cuban immigrants; followed by 15,000 in Spain; 13,000 in  Venezuela; 4,000 in Mexico; and much smaller numbers in other  countries worldwide. Aja points out that Cuban immigration  experienced a significant increase in 1959, and that the main  destination for two centuries has been the United States.    Mujica begins by stating that a little more than 200 people  are expected to attend the Havana conference. The agenda  includes several subjects to familiarize participants with the  current Cuban circumstances and to discuss issues of interest to  emigres. He adds that Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, will discuss the Cuban  People's Government system; Abel Prieto, president of the  National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, will discuss Cuban  culture and national identity; Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  will discuss current ties and prospects of ties between Cuba and  the emigre community; and finally, Carlos Lage, secretary of the  Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, will discuss  Cuba's current economic situation and prospects.    Mujica adds that the number of participants "is not  significant, many people have asked to participate." He adds  that it is important to stress that the participants come from  approximately 40 countries, are from diverse fields and social  conditions, and will pay their way.    Mujica goes on to say that the goal of the conference is:  "to  identify a common ground to work toward the establishment of  normal ties with the emigre community. The meeting will become a  forum to exchange opinions, and to discuss possible solutions,  and difficulties. It will not be a negotiation from which  accords could result." Mujica adds the meeting will be austere  but that several dozen comrades -- the minimum necessary -- from  diverse Cuban institutions and sectors directly related to  immigration will also attend the conference.    Prompted by Resillez, Mujica stresses that the participants  are not sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution -- a false claim  by the foreign media.    Regarding foreign media claims that the conference's  ulterior  motive is economic, Mujica adds: "That is another false claim  made to distort the true goals of this initiative by the Cuban  Government. There is no hidden agenda. This initiative is being  handled in a clear, open manner. There are no ulterior motives.    "The foreign media purposely exaggerate certain opinions on  the significance, or economic impact which might result from  ties with the emigres. Every human relation or endeavor has, of  course, an economic aspect but this is in no way the motive of  our initiative, nor is this economic aspect a significant  prospect for Cuba's future."    A video segment with Ingrid Estevez, from Havana's  Socio-Political Studies Center, stresses that polls conducted in  1993 and 1994 reveal that the current Cuban opinion on the  emigres is "more mature"; for example: 40 percent of the people  polled believed the emigres condemned the blockade; 79 percent  agree that emigres could use and pay for Cuban medical services;  83 percent agree with normalizing ties; 52 percent wish to visit  relatives in the United States. Another poll conducted earlier  this year shows that 84 percent supports "The Nation and the  Emigre Community" conference.    Mujica points out that the conference ought to show the way  to normalize ties with the emigres and adds: "We hope contacts  will increase and there will be a program of contacts with the  emigres, and our institutions, relatives, etc., through diverse  channels of communication".    Resillez asks if there are signs that the U.S. Government is  somehow participating in the effort to improve the emigre's ties  with Cuba, since the majority of emigres reside in the United  States.    Mujica answers: "No, really none. This is absolutely a Cuban  initiative. There is no participation from any government or  foreign element in its development. The answer is definitively  no." He adds: "I do not know of any statement or official  position from U.S. authorities regarding this conference.  Governments do not have to have a position on everything  happening in this world, particularly, if their interests are  not affected as we hope is the case."    Mujica points out that reporters are not invited to the  conference in order to facilitate the frankness and openness of  the discussions and that the media will be able to report on the  opening and closing ceremonies, and will receive daily reports  via an official spokesman.    In closing Mujica stresses: "We know this is a highly  interesting and sensitive subject for our people. We have made  every effort to keep the people informed about it and we will  continue to do so to see that our people are fully informed."</p>

He told Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, that the receivers had made clear that parts of the business could be saved without state funding. 'I believe that is the way to proceed,' he said. Mr Smith refused to accept the decision, arguing that it was 'vital' to British manufacturing industry that the company should not be allowed to collapse. Earlier the cabinet had heard a report from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, on the company.</p>

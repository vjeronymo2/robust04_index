			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories under pressure over dockyard row LABOUR SUCCEEDED yesterday in highlighting the government's wariness over the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards by securing an assurance that no announcement on a crucial nuclear submarine refitting contract will be made before June 17. As ministers acknowledged privately the acute political sensitivity of the decision, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, revealed that Mr John Major had agreed to meet him on June 17 to discuss Rosyth's bid. The prime minister yesterday met Conservative MPs from south-west England who are keen to see Devonport win the contract - estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds - and to save up to 4,000 jobs. Devonport is widely regarded at Westminster as the front-runner but several Scottish Conservatives have already indicated that they are prepared to vote against the government if Devonport wins. The prime minister's office emphasised that no decision was imminent, although it admitted that ministers might meet later this week for a preliminary discussion. The sensitivity of the contract has contributed to a delay of several months in the announcement, expected last June, but the government seems committed to resolving the matter before MPs disperse for the summer recess in late July. Mr Brown said that a 'number of sources' had told him that, under the Ministry of Defence's own criteria of assessing capital costs and running costs over five years, the Rosyth bid was Pounds 10m cheaper. Rosyth is in Mr Brown's Dunfermline East constituency. Mr Brown also called on the government to publish in full all the figures used by ministers in reaching a decision and for an independent inquiry into the bids by the National Audit Office. A Labour survey yesterday showed Fife in Scotland is the UK region most dependent on defence-related jobs. Cabinet ministers insist that the contract will be awarded on merit, and say that the potential political damage will be equally serious whether the contract goes to Scotland or the south-west of England. They add that a full debate will be in the government's interests since they are confident that the basis of the decision will stand up to the intense scrutiny it will receive. In an attempt to play down the significance of the contract, some ministers point out that whichever yard does not win the Trident work will be certain to be awarded work on the surface fleet in the coming years, and that even the successful yard will probably have to make some workers redundant.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BAND-AID REMOVED FROM GDANSK'S SHIPYARDS  </P> <P> Italian television announced Wednesday that the Johnson &amp; Johnson Band-Aid  widow, Basia (Mrs. Seward) Johnson of Princeton, N.J., has reneged on her  promise to Lech Walesa to buy the Gdansk shipyards for a controlling $100  million!  </P> <P> Last May, Johnson became excited over this prospect while visiting Gdansk and  signed a letter of intent. The matter was soon being played up all over the  world that she was "the Angel of Gdansk" and the capitalist savior of Poland.  Actual proceedings to buy the shipyard were to be completed this month. Now,  Johnson has backed out.  </P> <P> Many knowledgeable people feel this is the better part of wisdom since the  shipyard is in such a terrible and antiquated mess and probably could not be  brought back to a competitive level -- given the state-of-the-art shipyards  that do exist elsewhere in the world today.  </P> <P> But this is a psychological blow for Poland. I wasn't able to discover  Johnson's official reason for her decision; her lawyers and advisers are mostly  in Poland now. Nor what it means to her friendship with Walesa. They were  profiled together, you may recall, in an amazing article in the New York Times  Magazine, wherein, when Lech and Basia were rebuked for outrageous, open  flirting with one another, the Polish labor leader said it didn't matter, that  his wife could not read English.  </P> <P> Perhaps Johnson will do something else important and urgent for the homeland of  her birth instead of buying the shipyard. She is dedicated to reviving the  beautiful but crumbling ancient city of Krakow. In April, she'll hold a show of  her religious art collection in Warsaw, with the exhibition designed by the  Italian movie and opera director Franco Zeffirelli.  </P> <P> IF NEW YORK is unseasonably warm, it may be that Joan Collins is in town  co-hosting the new Joan Lunden show, "Everyday." Joan blew in from Paris and  went right to see "Gypsy" last night, dining at Le Cirque. This evening, she'll  turn up at the National Center for Learning Disabilities party in the Marriott  Marquis. Here, Joan will announce that Parlux Fragrances is going to donate a  percentage of her new perfume, Spectacular, to the national center. Joan has  always had a soft spot for disadvantaged children.  </P> <P> THE TALENTED Robert Guillaume -- so fabulous in his "Benson" reruns but now  seen mostly in Milk of Magnesia commercials -- is in New York talking to  director Hal Prince about appearing in a road company of "The Phantom of the  Opera." Guillaume served a long apprenticeship in the '60s and '70s in musicals  and has a fine voice. He studied opera.  </P> <P> THE NEW much-argued-over novel by Michael Thomas is titled "Hanover Place" --  not "Hanover House," "Hanover Square," "Hanover Road." So, on the blackboard  100 times -- "Hanover Place" from Warner Books. Never mind, as Gilda would say  -- buy it; read it!  </P></p>

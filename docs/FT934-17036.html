			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Property: Finding a palace in Portugal - Old and new properties throughout Portugal ONE OF the oldest surviving private houses in Portugal is for sale. Quinta da Bacalhoa, at Azeitao, 20 miles south of Lisbon, can variously be described as a manor house, country estate or summer palace. Its owners have included members of the Portuguese royal family and aristocracy who either cared for, or neglected, it. Its last buyer was Orlena Scoville, an American, who became so obsessed with the house when she saw it as a ruin, on her first visit to Portugal in 1935, that she spent the last 30 years of her life restoring it. The house was probably built in the early 16th century but most of its records were lost in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. At the end of the last century a Portuguese scholar published a book about it and from this, and the advice of experts, Scoville restored the building to its original state. Mysteries remain, such as why it was built in its Islamic/Italian style and its name has never been satisfactorily explained. Behind the high estate walls the main building is L-shaped, with domed towers. The residential accommodation is on the upper floor. It is not large but there are dining, drawing and sitting rooms, a library and bedrooms. A sunken marble bath is in one tower, a chapel in another. The house can sleep 10 and there is staff accommodation at ground level. Decorated, glazed tiles outline windows, doorways and skirtings and cover large sections of wall. Some are the oldest in Portugal. Altogether Scoville catalogued more than 70 different designs. There are also loggias, an arcaded pavilion, a vast reservoir tank, and the garden which, with its box parterre, fountain, tiled seats and boxes, is visited in its own right. Scoville died in 1967 but the property remained in the family and is now owned by her grandson, Thomas, who lives in Washington. Because he and his family are only able to spend a few weeks a year at Quinta da Bacalhoa he feels he must sell. He employs six staff and lets the house for eight months each year. Receipts from letting and from the vineyard cover running costs. He is asking Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.10m) for the property and its 14 acres, which include the vineyard. Some 15 miles north west of Lisbon is Sintra, an area noted for fine, old properties. One of these is the 19th century Quinta do Biester, a fairytale mixture of turrets, steep-sided roofs and Gothic windows, built by a German industrialist. Restored frescos are a feature of the property. The house has 35 rooms on four floors and stands in 22 acres, part of which is an arboretum. Hamptons International is asking Pounds 2.8m. By contrast, in the same district is the square, dusty pink Quinta da Ponte Redonda, an 18th century home on three floors, with seven bedrooms, an annexe, farm manager's house and several outbuildings in 27 acres. Price Pounds 1.4m, also through Hamptons. Developers the world over complain of planners and Portugal is no exception. Beltico is a Portuguese/British consortium which took over the 550-acre Praia d'el Rey estate, near Obidos, on Portugal's 'Silver coast'. It applied for revised planning permission early in 1989 and has just received it, so work on the development has been marking time. The delay was galling for the developer since it is eligible for an EC grant and possible tourist authority aid, but neither could be obtained in advance of planning consent. 'The bureaucracy is an absolute nightmare,' says London solicitor Stuart Swycher, a director of the consortium. 'It is almost unbelievable. Every time you go through one door you face another three. We have got the planning we wanted but it has taken so much longer . . .' Now work can go ahead on the golf course, tennis courts and other facilities. Eventually there will be 150 villas, town houses, apartments, hotels and an equestrian centre. The wait will bring benefits for eventual buyers. The recession in Portugal, and competition for work, has cut building costs. Starting prices for two-bedroom town houses in the development are down from Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 55,000. Also, with new roads now open, driving time from Lisbon to the estate has been cut from 80 minutes to 45. Northern Portugal is a world of its own with few agents offering property there. CTI, in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, is one which does, working with associates in the region. It operates most in the area between Braga and Daminha, at the entrance to the Minho river. Jeremy Lawrence, of this agency, whose wife is Portuguese, says he has rural properties from Pounds 30,000. One might expect to spend as much again on renovation (which his agency could arrange). If you want something a little better he can go up to Pounds 6.3m. This would buy a 17th century hilltop mansion with views over the Douro river. The house has 14 ensuite bedrooms, five reception rooms and a ballroom. The price includes furniture. The property has two swimming pools, tennis courts, two smaller houses and 100 acres of port-wine grape vineyards. One advantage of the area is the low cost of living. 'One can eat out in a good restaurant for a fiver a head, inclusive of wine,' says Lawrence, 'and where else could one get a puncture fixed for Pounds 1.60?' One might think that only a supreme optimist would launch a housing project in the Algarve at present. But work has begun on the Quinta do Rosal development of 30 villas and 12 town houses on a 14-acre site near Carvoeiro. Prices range from Pounds 90,000 for a three-bedroom house and Pounds 112,000 to Pounds 132,000 for a four-bedroom villa, including land. Just to get things going, the development company, Passarro Verde, has announced a 'special offer' - four two-bedroom houses with roof terraces are available for Pounds 65,000 each. The properties are being marketed in London by European Partnership. Salisbury-based Euro Property Advisers used to handle both new and resale property in the Algarve but says it is now only dealing in resales because it became embarrassing offering resales at half the price of similar new properties on the same estate. Apartments start at around Pounds 50,000 and villas around Pounds 100,000. Within the Algarve's Quinta do Lago estate, Bovis Abroad is a long-standing developer. It has 35 villas and apartments to build in its lakeside village there and expects prices to start at Pounds 115,000. In high season a three-bedroom villa with pool will let there from Pounds 1,200 week. Its Sao Lourenco project, on the same estate, has a golf course on one side and a lake on the other. That development is entirely apartments, with communal pool and bar. Some 40 units, from Pounds 102,000, have still to be built. Free golf membership goes with every apartment. There is also a deferred payment scheme. Lakeside sells to British buyers; Sao Lourenco attracts Germans and a mixed market. With the recently completed Pinheiros Altos course adjoining Quinta do Lago, the estate claims that the area is now the largest golfing complex in Europe. Pinheiros Altos' developers, Firago, formerly LET Leisure, allocated 91 plots with secured golf membership, around the course. The first four-bedroom show house has been built and sold for around Pounds 485,000. Away from Quinta do Lago, farther along the coast, Bovis has its Quinta da Boavista project, with 350 plots for sale from Pounds 50,000, in 217 acres. .

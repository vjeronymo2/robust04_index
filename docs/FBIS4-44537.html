			<p>CSO     [Text] The results of a survey undertaken by an  organization in Shanghai reveals that "at a loss about or  stymied by life" "reversals and attacks," "having a crush on  someone" and such psychological problems are among the problems  besetting middle schoolers on the mainland. According to an  analysis of some 1,200 letters received by a Shanghai city youth  problem hotline from young people in 27 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions, there are 14 types of  psychological problems besetting China's middle school students.  The report issued by the hotline divided the problems into the  14 types shown in the adjoining chart. According to the  analysis, of the problems listed, the most prominent were "new  life complications" "at a loss about or stymied by life" and  "reversals and attacks." A second year middle school male  student (the equivalent of our fifth year middle school) said in  his letter: "I have heard that people with money are happy; that  people with learning are in dire straits, that the children of  high officials use their connections and go by the back door,  that the gifts from civilians can make an official rich... Is  this all true? Hearing other people talk about this being  inevitable in society, that we are the naive ones, how is one to  adjust to this society?" If one says that the mainland middle  schoolers' problems like being "stymied by life" are primarily  the effect of society, then the cause of problems like  "reversals and attacks" and "having a crush on someone"  obviously is that the majority of them are middle school  students are single-child homes, who are normally  over-protected, have experienced few difficulties and who are  psychologically ill equipped to withstand or endure any  hardship. A Miss Wang who states that her study record has  been consistently excellent, after failing a small exam wrote in  her letter: "God is treating me so unfairly! My failure is  wholly unbearable!" For the same reason another student wrote:  "I am a piece of garbage! What are other people going to think  of me? The stench of my rotten name has wafted afar." The thing  that worries the concerned experts is the problem of "early  love" among middle school students -- which everyone had always  kept close watch over -- has recently begun to appear again as  "having a crush on someone" and including secret heterosexual  affairs with older people such as the parent of a classmate, a  teacher, a famous singer, or some master of ceremonies, etc. It  is a symptom of increasing personal and psychological immaturity.  <H5>  Psychological Problems of Mainland China's Middle School </H5> Students  14.     1.

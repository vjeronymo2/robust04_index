			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates unchanged DEALERS in French franc interest rate markets were bullish yesterday about the prospect of further policy easing by the Bank of France, even though the authorities left official interest rates unchanged, writes James Blitz. The French franc has performed strongly against the D-Mark on the currency markets in recent days, and there was speculation about another cut in the Bank of France's intervention rate, currently at 7.50 per cent. In the event, this interest rate was left unaltered in the central bank's weekly operation. However, the currency's strength raised speculation that the French authorities would be able to reduce interest rates at a more aggressive pace than has been set by the Germans. French franc interest rate futures were yesterday discounting lower interest rates in France than in Germany in June and September. French cash rates have been below their German counter-parts for several weeks. But this is only the second day on which the trend has emerged in futures markets. The June French franc contract closed 7 basis points higher at 92.54, while the September contract was up 12 basis points on the day at 93.32. Euromark futures were only mildly stronger. The June D-Mark interest rate contract ended at 92.45, up 2 basis points on the day. The September contract finished 2 basis points firmer at 93.23. The weaker rise in German interest rate contracts was partly due to the perception that the D-Mark was losing ground across the board on the currency markets, and that this would make German rate cuts more difficult to implement. However, D-Mark weakness allowed the Danish authorities to cut rates for the first time since Denmark voted Yes to monetary union on May 18. Denmark's discount rate was lowered from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Dealers in sterling markets took a more downbeat view of interest rate cuts, following press reports that the UK government was shying away from any more easing. The September short sterling contract closed 7 basis points down at 94.19. Three-month money finished slightly firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, following difficulties removing a Pounds 1bn shortage.</p>

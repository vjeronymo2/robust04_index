The SDL, which has 28 seats in the current parliament, is joining forces with the Green party, the Social Democratic party and the Slovak Farmers' Movement, and has pledged to make reviving the ailing Slovak arms industry a central part of its election campaign. Mr Peter Weiss, SDL chairman, said cuts in arms production since 1989 had contributed to Slovakia's growing unemployment rate. The country was one of the largest producers of weapons for the Warsaw pact countries before 1989.

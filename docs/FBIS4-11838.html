			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Closeup" Column By Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "We and the </F> Korean Crisis"]    [Text] For one reason or another, the United States chose  this particular time -- after 20 years -- to create a severe  crisis with North Korea because of unconfirmed "possibilities,"  lacking in substantiated proof, that North Korea is producing or  is on the verge of producing nuclear weapons. This crisis,  which escalates and then abates for reasons that are  incomprehensible to us, seems to be remote from our area and to  have nothing to do with us. As a matter of fact, it is linked  to U.S. policies that are becoming clearer and more determined.  These policies are generally aimed at preventing proliferation  of nuclear arms in various parts of the world on the one hand  and at completely controlling arms shipments to the Middle East  on the other -- naturally, this is to guarantee Israel's  continued superiority.    North Korea is not an unlikely source of certain types of  weapons for some Arab countries. There are U.S., European, and  Russian agreements to "control" arms shipments to the Middle  East, but these agreements are subject to the mood in the United  States. The United States violated these agreements with the  sale of modern military aircraft that it decided to offer to  Israel recently as a down payment for starting the peace talks.    Twenty years ago, there were doubts that North Korea had a  nuclear plan that might be used to produce weapons. But North  Korea signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in 1985 and it  allowed the IAEA to inspect its installations in 1991. Amid the  continuing tense relations between North and South Korea, the  North Korean Government decided last June not to allow the IAEA  inspectors to check its installations and threatened to withdraw  from the Nonproliferation Treaty if the U.S. and South Korean  pressure continues.    North Korea has played on the nerves of the United States  and  South Korea: It finally allowed the IAEA inspectors to check  some installations but then suddenly prevented them from  completing their mission. The United States tried to use this  crisis to gain access to the center of the closed society in  North Korea, but it failed. The crisis was referred to the  Security Council. The United States also tried to use the PRC  and Japan to pressure North Korea, but the PRC stated that this  crisis must he resolved peacefully without threats.    The United States so far has not one single confirmed bit of  evidence that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. North  Korea probably is playing this card for its own purposes in the  conflict with South Korea. The U.S. stance seems strange and  incomprehensible. It leaves in Israel nuclear weapons the  existence of which have been proven beyond a shadow of doubt and  searches for nuclear "ghosts" in North Korea. The whole game is  intended to serve Israel.</p>

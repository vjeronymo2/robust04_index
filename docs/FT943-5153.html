			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Greeks take the route to central Asia: Entrepreneurs are seizing their chance to follow the trail of Alexander the Great One short business trip was all it took to persuade Mr Pericles Tsompos, an Athenian importer of hides, that Uzbekistan was a place where Greek entrepreneurs could flourish. Mr Tsompos paid Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 129,000) to dismantle the contents of a bankrupt Greek match factory and transport it by train to Tashkent, where he set up a joint venture with the Uzbek Timber and Construction Ministry to start producing matches. The Dollars 6m investment, in which Tsompos Holdings and other Greek partners hold a 37 per cent stake, was designed to profit from the collapse of the centrally planned economy in the former Soviet Union. 'Every box of matches sold in Uzbekistan used to be imported from Moscow, so this was clearly an opportunity not to be missed,' says Mr Tsompos. The risk involved in investing in the ex-Soviet republics does not seem to deter the Greeks. Some Greek businessmen maintain this is because they are used to working in a politically volatile environment at home, often without the help of formal asset evaluations, bank financing or even export guarantees. Mr Tsompos has also opened a hard currency shop in Tashkent's museum of modern art, in partnership with the Culture Ministry. It serves as a showcase for manufacturers of Greek consumer goods, bringing in orders from Uzbek importing companies. Tsompos Holdings' latest venture was to become the Greek representative of Uzbekistan Airways, the state carrier formed when the Aeroflot fleet was divided up among the former Soviet republics. The Athens-Tashkent flight every two weeks carries both businessmen and cargo. Mr Tsompos now plans to offer package tours to Samarkand and Bokhara in co-operation with the Uzbek state tourist organisation, 'to cater for people wanting to follow the trail of Alexander the Great through central Asia'. Other Greek entrepreneurs have started to follow Mr Tsompos, forming joint ventures with state-owned processors of marble and astrakhan. Before long, more secondhand machinery should start arriving from Greece, as it is time to give Uzbekistan's neglected fruit and vegetable processing industry a boost. For Greeks who want to do business in central Asia, it helps that Alexander Makedonska is almost as familiar a name as Tamerlane the Great. Another factor is an influential, though diminishing, Greek community in Tashkent, originally refugees who fled when the communists were defeated in Greece's civil war in the 1940s. 'There's no doubt that being part of the local heritage helps to open doors for Greek businessmen,' says Mr Yannis Tzen, head of OPE, Greece's export promotion board. To establish a longer-term presence in the ex-Soviet market, OPE has opened a business centre in Odessa. It occupies the building where 200 years ago the Filiki Etairia, a secret society backed by prominent Greek merchants, plotted the liberation of Greece from Ottoman rule. Greek exports to the former Soviet Union amounted to Dollars 230m last year, against Dollars 124m in 1992, while imports rose from Dollars 427m to Dollars 513m. According to the Greek Exporters' Association, food and consumer goods account for most of the rising trend in exports. Greek trade with Ukraine was valued at Dollars 60m in 1993, handled mostly through Odessa, where Greek shipowners and traders appear set on reviving the status they held under Catherine the Great. Investment is starting to follow, again based on exports of secondhand machinery to start up a joint venture. In one such partnership, Mr Athanasios Daskarolis, owner of Deka, a meat-processor which recently upgraded its plant in southern Greece, has joined forces with Tirs, a Ukrainian trading company, to produce salami near Odessa. Mr Daskarolis believes it will be three to five years before his 40 per cent stake in Deka-Tirs, the joint venture, starts to produce 'a real return. But it's a good market to get a foothold in while investors from elsewhere in Europe are still feeling nervous about the former Soviet Union.'</p>

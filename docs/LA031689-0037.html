			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Yosemite National Park service workers overwhelmingly turned down the latest  contract proposal from Yosemite Park and Curry Co., authorizing their union to  call a strike during Easter Week. Spokeswoman Connie Cooper said 91% of the  members of Service Employees International Union, Local 752, supported the call  for a possible strike Tuesday. The approximately 750 employees seek improved  health care benefits and more control over their housing, including the right  to choose their own roommates.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS COUNTY DEAL TO BUY RIGHTS OF WAY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission gave its formal approval to  the proposed $450-million purchase of Southern Pacific rights of way and other  land and facilities. But Neil Peterson, the commission's executive director,  cautioned that there are serious impedements before the deal can be consummated  March 31.  </P> <P> Peterson noted that the county plans to buy only a share of the ownership of  two of the three lines it plans to use for commuter rail service. He said that  before the county puts up any money, it will want assurance of immediate  operating rights on the lines to both Santa Clarita and Moorpark.  </P> <P> Peterson said Southern Pacific will continue to run freight trains on the Santa  Clarita and Moorpark lines, and he told the commission the railroad so far is  balking at allowing the county the kind of operating rights it wants.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News At Ten" program"] </F>   [Text] Jordan said it expects a land-inspection regime to  begin soon in al-'Aqabah once approved by the United Nations  Sanctions Committee. Minister of State for Prime Ministry  Affairs and Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the  new on-land inspection regime will save Jordan millions of  dollars in losses. He told Jordan Television that Jordan has  received a message from the U.S. Administration confirming the  agreement on the new regime.    [Begin al-'Anani recording in Arabic with English subtitles]  A message was received from the U.S. Administration via the  U.S. State Department confirming what has been agreed upon; that  the U.S. Government has accepted to replace the inspection which  was carried out by multilateral forces, particularly the U.S.  vessels, in the Straits of Tiran for the vessels heading toward  al-'Aqabah with an on-land inspection in al-'Aqabah. Therefore,  this arrangement will answer the United Nations' desire to  maintain the inspection in implementation of the economic  sanctions against Iraq, and, at the same time, directly affect  the Jordanian economy in the sense that it will save large  expenses. We know that since Resolution 661 was issued in 1990  and until now, Jordan lost some $1.2 billion in expenses. [end  recording]</p>

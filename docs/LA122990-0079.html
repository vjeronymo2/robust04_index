Va., was buried under at least 10 inches of snow, and freezing  rain turned West Virginia's highways into skating rinks, authorities said.  </P> <P> Seven inches of wet snow fell in New York City's Central Park, just a few days  after record high temperatures in the 60s.  </P> <P> Airports in New York City reported delays of 45 minutes to an hour because of  the weather.  </P></p>

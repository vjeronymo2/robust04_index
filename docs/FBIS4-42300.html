			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["vm." report: "Symbolic Gestures and Declarations of </F> Intent During Kohl's Meeting With Mitterrand in Mulhouse"]    [Text] Mulhouse, 31 May -- With the proclamation of a  joint initiative against racism and xenophobia in the European  Union [EU], the 63d German-French summit ended in Mulhouse on  Tuesday [31 May] at noon. Germany and France are proposing  three measures to the EU Council: The establishment of a  commission of "high-ranking personalities" that is to present  proposals with the objective of more tolerance toward  foreigners; a "comprehensive" strategy in the European Union to  combat racism and xenophobia, and "opportunities for the  approximation of legal provisions and practical courses of  action" of the member states; joint relevant training for the  officers of the responsible authorities. The initiative had  come about at Germany's request. Apparently, after the  xenophobic riots that are harming the FRG's reputation, the  German side was obliged to take action. France complied with  its partner's wishes.    Two symbolic acts shaped the Mulhouse meeting in a special  way: Chancellor Kohl used the summit to return 28 valuable  pictures and drawings that had fallen into the Germans' hands  during World War II and had finally been taken to a GDR [German  Democratic Republic] museum. The chancellor had brought the  most important picture, a winter landscape by Monet, as a  present for the host. The showing of the works of art in Paris  is envisaged. Mitterrand said that the history of the pictures  is a veritable "story." Kohl talked of a dramatic facet of  Europe's fate in the past 50 years.    The chancellor paid tribute to the French president's  invitation to the Eurocorps to participate in this year's  military parade on the French National Day on 14 July as a  "great gesture." In 1988, on the 25th anniversary of the Elysee  Treaty, the German Guards Battalion had already lined up as an  honor guard in the courtyard of the Invalids. However, no  German soldiers have marched on the Champs-Elysees since the end  of the war. The application of German-French cooperation also  in the military sphere and the joint foreign and security policy  of the European Union create the prerequisites for it. The  chancellor accepted the invitation to Paris. In addition to  Kohl, the heads of government of the other Eurocorps members;  Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg, are also to be among the guests  of honor on national day.    Regarding the European Union's future enlargement by the  addition of Central and East Europen states, the opinions of  Bonn and Paris have been further reconciled. Nevertheless, the  different speeds are obvious. At the final news conference,  Mitterrand warned against harmful "competition" in the fixing of  deadlines for further entries.    The Community must not "gradually lose its meaning" by the  enlargement and, in the end, become merely some kind of free  trade zone. Kohl agreed with that and said: "For us there is  no contrast between enlargement and deepening." Only "an  enlarged free trade zone" would not be acceptable.    Germany and France will also use their successive EU  presidencies for the preparation of the reform of the European  Union's institutions, which is to be tackled in 1996. A  document that was developed by the two governments, and is to be  published after the European summit meeting on the Island of  Corfu, serves for the coordination between the two partners in  European politics in these "12 months of a uniform presidency"  (Mitterrand). A decision on the succession of European  Commission President Delors will also be made on Corfu.    Moreover, Kohl and Mitterrand announced further joint  initiatives for the security of the nuclear power plants in  Russia and East Europe, as news agencies reported in addition.  Kohl said that he is not satisfied with the fact that other  states do not assess the problem in the same way as Paris and  Bonn. At the meeting of the seven most important industrial  states (G-7) in Naples, one wants to insist on the closing down  of the reactors of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.    At its 11th session during the meeting in Mulhouse, the  German-French Defense Council affirmed that the two countries  want to continue their close cooperation on the basis of the EU  action plan in order to achieve a peaceful solution and the  termination of the hostilities in Bosnia. Germany and France  are advocating closer ties between the European Union and the  Western European Union, and they also want to promote the  introduction of the Central and East European states to the  European security organizations. A communique of the Defense  Council says: "Both countries also realize that there can be no  real stability and security in Europe without cooperation with  Russia." Germany and France repeated their intention to develop  a large military aircraft. In its statement, the Defense  Council affirmed that the new military transport aircraft is  necessary because neither the range nor the carrying capacity of  the aircraft that have been used in the two states so far -- the  C-160 Transall, the C-130 Herkules, and the Alenia G 222 --  correspond to the needs of the two armed forces. Defense  Minister Ruehe and Leotard agreed that the transport aircraft  should not be designed completely anew but be based on  preparatory work and experiences of the civil aircraft  manufacturer Airbus. Aircraft manufacturers from Germany,  France, Italy, Great Britain, and Spain who are interested in  the construction of the aircraft have already formed a  consortium. A feasibility study for the "Future Large Aircraft"  is to be concluded by the end of 1994.</p>

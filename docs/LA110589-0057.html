			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: THE CROSSROADS OF EUROPE AND ASIA  </P> <P> Once described as a comely bride adorned enticingly for her husband, this  color-splashed city is more than that, being a fetching combination of earth  mother, saucy soubrette, harridan and grand dame at the doorway of Asia Minor.  </P> <P> With one foot in Europe and the other in Asia, Istanbul's setting at the  confluence of the Sea of Marmara, Golden Horn and Bosporus, is unrivaled by any  other city -- Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco and Naples included.  </P> <P> Istanbul's checkered history and changing fate began as a fishing village about  1000 BC. It became the Greek Byzantium a few centuries later and, after  accepting Rome's influence and fighting wars between the empire's various  factions, it fell to Constantine the Great and Christianity in AD 330.  </P> <P> He proclaimed it "New Rome," renamed it Constantinople and made it capital of  the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire until conquered by Ottoman Turks in 1453.  </P> <P> Understanding Istanbul's past helps to appreciate the city's attractions today:  bits of Greek statuary; Roman forums, hippodrome and aqueduct; majestic Ottoman  palaces, the great Christian church-Muslim mosque of St. Sophia.  </P> <P> These and other priceless legacies from Hellenic, Christian and Muslim eras  have made the city an exciting first step into a country that yearly lures  great numbers of visitors from around the world.  </P> <P> Getting here: Fly British Airways, Pan Am, Lufthansa, KLM or SAS.  </P> <P> How long/how much? Four days will keep you hopping, what with a day's cruise up  the Bosporus for lunch near the Black Sea and perhaps another day over to Bursa  for a look at the Asian side. Lodging costs are expensive, but great Turkish  food is a huge bargain.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: The Turkish lira recently sold at 2,200 to the dollar, about  .00045 each. Visit any time from spring through November. Cabs are reasonable  and the town has 17,000 of them, but make sure you get one with a meter. And  stick to bottled water, even in the best hotels.  </P> <P> Getting settled in: Hotel Gezi (Mete Caddesi 42; $74 to $97 double B&amp;B) has  a wonderful location, with fine views of the city and Bosporus. Bedrooms are  contemporary in decor, and there are sparkling marble baths, mini-bars and TV.  </P> <P> The Hotel Riva (Aydede Caddesi 8; $95 B&amp;B double), like most hotels, is on  the "newer" Beyoglu side of the Golden Horn. It's modern, with a restaurant  cantilevered over the lobby on a balcony. Bedrooms are neat, basic and on the  small side. The cellar breakfast room serves as the Riva Pub in the evening.  </P> <P> Hotel Eresin (Topcu Caddesi 34; $100 B&amp;B double), at the heart of Beyoglu,  has a pleasant marble lobby. While the bedrooms are also small, they're pretty,  bright and have all the big hotel amenities. Buffet breakfasts there are more  like a hearty brunch.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: You'll find plenty of lamb and fresh seafood, but some  of the more interesting specialties never make it out of the country. Try the  pedici -- a flat, pita-like bread topped with cheese, ground meat or eggs, then  baked. Lahmacun also uses pita bread as a base for a soft pizza delight that's  inexpensive.  </P> <P> Turks have at least 150 ways of preparing eggplant and all are colorful and  delicious, like most of their fresh vegetable dishes. Cankaya is a good white  wine from the Ankara region. Doluca Akik Beyoz also is excellent.  </P> <P> Dining well: Pandeli (above the Spice Market by the Galata Bridge) has achieved  a worldwide reputation for authentic Turkish food in a romantic setting  overlooking the Bosporus. Everything we had was luscious: fried mussels, kebabs  on eggplant, lamb shish kebab and koftes (a spicy lamb patty). Menus have  English translations, and most main dishes are $3-$5.  </P> <P> Akvaryum (Capariz Sok. 39) is one of about 35 small fish places in the Kumkapi  area of the old part of town, southwest of the Golden Horn. Just look for the  word balik, which means "fish," over the door, then go in for the very best  seafood. Try Akvaryum's swordfish kebab skewered with fresh bay leaf. At night  the area comes alive with street musicians, which you invite inside to play,  and then tip. Some groups even bring along their own belly dancer.  </P> <P> Palet No. 3 (Tarabaya village on Bosporus) is about a 20-mile cab ride from  Istanbul. Or take a ferry from the Galata Bridge, but make sure you get Palet  No. 3. It's on a small marina, open to the street, offering music in the  evenings. The mezes (hors d'oeuvres) are numerous, the main dishes superb.  </P> <P> Going first-class: In the last three decades the Hilton (Cumhuriyet Caddesi;  $145-$170 double) has become a showplace and social center, with probably the  finest view in the city. Its lobby is also the best people-watching spot in  town: women in purdah, sheiks in flowing robes, European industrialists meeting  for drinks.  </P> <P> The Hilton has every possible luxury, from pool and squash court to helicopter  pad. The rooftop Rotisserie is considered Istanbul's most chic dining spot, and  it served us the best meal we had had since the French Riviera. Stop by for a  drink in the Rotisserie's Kiz Kulesi Bar.  </P> <P> Established in 1892 to accommodate passengers of the Orient Express, the Pera  Palace (Mesrutiyet Caddesi 98; $148 double) has a guest book that runs the  gamut from Kemal Ataturk to Agatha Christie. The main lounge is a masterwork of  wood paneling and marble soaring up to glass cupolas in the ceiling.  </P> <P> A club-like bar has an antique chandelier, a cool terrace and a 78 rpm  Victrola. Everything about the Pera Palace whisks you back to the last century,  but the busy lobby is cluttered with tour desks, posters and other tacky  paraphernalia.  </P> <P> Yesil Ev (Kabasakal Caddesi 5; $120 double) is one of the last 19th-Century  Ottoman mansions, now converted into a magnificent hotel. It's in the old part  of town near St. Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue  Mosque). Each bedroom has its own color scheme and period furnishings.  </P> <P> The Pasha's Suite ($180) is a fantasy of white and gold baroque furniture, an  Alexander Bell telephone that still works and private Turkish bath with marble  massage table. Take your meals in the flowery garden beneath magnolia and fig  trees by a tinkling fountain.  </P> <P> On your own: Start making a small dent in the city's attractions by visiting  the Blue Mosque, so called for its interior of blue tiles; Suleyman Mosque,  begun in 1550 and probably the town's most beautiful, and St. Sophia Museum,  built by Emperor Constantine, later a mosque and finally desanctified by Kemal  Ataturk.  </P> <P> Palaces come next. Spend an hour or so in Topkapi, where 24 kitchens (now  displaying jewels and porcelains) once turned out meals for the 4,000 people  who lived and worked there. Gigantic Dolmabahce Palace on the Bosporus also is  worth a visit, but the lines are horrendous. So cross the Bosporus on the  Ataturk Bridge and see the summer palace of Beylerbeyi, where the sultan and  his harem went during hot months.  </P> <P> Take a ferry ride up to the Black Sea, visit the Turkish and Islamic Arts  Museum and get lost in the bazaar looking for a Turkish carpet.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the Turkish Culture &amp; Information Attache at  (212) 687-2194, or write (821 United Nations Plaza, New York 10017) for a  brochure-city map of Istanbul giving descriptions and locations of sights and  many hotels.  </P></p>

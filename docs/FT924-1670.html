			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Big deal at Little Rock: Economic summit solved no problems but it was a tour de force by Clinton THE two-day economic 'summit' in Little Rock that many feared would be a public relations disaster was a personal triumph for Mr Clinton. In 19 hours of televised debate he demonstrated his mastery of an extraordinary range of complex issues; indeed, as the tireless moderator, he seemed to have a better grasp of the minutiae of most topics than many of the invited experts. As one participant put it, Mr Clinton combined 'the leadership qualities of the class president with the expertise of the class nerd'. He also showed a keen wit. When Mr Robert Kuttner, an economics columnist for New Republic Magazine, lapsed into almost obsequious praise, describing the conference as 'magical' - the 'defining moment' of his presidency, Mr Clinton shot back: 'I hope it is not all downhill from here.' However, Mr Clinton's economic teach-in did not resolve any of the economic problems facing his administration. It ended, as it began, with the president-elect committed to two potentially incompatible goals: a substantial increase in investment spending and a big reduction in the long-term budget deficit. His analytical capacity and communication skills are certainly no guarantee of good policies. But after a series of intellectually unimpressive presidents, his abilities should not be underestimated. Americans yearn for presidential leadership, and a president's ability to get things done on Capitol Hill depends in large measure on the public esteem he commands and his ability to forge a consensus on policy priorities. The positive media coverage of the conference will enhance his authority in economic negotiations with Congress. Mr Clinton, and Vice President-elect Al Gore, may also be beginning to change the public mood. President George Bush lost the election in part because people felt a sense of helplessness about the future: after four years of stagnation the American dream of ever rising prosperity seemed in doubt. Mr Clinton's ability to discuss deep-seated problems, calmly, candidly and without an obvious ideological bias seemed to reassure delegates and phone-in participants alike. It suggests he will head a 'problem-solving' administration. The quality of debate was enhanced by the diversity of participants. Businesses of all sizes were strongly represented: indeed their contributions seemed greatly to exceed those from the unions or overt left-wingers. And some of the most interesting points were made by successful female executives. Mr Clinton, for example, seemed bowled over by Ms Sheryl Handler, president of Thinking Machines Corp of Massachusetts, who argued that federal government, as the economy's biggest purchaser, should use its market power creatively. Instead of always seeking the lowest bid, she said, government should become a 'smart customer', demanding greater inventiveness as well as cost efficiency in its suppliers. It should become an active force promoting higher standards and aspirations in the private sector. The scope of the conference, moreover, demonstrated Mr Clinton's broad vision of economics. This was not a narrow discussion of fiscal and monetary policy but a broad debate encompassing education and training, health care, urban poverty, the role of government, the environment and technology policy. In nearly all sessions, Mr Clinton ensured the focus remained firmly on long-term challenges. The 20-year 'conversation about America' he has held with close friends has now become a national affair. For hours on end, Mr Clinton wrestled publicly with what he described as his administration's most important economic decision: the relative weight to place on deficit reduction on the one hand and higher investment in education, training and infrastructure on the other. At one point, he suggested that resources raised from tax increases and spending cuts should be evenly split between them. This was roughly the solution he advocated in his campaign plan 'Putting People First'. At the closing news conference, Mr Clinton said he had not yet decided whether a fiscal stimulus was needed next year - it would depend on how the economic data looked next month. But in what amounted to hours of economic testimony, he seemed doubtful of the merits of a traditional stimulus. He wants to get on with tackling long-term challenges, such as reforming the health care system. The heart of the economic plan to be unveiled next month is likely to be a controversial attempt to switch the emphasis of federal spending from consumption to investment. But if this is to be consistent with the deficit reduction Mr Clinton also promises, it will require either quite substantial tax increases or a swingeing attack on current government spending, including sharp curbs on entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions. Mr Clinton has the intelligence to design a programme; the question is whether he has the toughness to push the unpopular elements through Congress.</p>

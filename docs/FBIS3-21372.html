The argument is somewhat facile, but it is effective,  because  the manipulation of statistics has often ended by arousing  skepticism and distrust. To deal with that problem, then, the  figures one advances must be indisputable, and their proposed  interpretation must be as transparent as possible. That is the  object of this commentary regarding the members of the LTDH  [Tunisian Human Rights League], the delegates to its fourth  congress, and the final balloting on 6 February 1994.  <H5>  RCD Raid! </H5>   In a statement reported by the daily LIBERATION on 8  February  1994, the outgoing president of the LTDH once again raised the  argument that the LTDH was being "raided" by the Destourians  (that is, the government party RCD [Constitutional Democratic  Rally]). He said that the league "could no longer screen  membership applications," with the result that "a maximum number  of RCD members have joined our ranks."    In response to that completely tendentious argument, the  following objections can be raised:    1. The makeup of the ad hoc committee appointed by the  Managing Committee to "screen" the some 2,250 renewal  applications and the some 3,950 new membership applications was  decided on by the Managing Committee in November 1993 on the  advice of the league president.    2. The exhausting work done by that committee, headed by  Khedija Cherif, proceeded calmly, and after recommending  adjustments on the order of 6 percent, the Managing Committee  formally and unanimously ratified the ad hoc committee's  conclusions, which did not completely satisfy any of the  Managing Committee's members but did, quite obviously,  constitute the basis of consensus most acceptable to everyone.    3. At no time did the 41 branch congresses, the National  Council (meeting on 30 January 1994), or the congress completely  reject the process resulting in agreement to issue 4,327  membership cards (including renewals and new members), although  individual reservations were expressed here and there.    Of the 4,327 cards in the final count (the number approved  out of a total of just over 6,000 applications), 2,293, or 53  percent, were renewals and 47 percent were new members. That is  a reasonable ratio for an association that issued only 300 cards  (to six branches) in 1990 and no cards in 1991, 1992, and 1993.    The estimate advanced by the most cautious members of the  Managing Committee places the number of new membership  applications from RCD members at around 25 percent. They also  say--and it is hard to contradict them--that of the 1,650 new  membership applications not accepted by the ad hoc committee and  the Managing Committee, nearly 90 percent were from members of  the government party, and that nearly 900 applications were  mailed to the Managing Committee or turned in at the office of  the secretary general of the LTDH. Thus, if one goes by the most  alarmist statements by the most refractory members of the  outgoing Managing Committee, the raid or "Destourian takeover  bid" consisted of fewer than 700 new membership applications  spread over 41 branches!  <H5>  Branch Congress Marathon </H5>   Those 41 branch election congresses, where the thorough  debates were often remarkable, attracted over 3,200 of the 4,327  certified members.    In 35 branches, the work was done in transparence and  without  excessive tension. In the six branches where problems arose, the  members of the Managing Committee who were in charge of  presiding over the meetings managed to reach agreement on  initiatives and measures making it possible to remove the  obstacles. Those initiatives and measures were ratified  unanimously by the Managing Committee.    The result was the election of 328 delegates to the  congress.  That number consisted of 287 branch committee members and 41  additional delegates (one from each branch), the branch  "ceilings" being set at 100 members for 35 branches, 150 for  five branches, and nearly 250 in the case of Jendouba, which was  the object of a special consensus. Of the 328 delegates, 177 (54  percent) had no partisan political affiliation, while the 46  percent regarded as "organized" belonged to legal or  unrecognized political parties or to trends of opinion, examples  being the network of supporters of the Progressive Islamist  magazine 15-21 and the network of MDS [Movement of Socialist  Democrats] dissidents united around Mustapha Ben Jaafar.    So then, the RCD accounted for one-seventh of the delegates,  the POCT [Communist Workers Party] one-eighth, and the MDS  one-eighth, while other "tendencies" accounted for a little over  two-fifths of the delegates having a clear connection with some  political group. In that connection, we note that the record in  "effectiveness" was achieved by the network of MDS dissidents  through often contradictory alliances. The MDS wound up with as  many delegates as the Islamists of 15-21 and the RSP [Socialist  Progressive Party] combined!    Of the 328 delegates, 307 had been members since 1989 and  were already members back at the third congress, while 21 joined  after that time.    The above figures relativize in a singular manner the claim  that there has been a "mass entry movement" and a "sudden break  with the traditional equilibriums"! But that is not all, because  in fact, the continuity has been remarkable.  <H5>  Continuity of National Council </H5>   On 30 January 1994, during the new National Council's first  session, it became clear that the idea of a sudden break with  the league's traditional equilibriums was an exaggeration, to  say the least:    1. Eighteen outgoing branch presidents were reelected and  attended that session.    2. Twelve new branch presidents were elected with the  support  of the outgoing presidents (as the result of a general consensus  within the branch or as part of a joint election slate).    3. Four branches had been "frozen" since 1989, and fifth had  been in that situation since 1985. In the case of those five  branches (Sidi Bouzid, Rades, Medenine, Tebourba, and  Tataouine), which now have new officers, comparisons between the  situation before the crisis and the new situation are not  convincing.    4. Two branches (Mahdia and Beja) had not yet assigned  duties  within their newly elected committees.    5. So only four branches made a clear change in the  political  affiliations of their presidents!  <H5>  Two Slates Presented to Congress Delegates </H5>   On the question of political coloring, the following should  be noted:    1. The winning slate, called the League for Autonomy  Consensus Slate, included two MSD members, two RCD members (as  has been true of all managing committees since the first  congress in February 1982!), two Progressive Islamists, one MDS  dissident, one PUP [Popular Unity Party] member, one member of  the Ettajdid Movement (formerly the Communist Party), and one  extreme leftist.    That makes 10 "organized" members (note that this group,  which until now has not included Progressive Islamists,  previously accounted for 12 members of the Managing Committee)  and 15 independents, including three on the extreme Left and  five union officials (elected or seconded from their unions,  another new feature).    2. For its part, the "Slate for League Autonomy" consisted  of  five MDS dissidents, seven POCT members, five extreme leftists  close to the POCT, two RSP members, and six independents,  including one former member of the Managing Bureau of the UGTT  [Tunisian General Federation of Labor].    That is an edifying comparison!    On the question of responsibilities within the league's  structures, the following should be noted:    1. The League for Autonomy Consensus Slate included six past  or present branch presidents, 11 members of branch committees,  six members of the outgoing Managing Committee, and two  candidates from outside the league's leadership structures, one  of those candidates being a former president of the Association  of Tunisian Journalists.    2. For its part, the Slate for League Autonomy included 10  past or present branch presidents, eight members of branch  committees, three members of the outgoing Managing Committee,  and four candidates not belonging to any of the league's  leadership structures.    One form of disparagement currently being engaged in by  supporters of the league's outgoing president consists of  belittling the winning slate by saying that:    1. It does not include any "prestigious figures"--a relative  notion but one which, if accepted, applies just as well to the  losing slate, which favored the outgoing president.    2. It is the result of changes in the makeup of the league's  rank and file following the alleged Destourian "takeover bid."  But the fact is that 23 members of the winning slate are members  of the league's leadership structures, compared to 21 on the  losing slate.    At the socioprofessional level, the winning slate, which  some  people describe for polemical reasons as a "second-rate" slate,  includes three attorneys, two physicians, one inspector general  of education, eight teachers, six journalists, three senior  executives, and two midlevel executives.    Concerning the balloting, the winning slate received an  average of 165 votes out of 310 validated ballots, while the  losing slate received 90; 55 delegates [text missing].    The top three names on the winning slate received votes from  both "electorates": from 130 to 140 votes from the winning  slate's "electorate" and from 65 to 98 votes from the second  slate.    The group consisting of the POCT and its closely related  extreme left-wing allies received the bloc vote of about 100  delegates.  <H5>  Three Concluding Remarks </H5>   1. According to the French daily LIBERATION, the outgoing  president said: "With the end of an independent league, the last  democratic space has disappeared."    That statement is unacceptable, contemptuous, and insulting  not only to the congress delegates meeting in Amilcar but also  to the six members of the outgoing Managing Committee who were  reelected after consistently and unanimously supporting him in  adopting the 104 communiques and resolutions published during  his term of office. And also to the 17 presidents, past  presidents, or branch committee members who were on the winning  slate, which includes four former political prisoners!    2. The will for independence is not a matter of slogans and  verbal excesses. Independence means daily struggle by league  members as part of a managing committee and of structures in  continuity with the league. One proof of this was the high-level  and essential debate regarding the law on associations.    It is a strange league: one that has allegedly abandoned its  independence and been infiltrated and co-opted by the government  but which, despite that, devoted seven hours to debating the law  on associations in committee and in the plenary session of the  congress and wound up unanimously declaring the need to repeal  that law! The fact is that 140 delegates voted for a total and  absolute rejection of the law, while 149 objected to it in clear  and unambiguous terms but proposed measures intended to bring  the league's structures into compliance with its provisions so  as to avoid the law's negative effects on the league's autonomy.    3. This last remark, in the form of a regret, concerns the  feminine presence among the candidates and winners in the  elections for the Managing Committee.    Five women were candidates, three were elected, and that is  a  matter of concern to us. The matter deserves dispassionate  reflection in order to zero in on the reasons for that imbalance  and try to remedy it. Women made up an admittedly insufficient  percentage of the delegates, but even that was slightly higher  than the percentage of women candidates. Women constituted 11  percent of the delegates and 9 percent of the candidates. That  is too few for a league concerned with human rights.</p>

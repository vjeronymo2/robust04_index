			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 20 May (AFP) -- Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina today said U.S. Vice President Al Gore's  visit to Honduras on 24 May "is in recognition of the  democratizing efforts" the country has made.    Reina added that Gore's trip to Tegucigalpa to meet with  Central American presidents "is not by chance, because Costa  Rica used to be the favorite nation; it is a message of  recognition for the type of government Honduras has by popular  mandate."    The Honduran president told journalists that such issues as  the environment, human rights, corruption, foreign debt, and  sustainable development with a "human face" are included in the  summit agenda.    According to Reina, the objective of this meeting is to  define the course the presidents will follow during the 14 June  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, and the December  Americas Summit in Miami.    Presidents Ramiro De Leon Carpio (Guatemala), Alfredo  Cristiani (El Salvador), Jose Maria Figueres (Costa Rica),  Guillermo Endara (Panama), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua), and  Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel were invited to the  meeting.    A Foreign Affairs Ministry communique states that the  Central  American presidents will arrive in Tegucigalpa on 23 May to meet  on that day "as a prelude to the U.S. vice president's arrival."    According to the Foreign Ministry, Central American experts  will meet on 21 May to draft a common agenda to follow during  the summits.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Next steps in Yugoslavia YESTERDAY, the European Community recognised Slovenia and Croatia, albeit with understandable caveats from France and the UK. Two weeks into the most effective ceasefire in the six-month conflict, Bonn's persistently argued belief that recognition would be a carrot leading towards peace appears to have been vindicated. No one, however, should be tempted by the illusion that this war, which has killed thousands and made half a million people homeless, is over. The main question facing the EC, upon which the practical task of peace-broking will continue to fall, whatever the nature of any UN imprimatur, is the extent to which community member states are willing to apply stick as well as carrot. Economic sanctions will no doubt have a part to play for some time to come, but most specifically and immediately, the peacemakers must ensure that neither Serbia nor Croatia feels able to extend the war into the neighbouring republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Extension of the war is a course of action all too likely to appeal to Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, and Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, given their political need to silence growing internal opposition to the failures of their policies. Mr Tudjman, for example, has obtained recognition for Croatia without regaining full control of the republic's territory. Mr Milosevic has failed to prevent Croatia from seceding from what was once the Yugoslav federation. For politicians whose stock in trade is to foment nationalist unrest to increase their power bases, these are serious difficulties. Carve up That both politicians now present themselves as peace-makers should delude no one. There are unmistakeable signs that the two rivals are indeed seeking to gain more territory by agreeing with each other to carve up their ethnically mixed neighbour, where for centuries, Moslems, Serbs and Croats have lived together peacefully. It will not be easy for the international community to guarantee the stability and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina. A first step would be for the EC to make it plain to everyone involved that the security of this republic is a precondition of all further co-operation with Serbia and Croatia. Secondly, the EC should propose and help finance the demilitarisation of the republic, which is currently home to a large part of the Serb-dominated federal army. At the same time, planning needs to proceed in earnest for the possible despatch of a significant UN peace-keeping force to Bosnia-Hercegovina, something Mr Milosevic strongly opposes. Most risky Of all the options open to the international community, this is obviously the most risky and could only proceed in the light of a full appraisal of the military situation. It would be a disaster for such a force, likely to be composed mainly of Europeans, to be obliged to retreat in the face of gruesome casualties. If the ceasefire continues, such intervention may not be necessary; if it breaks down it may be impossible. But following the decision to send in unarmed UN observers, it is a contingency which, if well timed, may be both viable and desirable. In the meantime, Bosnians themselves will be active. Some still hope for international recognition once a referendum is held throughout the republic and that independence will give Bosnia the right, and perhaps even the ability, to exercise some control over the army. More important is the fact that independence would validate the republic's internal frontiers as international borders. If it is possible to establish in the Yugoslav context that no borders, whether internal or external, will be altered by force of arms, much will have been done to improve the chances of lasting stability. For the EC, Yugoslavia will continue to represent an inescapable, long-term challenge. That Germany's unilateral diplomacy has produced a short-term and most welcome advance should not be allowed to obscure the need for patient and coherent collective action in the future.</p>

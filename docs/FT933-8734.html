			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Pressure on sterling hits gilts during heavy profit-taking EUROPEAN bond prices were volatile yesterday, as some markets came under selling pressure from profit-takers, while others proved susceptible to movements in the foreign exchange market. Dealers said most markets had been ready for a correction after advancing strongly recently. According to Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at SG Warburg, 10-year bond yields have fallen 40 basis points in Germany, 47 in France, 56 in the UK, and 136 in Italy since the beginning of July. GILTS proved particularly turbulent as sterling came under pressure following the release of a disappointing batch of economic data which showed that manufacturing output fell 2.1 per cent in June and unemployment rose for the first time since January. The gilt future on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) opened half a point higher and rose to 113 1/2 before declining rapidly. However, after hitting a low of 11 25/32 , it recovered to end at 112 3/8 , more than a point down on the opening. Dealers said there was technical support for the future at this level. They said the declines were partly due to heavy profit-taking by domestic institutions. The market has rallied strongly recently, advancing from 108 1/2 two weeks ago and 110 5/8 a week ago. 'The main risk to the gilts market is that overseas demand will dry up,' said Mr Jonathon Davies, an analyst at UBS. Consequently, the weakness of sterling is of concern, as foreign investors tend to buy gilts when they are bullish on the currency as well as the bond market. However, the Bank of England sold its latest gilt taps without apparent difficulty. FRENCH bond prices ended up about  1/4 point, while the French notional bond future on the Matif in Paris closed at 122.82, up 0.18 point. The market had reached a high of 122.88, close to its psychological target of 123.00. However, once the future breaks through that level, it could lose some of its impetus, analysts said. It was announced that France's July provisional consumer price index rose a seasonally-adjusted 0.1 per cent, to 0.2 per cent on the month. This was a benign number for the market as tax changes had made little impact. However, inflation is not the current worry for the French market: of more concern was the pressure on the franc, and fears the government might see any currency weakness as a reason to delay rate cuts. The market was hoping for little fresh encouragement from an address by prime minister Edouard Balladur on French television last night. 'The general stance seems to be to talk tough and ease rates quietly,' one analyst said. AFTER rallying strongly in the morning on surprisingly good inflation figures, US bond prices dropped into negative territory later in the day following a disappointing auction of 30-year bonds. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 109 (a swing of almost  3/4 of a point from the morning's high), yielding 6.438 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.049 per cent. Longer-dated prices surged after the commerce department announced its index of producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in July. Analysts had been expecting a modest increase in the PPI. The 'core' measure of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, was also unexpectedly weak, registering only a 0.1 per cent increase last month. Even the most bullish of inflation forecasters were surprised by the data, and there was heavy buying of bonds. All of the early gains, however, were wiped out when dealers marked down prices in an attempt to clear their books of the new supply of bonds bought in the 30-year auction. Demand for the Dollars 11bn in new bonds was unexpectedly weak, and the issue was sold at an average yield of 6.33 per cent. GERMAN bond prices ended virtually unchanged after an unusually volatile session, when the trading range widened to 40 basis points. The bund future closed at 97.42, having reached a high of 97.63. However, the future is now heading into new territory, and it there may be some resistance to the market breaking through to new highs, without some sign of action to ease rates. IN Japan, the yen reached new highs, fuelling speculation that an interest rate cut was on the way, as the Bank of Japan eased conditions in the money market. Bond prices rallied more than half a point, and the benchmark No 145 government bond yield breached the psychological 4 per cent barrier to end at 3.97 per cent. ITALIAN bonds again out-performed other markets, as dealers continued to reassess their views on the market, now widely viewed as having been heavily oversold. Dealers said the currency was holding up reasonably well, and more positive sentiment on the inflation outlook is fuelling foreign interest in the market. Ten-year Italian bond prices rose a further 3/4 point, but yields are approaching the 10 per cent level, which could provide resistance. However, Italy and Spain are now the only mainstream European markets offering 10-year yields above 8 per cent.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Procter wins painkiller fight Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has won approval from a US court to continue its aggressive attack on the Dollars 2.4bn-a-year US market for painkillers. A district court judge in New Jersey ruled that the company was not engaged in misleading advertising for its new non-prescription pain-reliever, called Aleve. Procter &amp; Gamble entered the market last June in partnership with Syntex, a US drug company. It accompanied the launch of Aleve, an over-the-counter version of the drug naproxen, with television advertisements suggesting that the product was more effective than established products - notably Advil, an ibuprofen-based pain reliever made by American Home Products. In August American Home Products filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble and Syntex seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Aleve advertisements, claiming they were misleading consumers with 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated' claims.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (9): Consumers forced back to basics - Retailing When Mr Yukio Higuchi set up his first discount liquor store in Tokyo 25 years ago, he had to endure numerous anonymous death threats. He spent most of his time fending off the thugs loitering around his store while trying to convince wholesalers to sell him goods. Years later, however, supported by a change in consumer attitudes and a prolonged economic downturn, his Kawachiya liquor chain is thriving. 'During the weekends, the stores get so crowded I have to close the shutters to keep people out,' he says. During the 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s, ordinary Japanese did not think twice about spending on highly-priced household goods, food and drink. However the sharp fall in corporate profits and the consequent restructurings have posed a threat to workers' real income, forcing consumers to go back to basics. Boxes of beers and bottles of whisky at a 30 per cent discount to the normal retail price have an obvious attraction. Kawachiya, which is unlisted, says its sales have grown by about 30 per cent for the past three years, and it expects annual sales to double this year to Y15bn due to the launch of new stores. The trend towards cheaper prices, however, does not stop at liquor. Consumers are turning to discount stores for their electronic goods, clothes, drugs and other everyday products. Aoyama Trading, a manufacturer and retailer of office workers' blue suits, has seen profits surge during the past few years. For the first six months to September, the company posted a 34.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y12.1bn on a 38.7 per cent increase in sales to Y76.6bn. To achieve these results, discount retailers are turning away from conventional methods of Japanese retailing, relying on the myriad of wholesalers for supplies and providing extensive service. Japanese manufacturers set retail prices with profit margins high enough to support two levels of wholesalers and the retailer. In addition, domestic manufacturers cushion their retailers by offering rebates. Until now those who tried to buck the system faced intimidation by retail associations, manufacturers and wholesalers. For retailers such as Kawachiya, securing a procurement route for merchandise has also been difficult. By selling its products at a discount, Kawachiya is foregoing a bulk of the revenue that ordinary retailers see, but it manages to keep down costs by its no-frills approach. Most of the employees are hired part time, the merchandise is kept in boxes and its stores resemble old shacks. 'Consumers shouldn't have to pay extra to support distributors,' he says. In the case of Aoyama, and other men's suit discounters, they have turned to cheap production costs in south-east Asia and China, buying products directly from the manufacturers. In sharp contrast to the discount stores, Japan's upmarket department stores have been suffering from the plunge in consumer spending. October sales at leading department stores in the greater Tokyo area fell 10.4 per cent to Y209.5bn, the 20th consecutive decline. At the same time, Mitsukoshi, the prestigious department store which has business ties with Harrods, announced its first interim pre-tax loss in nine years. Mr Paul Heaton, retail analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo, explains: 'Department stores have the most to lose from the rising popularity of discount retailers.' Meanwhile, discount retailers have received a boost from stricter enforcement against price control by the country's Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog. Japanese manufacturers and wholesalers have often threatened to stop shipments if the retailer failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set by the manufacturer. But manufacturers are now being forced to allow retailers to set their own prices. Japanese beer companies announced in 1990 that retailers were free to set their own prices. Earlier this year, sales of subsidiaries of leading electronics companies, including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, were warned about attempts to prevent retailers from discounting their products by threatening to withdraw contracts. Mr Higuchi at Kawachiya says he has been actively informing the FTC of any unfair practice from manufacturers. Last year he took a pharmaceutical company, which cut shipments after Kawachiya started discounting its pep drink, to the commission. In August, he lodged a complaint against leading cosmetics companies, including Shiseido. He claims Shiseido and other producers cancelled or decreased shipments after he had rejected pleas to stop discounting luxury cosmetic brands. Japan's cosmetic makers distribute merchandise through small chain stores and have asserted pressure while providing large rebates at the same time, to prevent retailers from discounting. Following an investigation by the FTC, Shiseido recently announced that it would review its contracts and rebate practices with its chain store operators. Analysts predict that changes in consumer spending patterns are here to stay, and even if the economy picks up, sales of high-priced merchandise at department stores will not recover. This may be the reason why the department stores are starting to sell cheaper products. To compete with the likes of Aoyama, one leading department store recently attracted customers by offering men's silk suits below Y30,000.</p>

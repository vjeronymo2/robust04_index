			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hamleys to float with Pounds 40m tag Hamleys, the Regent Street toy shop, is to be floated on the Stock Exchange to fund more store openings. The company revealed its intentions as it announced a 50 per cent increase in operating profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.6m for the year to January 29. Turnover grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 17.9m). The flotation, which will be primarily through a share placing, is expected to value the company at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m. The proceeds will pay off debt of about Pounds 14m and fund more store openings. After opening outlets at London's Covent Garden and at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, the company is considering stores in overseas airports, the Channel Tunnel complex, and other areas with high tourist densities. Hamleys recently did a deal to operate toy concessions in some House of Fraser department stores. It also sees opportunities for 'limited expansion overseas' and development of the Hamleys brand. The company's operating profits have almost trebled in a three-year development programme implemented by Mr Howard Dyer, chief executive and former head of US operations at Williams Holdings, and operations director Mr Stephen Woodbridge, a former colleague from Williams. Hamleys was acquired in a Pounds 22m management buy-in from Lowndes Queensway led by Citicorp Venture Capital in 1989, shortly after Jimmy Gulliver's group bought Harris Queensway from Sir Philip Harris. Citicorp invited Mr Dyer to draw up a management plan for the business in 1991. He reduced costs, improved the retailing operations, purchasing and management systems, and carried out a Pounds 3m revamp of the Regent Street store. His reward is to be promoted to chairman now the company is seeking a listing, while Mr Woodbridge becomes managing director. Mr Rupert Hambro, non-executive chairman since 1989, remains as a non-executive director and chairman of newly-appointed audit and remuneration committees. Mr Dyer sees important opportunities for Hamleys as a 'retailer to the tourist trade'. But he does not intend to follow the example of Sir Philip Harris, who opened other Hamleys stores, such as those in Birmingham and Edinburgh, which were unsuccessful. Analysts suggest that the toy trade is too seasonal - with up to 75 per cent of sales being made at Christmas - for Hamleys stores to be profitable in cities without the tourist traffic of London. But its Heathrow Airport and Covent Garden stores have proved a success, as has its deal with British Airways to provide child passengers with packs of toys branded with the Hamleys name.</p>

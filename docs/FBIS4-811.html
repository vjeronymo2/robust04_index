			<p>BFN     [Text] Unable to cope with National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops and disenchanted with  seeing their parachutes falling in UNITA-controlled areas,  MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor  Party] troops stationed in Bie today decided to mount an attack,  using artillery fire. Sources say powerful explosions were  heard inside the city. Although the situation is worrisome,  sources in Huambo told our correspondent that World Food Program  aircraft managed to land in Bie with foodstuffs on board. The  sources added that UNITA armed forces in Bie have been  instructed to remain calm, but if Luanda continues with its  bombardments, the situation could worsen.    Meanwhile, our Cuanza Norte correspondent reported today  that  the MPLA-PT air force continued with its attacks on N'Dalatando  and nearby locations. The source said the MPLA-PT air force has  been carrying out two attacks daily. Civilians are the  preferred targets for the air force [words indistinct] and  Lucala villages. The source added that bombardments by  artillery units have been stepped up. The command of the Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola in the region said this  afternoon that N'Dalatando will never be occupied by neither  [words indistinct] let alone aircraft.</p>

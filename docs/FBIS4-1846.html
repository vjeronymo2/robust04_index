			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday morning [25 March], the provincial  government held a mobilization meeting about a major commodity  price investigation. Wang Xiaofeng, provincial party deputy  secretary and provincial executive vice governor, presided over  and addressed the meeting. Provincial Vice Governor Chen Suhou  made a mobilization speech.    In his speech, Wang Xiaofeng pointed out: In recent years,  our provincial economy has continuously advanced toward  sustained, rapid, and healthy development. However, under the  present situation of economic transformation, taking the  opportunity of changes in tax and exchange rates and price  reform, some enterprises, units, and individual commercial units  have arbitrarily increased prices and collected fees. They have  also arbitrarily raised prices of daily necessities and service  charges. This has enhanced the pressure of inflation and caused  higher price increase. In particular, the margin of price  increase in our province ranks first in the country. Due to  excessive price rises, the burden of the masses has become  heavier. Various quarters have a strong reaction against such  price hikes. Therefore, curbing price hikes has now become a  key to handling relations between development, reform and  stability well.    Wang Xiaofeng stressed: Under the condition of socialist  market economy, relying on market prices alone is not enough.  The government still needs to control prices. It is necessary  to organically integrate exercising control with lifting  controls. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen reform and  strengthen macroscopic regulation and control over commodity  prices. It is necessary to control prices according to law and  establish a supervisory system of the government. It is  necessary to stabilize prices through developing production and  ensuring supplies. It is necessary to implement measures of  microscopic regulation and control by central authorities and to  properly control investment and consumption demand, so that we  can maintain market stability and speed up the pace of our  province's economic development.    In his mobilization speech, Chen Suhou pointed out: Carrying  out a major investigation of commodity prices is an important  measure for strengthening macroscopic regulation and control and  promoting healthy economic development. It is an effective form  for strengthening supervision and examination of commodity  prices under the condition of developing a socialist market  economic system. In light of Hainan's practical conditions, the  present investigation of commodity prices must grasp well the  three integrations. In other words, the major investigation  must be integrated with the practice of stopping collecting fees  arbitrarily and lightening peasant burden. The major  investigation must be integrated with strengthening macroscopic  regulation and control and improving the price control system.  Inspection, supervision, and coordinated services must be  simultaneously grasped, so that temporary relief can be  integrated with permanent solutions.    It has been learned that the present majort investigation  will be carried out in two stages. From the second half of  March to 15 April, is propaganda and mobilization stage.  Various departments and enterprises must carry out  self-investigation and submit their own reports. From 16 April  to the end of June will be the key examination, summation, and  consolidation stage.</p>

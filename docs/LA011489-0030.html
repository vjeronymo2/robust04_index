			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS RECORD IS GREAT, EXCEPT FOR JANUARY  </P> <P> In rebuttal to Mr. Cowdery's letter (Jan. 7), saying the championship of L.A.  should not be decided until after the bowl games:  </P> <P> The last 2 years, USC has defeated UCLA with the Rose Bowl on the line for both  teams. Since UCLA lost those games they had to settle for a lesser bowl, and  thus, a lesser opponent.  </P> <P> Let UCLA brag about beating up on the BYUs and Floridas in other bowl games.  For Pac-10 teams, the Rose Bowl is the big show, and you can't win it unless  you get there.  </P> <P> JOHN RIS  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

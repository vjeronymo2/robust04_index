			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: The price of British gas ONE OF the most important moments so far in the short history of regulating Britain's privatised but still over-mighty utilities is almost upon us. British Gas is in the final stages of negotiations with its regulator, the Office of Gas Supply, to determine the formula which will set the prices paid by 17m domestic gas customers from April 1992. The Ofgas review of domestic prices began in June of last year and has been a wide-ranging affair. It needs to be; last year, gas prices went up twice - by 7.5 per cent in March and by between 3.3 and 3.7 per cent in November. These increases were justified under the current formula, which links the price of gas to the retail price index, minus 'x', plus 'y', where 'x' is a 2 per cent efficiency factor and 'y' is the cost to British Gas itself of obtaining raw fuel. It is to be hoped that Ofgas, with the help of two external accountants, is taking a robustly sceptical view of both the 'x' and 'y' factors. Although the British Gas publicity machine has been active in recent months in presenting the results of its own customer surveys, there remains a suspicion that this private sector near-monopoly still needs to shed more than a few pounds in weight. It has not, to take just one example, been driving particularly hard bargains on the pay front. Searching inquiry As for the cost of British Gas's raw materials, there are also good grounds for searching inquiry. The company's dominance of the retail market does not necessarily give it the strongest possible incentive to obtain the lowest cost supplies and there is, at the very least, room to question British Gas's efficiency as an operator of its own gas fields. At the point of privatisation, it was impossible for any outsider to unscramble British Gas's accounts to make a fair judgment on these points. Ofgas will have let down gas customers very badly if it has failed to sort out the figures. Ofgas has also served notice that it intends to reconsider the appropriate return for British Gas, the value of its assets and new ways in which it can be held accountable for standards of service. The next stage of this lengthy process, due in the next week, is that British Gas has to inform Ofgas whether it accepts the regulator's proposed pricing formula. If it does not, the matter is automatically referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for detailed examination. MMC involvement There is a very strong case for MMC involvement, not least because it would expose to public scrutiny the detail of Ofgas's case and British Gas's response. One of the biggest problems caused by the misjudged privatisation of British Gas, which was allowed to keep most of its monopoly power, is that the kind of public disclosure which was to some extent required of a nationalised industry can now be resisted on grounds of commercial confidentiality. As the rules stand, however, British Gas can avoid a bruising run-in with the MMC simply by agreeing to the Ofgas plan. It is to be hoped, in that event, that one element in the Ofgas proposal is that there should be full public exposure of its analysis. There is no point in Ofgas setting itself up as a policeman of the meter man's punctuality if its essential calculations about prices are lost in obscurity. Nor should the politicians who designed the regulatory regime in gas make the mistake of thinking that these are matters of little interest to voters. Energy prices are uncontroversial so long as they are relatively stable. But the new gas price formula will cover the period from 1992 to 1997. It will only take a modest oil and gas price shock in that period to turn the arcane algebra of Ofgas into front page news. Regulating a company as powerful as British Gas is not easy, and so far Ofgas has had only modest success in stimulating competition in the industrial gas market. For domestic customers, Ofgas looks like remaining the only protection against the abuse of monopoly power. That is why its next move on prices needs to be rigorous and visibly so.</p>

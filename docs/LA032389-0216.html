			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> GIRLS ALL-SOUTH COAST TEAM INCLUDES 4 JUNIORS, ONE OF WHOM IS AN ALL-AMERICAN  </P> <P> There are two exceptional junior basketball players at Lynwood High School --  Earnest Killum, who averaged almost 30 points a game for the boys team, and  Linda Watson, who averaged 22 for the girls team.  </P> <P> "I think she'd beat Earnest (in a shooting contest)," Lynwood girls Coach  Maurice Roberson said of Watson, one of the players on the 1989 Times All-South  Coast High School Basketball Team.  </P> <P> Watson, a guard-forward, made 72 3-point shots (from beyond 19 feet) this  season, breaking the CIF girls record of 55. She was named by Parade magazine  as a first-team All-American.  </P> <P> "She can do everything," Roberson said. "And she works on continually  developing her skills. She's not satisfied."  </P> <P> Watson also averaged 9.5 rebounds, five assists and three steals as she led the  21-7 Knights to the San Gabriel Valley League championship and the second round  of the CIF playoffs.  </P> <P> She made The Times' All-South Coast Team for the second year in a row, as did  another junior, Iesha Smith of Artesia. Altogether, there are four juniors on  the team.  </P> <P> Compton, St. Joseph and Poly High each placed two players on the team.  </P> <P> The rest of the All-South Coast all-stars:  </P> <P> Kathleen Hill, Compton -- At 5-foot-8, she held her own against taller players  and averaged 13 points and 12 rebounds a game. "She's very aggressive on the  boards, and has a good attitude," said Tarbabes Coach Carolyn Montgomery. Hill  is effective either facing the basket or posting an opponent. She started last  season as a sophomore.  </P> <P> Sharnette McMillan, Compton -- "If she keeps her head together, look for her to  be a Division I player," Montgomery said of this junior who averaged 14 points  and five assists. She led her team in scoring as point guard and is a very good  offensive player, adept at shooting and leaping.  </P> <P> Miko Montgomery, Poly -- Known as the Charles Barkley of girls high school  basketball, the 5-8 Montgomery once weighed 220 pounds but now is about 195.  "The only thing she doesn't do (that Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers does) is  dunk," said Jackrabbits Coach Orlando Larracuente. "She handles the ball, goes  coast to coast and can shoot with anyone, including boys." Montgomery averaged  10 points and five rebounds for the Moore League champions. There's a good  chance she will go to Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Yvonne Vanlandingham, Poly -- The Moore League's MVP, she averaged 13 points,  eight rebounds and two blocked shots. A center who can also shoot 3-pointers,  she did not start playing basketball until the middle of her sophomore year.  Larracuente expects her to be a Division I player, possibly at San Jose State  or Oregon State.  </P> <P> Lisa Fernandez, St. Joseph -- Most valuable player of the Angelus League, this  sharp shooter played all positions, averaging 20 points, nine rebounds, four  assists and 4.6 steals. "She is not weak in anything," Jesters Coach Margaret  Bos said of Fernandez, who had five triple doubles. An outstanding pitcher,  Fernandez is going to UCLA on a softball scholarship and wants to play  basketball there. "I think she can make it," Bos said.  </P> <P> Dana Montoya, St. Joseph -- "She loves to play defense," Bos said of the very  quick Montoya, a guard who had six steals a game. She also averaged 10.9  points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists. "Dana and Lisa are both a coach's dream  players, they play with their hearts," Bos said of Montoya and Fernandez.  </P> <P> Tameesha Hayes, St. Anthony -- Hayes had a great year for a 15-8 team. She  averaged 19.8 points a game, eight assists and five steals, shot 56% from the  field and 78% from the foul line. "She plays a complete game, comes through in  the clutch and doesn't make many mistakes," St. Anthony Coach Candy Gomez said.  Hayes beat out Fernandez of St. Joseph for MVP of the St. Anthony Tournament.  She also has a 3.8 grade-point average.  </P> <P> Iesha Smith, Artesia -- The leader of the 19-5 Suburban League champions, this  5-10 junior averaged 25 points and five assists a game. She also shot 60% from  the field and 70% from the free throw line. A player with great athletic  ability, she is particularly effective in the open court, either driving to the  basket or pulling up for a jump shot.  </P> <P> Minnie Blalock, Jordan -- A three-year starter, this point guard played an  up-tempo game and averaged 15.5 points, six assists and two steals for the  15-10 Panthers. In two seasons she made 89 shots from 3-point territory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 ALL-STARS  </P> <P> The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches  and parents will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 2, at the  annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-stars teams from 12  circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The featured speaker  will be George Yardley, a former All-American at Stanford University, who went  on to become the first player ever to score more than 2,000 points in an NBA  season. The players and the coaches of the year from each area will be  announced.  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will recieve the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Kathleen Hill  </P> <P> School: Compton  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 5-9  </P> <P> Average: 13.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Sharnette McMillan  </P> <P> School: Compton  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 5-6  </P> <P> Average: 14.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Linda Watson  </P> <P> School: Lynwood  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 5-9  </P> <P> Average: 22.2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Miko Montgomery  </P> <P> School: Poly  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 5-8  </P> <P> Average: 10.2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Yvonne Vanlandigham  </P> <P> School: Poly  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Average: 12.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Lisa Fernandez  </P> <P> School: St. Joseph  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 5-6  </P> <P> Average: 20.1  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Dana Montoya  </P> <P> School: St. Joseph  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 5-6  </P> <P> Average: 10.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tameesha Hayes  </P> <P> School: St. Anthony  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 5-4  </P> <P> Average: 19.8  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Iesha Smith  </P> <P> School: Artesia  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 5-10  </P> <P> Average: 25.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Minnie Blalock  </P> <P> School: Jordan  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 5-4  </P> <P> Average: 15.5  </P></p>

Many locally owned factories in Vietnam which were set up in  the Southeast Asian country under the assumption the embargo  would soon be lifted will surely turn a handsome profit as a  result of the U.S. policy change.    To date, investments by Taiwan-based enterprises in Vietnam  are estimated to be worth more than US$1.5 billion, making the  island that nation's number one source of foreign capital.    Most local companies went to Vietnam because of the  availability of cheap labor there. Vietnam also shares much in  common with Taiwan, due to its cultural heritage, work ethic and  the customs of its people. This commonality has surely helped  to attract investment from Taiwan.    Over the past few years, labor-intensive manufacturers of  various products ranging from textiles to low-end electronics  have been unable to maintain their price competitiveness  vis-a-vis other competitors in Southeast Asia and mainland  China, due to rising costs on the island.    Seeing that these industries had to move somewhere,  authorities here rightly encouraged them to set up production  lines in Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, in order to  avoid risking too many of the country's financial and industrial  resources in mainland China, which has been the top choice for  outbound investment for many years.    Now that the U.S. embargo has been lifted, the Vietnamese  economy is expected to be given a great boost and the country  will certainly become more important in the international arena.    However, the ROC [Republic of China] government should be  careful not to assess the current situation in Vietnam by  looking through recolored glasses.    In the late 1970s when relations between the United States  and mainland China were normalized, many people got caught up in  the euphoria that went along with the new friendly relations  between the two countries and forgot that the mainland remained  a communist state.    After tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled over the  dead bodies of students and workers who dared to speak out  against the Beijing regime in 1989, many people in the outside  world were surprised to learn that communist China had retained  a Leninist system of suppression after the death of Mao Tse-tung.    Now that Vietnam and the United States have apparently  bridged some of their differences, people in Taiwan should  refrain from adopting a similarly naive attitude about the  leadership in Hanoi.    Formally known as the "Socialist Republic of Vietnam," our  southwesterly neighbor is one of the world's last remaining  communist dictatorships, and the leadership of the Vietnamese  Communist Party is doing all it can to keep it that way.    To be sure, sweeping economic reforms were made by  Vietnamese  leaders beginning in 1986 with the so-called "doi moi" or  "renovation" policies. But virtually no major political reforms  have been made, except for efforts aimed at transferring more  day-to-day administrative duties from party committees to  official state organs apparently in order to avoid wasteful  duplication and the transferring of certain administrative  responsibilities to local governments in order to increase the  efficiency of the state bureaucracy.    The Vietnamese Communist Party has retained its leading role  in all important spheres of life in Vietnam. Any attempt to  organize any kind of opposition force is still, as always,  ruthlessly persecuted in Vietnam today.    The Vietnamese communists also continue to restrict  religious  activity throughout the country.    After the government of the Republic of Vietnam fell on  April  30, 1975, and the south was brought under the control of  northern-led forces, Chinese-Vietnamese citizens who had  previously belonged to the pro-Taiwan camp or who held  identification papers issued by the Republic of China were  persecuted by the communists and in many cases their properties  and businesses were confiscated.    After Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Hanoi's former allies in  communist China staged a fierce attack on northern Vietnam in  the late 1970s, many ethnic Chinese living in the country even  those who had been pro-Beijing were forced to flee the country  for their lives.    While we can't allow bad memories to unnecessarily restrict  our contacts and trade with Vietnam, we should not forget the  harsh treatment that people of Chinese ancestry have received at  the hands of the Vietnamese communists.    Although the end of the U.S. embargo will certainly mean  even  more contacts, exchanges and investments in Vietnam, we should  not allow ourselves to get carried away and make a mockery of  our democratic ideals by hopping in bed with the Vietnamese  communists.    As the old saying goes: "Those who lie down with dogs get up  with fleas."</p>

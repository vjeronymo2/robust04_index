			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Compagnie Jean Gaudin - The Place The programme leaflet begins, of course, with a meaty quotation from Roland Barthes, and follows it with a message from the mastermind of the evening telling us that it is not the quotation that influenced him but the way of thinking. Yes, it is the French new dance back at The Place - the Compagnie Jean Gaudin  - and yes, the heart plummets as the evening gets under way, and La Dame aux Camelias is given the rounds of the kitchen. A few observations from a victim of this enterprise may suggest something of its flavour. There is a large wooden trellised set, emblazoned (ask not why) with the Petainist motto Travail, Famille, Patrie. There is a round red velvet seat with ambulant tendencies on which the performers perch and journey about the stage area (and how I wish it had done the decent thing and taken them off to Heathrow). There are two men and three women involved: I could identify Marguerite and Armand, but the slightly Spanish girl, and the tall chap in the ill-cut jacket, mauve skirt and sensible shoes, did not really ring true as Dumas characters. There was a great deal of dialogue in French, much of it whispered, all of it of transcendent tedium, with the cove in mauve as chief chatterbox. He had a heavy English accent and kept his hands very busy above his waist and shoulders with ever such graceful gesticulation. Fragments of a squally Callas recording of La Traviata are played when the chit-chat dies down, and two of the girls suggest the falsities of La Vie by bursting into mocking laughter from time to time. There are references to sniffing cocaine. M. Gaudin's 'choreography' is more concerned with production than steps, and is banal. The evening amounts to a confused, pretentious, ill-conceived and drearily executed gloss on its original, and receives the support of the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique. It is singularly lacking in artistic action, and I do not find it does any good to the fair name of French contemporary creativity. It is, though, yet another example of the perfectly dreadful things the French are perpetrating under the impression that this is modern dance. The programme-sheet provides an idiosyncratic translation of the spoken text. The key to the affair reads: 'Oh, I feel like an indistinct heap tonight'. A heap of what only General Cambronne could tell.</p>

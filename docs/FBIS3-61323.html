However, the degree of their gravity is  different. In order to reduce the probability of committing new  errors, it is necessary to analyze the objective nature of their  occurrence.    Let us first turn to the market (Western) economy.  Developing  cyclically, that is, when from time to time a boom is  interrupted by an absolute slump, it thus is able to check the  quality of its existence during relatively short periods of time  and, having adopted a healing measure in the form of an  overproduction crisis, eliminates the disproportions and moves  forward. A happy surprise can befall it on this path: while  cyclicity is maintained, it can enter the phase of accelerated  advanced transformations for decades. Not every national economy  manages to realize such a chance. The point is that two types of  progress are characteristic of the economy.    The first--a cyclical ascent upwards, as though climbing  along the spiral to the Tower of Pisa. It does not depend much  on the economic management of the authorities. Even if the worst  variant is allowed, that is, for some reasons the government  would hamper a recovery from the cyclical crisis, the movement  of the economy itself would break the resistance of the  administration. By now Western economic science has developed a  number of generally accepted rules of anticrisis policy.  Fulfilling them, the government can save its face even if these  rules are incorrect from the point of view of their positive  effect on the final result (it is impossible to prove anything  mathematically). The cyclical crisis contains the automatism of  overcoming itself in a short space of time.    Consequently, the sense of the policy of management in  countries with a market economy lies not so much in eliminating  the cyclical upheaval as in solving another problem: how to lead  the economy to a higher plane of development, that is, to ensure  conditions for the second type of progress.    Economic history gives several facts of this type. One  country or another, which until a certain time was not noted for  special economic advances, suddenly begins to sharply outpace  its competitors in key indicators. Germany and Japan have become  chrestomathic examples. New industrial countries in Southeast  Asia are now making a spurt. At one time Soviet science did not  ignore this matter. However, it examined it from its own  specific point of view. Many works on the unevenness of economic  and political development of countries during the era of  imperialism were written for the purpose of searching and  substantiating the weak link in the chain of imperialism, which  falls out from it and becomes socialist.    Be that as it may, not every country and, all the more, not  every government is lucky history-wise. Therefore, cases of an  economic spurt are extraordinary. They do not lend themselves to  forecasting and, owing to their isolated nature, are not subject  to generalization.    The situation with a centrally managed economy looks  different. A cyclical movement is absent here and, therefore,  even the minimum of (cyclical) progress contained in the genes  of capitalism is not guaranteed. However, we did not need the  minimum, because the planned system set for itself the task of  attaining the maximum possible on the basis of the fact that  everything can be envisaged and calculated. Here, however, we  have encountered a phenomenon, which has not yet been fully  recognized in our country. It is a matter of the unknowability  of the economy.    Unknowability of the economy begins from an analysis of its  past. First, with a potential multiplicity of variants only one  variant is realized and, in principle, it is impossible to  calculate or demonstrate whether it was optimal. It is only  possible to assume, taking into consideration political, moral,  and military factors, which do not lend themselves to a  quantitative measurement. During an evaluation of the past,  public opinion can lean toward any side, which is represented,  for example, either by a single monopoly opinion, or by a  majority of votes, or by disarming eloquence. Second, similar  insurmountable difficulties arise during a retrospective  analysis of the most realized variant of development and during  the clarification of the question of what affected it to a  greater, and what, to a lesser extent, and whether everything  that affected it is known.    Third, it is impossible to grasp the intricacies of current  economic development at every moment.    Economy as such is the absolute truth and only its small  part  is accessible to us. Possessing only relative truth, during the  Soviet era we used the entire power of the state apparatus for  the formation of a process, the scale, structure, and nature of  which were not clear to us from the very beginning. The nature  of past economic mistakes lies precisely here.    State planning did not withstand the gravity of assumed  responsibility and the economy secured by nothing fell into a  crisis, which differs from the cyclical one by the fact that it  does not contain any self-overcoming automatism. They strove for  the target maximum, but fell below the market minimum. During  favorable periods, when the planned economy externally  demonstrated tangible achievements, cardinal disproportions  ripened and large-scale flaws were allowed in it. When they  became obvious, their elimination occurred according to the same  scenario: the rectification of the situation simultaneously  created foci of new omissions and even crimes, for which we had  to pay during and after decades.    The sum of economic knowledge available today objectively  permits neither us nor the West to declare ourselves dictators  of such a most complex phenomenon as social reproduction. The  experienced West does not even try to do this and, therefore,  does not make mistakes similar to ours. Local experts understand  the fundamental self-regulation of the market economy. They  reduce the economic role of the state to fine tuning, correctly  thinking that decisive proportions determine the market. Of  course, the development of productive forces forces the state to  participate in economic life to a greater extent than earlier.  However, even in the era of computers and information science it  is aware of its secondary role. Private property gives rise to a  natural movement of things. It creates a superstructure over  itself and redistribution relations, which, clashing and  becoming balanced in varieties among themselves, ensure the  functioning of the entire economic mechanism.    What is the way out? The continuation of previous economic  policy would be hopeless for the country. However, giving it up,  it would be incorrect to copy criteria for market behavior  characteristic of Western functionaries (as yet there are no  real prerequisites for this). We face another kind of task: to  lead the country to a guaranteed (cyclical) minimum of progress.  We cannot wait any longer. The present situation creates for  Russia a growing lag behind Western powers, whose economy goes  forward despite any crises and contradictions.    The market system steadily becomes complicated and this,  perhaps, is the most dangerous factor for us from the point of  view of the strategic race. The complication of the economy  involves a constant and intensive enrichment of Western experts  with new knowledge, which, in turn, improves the quality of  state economic management. Right now Western economists possess  a bigger arsenal of knowledge than our science and practice. Our  own chance should be seen in the development of a market nature  of the economy, which will ensure its efficiency in all cases,  even with the current mistakes of the country's administration.  The latter should concentrate on the main question--how to lend  an additional speed to the development of the market. Only then  will the chance to carry out the second type of progress become  realistic.    Thus, in order to be equal in potentialities with market  countries, we will have to meet two indispensable conditions.    First: to accelerate the development of the market  environment.    Second: having discarded the burden of microeconomic  concerns, state bodies should create for the economy  strategically favorable conditions for a long boom. This  requires high professional competence. We can acquire it only  with our own experience and only after the realization of the  first condition.</p>

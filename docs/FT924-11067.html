			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: No justice in 'better-off' pensioners subsidising others Sir, If the Institute of Fiscal Studies is flying a kite for the government as it contemplates raiding the piggy bank of the state pension, it must do better than proffer Mr Andrew Dilnot's convoluted logic ('Means to a public spending end', October 19). Seemingly the 'better-off minority' with an occupational pension 'averaging Pounds 65' are to contribute towards topping up flat-rate pensions of Pounds 54 a week or Pounds 67 for a married couple by foregoing their own state pensions. No mention of course of the tax they will pay on their pension income, nor that they will have paid for their state pension through the National Insurance contributions, which they had every reason to take into account when planning their own pension provision, as indeed, in the case of company pensions, did their employers. Are they to sacrifice their own standard of living and see it depressed to the level of those they are allegedly helping? No doubt they can move house down market and perform a further economic service to the nation and its masters. Justice, it seems, flies out of the window when the bills for economic incompetence come home to roost. Paul Baker, Knelle Lodge, 37 Robin Hill Drive, Camberley, Surrey GU15 1EG</p>

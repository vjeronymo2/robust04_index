			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> FIRE DAMAGES ART CENTER  </P> <P> The Westside Art Center, a private nonprofit facility that provides classes in  the arts for children, was hit by an arson fire over the weekend. One bungalow  was gutted by the blaze and another was severely damaged by smoke and water.  </P> <P> Fire Department arson investigator Lyle Lentz said the fire was reported about  3 a.m. Saturday and was believed to have been deliberately set from the  outside. He estimated damage at $50,000 to the building and $25,000 to the  contents.  </P> <P> Carlyn Clark, executive director of the center, said video and stereo  equipment, musical instruments, art supplies and the children's artwork were  destroyed.  </P> <P> She said classes will meet outdoors for the next two weeks to complete the  summer session. However, she said she does not yet know where classes will be  held for the fall session, which begins in late September.  </P> <P> The center, which was formed in 1981 and serves about 300 children weekly,  rents the bungalows on the McKinley School grounds from the Santa Monica-Malibu  Unified School District. District officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> "The children's reaction has been mixed," Clark said. "They have been terrific  in terms of pitching in and cleaning up. They are feeling sad, but they also  have a sense of real ownership and want to make it back the way it use to be."  </P></p>

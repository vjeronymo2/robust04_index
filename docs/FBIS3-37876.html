N. Nazarbayev's talks with B. Clinton -- at first one on  one,  then with the delegations -- lasted a total of three hours. In  the estimation of the president of Kazakhstan, considering that  this was his first meeting with the head of the present White  House administration, the hopes that were being pinned on it  fully justified themselves. The central place was occupied by a  discussion of the problems of bilateral relations between  Kazakhstan and the United States, of the situation in the CIS  countries and in the Central Asian region, of politics in the  world's "hot spots," and of questions of security.    The chief document signed as a result was the "Charter of  Democratic Partnership Between the Republic of Kazakhstan and  the United States of America," embracing questions of politics,  economics, defense, science, technology, ecology, and others.  According to Nazarbayev, it contains guarantees of security  accorded to Kazakhstan by the United States and also stipulates  the conditions of multilateral cooperation within the NATO  "Partnership for Peace" program -- which in itself, he  elaborated, certainly does not constitute Kazakhstan's joining  the North Atlantic bloc.    Nazarbayev also reported that the U.S. President announced a  significant increase in the size of financial aid for Kazakhstan  -- to $311 million.    The stopover made in Paris at the request of French  President  Francois Mitterrand developed into a discussion of the progress  in implementing the French-Kazakhstani accords reached earlier.  One of the new accords consists in the fact that a renowned top  Parisian school of management will welcome a large group of  students from Kazakhstan.    "There have always been and will be Russian interests in  Kazakhstan, just as there are Kazakhstani interests in Russia,"  Nursultan Nazarbayev said in reply to a question from REUTERS  about consideration for these interests in the process of  developing contacts with the United States. "Therefore we do  not draw up a single large or small-scale international program  without inviting the Russian side to participate in it."    The journalists participating in the news conference showed  a  lively interest in the facts cited in IZVESTIYA correspondents'  reports (IZVESTIYA Nos. 29 and 32) concerning the Kazakhstani  president's position during his U.S. visit -- a position  "emphatically independent of Moscow's policy." Nazarbayev  deemed it necessary to make his elucidations on this score after  asking your correspondent to reproduce in the newspaper  everything he said with the utmost accuracy.    The state of affairs in Russia is of interest to everyone,  Nazarbayev said. Cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government are  also of concern to the U.S. Administration -- what changes of  political course might they lead to? I have always replied to  these questions as follows: It is necessary to gamble not on  names but on the process of democratization and economic reforms  taking place in Russia. I do not consider V. Chernomyrdin's  present government to be conservative -- first, because I know  Chernomyrdin himself well; second, both Chubays and Shokhin  remain in the government, while Gaydar and others can continue  to exert effective influence and give assistance by working in  parliament. Nobody will succeed in reversing the processes that  have already been accomplished in Russia. It is essential to  assist them, these processes -- I always emphasized this in  America, Nazarbayev said.    With regard to the allegation that "Kazakhstan sold  Baykonur without taking Russia's interests into account,"  Nazarbayev reported that only a treaty on the protection of  "know-how," providing for the nonproliferation to third  countries of space technologies provided by the United States,  was signed during his U.S. visit. It was signed by the leaders  of three aerospace departments -- U.S., Kazakhstani, and Russian  -- and Mr. Koptev, the head of the latter, accompanied  Nazarbayev on his trip.    Nor was the Semipalatinsk range "sold," Nazarbayev  asseverated -- there was talk exclusively of U.S. technical  assistance in conducting the necessary scientific research there  into the consequences of nuclear tests and of giving assistance  in rehabilitating the territory and the population affected by  them.    With regard to the strategic missiles which are to be  dismantled Nazarbayev confirmed that Kazakhstan is reckoning  only on compensation for the value of the highly enriched  uranium which constitutes the main "filling" of nuclear warheads.    According to the president of Kazakhstan, there was no need  for Bill Clinton to convince his guest of the need to construct  an oil pipeline from Tengiz to Novorossiysk, its construction is  already close to completion, and Russia is one of the full  participants in the construction. The planned capacity of the  Novorossiysk oil pipeline, however, is just 17 million tonnes of  oil a year, whereas, according to estimates, Kazakhstan intends  to export 50-60 million tonnes from the North Caspian regions.  If we look into the 21st century, Nazarbayev said, of course we  cannot manage with this oil pipeline alone, and it is becoming  simply essential to construct a large-capacity oil pipeline to  the south, across Turkey and Iran, with an outlet not just to  the Black Sea but also to the Persian Gulf.    Nazarbayev particularly emphasized that no documents  directed  against any third countries were examined or signed during his  visit -- they all concerned exclusively bilateral relations  between Kazakhstan and the United States. He also asseverated  that neither Kazakhstan's enforced departure from the ruble zone  nor any other circumstances had made him betray the principles  of integration among the former components of the USSR which he  has upheld throughout recent years: "Nazarbayev has not changed  and will not change. At least not in this life. Whatever the  press might say, Russia remains our top-priority, chief  partner." Just a little later he made a proviso: "True, it  does take two to tango. For proper cooperation willingness on  the part of the partner is also necessary."</p>

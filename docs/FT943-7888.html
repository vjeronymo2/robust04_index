			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Supply of workforce skills 'not deficient' Britain is not deficient in the supply of skills in its workforce, says a study from the Centre for Economic Performance. It argues that the country is 'not out of line' with other advanced western economies which have 'similar standards of living in terms of the stock of skills in the population'. The comparative study was carried out by Mr Peter Robinson. He found that only 35 per cent of the population lack recognised basic qualifications, which is much better than the average of 45 per cent for industrialised economies. The study showed, however, that Britain has a below-average proportion of the population who have been through higher education (16 per cent compared with an average of 19 per cent). But if non-university higher education is excluded, the proportion of the British population with university higher education, at 10 per cent, is similar to the average of member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The report's findings appear to conflict with the widely-held view at the end of the 1980s that Britain had too few 16- and 17-year-olds in training or full-time education. But Mr Robinson argues that a 'transformation' has taken place since 1988. In the current academic year, 73 per cent of 16-year-olds were still in full-time education in the January after their exit from compulsory schooling. This compares with only 45 per cent in 1986-87. In 1993-94 58 per cent of 17-year-olds were still in full-time education compared with only 33 per cent in 1986-87 while last year 30.9 per cent of the age group entered higher education compared with only 15.1 per cent in 1988. The report also points out that only an estimated 6 per cent to 8 per cent of 16-year-olds and 18 per cent to 19 per cent of 17-year-olds were in regular full-time jobs in 1993-94 with 12 per cent of both age groups in government-funded Youth Training. A 'worrying residual' were however, unemployed or inactive - amounting to 6 per cent to 7 per cent of 16-year-olds and 12 per cent to 13 per cent of 17-year-olds. 'The debate of the late 1980s over the supply of skills in the UK seems rather dated,' says Mr Robinson. 'Young people themselves have 'resolved' the debate over choosing the full education or apprenticeship route for 16- to 17-year-olds. The majority have chosen full-time education and it seems only prudent to accept this and reinforce the trend.' Supply of Skills in Britain. Centre for Economic Performance Working Paper 618.

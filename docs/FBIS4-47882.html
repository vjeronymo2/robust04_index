			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union,  Mr., Dries Bruwer, says a new government should have talks with  organized agriculture before completing an agricultural and land  policy for South Africa. Mr. Bruwer was reacting to the ANC's  land policy announcement yesterday in which sweeping land  reforms were envisaged. Mr. Bruwer said land claims and demands  had always been a sensitive matter and should be approached with  great circumspection because of their conflict potential. He  said a government which did not take cultural differences into  account could destabilize a country. Referring to land demands  after forced settlement, Mr. Bruwer said the ANC should not  forget that large numbers of white farmers had also been  resettled. He said traditional land ownership applied to white  farmers in the same way as it did to the other five ethnic  groups in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Thomson declines to Dollars 292m THE LONG North American recession and lower newspaper advertising revenues dampened Thomson Corporation's performance in 1991. The information-publishing group, which includes UK regional newspapers and specialised publishing in North America, recorded lower margins but Thomson Travel Group unit had an 'outstanding year'. Overall, Thomson reported 1991 earnings of USDollars 292m, or 53 cents a share, compared with Dollars 385m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. But before Dollars 67m amortisation of publishing rights applied in 1991 for the first time, per-share profit was 65 cents, against 70 cents. Operating profit was Dollars 692m, down 4.7 per cent from 1990. Profits from aircraft sales were Dollars 5m, against Dollars 45m last time. Thomson Newspapers sales dipped 1.4 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn. Improved circulation revenues, however, did not offset advertising losses, and operating profits dipped 19 per cent to Dollars 228m. The Ontario newspapers were worst hit. Information-publishing sales rose 3.2 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn, while operating profit dipped 2.4 per cent to Dollars 363m. UK professional and business publications and UK newspapers were slightly lower, but the US-based book and reference group improved profit. The financial services companies gained in sales, but margins remained under pressure. Fourth-quarter sales for Thomson overall were little changed at Dollars 1.35bn. Earnings, after amortisation of publishing rights, were Dollars 83m, or 15 cents a share, also little changed from 1990.</p>

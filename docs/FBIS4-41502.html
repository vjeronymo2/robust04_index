			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko  called for carrying out a policy of state protectionism toward  Siberia. With this aim in view, he initiated a bill on top  priority measures to develop Siberia.    Speaking at the session of the Interregional Siberia  Agreement Association at Irkutsk Saturday, Shumeyko explained  that for a period of one year Siberia should be guaranteed  against a number of the newly legislated economic measures. For  this reason, he spoke in favour of changing transport and  electricity tariffs.    In his opinion, such a bill should be passed by the assembly  houses before they get down to examining the draft of a federal  budget for 1995, which the cabinet has been instructed to submit  by September 15.    The Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, also attending the session,  backed up Shumeyko's proposal. In an interview with  journalists, he called for reasonable protectionism toward  producers and for giving regions more powers in drafting  taxation policy. He stressed that local authorities should  display more lawmaking initiative in federal parliament.    Deputy Premier Sergey Shakhray has also necessitated a  temporary law on commodities shipment to Arctic regions to stay  in effect in 1994-1995. He underlined that in the federal  budget, endorsed by the parliament's houses on Friday, the  delivery of goods to Arctic areas is estimated at 5.5 trillion  rubles.</p>

Sung and Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] The fate of Hong Kong's new airport hangs in the  balance, with China virtually calling off further talks on the  project following the government's decision to inject additional  funds without Beijing's blessing. Xinhua News Agency local  branch deputy director Zhang Junsheng warned yesterday there was  little hope of resuming talks on airport financing, because  Britain had breached Sino-British agreements on financing the  project.    The government will ask legislators tomorrow to approve a  $1.6 billion cash injection which will give the go-ahead for  urgent airport contracts, and allow the project to be completed  by its mid- 1997 target date. China has labelled the move as a  violation of the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the  New Airport (MOU), and accused the Hong Kong government of  taking unilateral action on financing.    Mr. Zhang hinted that the Airport Committee (AC) under the  Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was unlikely to resume  talks on airport financing.    "We wish the British side would handle the matter by  strictly  abiding by the principles of MOU," Mr. Zhang said. "However,  the British always play tricks and give trouble in everything."    Governor Chris Patten said last week China had not responded  to calls for further talks through the JLG. But in a  contradictory statement, a senior Chinese official said China  had never refused Britain's requests to hold Airport Committee  talks. "We may not agree to their funding proposal, but we have  never refused to have meetings," the official said.    In her first day as Acting Governor, Anson Chan said the  government still held out hope that the Airport Committee would  resume talks. "We hope to continue to have a dialogue with the  Chinese, to come to an early agreement on the financing so that  we can get ahead and build this airport that everybody says we  need," she said.    The JLG Airport Committee has not had a meeting since last  August.</p>

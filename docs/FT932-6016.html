			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Go-ahead from India for ABB's locomotive deal THE INDIAN government has approved, after more than five years of argument, a controversial Dollars 190m contract to import high-technology electric locomotives from Asea Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine. The deal has faced intense opposition from supporters of India's large domestic raliway engineering industry, who argued the country should build its own locomotives with the minimum of overseas help. Critics also said that India, a poor country, could not afford state-of-the art technology. But the cabinet of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, on Friday approved a contract for the import of 30 locomotives, and for the transfer of technology which would enable Indian factories to produce many more such machines over the coming decade. India first invited bids for the contract in 1987, but it was not until March 1992 that it decided to grant the contract to ABB, rather than three other international bidders. The deal's opponents were helped when the issue went before the Railway Convention Committee, a government advisory panel, last autumn. The panel said it would be better for India to develop its own cheaper techology, adding that ABB's locomotives, powered by a newly-developed alternating current motor controlled by microchips, would be much more expensive than an upgraded version of India's existing electric locomotives, run on traditional direct current motors. However, the cabinet has accepted ABB's argument that its machines will be cheaper and easier to run in the long term. Ministers may also have been swayed by concern that India, now opening its economy wider to foreigners, should not be seen turning its back on a foreign company already committed more than most to India. ABB's Indian affiliate employs more than 4,000.</p>

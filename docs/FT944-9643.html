			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Customer's Pounds 3m Lloyds claim fails A businessman whose company collapsed after he was introduced to a consultant - who was later convicted of fraud - yesterday lost his Pounds 3m compensation claim against Lloyds Bank. Mr Vince McGee has waged a six-year war on Lloyds Bank, including dropping stink bombs in branches, placing 'out of order' signs over cashpoint machines, and singing outside its headquarters at Canons Marsh, Bristol, while wearing a bath towel. After losing his case at Bristol County Court yesterday, Mr McGee said he was considering an appeal. Mr McGee had argued that the bank was liable for the collapse of his company, South West Piping Services, after introducing him to a consultant who was later convicted on fraud charges. Judge Raymond Jack QC said the manager of the bank's branch at Chippenham, Wiltshire, had introduced Mr McGee to the consultant, but had not recommended him. The judge said he accepted the manager's evidence that he warned Mr McGee about making inquiries about the consultant's source of capital. 'This warning appears to have fallen on deaf ears,' the judge said. During the hearing Mr McGee, of Lilley, near Newbury, Berkshire, who represented himself, told the judge his pipe-laying business collapsed because Lloyds recommended him to the consultant. He said that at the time his company employed 46 people and had a Pounds 3m a year turnover.</p>

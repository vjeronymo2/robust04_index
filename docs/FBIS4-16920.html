			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of political movements opposed to President  Johar Dudayev in Chechnya discussed how they might become  involved in dialogue with Russia in Moscow on Monday [18 April].    Interfax was informed by the opposition head quarters that  the movements concerned discussed how they might form one body  to represent both political parties and public and national  movements in Chechnya opposed to Dudayev's policies. The  stabilization of the situation inside the republic was also  discussed.    One option for dialogue with Russia was that proposed by  Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey  Shakhray. That involved a presidential instruction stating,  among other things, that the Russian government had been charged  with "holding consultations with representatives of state power  and of all political movements in the Chechen Republic" to find  a way out of the social and political tension which had arisen.    Asked by Interfax why the meeting had taken place in Moscow,  one opposition representative replied: "Not all opposition  leaders are able to travel to Chechnya because they are being  literally hunted down there."</p>

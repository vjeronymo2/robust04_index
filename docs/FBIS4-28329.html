			<p>BFN     [Text] The details of Japan's proposal for objective  criteria were disclosed on 4 June. The government will present  the proposal in Japan-U.S. framework trade talks on government  procurement, where the setting of objective criteria has been  discussed as a way to gauge the openness of markets.    The proposal says standards should be established to assess  efforts to increase the transparency of government procurement,  efforts by U.S. firms to enter Japanese markets, and their  competitiveness. It stresses that the competitiveness of  foreign firms should be judged by such criteria as the  difference between bidding and contract price, and not by a  comparison of a product's market share among the other G-7  nations, as the United States is demanding. The proposal also  says records of procurement in each fiscal year will be used as  a yardstick, but any increase over past figures should not be  taken to mean "there was no increase in the past in the  procurement of foreign products."    Japan and the United States agreed at unofficial  negotiations  in May on an "increase in competitive foreign products" as a  target for the Japanese Government's procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment. It was at the same  meeting that the two countries decided to resume bilateral trade  talks. The focal point of negotiations now is the assessment of  competitiveness.    Washington wants to use as a standard the share of foreign  products purchased by government procurement in other G-7  nations, but Japan has rejected this, saying: "This would lead  to the setting of numerical targets and violates the principle  of giving equal treatment to both domestic and foreign products."    The government compiled an outline of external economic  reforms in March. The outline says a successful bidder will be  determined on such points as quality and performance of the  product, as well as the bidding price for part of the government  procurement contracts valued at more than 800,000 SDRs (special  drawing rights; a currency used by the International Monetary  Fund -- about 152 million yen). The proposal Japan will present  to the United States says the assessment points and the  difference between a foreign firm's bid and the contract price  will help assess competitiveness. If the difference is big and  the assessment points are low, the company will be classified as  uncompetitive.    The proposal says the number of bids by foreign firms, the  number of consultations with them before bidding, and the number  of announcements of planned procurement bidding on the 10 most  expensive items in the medical equipment field for national  hospitals will serve to assess the transparency of government  procurement. The proposal notes that Japan will work to  increase transparency while urging U.S. firms to make efforts to  enter Japanese markets.</p>

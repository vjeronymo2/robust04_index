			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Protection of Women Workers Urged"] </F>   [Text] Improved working conditions are a top priority in  the protection of women's rights as China speeds toward  industrialization.    Despite overall improvement in the working environment for  women, problems have recurred, especially in sectors where there  is less State surveillance, such as some township, private  enterprises and joint ventures.    China now boasts one of the world's most complete legal  codes  regarding working conditions for women, according to Yang  Yuchen, official from the Women Workers Department under the  All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).    The code consists of the Regulation on Women's Labour  Security, the Regulation on Women's Labour Contraindication and  the Regulation on Women Workers' Health Care.    This network of regulations ensures the physical well-being  of women of all ages.    In its July survey of 2,000 enterprises, mostly State-owned,  in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the  ACFTU found 94.5 percent of the business have full- or part-time  persons hired to monitor the working conditions of employees.    Nearly 95 percent of the enterprises surveyed offered  routine  gynecological examinations for their female employees. Pregnant  workers in 87 percent of the enterprises received prenatal  examinations.    Breaks for breast-feeding and one or two-day menstruation  leaves for women on jobs requiring heavy labour were also  guaranteed in most enterprises.    However, the changing economic system often causes  infringements of the women's rights and safety.    Pregnant and lactating women workers tend to be the first to  be laid-off by employers obsessed with production efficiency.    Women at unprofitable and bankrupt enterprises cannot expect  to have hospitalization for child-birth paid by their employers.    Workers at many foreign-invested and private businesses are  facing an even tougher situation.    During the past couple years, the ACFTU has investigated  1,058 foreign-funded and township enterprises. Nearly half did  not grant child-birth leaves.    Exposure to dangerous substances, far beyond State mandated  limits, overtime work without compensatory pay, random salary  deductions and sexual harassment were also prevalent.    Some workers were even deprived of basic human rights.  Abuses included strip searches and even an instance in which a  woman suspected of theft being locked in a dog cage.    Some 59 of the 60 persons who died in a fire in a  Taiwan-invested textile factory in Fujian Province last month  were rural women.    To improve the situation, the ACFTU's Women Workers'  Committee suggests four measures:    -- Disseminate information regarding the State regulations  on  working conditions.    Rural workers, as well as the heads of many township  enterprises, are ignorant of the labour laws.    -- Strengthen the enforcement of existing labour  regulations.  In addition, the future Labour Law, which is expected to be  submitted to the legislature this year, should stress all the  enterprises within China must observe these laws.    -- Establish a labour security inspection organization that  caters to the needs of women workers.    -- Speed the foundation of a social security system for  child  birth, in which all of the society would shoulder the cost of  deliveries, not the individual enterprises.</p>

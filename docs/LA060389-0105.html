			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Noble Broadcast Group of San Diego and the Griffin Group of Los Angeles have  called off a purchase agreement announced in April whereby Griffin was to have  bought two Boston radio stations, WSSH-FM and WKKU-AM, from Noble for $39  million.  </P> <P> Noble said in a statement that it backed out of the Griffin deal after its  efforts to buy two radio networks in a separate transaction failed. Proceeds  from the sale of the stations to the group controlled by entertainer Merv  Griffin were to have been used to finance the purchase of the networks.  </P> <P> Noble, which bought the stations for a combined price of $22.2 million in 1986  and 1987, owns 18 radio stations. Griffin owns four radio stations.  </P></p>

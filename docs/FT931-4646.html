			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Barely afloat on a cruel sea: John Lloyd says that President Yeltsin has few options left as the power struggle in Moscow intensifies A special Congress of People's Deputies will convene today in Moscow, the latest in a series which has loomed over Russian political life over the past year. Like vast clouds, they roll in from the horizon, preceded by prophecies that this time the deluge they carry will swamp President Boris Yeltsin and his government. As Timothy Colton, head of Harvard's Research Centre, says in a recent book*, prediction 'is about as easy as judging a symphony by its opening bars: the ear picks out isolated chords and notes, melody and rhythm elude it'. Using this metaphor, we can say that the Russian symphony becomes more and more discordant, and no one is playing together. Mr Yeltsin and his government have few options left except to tough it out. Their mood is hard, though whether that hardness has depth, or is simply brittle, will be tested at today's Congress. Mr Yeltsin has threatened unspecific action of an authoritarian kind in order to inspire fear. If Congress calls his bluff, he either has to act decisively - or make yet another messy compromise, which will deepen and prolong the crisis. The parliament, both Congress and the Supreme Soviet, are increasingly opposed to the president and government. As Galina Starovoitova, the former presidential adviser, said recently: 'We are in the anomalous position of having the parliamentary majority in the opposition.' The centrists no longer think Mr Yeltsin recognises their concerns and can answer them. Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the Union of Industrialists and leader of the Renewal party, said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is not really interested in consensus and compromise. And if he does the kind of thing he seems to be threatening, then we are back to the Politburo and the Bolshevik era.' Among the harder opponents are a substantial proportion who are engaged on quasi - or fully - treasonable activities, such as conspiring with military officers to overthrow the state authorities. This goes on openly; communist and nationalist deputies demonstrate together for the resignation of the president to whom the latter have taken an oath of loyalty. They stand on platforms and threaten extra-parliamentary action to achieve this end. No move is made against them. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who remains in parliamentary terms a moderate, has little room left in which to make yet another of his famous last-ditch compromises. Mr Valery Zorkin, the chairman of the Constitutional Court who devised the last deal between parliament and the president, has since compromised his position by siding with Mr Khasbulatov in rejecting a referendum. Those loyal to Mr Yeltsin, such as Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor of Nizhny Novgorod, famous for his support of pro-market change in his region, say that the anti-presidential forces simply do not have the strength to stop the tide of change. 'In so far as they want to centralise power back in Moscow, they cannot do so except with guns. And I don't think they have enough. It has gone too far.' Still, in his celebration of the freedom given to (or taken by) him and other regional bosses, Mr Nemtsov implicitly admits the perceived weakness of the present administration: its inability to stop Russia falling apart. A chorus of domestic and foreign observers now likens Mr Yeltsin to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in mid-1991, floundering helplessly before a disintegrating state. And the people? The clamour that 'things were better before' grows ever louder. En route back from Nizhny, three separate strangers took time and trouble to stress how much they hated what was happening in their country. One, an Aeroflot flight attendant, said she knew that the lemonade she was serving was terrible - 'but it was better before. And now so expensive] If the quality was better it wouldn't be so bad'. Even in the privatised shops in Nizhny, the pride of Russia's reformers, there was grumbling about the political instability in the town which made the proprietors unsure that they would be allowed to transform themselves from payers of rent to real owners. A Moscow paper at the end of last week asked the citizens of Verdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg) - Mr Yeltsin's old home town and his former base as first secretary - how they felt about their favourite son. Sour, said most of them. The tenants of his old flat were just putting up a solid steel front door for protection and the neighbour was hanging out pictures of Stalin to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his death last Friday. All the polls show Mr Yeltsin's popularity down, and support for some kind of 'firm grip' ever increasing. 'I fear the Russian mass, aroused and pitiless,' said Mr Yeltsin last December, quoting Pushkin. Everyone fears that now, and they fear one another. The nation is teetering, its leaders struggling over the tiller as the storm breaks. The best of them, in and out of government, can hardly keep reform's momentum going. Mr Yeltsin's options are stark. He either makes a compromise with the parliament, or he decides to break with it. He has signalled a willingness to do both, keeping them guessing, alarming them with talk of decisive measures, soothing again with suggestions of compromises. He may not yet know himself which road to take. The compromise route could entail dropping the idea of a referendum and accepting a firm date for parliamentary and presidential elections. If this were the route taken, both constitutional and economic change would be further stymied. Mr Yeltsin could hardly allow his government to inflict the pain of real 'shock therapy' on a people whose vote he would soon be canvassing; parliament, under the present constitution, can obstruct any attempt to adopt a new constitution because it can block every legal step towards it. Having passed up the chance to reform a Soviet-era parliament and constitution while he retained the momentum and popularity to do so a year and a half ago, President Yeltsin is now enmeshed in the closed circles which the constitution prescribes. Mr Khasbulatov, the speaker, says only a parliamentary system can safeguard Russia's new-won freedom. Mr Yeltsin says that only an authoritative presidency can drive through reform and, by doing so, safeguard democracy. Behind the undoubted importance of the rival conceptions lies a naked power struggle. Compromise is only a pause between rounds, never an agreement in principle. But to break out of this would be fraught with risk. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, may have allowed it to be reported that the army wants 'decisive measures'. But he has been as contradictory as Mr Yeltsin, and must fear that, if he comes out in full support of the president, he may this time back the wrong horse. (General Grachev got his job by choosing to back Mr Yeltsin against the coup leaders in August 1991.) The bottom line of presidential rule, or the declaration of a state of emergency, is an army willing to shoot its own people. An army willing to do that must either be desperate, or believe that the power in whose name it is doing the shooting will survive to give it political exculpation in the longer term. Mr Yeltsin, unfortunately, is now seen as possibly being a short-term president - by both foreign and domestic observers. He needs to show he is in charge, and decisively in charge, in order to dispel that view. Yet to do so he risks everything. Today's Congress is - yet again - a critical moment for Russia, and for the world. * After the Soviet Union, ed Timothy Colton and Robert Levgold (W W Norton, New York)</p>

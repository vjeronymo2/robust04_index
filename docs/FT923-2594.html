			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Mitterrand to work on despite cancer FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand is suffering from prostate cancer. His doctors said yesterday it was not dangerous, but the announcement sparked fresh speculation about the 75-year-old president's political future. The Elysee palace said Mr Mitterrand was in no danger and would be able to carry out his full presidential duties as normal. Yesterday afternoon he left Cochin hospital in Paris, where he underwent surgery last week. Mr Mitterrand said he saw no reason to resign. 'I don't think that they gave me a lobotomy', he joked. He plans to vote in his former constituency, Chateau-Chinon in central France, in Sunday's referendum on European monetary and political union. Political commentators speculated that Mr Mitterrand's condition might attract a sympathy vote in the closely balanced weekend poll. However, it could also increase pressure on Mr Mitterrand to retire before his seven-year term ends in May 1995. The medical bulletin sent equity prices on the Paris stock market down 1.7 per cent by mid-morning, but shares recovered to end the day up 1.29 per cent when it became clear that Mr Mitterrand was in no danger. The president's decision to broadcast the details of his condition contrasts with the secrecy surrounding former president Georges Pompidou, whose staff revealed that he had cancer only a few days before he died in office in 1974. Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday appealed to French citizens to vote Yes on the Maastricht treaty out of economic self-interest. 'It is difficult to imagine how the French can abandon the advantages (of monetary union) when they have already paid the price for it in terms of budgetary and monetary rigour', he said in an interview to be published in today's Les Echos. Several Parisian bank and security house economists warned that a No vote would create heavy pressure on the franc and force up interest rates. Intense campaigning continued across France yesterday as politicians appealed to the large number of undecided voters - 29 per cent according to recent polls - who could swing the balance. Opinion polls showed a small majority in favour of the treaty, within their own statistical margin of error, in samples taken over the weekend. France and Maastricht, Page 3</p>

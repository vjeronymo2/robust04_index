			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (13): Hand luggage is really all you need - Traveller's Tale / Adele Biss talks to Michael Skapinker AS SOMEONE who began her business career in the 1960s taking coach-loads of tourists around Europe, travel has long been part of Ms Adele Biss's working life. Her subsequent career in public relations was largely spent representing companies in the tourist industry and travelling on their behalf. Her appointment as chairman of the British Tourist Authority last May has made one important difference to the way she travels: she no longer has to find her own way to hotels in foreign cities. There is always a local representative of the authority at the airport to meet her. She does not have to search for a piece of cardboard with her name on it; her photograph has been widely circulated since her appointment and staff usually recognise her. 'It's tremendous to see a welcoming face,' she says. 'The first thing they do is take my luggage off me.' Before she was appointed to her current job, she says, 'one of the worst things was to arrive in a city and wonder how I would get to the centre. It's uncomfortable coming tired off a flight and getting into a taxi whose driver doesn't speak English, even sometimes when it's in an English-speaking country. Heading the drive to attract tourists to the UK involves constant travel. 'It's Jo'burg one week, Cumbria the next,' she says. She makes a business trip, either in the UK or abroad, every 10 days or so. Although, as head of a tourist authority, sightseeing is part of her job, she tries to keep to a minimum the number of days she is away from home. 'I'm normally travelling alone and it's time away from my family,' she says. Like many veteran travellers, Ms Biss keeps her luggage to a minimum. A priority of many business travellers is to avoid waiting at the baggage carousel to see if your suitcase has successfully completed the same journey you have. Ms Biss says: 'I can travel for a long time on hand luggage. The trick if you are a woman is non-crease, light fabrics. I take a suit with different blouses, so that the bulk is in the suit and the variety is in the blouses.' Airports and hotels do not help women travellers much with their clothing, she says. There is usually an airport shop selling ties. Shops selling tights are far less common. Ms Biss says airlines have become better at looking after women travellers. She tries to travel on a UK carrier, which means she usually flies British Airways. 'They're quick to help with your bags and I like the fact that most of the cabin crews are mixed male and female.' Most hotels do not know how to look after women travellers, she says. 'There are the usual problems like being shown to a lousy seat in a restaurant. 'But I don't think the biggest problem business- women face when they travel is security or loneliness. It's having to keep up appearances. We need to able to get sewing kits. We need to be able to have a shampoo and a blow dry before a 9.30 am appointment.'</p>

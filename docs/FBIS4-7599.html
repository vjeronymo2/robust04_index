			<p>BFN     [Text] Reviewing the grave situation in the republic which  resulted from the continued aggression and ethnic cleansing on  the occupied territories of the republic, our country's  government, at today's session -- Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  presided -- adopted the following statement:    Two years have passed since the aggression on the sovereign  and internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The consequences of this aggression are over 200,000 killed and  some 1,250,000 refugees and displaced persons. Unfortunately,  the Serbian occupying forces are continuing the process of  ethnic cleansing with relentless intensity, particularly in the  areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, Stipovo, Jajce, and other parts  of the Bosnian Krajina.    The international public is acquainted with the dramatic  news  of murders and other forms of pressure against the non-Serbian  population and with preparations for the evacuation of the  remaining non-Serbian population. The government uses this  occasion to lodge an energetic protest because of the fact that  the international community is not showing a readiness to stop  the aggressor in this fascist endeavor.    We call on the United Nations, the European Union, and the  United States to do everything in their power to prevent the  conclusion of the process of ethnic cleansing and that all  citizens are granted the elementary conditions for safety of  property and personal safety, and are guaranteed all other human  liberties and rights established by international treaties and  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution. We call on all states,  signatories of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment  of the Crime of Genocide from 1949 to carry out immediately all  the obligations pursuant to this convention.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government believes that the  international community has failed to react to the  Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor's attacks at Gorazde and Bihac.  Since these attacks are attacks on protected areas as  stipulated by UN Resolution 824, the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government has taken measures with the goal of activating the  mechanisms of the UN Security Council in order to stop these  attacks and protect the civilian population. The government  maintains the position that the aggressor is calling into  question the continuation of peace negotiations and that the  international community is obliged to take all measures to stop  the attacks and create conditions for the continuation of the  peace process.</p>

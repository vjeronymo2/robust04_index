			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia today, perhaps  as never before, needs interaction between its economy and the  economies of neighboring states. It has sufficient resources at  its disposal to move swiftly out of economic crisis, and this is  the aim of its parliamentarians' daily work. State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin said this during a meeting with Ne'matollah  Izadi, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in the Russian Federation.    New legislation is being drawn up in the Duma which will  guarantee foreign investment in the Russian economy. In Ivan  Rybkin's opinion, this will permit the scope of traditional  Russo- Iranian cooperation to be extended.    The Iranian ambassador agreed with the State Duma chairman  about the need to extend bilateral contact in various spheres.  He noted that the Iranian leadership attaches great  significance to interaction between the two parliaments in  inter-state relations.    The State Duma press office reports that also today, the  State Duma chairman met Rogelio Montenegro, ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba in  Russia.    The two men held detailed discussions about the problem of  the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. Among other things, Ivan Rybkin  said that he considers as unnatural any sanctions implemented by  force or embargos in inter-state relations. "Such measures can  only be justified if there are extraordinary reasons for them,"  he stressed.</p>

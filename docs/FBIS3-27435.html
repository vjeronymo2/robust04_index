For  this purpose, the State General Institute of Animal and Plant  Quarantine and the Animal and the Plant Health Inspection  Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently signed  the "Plant Hygiene Conditions for the Export to China of Apples  From Washington State in the United States."    In recent years, domestic demands for imported fruit have  been growing steadily. To enhance bilateral trade between China  and the United States and to meet the demands of the domestic  market, China's animal and plant quarantine organ has, on the  basis of widely collected relevant information, formed a  specific group to carry out a study of the destructive nature of  insect pests which might be present in apples imported from the  United States. Based on their scientific analysis, experts hold  that Washington state is not included in the area infested by  the Mediterranean fruit fly, and that apples produced by this  state may be exported to China with conditions. According to  the agreement signed between China and the United States  governing the plant-hygiene condition of apples to be imported  from Washington state, the apples to be exported to China must  be produced by orchards designated by the Chinese State General  Institute of Animal and Plant Quarantine, and must be packed,  frozen, and stored by designated factories. During the process  of packing and prior to export, they must be strictly inspected  by the U.S. animal and plant quarantine organ and it must be  guaranteed that they meet the quarantine requirements as imposed  by China. Moreover, upon their arrival in China, the apples  exported to China must enter the country through designated  ports and must be quarantined and cleared by a Chinese animal  and plant quarantine organ before they are allowed to be put on  sale.    The Mediterranean fruit fly is a destructive pest to fruit,  one from which China is free. To prevent it from entering  China, and to safeguard China's fruit production, China has  banned the import of fruit from the United States and other  countries affected by the pest. The current lifting of the ban  is confined to apples produced by Washington state and shipped  directly to China.</p>

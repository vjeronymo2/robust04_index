			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 11-YEAR WAIT, IT'S SHOW TIME FOR PLAINTIFF-ATTORNEYS  </P> <P> The jury in San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter's courtroom was  away for a five-minute recess. The attorneys were milling by their tables when  Schacter entered, walked to his bench and called them back by spreading his  arms wide and bellowing: "Show time!"  </P> <P> Justice was not being mocked. It was working. Slowly, anonymously,  good-naturedly and, above all, patiently.  </P> <P> Inside Schacter's small, modern, wood-paneled courtroom, four South Los Angeles  residents were finally going to trial against a huge financial institution  after spending 11 years squabbling about home improvement loans that went sour.  </P> <P> For the plaintiffs -- John and Shirley Thymes and Charles and Cora Brown -- it  should have been a relieving, cathartic experience. Instead it was, as Cora  Brown put it, "a nightmare."  </P> <P> It was a nightmare because the Thymeses and the Browns wound up acting as their  own attorneys, a challenge that for all its quixotic appeal is almost never  undertaken in a civil trial of this complexity, involving 90 court exhibits and  a tangled chronology that weaved through loan applications, liens, job  estimates, phone calls and possibly forged signatures.  </P> <P> Over the course of two weeks, the Thymeses and the Browns would put everyone in  Schacter's courtroom -- including themselves -- to a severe test. By the end,  several jurors would conclude that if they were ever asked to serve in another  of these so-called pro per cases, they would ask to be excused. Watching laymen  try to be lawyers was simply too exhausting, they said.  </P> <P> The Thymeses and the Browns, who first filed their lawsuit against Beverly  Hills-based Gibraltar Savings in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1980, hadn't  planned it this way. But at the last minute their attorney -- one of several  they had hired over the years -- dropped out. After waiting this long for their  day in court, they simply didn't want to wait any longer. They swallowed hard  and went it alone.  </P> <P> And so one day John Thymes, churning with visible anxiety, wearing a dark  patterned sport coat entirely too flashy for a lawyer, was examining a witness  he'd called the day before.  </P> <P> It was his wife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Know Too Much  </P> <P> He walked up to the witness stand and began to question Shirley Thymes about a  Gibraltar loan document. Their conversation was awkward. John Thymes runs a  secretarial service store in the Crenshaw District and has frequently been in  courtrooms, and Shirley Thymes once planned to go to law school, but the couple  had become so obsessed with the particulars of their lawsuit that to jurors  their exchanges were often impenetrable. They simply know too much for their  own good.  </P> <P> And then there was the matter of posture. John Thymes had his back to the jury.  </P> <P> "Mr. Thymes," Schacter said, "when you stand there, half the jury can't see or  hear you. It looks good in movies. . . ."  </P> <P> And with that Schacter began to explain to all concerned why it looks good in  movies, how the camera's desire to focus on the attorney-witness angle ignores  the distance that real-life lawyers normally maintain so that they can  simultaneously play to the jury.  </P> <P> This was how Schacter played two roles -- attorney and judge -- during the  trial.  </P> <P> A kindly, balding man in his 40s who prides himself on courtroom civility,  Schacter had inherited this case from downtown because there were no courts  available. He hadn't read the file. He didn't know the background. Yet he found  himself having to painstakingly regulate the organization and dispensing of  hundreds of tiny facts for the benefit of the plaintiffs, separating what they  considered truth from what the law considers proof.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basic Issue  </P> <P> The basic issue in the trial was the contention that Gibraltar -- which has  suffered severe financial losses in recent years and is now in a government  conservatorship -- should be held financially responsible for the conduct of an  independent home-repair contractor. According to state regulators, the  contractor, Reinaldo Gilbert, owner of Mr. Fix-It, swindled dozens of residents  and persuaded most of them to finance their repairs through Gibraltar.  </P> <P> In the last decade, Gibraltar had reached financial settlements with numerous  families who borrowed money for jobs performed by Mr. Fix-It, but no settlement  had been offered to the Thymeses. Gibraltar contended that it had paid for  completion of work that Mr. Fix-It left undone. Gibraltar offered a $135,000  settlement to the Browns, but the Browns chose to go to trial. Like the  Thymeses, they believed they could obtain significant damages for pain and  suffering in court.  </P> <P> Gilbert was enjoined from doing further business a decade ago and was no longer  a defendant by the time the lawsuit went to trial. The challenge for the  Thymeses and the Browns was to show that Gibraltar was at least indirectly  responsible for Gilbert's misdeeds.  </P> <P> To do this, they claimed that a former Gibraltar loan agent, Mike Garner, had  continually vouched for Gilbert even after it became evident that Gilbert was  not going to finish the jobs he started.  </P> <P> John Thymes made a stab at questioning Garner, but Schacter quickly broke in.  Thymes was not being focused enough. His interrogation lacked sequence. "The  dangerous thing when you're inside your own case," the judge had observed  earlier outside of the courtroom, "is that everything is important to you,  every piece of paper you fought for."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Asks Questions  </P> <P> So Schacter began to pepper Garner with inquiries about if and when he had met  Gilbert, whether he had vouched for him, whether he had ever told anyone that  Gilbert -- who routinely provided Gibraltar loan application forms to his  clients -- worked for the financial institution.  </P> <P> Schacter routinely did this. He explained procedure. He made sure pieces of  evidence were properly numbered. He stopped the proceedings so that Shirley  Thymes could leave the witness stand to put in her hearing aid. Outside the  jury's presence he gently nagged Mrs. Thymes to pay more attention to her  husband so she wouldn't repeat questions when it was her turn to question  witnesses.  </P> <P> Schacter could have required the Thymeses and Browns to designate one member of  their party as counsel, but he decided against it. All four could ask questions  and call witnesses.  </P> <P> "Why shouldn't they have their day in court?" he said over lunch one day. "I  figure this thing's been long enough in the system. There's no way when this is  over they won't be able to say they had their day in court."  </P> <P> There were seven tedious days of trial and two days of jury deliberation. On  Thursday morning John Thymes, dressed and waiting, received a phone call at his  home on 107th Street, a place that remains a hodgepodge from work that was done  and re-done improperly in 1977. The call was from the court. The jury was  ready.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Feel Satisfied'  </P> <P> The two couples drove to San Fernando. John Thymes was in such a hurry he  forgot his coat.  </P> <P> "I feel satisfied," Shirley Thymes said as she waited in court. "Regardless of  which way it goes."  </P> <P> The jurors came in. The clerk read their verdict. By a 9-3 margin the jury  determined that Gibraltar Savings had recklessly made false representations  with intent to defraud. The Thymeses and the Browns had won.  </P> <P> But not very much.  </P> <P> The jury ordered Gibraltar to pay the Thymeses $21,182 and the Browns $20,000.  </P> <P> The homeowners were crestfallen. Over the last decade, they estimated that they  had spent more than $50,000 on lawyers alone. "No way, no way," said Charles  Brown, a warehouse worker, when asked if he was satisfied.  </P> <P> One of Gibraltar's two attorneys, Sharon Mason, was, as she said with a smile,  "pleased."  </P> <P> Like any other attorney, John Thymes talked casually with the jurors in the  courtroom later. Unlike a professional attorney, he did not hide his anguished  belief that the jury had simply not understood the facts.  </P> <P> Several sympathetic jurors told him he was lucky to have gotten as much money  as he did.  </P> <P> "John," one of them said, "what you have to understand is that you had no  proof."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Appeal  </P> <P> John Thymes said he would probably appeal and try to find an attorney to  represent him.  </P> <P> Another juror, Jack Lasnik, a Chatsworth resident, was walking out of the  courtroom when he stopped a reporter to mention how impressed he was by Judge  Schacter.  </P> <P> "He was one of the fairest individuals I've ever met," Lasnik said.  </P> <P> "He was overall fair," Shirley Thymes said. "He didn't do us any special favors  because we were pro per."  </P> <P> "The most important factor is to keep everybody calm," Schacter had said  privately the week before. "If I get impatient, everybody's going to get  impatient."  </P> <P> Of course, he added, this trial was not his highest display of patience. If you  wanted to see that you'd have to come back Friday and watch him handle the San  Fernando Superior Court's law and motion calendar.  </P> <P> "That's where I deal with a hundred lawyers," he smiled.  </P></p>

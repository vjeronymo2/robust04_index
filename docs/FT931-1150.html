			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Property profit helps to keep Appleyard Pounds 1.7m in the black PROFITS OF Pounds 2.4m on a property deal and the sale of spare advanced corporation tax capacity kept Appleyard Group, the motor dealer, in the black last year when pre-tax profit slipped from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 1.71m. The group halved its final dividend to 2.6p, making a total of 5.2p (7.8p), which was not covered by earnings of 2.3p (2.5p). After dipping into reserves for the second year running, the retained loss was Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 2.49m). Turnover fell to Pounds 305m (Pounds 390m) reflecting the sale of Ford dealerships and petrol stations in 1991. Mr John Atkin, business development director, said ongoing sales were slightly down. Operating profit declined to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 5.81m) including property profits of Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.58m). Ian Skelly, bought for Pounds 18.3m in 1989, incurred losses. Mr Atkin said it had run out of VW Golfs early in August, the crucial selling month. He blamed the importer, which was then Lonrho. The manufacturer has since bought out the agreement. Skelly's large sites had also been particularly vulnerable to recession. A hundred jobs had been shed and other overheads cut. The car leasing joint venture with Barclays Bank contributed Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 530,000), although this included Pounds 1.01m from the sale of spare ACT capacity. Net debt fell to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 14.1m) and interest costs came down to Pounds 3.61m (Pounds 4.54m). The group also has off balance sheet borrowings in the leasing joint venture. Appleyard also announced the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Reading for Pounds 2.3m. This would be paid for by a Pounds 4.15m sale and leaseback deal on sites at Gateshead and Oxford.</p>

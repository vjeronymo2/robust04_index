			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hochtief barred from lifting Holzmann stake Hochtief, one of Germany's largest construction companies, will not be allowed to increase its stake in Philipp Holzmann, its main domestic competitor, after a preliminary ruling yesterday by the federal cartel office in Berlin. Hochtief, which is seeking to expand its domestic market share and international profile, said it would examine the decision and possibly challenge it by January 10, the deadline set by the cartel authorities before they make their final ruling on January 16. It is expected to remain unchanged. Holzmann, Germany's biggest construction company, expressed relief at the decision. It had been uneasy about the possibility of Hochtief's taking a majority stake. 'The cartel office held the trump card, and we played it,' Holzmann said. Although the largest two construction companies in Germany, together they account for only about 3 per cent of the total market. However, they enjoy a dominant market position in their specialist area, large industrial projects. Mr Jurgen Kiecker of the cartel office said the increased stake by Hochtief in Holzmann would have tightened both companies' hold on the sector. He said the decision was made after examining contracts worth DM50m (Dollars 31.7m) or more. 'Between 1990 and October 1994, Hochtief and Holzmann had 30 per cent of the 530 contracts of this size or over. Any merger would hinder competition,' Mr Kiecker said. Hochtief had intended to increase its current 20 per cent holding in Holzmann to 30 per cent through the acquisition of a 10 per cent stake owned by BfG, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. BfG acquired that stake last year. Hochtief was also considering buying 5 per cent owned by Commerzbank. Deutsche Bank remains Holzmann's largest shareholder with 25.9 per cent, although recent reports indicate it wants to reduce that stake to 10 per cent. Hochtief last year had turnover of DM8bn, with foreign sales accounting for 20 per cent, and net earnings of DM122m. Holzmann reported larger turnover, of DM12.4bn, but lower earnings of DM106m. RWE, Germany's largest electricity company, owns 56 per cent of Hochtief.</p>

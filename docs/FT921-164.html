			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Tax high, so is spending Sir, In 1979 the Conservative manifesto said: 'The state takes too much of the nation's income; its share must be steadily reduced.' Taxes in total took 45 per cent of national income in 1979; they exceeded 50 per cent between 1981 and 1986; and the latest estimate for 1991-92 is 47 per cent. Quoted 'official figures' of around 36 per cent are far too low: they relate to gross domestic product, not to national income. The fact is that all three main political parties in Britain are high-tax parties. Since they are all now high-borrowing parties too, this suggests that government spending is far too high.

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / New talks revive hopes for rail peace Hopes of a settlement to the four-week-old signal workers' strike rose last night after it emerged that Railtrack and the RMT Transport Union are to resume talks at the conciliation service Acas today. The two sides are to meet this afternoon at the invitation of Acas after Railtrack provided 'additional information' to RMT last Friday. Railtrack said: 'We are glad they are considering our package. If all goes well this could prevent next Wednesday's strike.' But RMT said the talks were complex and the talks at Acas could only be a start to more detailed discussions. A spokesman said: 'We have been invited to resume our search for a negotiated settlement and we are happy to do so but I do not think the situation is any less difficult.' 'I do not realistically think we can get an agreement on a package of this nature at Acas. It is too complex. The detail has to be negotiated in a sensible way.' Railtrack's most recent offer presented as a 6 per cent increase was in fact worth 3 per cent on basic rates of pay, RMT said. RMT said the additional information provided by Railtrack would not have a material impact on the negotiations and consisted solely of details of paybill costs requested earlier by the union. RMT said that an attempt by Railtrack to contact the union's members directly by letter last week had failed to change the minds of signal workers. Four days have been lost to strikes over the past month although Railtrack has managed to increase the number of routes operating on each occasion. Last Wednesday it provided enough signal boxes to allow the running of between 1,700 and 1,750 trains. The union has threatened to introduce two-day stoppages each week.</p>

Gavrileva,  under the rubric "Let Us Be Specific": "Proceeding Toward the  Elections. Why Was the Edict Not Accepted for Execution?"]    [Text] Yesterday KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA published the Decree  of the Central Electoral Commission "On the Edict of the  President of the Republic of Crimea `On Holding a Poll of  Republic of Crimea Citizens.'" We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of  the commission, to comment on the situation.    [Gavrileva] Viktor Vladimirovich, in its decree the Central  Electoral Commission actually refused to execute this edict of  the president. Please explain to us the reason for the  appearance of the decree; after all, this is direct disobedience  of the authority of the president!    [Alsufyev] This has to do with the fact that the edict of  the  president faced the Central Electoral Commission with a choice  between accepting the demand to violate the law and incurring  the displeasure of the president's team. Despite the fact that a  great variety of political forces are represented on our  commission, the decision was made unanimously--to stick to the  position of the law.    Please note Point 4 of the edict in which the president  obligated the Central Electoral Commission to conduct the poll  simultaneously with the elections. However, the point is that  the Central Electoral Commission is not by any means  subordinated to the executive authorities in some way, and a  demand, even by the president, does not and cannot entail legal  consequences in the form of its execution. Since in keeping with  the law the commission is the supreme institution for organizing  and holding elections of deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the  Crimea, the commission reports solely to the Supreme Soviet of  the Crimea, and only on the basis of its decision does the  commission have the legal authority to take measures that do not  fall within its jurisdiction.    Furthermore, the edict provides for appointing  "representatives of the president" to electoral commissions.  This amounts to a direct violation of the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea and electoral legislation. Had this happened,  it would have been grounds to consider the election of deputies  invalid.    Therefore, it is not some kind of disobedience to the  supreme  official that is at issue but rather the need to take measures  to uphold the law.    Believe me, the commission has no dearth of problems other  than becoming involved in a conflict with the presidential  authority. The Crimea is now holding elections which are without  parallel in history in terms of complexity. While it is the  Central Electoral Commission with regard to 66 single-seat  electoral districts, our commission at the same time exercises  the powers of a district commission in the multiple-seat  electoral district in which the Crimea elects deputies under the  proportional system from four political parties and one  electoral bloc. At the same time, our commission must operate in  the mode of five district electoral commissions for national  electoral districts. The lot of district commissions is even  more difficult: They also are commissions for elections to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine at the same time.    [Gavrileva] Pardon me, but a document such as this edict  could not have appeared without prior coordination with the  Central Electoral Commission. Where were you before?    [Alsufyev] The edict came as a complete surprise to us. We  saw the text as late as 11 March in the newspapers. I think that  a realistic scenario for solving the emergent problem which  would comply with legal norms would have been quite possible.  The Central Electoral Commission always provides the necessary  consultative assistance benevolently. We use professional  lawyers from the Ministry of Justice of the Crimea and the state  law department of the Supreme Soviet for such efforts. If  necessary, we verify our decisions with the prosecutor's office  and the Supreme Court of the Crimea, that is to say, we do  everything possible to strictly uphold the law. However, in this  case, a consultation with us was apparently not needed.    [Gavrileva] Incidentally, on the day the edict was  published,  readers called our editorial office requesting that the meaning  of some of provisions be clarified. Perhaps the period of 16  days is too short, after all: It turns out that the voter (that  is, the citizen taking part in the poll) is being deliberately  faced with a situation in which he is simply deprived of an  opportunity to grasp the essence of the questions and to make a  determination concerning his choice....    [Alsufyev] You are right. I would like to not assess the  edict from the standpoint of the content of the questions.  However, the time factor is very significant indeed. You will  agree that it is necessary to be in possession of a certain  volume of legal information in order to respond to each question  intelligently. Time is needed to this end, and a lot of it.    At present, space in newspapers and air time are the main  point: The mass media are overburdened with articles related to  elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and the Supreme  Council of Ukraine to begin with. We have received a great many  complaints from candidates for deputy about the absence of an  opportunity to use the mass media because of the superimposition  of the two election campaigns. And what if we also include the  poll, with its complex questions?    You will agree that there is indeed no real opportunity to  ensure a deliberate choice and a free expression of the will of  citizens within this period of time.    [Gavrileva] Indeed, technically it is very difficult to do  this on 27 March. What is to be done next?    [Alsufyev] There is only one way out: The president should  correlate his intentions with the requirements of the law.</p>

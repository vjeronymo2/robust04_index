			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest confirms float plan DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products arm of the Milk Marketing Board, has confirmed its plan to float early next year. It made the announcement when reporting a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 24.6m to Pounds 28.2m for the year to March 31, after exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 20.9m). Mr Geoffrey John, chairman, said that there were still many unknowns in the flotation and the industry itself was undergoing far-reaching change. He said it was too early to be precise about the shareholder structure after the flotation, but that dairy farmers could hold about 70 per cent of the capital. The farmers will receive shares representing the 'free reserves' of the MMB, worth on average Pounds 8,000 per farmer, and will be offered shares or cash to settle their entitlement to the MMB's 'rolling fund', totalling about Pounds 60m. Dairy Crest also plans to raise new money and the group's market capitalisation could be about Pounds 250m. Schroders and Hoare Govett will be handling the flotation. Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said that Dairy Crest had achieved a great deal but still had much to do to succeed in the 'new world'. He said: 'We have no illusions as to the nature of the challenge that awaits us.' He said that when the MMB was abolished next year, Dairy Crest's first duty would be 'to buy milk on a very competitive basis'. He added that Dairy Crest was not committed to buying from Milk Marque, the milk buying co-operative which the MMB is planning as its successor. Group turnover was unchanged at Pounds 1.16bn, although Dairy Crest, which is the buyer of last resort under the existing milk scheme, had bought 5.5 per cent less milk as milk quotas reduced production. Prices of milk for manufacture rose 16 per cent. Operating profits rose from Pounds 59.2m to Pounds 62.2m, with margins up from 5.6 to 6 per cent. Greater operating efficiencies were being achieved, Mr Houliston said. Staff had been reduced by 1,300 during the year, and by 30 per cent over the last three years. Capital spending was running at about Pounds 30m a year. Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 8.3m, with about Pounds 1m of the fall coming from lower interest rates and the rest from the reduction in net debt from Pounds 101.1m to Pounds 69.5m. The company also announced a number of board appointments including Mr Graham Fish, as managing director of the dairies business. Five non-executive directors, with diary or commercial experience, will be appointed on August 1 in preparation for the float. They are Mr Richard Fletcher, an MMB member, Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman of Hays, Mr Thomas Hugh Jones, an MMB member, Mr Paul Lewis, deputy chairman and finance director of Tate &amp; Lyle, and Mr William Madders, a special MMB member.</p>

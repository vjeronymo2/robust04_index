			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: POLLUTION RESEARCH &amp; CONTROL MAY BE SOLD  </P> <P> Pollution Research &amp; Control Corp., a Glendale company that makes  air-quality monitoring devices, said it is considering offers to buy the  company. The company declined to name any of the potential buyers, but said it  had "entered into preliminary discussions" with them.  </P> <P> Pollution Research also announced that it would report that sales of its  primary product, devices for measuring ambient air pollution, would show a  "significant decline" in the fourth quarter that ended June 30. Pollution  Research attributed the drop in sales to lower than expected demand for the  devices in the United States and Korea.  </P> <P> In addition, Pollution Research said that as a cost-cutting measure, it will  sell 75% of its Air Instruments &amp; Measurement subsidiary to its management  in exchange for royalties from the unit's sales. Albert E. Gosselin Jr., chief  executive officer of Pollution Research, said AIM's management in turn would  probably sell the unit.  </P></p>

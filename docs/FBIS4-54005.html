			<p>BFN     [Text] On 23 May, the opposition Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ), Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Seiun  [parliamentary] group agreed to set up the Policy Study Council  (headed by Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the SDPJ Policy  Board], a consultative body attended by legislators in charge of  policy affairs in the two parties and the parliamentary group,  and held the council's first session in the Diet building that  day. During the session, the SDPJ, Sakigake, and Seiun agreed  to create three panels on "welfare, administrative reform, and  tax system reform"; "security"; and "agriculture." They also  agreed to draw up plans for overhauling the current tax system  by the end of June. The "Minshu no Arashi" [Storm of  Democracy], a House of Representatives parliamentary group  organized by legislators who broke away from the Japan New  Party, is expected to join the Policy Study Council. The SDPJ,  Sakigake, and Seiun intend to work out the plans for overhauling  the current tax system in line with a set of policy agreements  concluded among the ruling coalition parties; the plans are  likely to call for abolishing or revamping the consumption tax  and raising indirect taxes. The plans to be worked out by the  two parties and Seiun, which hold the deciding vote in the Diet,  are likely to have a decisive impact on the tax system reform's  future.    On 23 May, the "Consultative Council on Welfare,  Administrative Reform, and Tax System Reform" [headed by Shoichi  Ide, chairman of the Sakigake General Council] held its first  session in the Diet building to decide that: 1) two project  teams on "welfare" and "administration and finance" will be  organized; 2) the council will hold discussion from the position  of salary earners, consumers, and women; and 3) legislators from  the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party will be allowed to attend the council as  observers. At the session, the council made clear its position  of attaching importance to "administrative reform" by deciding  to draw up plans for reforming administration and finances as  part of efforts to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ,  Sakigake, and Seiun intend to press the government and the  ruling coalition parties to reform the current tax system by  speedily drawing up plans for overhauling the current tax system  in parallel with debates by the Tax System Reform Consultative  Council of the ruling coalition parties.</p>

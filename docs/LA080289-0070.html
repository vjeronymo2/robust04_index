			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLISH COMMUNISTS' MAIN ALLIES BALK ON NEW LEADER  </P> <P> The nomination of Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for premier ran into serious trouble in  the Polish National Assembly on Tuesday as the Communist Party's key coalition  partners rebelled, expressing no support for him.  </P> <P> A vote on Kiszczak's candidacy had been expected Tuesday but was put off to  today after the United Peasants' Party, for years a reliable Communist ally,  emerged from a meeting with no announcement on how the party would cast its 76  votes, which are essential if Kiszczak, now interior minister, is to be  elected.  </P> <P> The Communist parliamentary group, and its newly rebellious allies, were  meeting late into the night Tuesday in an attempt either to salvage Kiszczak's  candidacy or come up with an alternative.  </P> <P> Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the outgoing premier, left a  hospital bed to join the meeting. He was taken to the hospital, aides said,  after feeling faint Tuesday morning at an anniversary observance of the Warsaw  Uprising in World War II.  </P> <P> The continuing fracas of Polish politics has brought a steady battering to the  Communists, who had hoped that bringing the Solidarity opposition into the  National Assembly, through partially free elections, would buy time to shore  itself up and deal with the country's crisis-ridden economy.  </P> <P> Instead, the Communists have taken on several down-to-the-wire battles,  including a one-vote margin in Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's election as president  by the National Assembly, and now the apparent rejection of Jaruzelski's choice  for premier -- possibly the most blatant parliamentary defiance of a Communist  leader in East Bloc history.  </P> <P> It is noteworthy that much of the recent Communist embarrassment has stemmed  not directly from the opposition, but from within the once tightly controlled  ranks of Communist allies.  </P> <P> Solidarity, controlling 161 votes in the Sejm, as the lower house is known, has  said it will vote against Kiszczak. That decision seemed to be sealed Tuesday  with a one-line statement issued by Lech Walesa saying: "I am against Gen.  Kiszczak's candidacy for premier."  </P> <P> The Communists hold 173 seats in the Sejm and must rely on their coalition  partners, the Peasants, the Democratic Party and a small group of pro-Communist  Catholics, if they are to put their candidate across.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gasping for Air  </P> <P> Both the Peasants and Democrats have roots going back to prewar Poland. Both  parties were leftist in their original orientation and, after being first  suppressed by the Communists after World War II, they were re-formed and  essentially subsumed by the Communists, who wanted a pliant illusion of a  multi-party "national front" system. Now, as the Communists gasp for air like  beached fish, both parties have been eager to distance themselves from their  domineering partners in order to stake out a future for in the rapidly shifting  political landscape.  </P> <P> Aleksander Benkowski, the Peasants' parliamentary leader, told reporters that  perhaps as many as 60 members of his own party were rebelling against Kiszczak.  Other sources said up to 12 Communists had decided to vote against him.  </P> <P> The Peasants' rebellion suggests the possibility of a Solidarity-Peasant Party  alliance, which would give Solidarity a 237-223 margin in the Sejm -- and  possibly 28 votes more if the Democratic Party joined in, which seems likely.  Solidarity already controls the Senate, the upper house of the National  Assembly, 99 to 1.  </P> <P> Such an alliance would lead to increased pressure for a Solidarity government,  although some key Solidarity leaders have resisted the idea in the past and the  Communist authorities could be thrown into an even deeper crisis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upset Neighbors  </P> <P> Jaruzelski told Solidarity lawmakers last week that Poland's Communist  neighbors -- the Soviet Union, East Germany and Czechoslovakia -- would be  deeply upset with a non-Communist, opposition government running Poland.  </P> <P> At a meeting of Solidarity lawmakers, convened while the Communist coalition  went into its closed-door emergency session, longtime union activist Jan  Litynski said the Peasants Party leadership was about to propose a  Solidarity-led government, with parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek as  premier and Kazimierz Olesiak as first deputy premier.  </P> <P> "The Communist coalition has collapsed after 40 years in power," Litynski said,  adding that the Peasants Party already had proposed a coalition with  Solidarity.  </P> <P> "Such a coalition would have a majority in Parliament," Litynski said, "so the  last argument against a Solidarity-led government -- that we lack a majority --  falls."  </P> <P> While the vote on Kiszczak was delayed, the National Assembly continued debate  on the Polish economy, and the nation's shoppers gazed with dismay at newly  raised food prices -- that is, in the few shops where food had not been cleaned  out in anticipation of the government's "marketization" plan.  </P> <P> Designed to replenish food store shelves by paying more to farm producers, the  government's plan sent meat prices skyrocketing. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of ham  went from 1,600 zlotys ($1.92) to 6,000 ($7.22), an increase of 275%. Pork went  up 288%. Prices of sugar, flour and butter increased by up to 56%.  </P> <P> Newspapers reported that sugar, salt, flour, butter and cheese were unavailable  in large cities such as Wroclaw, Krakow, Lodz and Poznan.  </P> <P> The parliamentary debate on the economy was triggered by a vote to accept  Rakowski's resignation as premier. While Rakowski was resting in the hospital,  his marketization plan was defended by his deputy, Ireneusz Sekula, who claimed  that "the ship of the Polish economy is right on course."  </P> <P> "It seems to me that the situation is exactly the opposite," countered  Solidarity deputy Ryszard Bugaj. "This ship is sinking."  </P> <P> Another Solidarity deputy, Jan Furtak, said the price rises were "another sign  of the authorities' arrogance" and argued that state claims of launching a free  market are contradicted by government procurers who dominate the meat  processing industry and are free to set any price they choose.  </P></p>

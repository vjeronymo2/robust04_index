			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Hedge funds put G10 in quandary: The world's leading central banks find one class of investment group almost beyond the reach of their influence On the face of it, the Group of Ten central bankers gathered in Basle today to discuss the state of global financial markets might as well not waste their breath on hedge funds. It is not only hard to define which investment funds fall into this category, but also bankers' powers to sway them are extremely weak. Central banks do not have the direct control over hedge funds that most of them do over banks. The funds - although mostly managed in the US - tend to be based offshore and are not supervised by bank or securities regulators. Nonetheless, the G10 central bankers have three reasons to be worried about these funds. First, they appear to have added to volatility by selling as bets on currency, securities markets and derivatives went wrong. Second, heavy losses could make funds default on loans from banks. Third, funds that could not settle contracts might spark off a chain reaction affecting financial systems. This combination of concern, and the inability to do much to address it, may well disquiet central bankers. The question is whether they will either try to create regulations to allow them to intervene directly, or try to exert greater indirect influence on hedge funds through supervised banks. The first approach carries both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it is hard to draw a boundary between hedge funds and other funds that manage institutional and private client money. Any change in regulations would be complex and would have to be co-ordinated across borders. The theoretical problem is that hedge funds appear to be doing nothing wrong. Leveraging risk to make big gains in the short term, while risking sharp losses, is a common investment strategy. Regulating funds to prevent a particular trade-off between risk and reward would be heavily dirigiste. This leaves central banks with the possibility of exerting indirect influence through banks. There is a promising start in that funds often leverage their capital by buying securities and derivatives in tranches, then borrowing more cash against the positions to make further purchases. This exposes banks to credit risk, a legitimate concern of supervisors. Banks hold securities of the same value as the cash they lend, with an extra margin of perhaps 5 per cent to cover risk. Most mark the value of the securities to market each day to ensure that they are not over-exposed. These activities are being examined by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, although a director of one large UK bank says that most of such lending is done in the US. Like other corporate lending, there has been some pressure on margins as banks compete for business amid weak demand for loans. One New York bank, which says that it only trades with hedge funds in foreign exchange markets, claims it requires a margin of 5 per cent, but that others will trade at lower margins. 'Some (margins) just aren't big enough to cover the daily swings you get in today's markets,' a banker says. Volatile markets can eat up margins. Mr John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, says that positions can move substantially overnight. 'You have to be aware if a fund is heading south quickly - where is the next margin call going to come from?' says one bank's head of risk management. Banks find it hard to assess credit risk accurately because hedge funds are not credit rated, and hold a complex range of financial contracts. Some funds also refuse to provide net asset valuations, an essential tool for banks assessing the overall health of funds as financial counterparties. In spite of such problems, the most recent proposals on market risk by international bank supervisors could require banks to set aside less capital against hedge fund exposures. At the moment, all reductions in the value of securities held against loans to funds count as potential losses to banks. This would change under the netting proposals issued by banking supervisors last year along with proposals on market risks. Commercial banks should in future be allowed to net off losses in the market value of securities against the extra cash margin deposited with them by hedge funds. Bankers argue that credit risks can be exaggerated. Banks can call for extra margin payments if securities fall in value sharply, and lose only if funds fail. 'This is not a credit quality issue,' one banker says. 'It is to do with what happens to markets if funds all head for the exit at once.' They also argue that they have been dragged into the debate illogically. 'Regulation only affects people who are easily regulated, and that usually means us,' a banker says. Yet no matter how clumsy the weapon, it may be the only one available if today's meeting opts to crack down on hedge funds.</p>

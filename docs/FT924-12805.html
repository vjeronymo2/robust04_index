			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Recession blamed for Japanese bankruptcy THE Japanese downturn has claimed its second bankruptcy victim among listed companies this year, after Daiichi Spinning, the textile group filed for court protection with liabilities of about Y100bn (Dollars 834m). The Daiichi bankruptcy follows that of Lec, a Tokyo-based manufacturer of household sundries. Meanwhile, the Osaka Stock Exchange, where Daiichi is listed on the second section, has launched an investigation into insider trading in its shares last week after an unusual surge in trading. The bankruptcy of even a medium-sized listed company in Japan suggests the downturn is creating growing strains in relations between banks and industrial clients. Traditionally, banks have helped industrial customers through downturns in demand by providing renewed credit. However, many banks have been hit themselves by a rapid growth in non-performing loans on property lending. Some may now be taking a tougher approach to troubled industrial clients. Daiichi's main bank is Sakura Bank. Daiichi's filing for court protection under corporate rehabilitation law, the Japanese equivalent of the US Chapter 11 procedures, marks the end to a desperate financial struggle to stave off bankruptcy.</p>

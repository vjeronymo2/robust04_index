			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Technology fails to impress bank customers Consumers show a marked lack of enthusiasm for technological developments such as home banking, and appear to prefer conventional banking methods, says a a survey published yesterday. Within the general level of caution, there was greater interest in technological services from the under-35 age group. The poll by Mori for computer company ICL, revealed that three-quarters of those questioned would not use a home banking service if it was available. One-third of respondents said they had never used a cashpoint machine. The most popular single extra service which customers would like to be available through cash machines is the sale of postage stamps. The survey also shed light on consumers' views of financial institutions. When consumers were asked which organisations other than banks or societies they would trust to look after their money, 24 per cent said insurance companies. There should be a single regulator for building societies and banks, Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, said yesterday at a Chartered Institute of Bankers' seminar. This might mean the Building Societies Commission becoming part of the supervisory department of the Bank of England. Consumers' Attitudes to Home Finance and Technology.

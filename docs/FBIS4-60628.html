			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>   [Text] As customary, Rabin's government has once again  resorted to procrastination. It is trying to impose its concept  [word indistinct] the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and its  articles in a manner that serves only its interests, as if the  agreement is just to throw dust in the eyes and a cover for  Israeli [word indistinct] to continue controlling the situation  on the ground and the Palestinian people, thus violating the  articles of the agreement, its annexes, and the symbols of  Palestinian sovereignty it contains, including the National  Authority and its power to run the Palestinian affairs in  accordance with the Palestinian interest.    Undoubtedly, the aim of Rabin's government is to abort the  agreement and render it empty and lifeless. This is a first  step toward circumventing the Palestinian national achievements  [word indistinct].    Commitment and pledge to implement the agreement -- any  agreement -- is, according to sound logic, not for one party  only, because the agreement is between two parties and is  applied equally on both sides.    The Israeli superior attitude which claims that the  Palestinian self-rule authorities have a duty to protect the  armed settlers and secure guarantees for their arrogance, not  only shows disdain for logic, but also demonstrates a series of  Israeli violations aimed to confuse the Palestinian Authority  and undermine its credibility concerning the Palestinian people,  their shrines, and rights in the homeland.    The Palestinian Authority is the symbol of Palestinian  sovereignty, and is --in all cases -- not concerned with the  security of any symbols of occupation in the Palestinian  self-rule areas. This authority cannot at all be responsible for  the results of the Israeli violations, which cannot be far from  the official Israeli policy.    In light of this situation, Rabin's government before anyone  else, is demanded to prove its credibility toward implementation  of the agreement in letter and spirit. This cannot be realized  as long as Israel continues to place obstacles, cause  (?confusion) and ambiguity concerning the agreement's articles  and [words indistinct]. Rabin's government should also be aware  that the Palestinian laws are the only legitimate and logical  alternative after the end of occupation. Issuing [word  indistinct] laws is a legitimate Palestinian right and one of  the symbols of the Palestinian sovereignty that Rabin's  government or anyone else cannot eliminate or cancel according  to a whim that is far from (?sound logic).    The Palestinian people and their national leadership have  been and will continue to be on the alert for Israeli traps, and  will continue to maintain their decisionmaking until victory.</p>

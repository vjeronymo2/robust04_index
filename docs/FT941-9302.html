			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ytong acquires Bulgarian group Ytong Holding, the German construction and housing group, yesterday bought 80 per cent of Gazobeton, Bulgaria's leading concrete producer, in the first major privatisation deal in Bulgaria's construction sector involving a foreign investor. Ytong has paid DM4m (Dollars 2.3m) for the two-year-old company and will spend a further DM5.6m over the next five years to modernise the plant. Mr Dieter Goerres, Ytong's technical director, said the acquisition was another large step in the company's expansion in eastern Europe. Ytong had a 1993 turnover of DM887m and has stakes in 20 industrial and housing construction plants in 15 European countries with more than 3,000 employees. Its main markets are Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal. The company first made acquisitions in eastern Europe in 1992 and now owns several construction plants in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Croatia. Mr Goerres said the company and its main competitor, Hiebel of Germany, are the biggest producers and traders of concrete in Europe. The new company, Ytong-Bulgaria, plans to target local markets and neighbouring Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. Ytong has already established a trading company in Greece.</p>

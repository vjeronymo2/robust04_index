			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Robotic production falls out of favour / Finding a growing market for mechanical time pieces THOSE who appreciate fine time pieces have long preferred mechanical watches to their quartz counterparts. This year is likely to prove a turning point in the revival of interest in high quality mechanical watches For some years, mechanical horology has been undergoing a revival, but only recently have fresh advances in technology enabled Switzerland's master watchmakers to achieve what they would have previously considered impossible. People who spend thousands of pounds on a gold watch like to own a product that has been assembled or finished by a craftsman whose skills have been handed down from father to son for many generations. Mechanical watches that emerge from a production line may be high in quality, but the type of watch most likely to appeal to a collector will have been assembled, checked and regulated by hand. Although the finest mechanical watches are made using modern equipment to allow even greater precision and improve parts of the production process, mainly at the design stage, no machine can match the patience and skill of the engraver who decorates a movement or case, nor the craftsman who painstakingly pierces the dial and movement of a skeleton watch to make it almost transparent. A growing number of collectors delight in acquiring these miniature marvels of engineering, whether modern or vintage. To understand the watchmaker's achievements it is worthwhile considering what a marvel he produces. If the mainspring of a watch were left to itself it would uncoil in seconds, causing the wheels inside and the hands to spin at a tremendous rate. In order to control the rate at which this pent-up power is released, horologists invented the escapement, which releases the driving power of the spring a little at a time, causing the familiar ticking sound. The work done by the escapement is extremely demanding. In an ordinary mechanical watch, the balance wheel swings 18,000 times an hour and the gear train moves forward 432,000 times in 24 hours. In six years, this represents almost one thousand million impulses. If a mechanical watch varies by one minute a day, it has a precision of 99.93 per cent - a good example should be seven times more accurate, to within one minute a week. This is a remarkable achievement for a mechanical measuring device small enough to fit on the wrist and which provides up to 100 years of service. Quartz watches have been available for over 20 years and today their accuracy and reliability are taken for granted. They accounted for more than 90 per cent of all Swiss watch exports last year and an even higher percentage from Japan. However, last year the number of mechanical watches exported from Switzerland increased by 23 per cent. Although these 2.6m units represent only 8 per cent of all watches exported, they account for a staggering 44 per cent in value terms. The past 20 years have seen quartz movement manufacturers rapidly develop and perfect their technology. Few challenges are left, and to the serious collector, the watches have less character than mechanical timepieces. This is reflected in the annal watch and jewellery fair at Basle, in Switzerland. where the most interesting new products this year were mechanical watches and little innovation can be seen in the world of quartz watches, although the styling of cases, bracelets and straps continues to evolve. However, there is one important exception: the movement that uses a conventional quartz movement for accuracy and adds to it high-precision micro-mechanics to provide the additional information which a complicated watch has to display. While Swatch has produced 100m watches in the past 10 years, at the opposite end of the market Patek Philippe is careful not to expand production at the expense of quality. In April this year it unveiled two important new models, a minute repeater wristwatch with a tourbillon escapement, and a minute repeating perpetual calendar with a fly-back calendar hand. The former will cost about Pounds 250,000, while the latter will be around Pounds 350,000. In the next 12 months it will probably be able to produce only five pieces of each for world-wide consumption, such is the skill and time needed to produce each watch. During the Basle fair, where both watches were shown for the first time, orders for six of each were received from London stockists alone. Watches and watch movements enjoy fashions, like any other luxury product, but the cost of developing entirely new movements is so great that watch fashions change more slowly than others. For several years, for example, moon phase dials were in vogue but now interest in the moon is definitely waning. Last year mechanical and quartz 'complicated' watches - models with many dials and many functions - took centre stage, and this trend seems likely to continue. The popularity of the chronograph - the watch with a built-in stopwatch - continues. Many more perpetual calendar watches - which show the date and allow for leap years - are on the market. Minute repeater watches, which delicately chime the time on command, have also kept Swiss watchmakers busy over the past year. So much research, development and investment go into the production of new complicated movements - especially the mechanical models - that manufacturers hope they will remain in production well into the future. Each year it seems more unlikely that the previous year's achievements can be surpassed, and yet further technical refinements and improvements in quality appear. 'Limited editions' became popular last year but too many Swiss watch companies jumped on the bandwagon, and supply outstripped demand. This year, the few limited editions being offered are of genuine interest, such as the limited edition reproduction of Cartier's famous Crash watch, or an unusual elongated oval design known as the Baignoire Allonge. The unique flip-over Reverso 60th by Jaeger-LeCoultre, of which only 500 were made, was sold out long ago. Now, however, the Reverso is enjoying renewed interest and a book about the history of this classic watch is on sale. Vacheron Constantin has long been respected as one of Switzerland's finest producers. This year it has introduced a minute repeater watch which is an exact replica of one of the company's models from the 1930s. It is a masculine model in an 18 carat yellow gold or platinum case and owes its revival to advanced technology. The thin hand-wound movement has a power reserve of 48 hours and strikes on demand the hours, quarters and minutes, using two gongs. Only 200 pieces of this limited edition are to be made. Blancpain is one of the most respected names in watchmaking and noted for its determination not to make a watch containing a quartz movement. Instead, it has concentrated its efforts on perfecting some classic models. This year, it has created the world's slimmest self-winding chronograph with a flyback hand, and added to it a perpetual calendar mechanism. It contains 388 parts but the movement is only 27mm in diameter and just 6.95mm thick. Chopard, a family-owned company in Geneva, is unusual in that it makes its own fine watches but is also renowned for its diamonds and gem-set jewellery too. Its timepieces include the Happy Diamonds collection of diamond-encrusted jewellery watches, with loose diamonds rolling around the outer part of the watch case. Piaget - long associated with jewellery watches - now makes many fine pieces in plain gold cases. This year, it is paying a tribute to Georges Piaget, the company's founder, by reproducing the characteristics which prevailed 50 years ago in Georges Piaget Watch. A round, classical watch, it is being issued in a limited series of 500. It has a hand-wound mechanical movement 2mm thick, first developed and produced in 1956 and which still forms the basis of the entire Piaget classic watch line. It is manufactured entirely within the Piaget workshops and requires 870 separate operations. The movement of the numbered edition from 1 to 100 in platinum is elaborately engraved by hand and is a superb example of the engraver's art. Ebel has produced the left handed watch. Designed to be worn on the right wrist by left-handed people, the 1911 is a special version of a popular design. The left-handed version has the date at nine o'clock instead of three o'clock, so it is not hidden by the sleeve, and the winding button is on the left of the case, making time and date setting easier. It is believed to be the first series-production timepiece of its kind. Cartier has recently opened its own watch factories to reduce its dependence on outside producers. The results promise to be exciting, now that design, development and manufacturing both movements and cases can be done in-house. One of the most exciting examples is the important new Tank B asculant - the Rocking Chair watch. In the familiar rectangular tank shape for which Cartier is famous, the inner part of the case is pivoted in the centre so that the watch case can be turned face-down on the wrist. Gucci Timepieces has earned itself a strong reputation for making fashion watches. Now it is enhancing the range with an 18 carat gold collection. The lines are clean and simple and the gold is either carefully polished or satin finished. Gucci watch prices are now from Pounds 599 up to Pounds 8,400. Bertolucci is a brand which combines Swiss precision and Italian design flair. It became well known for its Pulchra line, inspired by seaside pebbles. A new collection, Docta, features similar rounded styling. In the Pulchra line it has introduced an advanced self-winding mechanical model with a perpetual calendar. In the past 12 months one curiosity has grown in popularity among Swiss manufacturers: jumping hours. Such watches have a conventional hand to indicate the minutes and seconds, but the hours are shown in digital form in a window. The term 'jumping hours' is derived from the practice of ensuring that the hour indication jumps to display the next hour. One example is being introduced this year by Audemars Piguet, combining a minute repeater watch with a jumping hours display. The watch shows the hour through an aperture in the dial and displays minutes and seconds on hands in the normal way. On demand the repeater function strikes the hours, quarters and minutes using three different tones. International Watch Company, one of the manufacturers favoured by collectors, introduced a grand complication wristwatch two years ago, a watch which has always been considered the pinnacle of the watchmaker's art in pocket watch form. The much smaller wristwatch version, is an even greater achievement. IWC is the only company to have succeeded in achieving regular production. The grand complication is only available in platinum. When introduced the price was Pounds 85,000; now it is Pounds 87,500. It is only possible to make 50 each year and the company now has orders on its books for another seven years. Interest in fine watches is spreading, but the number of watchmakers is strictly limited. So demand often outstrips supply - a situation that tends to attract still more collectors, for who wants to collect anything which is freely available?

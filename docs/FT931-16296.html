			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's oil output cut as storms rage NORWEGIAN North Sea crude oil production fell sharply yesterday as raging storms forced the closure of one field and threatened to halt production at others, according to Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. Norway's total output of 2.3m barrels per day dropped by 25 per cent before the sea calmed, allowing tankers to dock and full production to resume last night. Production from the Statfjord field, Norway's biggest oil field which is operated by Statoil, was cut to 190,000 barrels a day from 700,000 while the 100,000 b/d Snorre field, operated by Saga Petroleum, was briefly closed. The Snorre floating tension leg platform also suffered some minor damage. Last night three tankers were docking at Statfjord, said Statoil. Storage tanks of the three platforms at Statfjord had been virtually full because tankers had been unable to dock for several days. Each tanker can suck out more than a day's output from the vast tanks. Statoil added that a tanker was also loading oil at the Gullfaks field. Production from Gullfaks had had just one day or so of production left due to limited storage capacity. Tankers load oil from storage tanks situated in the legs of the Gullfaks platform substructure. The Gullfaks field set a production record on January 1, when output hit 530,000 barrels. Gullfaks averaged 431,000 b/d last year.</p>

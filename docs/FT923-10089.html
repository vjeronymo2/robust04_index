			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Devaluation is no answer, and 'siren voices' must be resisted Sir, Those calling for a sterling devaluation, in the hope of allowing domestic interest rates to fall, are surely overlooking the consequences for the UK's balance of payments, and the short- and long-term effects on British exporters. In the short term, a sterling devaluation will have the effect of reducing export earnings - foreign demand for British goods will not suddenly jump overnight because those goods are perceived to be cheaper. In the longer term, such is the British propensity to import, any recovery will lead to the inevitable increase in demand for foreign goods, but at a higher price relative to the size of any devaluation. These domestic inflationary pressures will have to be offset, most probably through the use of higher interest rates. Additionally, export earnings will only recover should expenditure switching be possible, and foreign purchasers can find British goods which are suitable substitutes for foreign ones. The UK economy would therefore have gone full circle, firstly depressing the export earnings of industry, and secondly by offsetting inflationary pressures from imported price rises through the use of higher interest rates. For this, British industry would not thank the present government if it ceded to the 'siren voices'. Matthew Brodrick, Top Floor Flat, 48 Alma Vale Road, Clifton, Bristol BS8 2HS</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament May 24 SAPA -- Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,  secretary-general of the African National Congress, was elected  to chair South Africa's Constitutional Assembly at the first  joint sitting of the National Assembly and Senate on Tuesday.    Mr Ramaphosa, 42, will oversee the two-year process which is  to draw up the country's final constitution. He was the ANC's  chief constitutional negotiator, a former security detainee and  headed the National Union of Mineworkers before becoming  prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics in the late 1980s.    According to ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile, Mr Ramaphosa  would act as a "political rudder", ensuring that the principles  in the interim constitution and those of the ANC were adhered to.    The constitutional assembly is convened by a joint sitting  of  the 400-member National Assembly and 90-seat Senate.    Former Minister of Manpower Mr Leon Wessels was elected  deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly on Tuesday. His  nomination, by Minister of Environment Affairs Dr. Dawie de  Villiers, was unopposed.</p>

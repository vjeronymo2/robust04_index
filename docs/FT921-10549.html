			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tougher times for composites - Rising reinsurance rates ALREADY enfeebled by their losses from recession and weather-related claims over the past two years, UK composite insurers are facing tough increases in their reinsurance costs and a reduction in cover in some instances. With negotiations still proceeding in some cases, insurers are reluctant to give details, but five of the country's leading insurers - General Accident, Sun Alliance, Commercial Union, Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance  -face increases of at least 25 per cent. Underpinning these developments are two related trends. UK insurers are presenting their reinsurers with serious losses. In 1990 four of the five recorded pre-tax losses for the first time for at least a generation. That result was heavily influenced by the Pounds 4bn cost of the storm losses of January and February 1990 and reinsurers responded by pushing up rates by multiples of three and four times. Reinsurers, such as Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re, are themselves facing much tighter conditions in the retrocession market, where they buy their own reinsurance protections. Between 1987 and 1990 reinsurers in the retrocession market, much of which is concentrated at Lloyd's of London, were hit by a string of catastrophe losses - ranging from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in the North Sea in 1988, to hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the January storms in 1990. Total losses amounted to more than Pounds 18bn and the impact has forced many players out of business with those remaining pushing through significant increases in rates. And although 1991 was relatively free of major catastrophe losses, reinsurers were hit by a number of medium-sized losses in the last three months of the year. Together losses from Typhoon 19 in Japan, a forest fire in Oakland, California, a hailstorm in Calgary and hurricane Bob in North America led to claims in excess of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn). Reinsurers have, therefore, been squeezed and although UK insurers had hoped to escape further increases this year they have found their reinsurers in a surprisingly tough mood over the past three months. As a result negotiations have been long drawn out. Many contracts which are normally completed a number of weeks before Christmas have only been completed in the past few days. One large mutual office is understood to have completed its programme last week. 'This has been the most horrendous renewal season that most individuals on the market can remember,' comments one London broker. 'European reinsurers were unhappy with the extent of increases they were able to obtain last year and since the summer of last year have been co-ordinating efforts to obtain much higher rates', says another broker. Reinsurers have been forcing through tough new terms for the proportional treaties - in which they assume a fixed percentage of an insurer's liabilities for a fixed percentage of the original premium. The rate of commission which reinsurers pay for this business has been cut drastically. Reinsurers who paid between 25 per cent and 27 per cent at the beginning of 1991 have paid as little as 7.5 per cent this year. In one case reinsurers have insisted on the introduction of 'loss participation clauses,' arrangements whereby insurers refund the original reinsurance commission if the business they cede eventually generates losses. Not surprisingly, many insurers have refused to buy proportional covers on these terms and have been forced to rely exclusively on non-proportional covers, in which the reinsurer agrees to pay all losses above an annual aggregate level. Here, too, though prices have been increased and terms have been tightened. Last year four of the UK's five composite insurers paid between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m for policies covering them from aggregate losses of up about Pounds 250m. Reinsurers are known to have successfully achieved rate increases of at least 25 per cent - following rises of up to 400 per cent last year. Last year the UK's leading five insurers paid over Pounds 125m for their non-proportional reinsurance. And in at least one case a trigger point of about Pounds 50m has been set, with the implication that insurers carry a much higher proportion of their losses on their own books. This shift has also had implications for the cash flow of insurers. While payments for proportional reinsurance are made on a quarterly basis, insurers pay up front for their non-proportional protections.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> WAYLON JENNINGS REVELS IN GED  </P> <P> Country music star Waylon Jennings is singing a different tune since gaining a  high school eqivalency diploma: "Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be  dropouts."  </P> <P> Jennings was scheduled to accept his General Educational Development  certificate from Kentucky First Lady Martha Wilkinson at the Capitol in  Frankfort today.  </P> <P> He enrolled in Kentucky Educational Television's "GED on TV" program last fall  after talking about it with Mrs. Wilkinson, the wife of Gov. Wallace Wilkinson.  He passed the exam in December after studying tapes on his tour bus.  </P> <P> Mrs. Wilkinson said Jennings, whose hits include "Mama, Don't Let Your Babies  Grow Up to be Cowboys" (with Willie Nelson) and the theme to "The Dukes of  Hazzard" TV show, was ecstatic when he learned he had passed.  </P> <P> "I've got to admit, I don't think I've ever talked to a teen-ager more  excited," Mrs. Wilkinson said. "He yelled on the phone, 'I really did it!' And  it actually was a yell."  </P></p>

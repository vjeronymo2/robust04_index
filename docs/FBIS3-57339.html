			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 25 Jan (ARMENPRES)--Bagrat Asaturyan,  president of the Armenian Central Bank, told reporters that the  Armenian coins known as lumas will be brought to the Republic.  The absence of the luma is creating major problems, mostly in  retail trade, and is causing artificial inflation in the price  of some goods.    Asaturyan also said that Iran's "Mellath" Bank will be the  first foreign bank to start operating in Armenia soon. The  building to be allocated to the bank in Republic Square is not  ready. The Armenian side is doing everything to enable the bank  to start operating as soon as possible.    The Armenian Central Bank reported a noticeable flow of  forged Russian rubles and dollars from Russia to Armenia.  Circulation is helped by the existence of a foreign currency  "black market."</p>

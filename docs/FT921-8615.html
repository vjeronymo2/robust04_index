			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Leading Article: How to cut BT's prices THE MOST encouraging feature of the BT price review, which started last month, is that it will be conducted to a large extent in the open. Past examinations of the telecommunications group's prices by Oftel, the industry regulator, have been behind closed doors. Openness is important not just because price control must be seen to be fair to BT's customers. It is also important because errors in controlling the company's prices in the past have mainly resulted from Oftel's exclusive reliance on its own internal resources. Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, may be a distinguished accountant, but he has a tiny staff to pitch against BT's array of lawyers, economists and accountants. By consulting widely, Sir Brian should receive help from independent experts. Sir Bryan is right when he asserts that a price cap is a better way of controlling BT's monopoly power than direct curbs on profits. A price cap gives the company an incentive to improve efficiency, because it is allowed to keep any extra profits that it earns through cutting costs. But profits must be taken into account in setting the price cap. The cap should allow BT to earn reasonable profits if it makes reasonable progress towards higher efficiency, but reward it with extra profits only if it makes exceptional progress on efficiency. Detailed forecasts Judging exactly how far BT's prices should fall can only be made on the basis of detailed forecasts of the effect on profits both of different price caps and of different definitions of reasonable profits and efficiency. Oftel will be doing this work in the next few months. In the new spirit of openness, it should publish these before concluding a deal with BT. On the basis of the figures now in the public domain, however, the provisional conclusion has to be that BT's profits are excessive. In the financial year to the end of March 1991, BT earned a return of 25.4 per cent on the capital employed in its regulated businesses, compared with the 18 per cent that Oftel had initially expected. The difference between these two rates - about Pounds 700m in hard numbers - is a measure of BT's extra profits. What then should be done? Nothing, according to BT. Its argument is that the price cap, which was tightened last year, is already cutting profits, as the 4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for its third quarter reported last month shows. The likely effect of the current cap should, indeed, be the starting point for the review. But looking at one quarter's profits in isolation, especially in the depths of a recession, cannot be the basis for a formula that will last for four or five years. Profits normally fall in recessions. Most other companies have been much worse affected than BT. One-off cut If, as seems likely, BT is still earning excess profits when the current cap expires, there are two principal ways of returning these to telephone users. Oftel's preference would be to tighten the cap a notch or two; but a one-off cut when the next price cap is imposed would also be possible. Sir Bryan's objection to a one-off cut is that BT would have less incentive to improve efficiency in future if extra profits earned this way were clawed back immediately. He argues that in a competitive market, which ought to provide the benchmark for regulating a near monopoly like BT, firms with particularly high efficiency see their extra profits eroded gradually because it takes time for rivals to catch up. This argument would be conclusive if BT's extra profits were the result of better-than-expected efficiency. But Oftel has explained the divergence between BT's actual profits and its forecasts mainly in terms of its initial decision not to regulate the company's international call charges, which earn a return on capital of over 80 per cent. Why should BT's customers have to pay more because of a regulatory oversight? It seems sensible to phase out extra profits that stem from BT's extra efficiency only gradually, but it would be better to hand back those that do not in the form of a one-off cut.</p>

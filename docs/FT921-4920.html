			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / China envelops colony's economy / A report on an ever-closer economic relationship IF THE stock market is any indication of Hong Kong's future economic prospects, its performance in the first two months of this year presages great things for the colony's irrepressible economy. The market has risen nearly 15 per this year - a rise explained almost wholly by one word: China. China now holds the key to Hong Kong's economy in a way it has not since before the Korean war. Hong Kong's real gross domestic product grew by 'only' 4 per cent last year; the government is expecting growth of 5 per cent this year while private sector economists are expecting it to rise by 5.5 per cent. The basis of this expansion are expected to be trade, investment and strong consumer spending. Mr Hamish MacLeod, financial secretary, said in his budget on Wednesday that trade, the backbone of the economy, was expected to be buoyant with exports growing by 14 per cent. Inflation, however, was forecast to remain high with the gross domestic product deflator rising at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent, and consumer prices expected to rise at a faster rate of above 10 per cent. Hong Kong's problem with inflation seems likely to remain. There is an extremely tight labour market, with unemployment just 1.4 per cent and on a declining trend, and the government has plans to import 25,000 workers this year. The inflation problem is also a consequence of the deep structural changes in the economy. Hong Kong is becoming integrated into the southern Chinese economy and a consequence of this is a shift to non-traded services away from traded goods. This marks a return towards the situation of the pre-Korean war period when China accounted for about two thirds of the colony's trade. Today, it is Hong Kong's biggest trading partner, accounting directly for over 30 per cent. Much of this trade includes re-exports related to 'outward processing'  -the export and import of goods, partially manufactured in either Hong Kong or China and finished in either, for the international market. In 1991, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn (Pounds 56bn). Of these HKDollars 534.8bn were re-exports, more than 80 per cent of which related to trade with China. As Nomura Research Institute recently observed, Hong Kong is adopting a 'head office' role (marketing and finance) and China the role of the factory. The explosion in trade with China has sent shock waves throughout the colony's economy. Employment in services related to trade, among other things, has risen from 19.6 per cent in 1980 to 31.5 per cent at the end of last year. There has also been big investment by Hong Kong business in southern China since China opened its door to foreign investment in 1979. Capital has flowed into southern China, mainly neighbouring Guangdong. By the end of 1990 Hong Kong had contracted to invest Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds 13.2bn) directly in China, representing 63 per cent of total contracted foreign investment. Of this Dollars 11bn has been put to work, mainly in Guangdong and its special economic zones, creating an estimated 2m jobs in manufacturing in that region. The rise of manufacturing there has led to a fall off in manufacturing employment in the colony, as low and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs have been exported north. In the reverse of what has been happening to employment in services, Hong Kong's manufacturing labour force has fallen from 890,000 (or 37.5 per cent of the workforce) at the beginning of the 1980s to 655,000 at the end of 1991 (23.4 per cent of the workforce.) However, although services might be providing growth to the colony's economy, Hong Kong is far from becoming a wholly-services based 'post-industrial' society as some economists assert. The colony's manufacturers have shown themselves to be formidable managers of their sector's apparent 'decline'. Manufacturing industry's share of GDP has remained remarkably constant on the back of sustained productivity improvements and investment in new technology.</p>

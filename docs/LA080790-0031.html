			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: STABBING VICTIM'S CONDITION IMPROVES  </P> <P> The condition of a Santa Paula man who was stabbed 18 times has improved from  critical to guarded, a Ventura County Medical Center nursing supervisor said  Monday.  </P> <P> Avelino Morales, 28, was admitted to the hospital late Friday after the knife  attack.  </P> <P> But the identity of the assailants who repeatedly knifed Morales remains a  mystery, Santa Paula Police Cmdr. Bob Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Morales was walking with a friend at 10:29 p.m. Friday in the 1200 block of  East Ventura Street when they were approached by two men in their mid-20s.  </P> <P> Morales was stabbed in the chest, back and both legs. The two attackers fled on  foot, Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Police are not revealing the name of Morales' friend out of concern that he may  be attacked in retaliation for his testimony, Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Officers have been unable to determine whether a gang was involved in the  stabbing because Morales' friend could not identify the attackers by name,  Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Police plan to interview Morales when he is released from the hospital,  Gonzalez said. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

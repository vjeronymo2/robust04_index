			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES SQUEEZING SCHOOLS, SERVICES;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: OFFICIALS FEAR TRANSPORTATION COSTS WILL SOAR FROM 20% TO 50% IF  THE CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF DOES NOT ABATE SOON.  </P> <P> While individual motorists are digging deeper into their pockets for a few  extra dollars to meet rising fuel costs, Orange County governmental agencies  and school districts are dipping deeper into their coffers for thousands of  extra dollars to keep vital public services from literally running out of gas.  </P> <P> With oil prices at a seven-year high, county government and school officials  predicted that the cost of running buses, maintenance and sanitation trucks,  police cars and other vehicles essential to county operations could soar from  20% to 50% if the crisis in the Persian Gulf does not abate soon.  </P> <P> Most school district and county officials stressed that the continuing increase  in gasoline and diesel prices should not have an immediate effect on public  services. But they added that in a worst-case scenario -- that is, if the  crisis drags on or if war breaks out and disrupts the flow from Saudi oil  fields -- Orange County residents may see cutbacks in transportation services  or hikes in bus fares.  </P> <P> "One of the last resorts would be to raise fares, and then the very, very last  resort would be to reduce service," said Joanne Curran, a spokeswoman for the  Orange County Transit District. "The last thing we want to do is cut service.  We would increase fares before we did that, although that also is not a  pleasant thought."  </P> <P> Although the Persian Gulf situation is barely a month old, Curran said the  county is already grappling with the fallout from the crisis. OCTD officials  expect that, even if prices begin leveling off immediately, diesel fuel for its  fleet of 481 buses will cost $900,000 more than originally projected for the  current fiscal year. The state's new 5-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline will  tack on another $300,000 to the county's annual fuel tab, Curran said.  </P> <P> OCTD paid 52.3 cents per gallon for diesel fuel on Aug. 3 and 72.9 cents per  gallon on Aug. 21. Curran said OCTD will try to offset the increased costs by  delaying work on some new facilities and by cutting back on cosmetic  improvements, such as a scheduled paint job for some of the fleet's older  buses.  </P> <P> The news isn't all bad for OCTD, however. Curran said that bus ridership has  risen by about 30% in the last two years and that ridership will probably  increase even more as motorists decrease use of personal vehicles to combat  rising fuel costs.  </P> <P> While more riders may help balance out OCTD's ledgers, there is little that can  be done to offset the increased cost of operating the county's 1,480 fleet  vehicles -- including sheriff's patrol cars and vehicles for county inspectors  and maintenance personnel -- and 109 trucks and buses, said Robert J.  Stechmann, manager of the county's transportation division.  </P> <P> The county has budgeted slightly more than $1.9 million to keep tanks filled at  its six stations for county-owned vehicles, Stechmann said. More than 21,000  gallons of fuel is dispensed from the county's Civic Center gas station alone  each month.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors would have to approve any increase in the  $1.9-million fuel budget if the crisis continues and gas supplies are  endangered, Stechmann said. He added that in such an event, the board could  order limitations on the use of some county vehicles.  </P> <P> "If we get into a severe situation, public safety vehicles will receive  priority, and (vehicles for) essential services so that the county can continue  to transact business would follow," Stechmann said. Use of pool cars by county  officials would probably be curtailed first, he said.  </P> <P> School districts around the county have even fewer options than government  agencies or OCTD since services, for the most part, are difficult to cut. "You  have to bus the kids, and maintenance vehicles are really necessary to keep the  district operating," said William Moncure, director of purchasing for the Santa  Ana Unified School District.  </P></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trotman to take over from Poling as Ford chairman MR ALEX Trotman is to take over as chairman, chief executive and president of Ford, the world's second-largest vehicle maker after General Motors, with effect from November 1. He will replace Mr Harold Poling, 67, who will retire at the end of the year. Mr Trotman has emerged as the favoured candidate in recent months to lead Ford in preference to the earlier front-runner Mr Allan Gilmour, who remains as one of two vice-chairmen. Mr Trotman, 60, has moved rapidly through the senior ranks of Ford since serving as president and then chairman of Ford of Europe in the second half of the 1980s. In 1989 he moved back to the US to become executive vice-president of Ford's North American automotive operations, and was appointed president and chief operating officer of Ford Automotive Group in January. Born in Middlesex, UK, and educated in Edinburgh, Mr Trotman joined Ford as a student trainee in the purchasing department of Ford of Britain in 1955, following service as a flying officer-navigator in the Royal Air Force. Much of his career at Ford has been spent in product planning. He became director of Ford of Europe's car product planning office in 1967. He moved to the US in 1969 and was appointed chief car planning manager for Ford in North America in 1975, the year in which he became a US citizen. In the early 1980s he also served for a period as president of Ford Asia-Pacific, before becoming president of Ford of Europe in 1984. With the retirement of Mr Poling, Ford will lose one of the leading figures of the US auto industry, who has emerged in recent years as one of the most outspoken champions of tougher action by the US government to reduce the large Japanese automotive trade surplus with the US. After two years of heavy losses, Ford returned to profit in the first half of 1993 and has gained significant market share, partly at the expense of its bigger domestic rival, General Motors. MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian forest products group, will maintain its interest in KNP BT, a Netherlands fine paper and packaging group, by taking its share of a KNP rights issue for CDollars 64m, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. MacMillan owns 17 per cent of the enlarged KNP, which is making a rights offer to bolster its balance sheet. MacMillan will buy 2.85m new KNP shares.</p>

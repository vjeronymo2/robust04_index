			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks during interview with Deputy U.S. </F> Trade Representative Barshevsky by correspondent Shigeru Komago;  place and date not given]    [Text] 1. Without agreeing on the fundamental understanding  needed to realize the agreement made last July, Tsutomu Hata,  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and U.S. Trade  Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor confirmed in Morocco that  the situation is not ripe to restart the unofficial meetings  aimed at resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  At that time, Foreign Minister Hata indicated the policy that  he would take USTR Kantor's proposal back to Japan and study it.  We are waiting for his reply. The stance of the United States  regarding policies toward Japan will not be changed by a change  of administrative power in Japan.    2. On the bases of the clauses on government procurement and  other clauses of its comprehensive trade law, the U.S.  Government, (regardless of whether or not the framework talks  will be resumed), will pass judgment by the end of April on how  Japan is abiding by the accord on government procurement of  electrical communications and medical equipments.    3. Japan's macroeconomic policies, designed to significantly  reduce its current account surplus by stimulating domestic  demands, and market liberalization in different fields are  equally important for resumption of the framework talks.  Regarding macroeconomic policies, we are asking Japan to spell  out its long-term views on ratio between current account surplus  and the gross domestic production (GDP).    4. It will be difficult for us to resume even unofficial  meetings unless we have a prospect that a Japanese reply will  break the deadlock on some points. No decisions have been made  whether we will hold official meetings at ministerial level or  the unofficial meetings between vice ministers. The situation  is unclear as to whether or not we will be able to come to a  conclusion on the framework talks by the July summit of the  developed countries (Naples summit).</p>

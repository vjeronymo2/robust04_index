A decisive guarantee for victory in the march this year is  to  defend our rock-solid single-hearted unity around the party and  the leader [suryong] as the most precious thing and demonstrate  the might of this unity more highly.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must  defend the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks,  which has been consolidated rock-solid under our party's  leadership, as the most precious thing and further consolidate  and develop it.    Single-hearted unity is our revolution's immortal, honorable  tradition and a great banner of victory. Our people have been  able to victoriously overcome all difficulties and trials on the  revolutionary road and march forward and build a powerful  independent, self-sufficient socialist country capable of self-  reliant defense in this land because they have waged struggles  like heroes after strongly uniting around the party and the  leader [suryong].    Last year, when stern trials faced the fatherland and  reunification, our people honorably defended the socialist  fatherland's dignity and safety and won a great victory in  socialist economic construction. This was possible because  there was the might of single-hearted unity.    Only when we resolutely defend the honorable tradition of  single-hearted unity and continuously and highly demonstrate its  might, can we fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism of  our own style and complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause  to the end in any storm.    More strongly consolidating single-hearted unity among our  revolutionary ranks is all the more important a demand in  connection with our revolution's environment and our massive  tasks. The imperialists and reactionaries are strengthening  their offensives on an unprecedented scale in the political,  economic, military, and diplomatic fields and all other fields  to isolate, stifle, and crush [korip chilsik apsal] our  Republic, which is marching under the uplifted banner of  socialism. The situation in our country is still tense and  complicated because of the enemy's anti-Republic, antisocialist  maneuvers, and numerous difficulties face us. We must fly the  banner of single-hearted unity more highly if we are to score  revolutionary upsurges by waging the struggle to thoroughly  implement the party's revolutionary economic strategies under  these circumstances.    Single-hearted unity is a source of the vitality of  socialism. When our people implement our party's revolutionary  economic strategies after strongly uniting around the party and  the leader [suryong], the imperialists' anti-Republic,  antisocialist commotions will quiet down, and our people will be  able defend and maintain socialism of our own style and glorify  it to the end.    The tasks of all fields of socialist construction this year  are heavy and massive. As the great leader has elucidated in  his New Year's address, we must thoroughly implement the  revolutionary lines of self-dependence, self-support, and  self-reliant defense to comply with the prevailing situation and  the requirements for the development of our revolution. They  must also vigorously carry out the three revolutions,  ideological, technological, and cultural, to further strengthen  the country's political, economic, and military might.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategies presented at  the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth party Central Committee  are the most just and revolutionary lines for consolidating a  basis for a self-reliant rock-solid national economy and further  improving the standard of living to meet socialist demands.  When we thoroughly implement these strategies, we will be able  to more vigorously demonstrate the superiority of socialism of  our own style and take new attack bases for conquering higher  peaks in socialism.    We must continuously and strongly adhere to the  agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and  the foreign trade-first policy this year. We must also give top  priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway  transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's  economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical industry.  They must also achieve new development in all fields of  socialist cultural construction and exert due efforts to  strengthen the country's defensive capability in response to the  enemy's war provocation maneuvers.    If we are to implement these massive tasks successfully, we  must defend our single-hearted unity as the most precious thing  and more highly demonstrate its might. Our single-hearted unity  is single- hearted unity in ideology and in action in which the  entire party and all the people absolutely worship [sungbae] and  follow the great leader [suryong], and the great leader  [yongdoja].    When we highly display the might of such great  single-hearted unity unprecedented in history, there will be no  difficulty that we cannot overcome or stronghold that we cannot  occupy.    The road to destroying in every step vicious anti-Republic  and antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and  reactionaries and the road to highly demonstrating the spirit of  chuche Korea are to highly display the might of single-hearted  unity. The road to consolidating the foundation of the nation's  self-supporting economy by vigorously accelerating the socialist  general march is for all people to struggle with single-hearted  unity with the party.    The idea on further strengthening the single-hearted unity  of  our revolutionary ranks, expounded by the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song in the New Year's address, is a precious guideline  that provided a decisive guarantee for victory of this year's  combat.    This idea reflects the great leader's lofty intent to make  this year the year of historic turn in the revolution and  construction in our country by more highly displaying the might  of our single-hearted unity, which the entire party, all the  people and the whole Army have attained by firmly rallying  themselves behind the great leader [yongdoja].    All party members and working people should further  consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in conformity  with the demand of the prevailing situation and development of  the revolution, and should brilliantly achieve the militant  tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the  New Year's address. Thus, we should register greater victory in  the struggle to advance the socialist cause of our own style.    It is important, above all, for all party members and  working  people to deeply realize the greatness of the leader [yongdoja]  and to have thoroughgoing faith to absolutely trust and follow  only their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] under  any circumstance.    The might of the unity of the revolutionary ranks is the  might of solid faith of all people toward the leader. Comrade  Kim Chong-il, our dear leader, is the matchlessly great man who  has both literary and military achievements and who has loyalty  and filial piety. He is destiny and future of our fatherland,  our people and our-style socialism.    Through proud realities of our revolution, which advances  without wavering even a slight degree in the midst of worldwide  upheaval, all party members and working people should be keenly  aware of how the great leader [yongdoja] we are upholding is at  the van of the party, the revolutionary ranks and revolutionary  armed forces.    We should uphold the dear comrade leader with loyalty and  filial piety by cherishing the iron-clad belief that because  there is the leader [yongdoja], there is the nation, and their  own happiness and everlasting prosperity of the future  generations are insured.    The great chuche idea is an ideological basis of our  single-hearted unity. All the people should firmly insure  consistency of their ideologies and actions in accordance with  the demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the invincible might  of our single-hearted unity.    Deeply realizing that the chuche idea is the life of  our-style socialism, party members and working people should  more firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea. Our  single-hearted unity is a powerful driving force in socialist  construction, and its might should be fully demonstrated in the  practical struggle to accelerate the socialist economic  construction.    In today's rewarding struggle to further consolidate the  foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy, to upgrade  the people's standard of living, and to hold a new offensive  position to occupy a higher height of socialism, we should fully  display the might of our people's firm unity with the party and  the leader [suryong].    By highly displaying the sense of unbounded devotion to the  party and to the revolution and the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and arduous struggle, all party members and  workers should timely fulfill and without fail national economic  plans assigned to them.    For us to glorify our-style socialism with the might of  single-hearted unity, we should more brilliantly bloom the  communist fine custom overflowing in the whole society. The  revolutionary traits of our people, who are firmly united as one  with the party and the leader, should be vigorously demonstrated  in highly displaying the communist fine custom, in which all  members of society help and lead each other according to the  collectivist principle, "One for all, all for one."    The single-hearted unity is our most powerful weapon and  strength in defending, protecting and accomplishing our-style  socialism to the end. As long as there are the wise leadership  of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity of the  people, who are rallied behind the great leader [suryong] and  great leader [yongdoja], there is nothing that we should be  afraid of in this world.    All party members and working people should advance by more  highly upholding the banner of single-hearted unity with sense  of confidence and courage. Thus, we should again demonstrate the  unswerving spirit of heroic Korea in this year's socialist  general march.</p>

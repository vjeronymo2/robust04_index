			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The largest audience for a single episode of a series in Italy tuned into the  finale of "La Piovra" ("The Octopus") this week and watched as a beloved  anti-Mafia police commissioner was assassinated. A record 17.2 million  Italians, nearly 60% of the TV viewing audience, saw the TV hero, Corrado  Cattani, walk out of a Milan hospital and fall victim to 70 rounds of  ammunition from Mafia killers' guns. Though fans protested the death (one  threatened suicide if the character was killed off), Michele Placido, the actor  who played the part for four seasons, was not upset. "I couldn't bear the  thought of doing another season. I'm glad Cattani is dead, for me it's a  rebirth," said Placido, who wants to move on to other projects. "La Piovra"  will be back for a fifth season, with a tough and beautiful anti-Mafia judge  swearing revenge. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

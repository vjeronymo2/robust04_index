			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Money Markets: A change of mood Despite a hectic week in sterling markets, dealers yesterday went home for the weekend with no clear view on whether UK base rates were set to go lower than 6 per cent, writes James Blitz. By the close of trading yesterday, the yield curve from one month out to 1 year in the sterling interbank market was perfectly flat. That was a significant indication of the market's mood. The curve has moved from a downward sloping one to general flatness this week. If it starts to move upwards, this will be the first indication since the September sterling crisis that the market expects base rates to rise. There is still some bullishness on rate cuts in the market. With most cash rates at around 5 7/8 per cent, there are signs that some dealers expect a small easing soon. But there has been an overall change in sentiment, inspired by comments from the UK authorities that they do not want to see policy ease for the near future. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, has had an especially strong impact on the market, suggesting that he wanted sterling to have a higher exchange rate. Dealers also believe that the new signs of growth in the UK economy make another base rate cut unnecessary. Thursday's M0 money supply figure, showing growth of around 5 per cent, underlined this view. Even the futures dealers who tried to push up the short dated sterling contracts at the start of the week have ended up losing money. Tensions between the government and Britain's building societies over the high rates of interest offered by National Savings Bonds had raised expectations of another base rate cut. But the row has petered out, and the June contract, having been as high as 94.40 earlier in the week, closed last night at 94.18. There is always a possibility that aggressive cuts in German rates might open the window for another easing in UK policy. But, here again, the market was disappointed this week. Certainly, there was a sharp drop in call money, from about 8.75 per cent last Friday to 8.25 per cent last night. But the Bundesbank's official rates were unchanged, and the cut in the repo rate was a modest 8 basis points to 8.17 per cent.</p>

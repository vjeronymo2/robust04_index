			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SALESMAN' STAR PHILIP BAKER HALL SUFFERS DETACHED RETINA, IMPERILING  PRODUCTION  </P> <P> A detached retina suffered by the lead actor in the Los Angeles Theatre Center  production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" put the play's run in  possible jeopardy Wednesday as the performer, Philip Baker Hall, underwent  surgery.  </P> <P> Diane White, LATC's producing director, said the retinal detachment was  discovered by Hall's physicians Tuesday night -- an evening when the play,  which opened last month and is scheduled to run until Dec. 10, was dark.  </P> <P> White said the situation could become more critical if Hall is unable to return  for a daytime performance today or the next scheduled evening performance  tonight. She said the company does not include an understudy for the Loman  part.  </P> <P> Bill Bushnell, the center's artistic director and director of the production,  read Hall's part of Willy Loman at a daytime performance for school children  Wednesday morning. No Wednesday evening performance was scheduled. White said  she was not certain at which hospital Hall's surgery was being performed.  </P> <P> White said that if Hall cannot return, LATC may try to identify local actors  who have played the role elsewhere to see if they can step in on short notice.  White said Hall's doctors could not predict how early he might return. ALLAN  PARACHINI  </P></p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / People: RMC's successful German connection RMC, the building materials group which last year derived two thirds of its operating profits from Germany, has promoted Stuart Walker, finance director of the German subsidiary, to the main board. In his new position, he will cover France, Spain and Portugal. The largest producer of building materials in Germany, RMC has had a presence in the country since 1954; apart from Walker and one other, the operation is run entirely by German nationals. Bruno Baumgarten, boss of the operation, already has a seat on the main board. Walker, 49, has been closely involved with the expansion into east Germany, including negotiations with the Treuhand, the agency charged with the privatisation of east German industry. The company now has 70 ready mixed concrete plants in the new states, making it one of the leading investors in the east. After 15 years living in Germany, Walker now returns to the UK. Meanwhile, his new geographic beat, which he assumes from Peter Young, promoted to managing director earlier this year, will already be somewhat familiar. Walker had looked after Spain, Portugal and France for four years from 1978 when he first went over to Dusseldorf. In 1992, turnover in Germany amounted to Pounds 1.3bn compared with Pounds 378m in France and Pounds 133m in Spain.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>   [Text] American law enforcement agencies failed to  intercept a consignment of detonators bound for Ulster  terrorists because they believed the IRA was only going to use  them for testing purposes, a television report claims tonight.    In fact, after sending them across the Atlantic, the  Provisionals used the detonators in a bombing campaign in Ulster  and England, according to the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight  programme.    The devices, made by a U.S. firm and allegedly bought by a  Belfast man in Arizona, started turning up three years ago in an  assortment of bombs. Others were found in unexploded bombs in  England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.    American agents posing as arms dealers and involved in a  so-called sting operation agreed to sell a Stinger  surface-to-air missile to the man who, it is claimed, also told  them of his plans to buy 2,900 detonators.    Kevin McKinley was later arrested for his part in the  missile  sale, but the detonators were sent to Ireland, the report says.    Details emerged at a trial in Tucson where four other  Irishmen and two Americans face charges connected to the sale.  The case is expected to end soon.    According to the report, the U.S. authorities failed to keep  a tail on McKinley after he unwittingly warned them of his plans  to buy the detonators. Had they known they were going to be  used for bombs, he probably would have been followed, one agent  claimed.    One of the defence lawyers at the hearing claimed the law  enforcement agencies were more interested in a successful  "sting" involving the missile.    Bates Butler said: "Even though they had been told  detonators  were involved, they didn't care...it could have been stopped."</p>

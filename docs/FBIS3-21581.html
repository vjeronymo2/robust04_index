			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lev Fedorov, doctor of chemical sciences: "From </F> Chemical Warfare to Ecological Warfare"]    [Text] SPASENIYE Reference Information -- Doctor of  Chemical Sciences Lev Fedorov is president of the Alliance for  Chemical Safety. The friend and comrade-in-arms of Vil  Mirzayanov, he has traveled this fighter's entire journey --  from social persecution to KGB interrogations. Whereas we might  stretch things to believe that the persecution of political  dissidents is over, attempts continue to be made, as before, to  nail "industrial" dissidents to the wall.    In mid-October, at their first assembly in Nizhniy Novgorod,  a small group of activists of the antichemical movement founded  the Alliance for Chemical Safety. Our organization is not very  large at present, and certainly not widespread. However, we  would like to make a beginning. We cannot allow the  military-chemical complex, whose inclinations for poaching have  long been well known, to make decisions regarding Russia's  withdrawal from chemical warfare without consulting us -- the  inhabitants of Russia.    I would like to invite into discussion (and into action!)  the  populace of those regions in which the chemical weapons of the  land of the soviets have been stored in recent years at seven  bases, and from which their continued journey can lead to just  one destination -- nonexistence. We are addressing first and  foremost those people who reside near three air bases and two  artillery bases that store chemical munitions with the most  toxic organophosphoric nerve-paralysis agents -- zarin, zoman,  and V-gas.    The air bases housing chemicals were situated at three quite  tranquil localities in Russia -- the city of Pochel (Bryansk  Oblast), and the settlements of Leonidovka (Penza Oblast) and  Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast). Protected here from impudent  "hostile" eyes are various types of air-dropped bombs, molded  aviation devices, components for all-purpose containers, and  other "riches" we have no need for.    The chemical arsenals at rocket artillery bases were  comfortably positioned in the settlement of Kizner (Udmurtia)  and in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast). At one time  chemical projectiles for tube and rocket artillery and warheads  for missiles of various ranges were transported here.    None of us is guilty of what is the reality today. Those who  dragged Russia into chemical warfare and accumulated stockpiles  of chemical weapons preferred to remain in obscurity and can  hardly be expected now to come out into the spotlight. No more  deserving of trust, however, is the current wave of  military-chemical establishment people, who are again attempting  to take charge of something, this time -- the destruction of  chemical weapons. And once again -- without us, although at the  expense of our health and our interests. It seems these people  are about to drag us out of chemical warfare and into ecological  warfare without proper supervision on the part of society.    The sad story is that our chemical weapons stockpiles will  have to be eliminated "in their storage locations" (KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA, 22 October 1993). This was acknowledged by General A.D.  Kuntsevich, head of the "eliminators," and a zealous and not  unselfish creator of our military-chemical offensive  "achievements" (we are not talking about defensive arms here) in  the past. And it is even more important that we not give sloppy  people from the military-chemical complex complete freedom of  discretion in managing this matter of greatest danger. Their  thoughtlessness and lack of professionalism could well deliver  us many new calamities.    In order to provide a convincing basis for the fears I am  expressing here, I cite the interview, just published, with  Colonel A.D. Gorbovskiy (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 27 January 1994).  It is out of pure necessity that I provide the name of this  gentleman -- he deserves no publicity.    As the head of some military-chemical inspection team, the  colonel recently made a calculation of the amount of toxic  substances Russia has on hand. It is suspicious that this amount  coincided exactly with the figure officially declared previously  -- 40,000 tonnes, and not a tonne more. Of course, the gentleman  simply forgot to inform us as to what happened to the remaining  tonnes which used to exist and were a topic of discussion.  Which, by the way, are not a bit less toxic in the buried or  submerged state than they are in the combat configuration --  when stored in the form of chemical munitions.    We go on; there is more. In his capacity as head of this  inspection team, the colonel assured his fellow citizens, first  and foremost the residents of the above-mentioned population  centers, that the chemical munitions in their locality were  being stored safely, and that "no instances of leakage of toxic  substances have been recorded" at any of the arsenals. Well,  suppose there is no automatic alarm system whatsoever at the  bases in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast) and settlement of  Kizner (Udmurtia) to signal the presence of toxic vapors in the  atmosphere. And there never was! So it would seem that nothing  exists to do the recording, especially when the soldier is  sleeping and a "leak" is occurring. Things are not much better  at the other bases. Thus, it is hardly worth talking so  categorically about leaks. Especially since the environmental  protection organs and sanitation and epidemiologic services of  these localities are not allowed to get involved here --  "ecologists" in uniform are in charge.    No less interesting is the geographic aspect of the  colonel's  revelations. Once again, in his capacity as head of the  inspection team, he "shut down" altogether the rocket artillery  arsenal in the city of Shchuchye, announcing that all of our  storage facilities "are located in the European part of Russia"  and that "the most eastern" facility was situated in Chelyabinsk  Oblast. I do not know whether or not there are in fact chemical  weapons in the city of Shchuchye, but such an announcement was  officially made (IZVESTIYA, 3 November 1992), and it was  released following General Kuntsevich's optimistic speech  delivered to committees of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  before it was burned down.    Finally, they are again trying to drag us into "speeding  things up." The colonel acknowledges that the buildings housing  our chemical munitions ensure reliable storage over an extended  period of time. At the same time, his energetic complaints about  the intractability of his fellow citizens arouse suspicion. It  turns out that, because of a predilection for adequate  resolution of ecological problems, Russia "will be unable to  effect timely implementation of the program" for chemical  weapons destruction. But why should Russia do anything at all  that is to the detriment of its citizens?    In this regard, we must pause and raise a question to be  dealt with before we can proceed further. We know that the  American program of chemical weapons destruction emerged  following, and as a result of, a 20-year debate between the  military and people residing in the vicinity of the bases for  the storage (and destruction) of chemical weapons. Residents met  the military halfway only after being convinced of the absolute  safety of the technology of destruction, not to mention  everyday, purely economic interests. It was only after attaining  a consensus with its populace that the United States embarked  upon the official signing of the international Convention on  Chemical Disarmament.    Why has not a similar debate begun here? I am thinking not  only about the citizens of Russia who reside in the vicinity of  the five above-mentioned bases where the most dangerous toxic  substances are stored. This problem is a matter of importance to  all the rest of the population as well.    It is all as simple as pie. They continue to consider us  bystanders. Even those who have lived so close to chemical death  for decades.    Returning to the beginning of this article, I would like to  emphasize that we can hardly permit ourselves to continue such a  negligent attitude toward our lives and our environment. Truly,  these are far more important than the selfish interests of the  colonels and generals who, originally out of a love for foreign  travel, were excessively hasty in signing the Convention, and  who now hasten to implement it with the same fervor.    Let us begin to do everything in sequence. Clearly, the  process of ecologically safe destruction of chemical weapons  cannot begin without serious -- and critical -- debate. But the  proper level of debate can be ensured only if the residents of  regions where the most toxic chemical weapons are stored unite  in protest groups and define their positions and interests. We  will not be able to run away from chemical weapons, of course.  We have been chained to them. We can safeguard our interests,  however, in the process of preparations for their destruction.    It is unimportant whether or not the groups under discussion  join our alliance or fight independently for their interests.  What is important is that the interests of people who reside in  Russia be observed first and foremost when we part from the  chemical weapons. Incidentally, this position in no way  contradicts the Convention which was concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Broad Front announced at Shangrila on 9  March that Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez is the coalition's  presidential pre-candidate. The party rejected all conditions  presented by Senator Danilo Astori to accept becoming a  candidate from the municipal capital.    During the meeting held by the leftist coalition party,  which  lasted more than six hours, Vazquez finally accepted becoming a  presidential candidate. His candidacy now will have to be  confirmed in a Broad Front national meeting. Vazquez explained  that his remarks, made 48 hours before, about preferring to be  reelected Montevideo mayor had been misunderstood.    After Vazquez accepted becoming a pre-candidate, the Broad  Front offered Sen. Danilo Astori the possibility of becoming a  candidate to be Montevideo mayor, with Vazquez' support.    Astori answered that he accepted with the condition that he  be permitted to continue heading a new political group made up  of legislators and leaders who today are considered independent  Broad Front followers.    Astori's proposal prompted a wave of comments, and even  though nothing was decided, most representatives of the 12  factions attending the meeting rejected the proposal with  similar arguments. One of the most repeated reasons to oppose  Astori's proposal was the Broad Front tradition forbidding  double candidacies. In other words, a candidate representing the  entire coalition cannot, at the same time, appear on the ticket  of one of the groups participating in the coalition.    It was agreed to recess until 16 March in order to give time  for all groups to independently analyze the issue and define who  will represent the Front in the race for Montevideo's mayoralty.    Sen. Danilo Astori declined to comment when EL PAIS asked  him  about the matter at the end of the meeting, adding that he will  talk with reporters later in the day. He said, however, that he  does not intend to resign from his plan to work for the creation  of a new group of independent Broad Front followers.    No other names of possible candidates to head Montevideo's  city hall were mentioned on 9 March in case Astori confirms he  will not become the candidate. A few days ago, the name of  Senator Mariano Arana, the Front's 1984 candidate, was mentioned  in congressional corridors as a possible candidate. At that  time, however, Arana was an "independent" and did not belong to  the Artigas Sector, the group that elected him to the Senate.    There is a formula circulating among Broad Front leaders  that  will be analyzed by the different coalition groups. This formula  has Tabare Vazquez and Sen. Danilo Astori heading all possible  tickets. [passage omitted]    After announcing the candidacy of Montevideo Mayor Tavare  Vazquez for the presidency of the Republic, Broad Front leader  Liber Seregni said the coalition now must "program the  appropriate electoral campaign."    Seregni made this remark in Shangrila (Canelones) after the  Broad Front provisional executive board meeting that gathered to  define the issue of candidacies.    Regarding the candidate for Montevideo's city hall, Seregni  said: "We are talking about it. It was proposed..., I proposed  Sen. Danilo Astori."    "We have been talking about the issue and we have been  listening -- as we appropriately should. Sen. Astori gave us his  personal opinion on the matter, and we are comparing it with the  interest of the coalition as a group. We are seeking to  harmonize Astori's rightful personal wishes with the Broad  Front's best interests," Seregni said.    The Broad Front leader added: "We have been exchanging  ideas. We have talked about a series of issues and concluded  that executive board members need to discuss the matter with  their respective grassroots. We then decided to postpone a  decision until the 16 March meeting."    Before joining the meeting of the so-called "provisional"  executive board Vazquez said: "It is just one more stage in a  process that will develop progressively into a satisfactory  political message, a very positive message for the people."    The capital's mayor said the Broad Front already has  approved  its reorganization and programmatic platform and is progressing  in its efforts to achieve a larger electoral coalition with  other political forces. "The process is proceeding very well; I  am optimistic," Vazquez said.    Meanwhile, Socialist Senator Reinaldo Gargano said the  recommendation to the highest Broad Front bodies (the plenum and  the congress) to promote Vazquez's candidacy for the presidency  of the Republic was approved unanimously and "with cheers."    "I think we have taken a very important step because the  force and attraction of this candidacy goes beyond Broad Front  borders. It is a proposal that clearly attracts citizens with  backgrounds not typical of Broad Front followers," the Socialist  senator said.</p>

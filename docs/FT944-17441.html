			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Beijing to set up HK shadow body China is to set up a special committee in Hong Kong in the run-up to the 1997 takeover to review legislation and recommend appointments to the judiciary. Beijing's announcement of a 'civil legislative committee' in direct competition with Hong Kong's Legislative Council deals another blow to Sino-British co-operation. The official China Daily reported that the new committee would 'oversee areas currently being supervised by the Legislative Council'. China was compelled to take this step after the British Hong Kong government closed the door to co-operation with China, the newspaper said. China's declaration came 48 hours after Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten made the conciliatory offer of allowing officials of his administration informal contacts with Beijing's preliminary working committee - the body set up to prepare for Chinese rule. Previously, Mr Patten had banned any contact between Hong Kong officials and the PWC whose establishment last year was widely regarded as an attempt to undermine British authority. Mr Patten made his offer in his third policy speech as governor, but China's response was dismissive. This reflects the parlous state of Sino-British relations. British officials said that while the formation of a new committee to review legislation would be 'unhelpful' the body would not come into being until it was approved next year by the National People's Congress  - China's parliament. They also noted that until 1997 the committee would serve no practical function since it would have no authority to amend or reject legislation, or make appointments. Its recommendations would not take effect until sovereignty passed to China. But these officials said that Beijing's negative reaction to Mr Patten's attempts at conciliation this week hardly augured well for increased co-operation.</p>

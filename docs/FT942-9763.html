			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Bombay SE could lift forward trading ban A six-month row over forward trading between India's stockbrokers and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog, could shortly be settled. Brokers on the Bombay Stock Exchange said yesterday that exchange officials and Sebi executives were preparing rules for the re-introduction of forward trading, which has been banned by the Sebi for the past two months. The prospect of a restart of forward trading has prompted a sharp rally in shares in recent days. The market has also been buoyed by renewed buying by foreign fund managers, partly motivated by the withdrawal of the Dollars 1bn Euro-issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the international telecommunications carrier. Money earmarked for VSNL is now flowing into other shares. The arguments over forward trading began last autumn when the Sebi launched a strong attack on a long-established informal kind of forward trading, on the grounds that it was not transparent and could easily be used for price manipulation. After failing to secure the brokers' agreement on regulatory rules, the Sebi banned forward trading altogether from March 12 and refused to be moved by brokers' protests. The ban contributed to a sharp fall in shares, exacerbated by the worldwide turmoil in stocks caused by increases in US interest rates and by profit-taking. The Sebi and the Bombay Stock Exchange declined to disclose details of their discussions.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cold turkey as Bernard Matthews warns on profits BERNARD Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat processor, yesterday warned that profits for the first half of 1992 would be significantly below the same period of last year. The shares fell 6p to close at 64p. 'The market for meat and poultry continues to be depressed,' Mr Bernard Matthews, the chairman who holds 40 per cent of the company's shares, said at yesterday's annual meeting. Mr Matthews would not make himself available for comment. In a statement he said he had nothing more to add to his comments in the annual report, published on April 2, in which he said the 1991 results 'must be considered satisfactory after taking into account the economic recession and the very depressed market for meat and poultry.' At the preliminary reporting stage Mr Matthews said that the whole bird and oven ready turkey market had been hit last year by low chicken prices. Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.2m but the final dividend of 2.5p and the total distribution of 4.5p for the year were both maintained.</p>

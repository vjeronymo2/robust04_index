			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Muddy waters - Plans to clean up the heavily polluted Baltic Sea have stumbled over funding The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted in the world, but the problem of how to clean it up and who should foot the bill has plunged politicians, bankers, and environmentalists into a lengthy controversy. This has festered even though the Baltic coastal nations - including Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Finland, Germany, and Poland - agreed more than a year ago on an Dollars 18m (Pounds 12m) plan to restore the health of the world's largest body of brackish water. The arguments have centred mainly on the lending terms of development banks and the long-term benefits of the plan. The debate came to a head at a recent conference in the Polish port city of Gdansk where more than 100 designated environmental 'hotspots' in the region were pinpointed. In what was billed as a 'resource mobilisation' meeting, it proved to be another ministerial session where leaders from eastern Europe looked for help and western European ministers pleaded poverty. However, Denmark did pledge Dollars 5m this year and an overall increase in Danish foreign development assistance in the next decade. Svend Auken, Danish environment minister, took issue with the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction and the Nordic Investment Bank. His criticism amplified the frustrations eastern European leaders have expressed for several years. Since then, the EBRD has been castigated for spending heavily on itself and being too slow to lend on new projects. 'We all had great expectations as to what the banks could offer, especially the European development banks,' says Auken. 'I must say I am not impressed with the willingness and capability of the international banks. 'Nothing will happen if the loans are only provided on market terms - that is with western guarantees and market-level interest rates and high consultants' fees to the banks. 'The banks will have to provide soft loans for this programme,' Auken adds. 'Only by doing so can they help to increase investments in environmental improvements. A sewerage treatment plant is obviously not going to make the same immediate return as a cement producing plant. So loans need to be adjusted accordingly.' The need to improve water quality in the Baltic Sea has become ever more urgent. With more than 80m people in its catchment area, it is continually flooded with dangerous concentrations of not only the typical sewerage effluents of nitrogen and phosphorous, but also more toxic substances such as PCBs, DDT, chlorine, mercury, lead, cadmium and others. 'The concentrations of organochlorine residues in fish in the Baltic proper are three to 10 times higher than in those from the North Sea,' scientists stated in a report released when the updated Baltic Sea convention was signed two years ago in Sweden. 'More than 100,000 sq km are totally dead.' Another source of pollution comes from chemical weapons dumped after the second world war. The casings for these weapons have rusted at the bottom of the sea and mustard gases and other chemicals are a particular problem in various parts of the Baltic. The deteriorating conditions in the Baltic are aggravated by geography and an unusual marine ecology. The inflow of seawater from the North Sea past the Danish and Swedish coasts is very limited and ice covers much of the Baltic in winter. Thus its ability to clean itself is much more limited compared with the North Sea or the oceans. Concentrated efforts by the Nordic nations such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark have been made to clean up the Baltic. One example is provided by modern Swedish paper and pulp mills which have drastically reduced chlorine emissions. Water quality in many of the Scandinavian coastal cities has improved to the point where fish have returned and swimming is possible for the first time in decades. But local progress has been offset by pollution emissions not only from Russia, Poland, the Baltic nations and the former East Germany, but also by increased agricultural runoff from Denmark, Finland and southern Sweden. The financial problems associated with the clean-up are not the only controversy that has erupted over the action plan. Environmental groups such as the Coalition for a Clean Baltic and Greenpeace have criticised it for its emphasis on end-of-pipe solutions such as sewerage treatment plants. 'There must be much more of an emphasis on clean technology so as to control diffuse sources of pollution like agricultural runoff,' says Jesper Grolin, a Greenpeace representative who has worked closely with Baltic Sea issues. The environmental groups have also criticised the financial problems of implementing the plan. 'Even if governments from Scandinavia and Germany and the others do not pledge the money now, they should at least commit themselves to finding it,' Grolin says. With aid loan money in short supply, several eastern European nations have attempted to help themselves. Poland has started a Bank for Environmental Protection, which has assets of more than Dollars 3bn raised from pollution licence fees charged to industry and other pollution sources. Slovakia, which also drains into the Baltic Sea basin, is expected to set up a similar bank. Poland and Slovakia have moved much further than Russia and the former Soviet satellite nations in establishing local government bodies. 'This is essential if international institutions are going to put forward loan money for a project such as a municipal sewerage treatment plant,' says Piotr Krzyzanowski, a Polish government representative working with the Baltic Sea convention. 'This is true whether it be for a soft loan or on market terms.' George Toregas, an economist with the EBRD, says it will take more than the establishment of local governments to allow loans for environment projects. 'If governments such as that of Denmark and others want us to make loans on soft terms, they have to change regulations established when the bank was set up. 'Governments run the boards of the bank and these were the rules we were given. So it is hardly fair to blame us for not allowing soft loans to eastern European nations.'</p>

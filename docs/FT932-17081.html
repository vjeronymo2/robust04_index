Naafi, the official trading organisation of the Forces, which sees an annual turnover of Pounds 430m, gets no money from the government - unlike the situation in other countries - and aims to return a surplus (Pounds 16m last year) to Service welfare funds. 'With a much more sophisticated customer base, there is actually no longer a need for the Naafi in much of the UK,' says Cullimore, 'but there is a desperate need for it in Benbecular or Northern Ireland.'

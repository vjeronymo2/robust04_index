			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Factory activity 'still in decline' ACTIVITY in manufacturing industry continued to decline in January for the seventh month in succession, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported yesterday. The institute's purchasing manager's index, which is based on a weighted average of the movements of several variables including new orders, output and employment, remained almost unchanged last month at 49.3 per cent. However, the institute said that a reading of below 50 per cent always tended to imply that activity was continuing to decline. It also found that, for the fourth successive month, the price of raw materials used by manufacturing industry showed a big increase in January thanks almost wholly to the devaluation of sterling. Consumer credit demand in the UK rose in December 1992 and may continue to increase this year according to Infolink, the independent credit information group. It said yesterday that demand for credit in the new-car loans sector was the strongest of all, growing in December by 6.9 per cent year-on-year. UK unemployment will increase by 380,000 this year and peak at 3.35m by the end of the year, according to Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank.

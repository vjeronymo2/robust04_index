			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PATRONS USE UNIVERSAL SIGN LANGUAGE;  </P> <P> CAFE AN OASIS OF QUIET IN NOISY MANILA  </P> <P> In a cozy corner of Manila's sprawling seaside Rizal Park, visitors can cool  off at an open-air coffee shop where the loudest sound is the ticking of the  cash register.  </P> <P> "I like this place. It's so quiet and peaceful," said Frenchman Henry Laborde,  sipping his morning coffee. "The waiters are deaf and mute but they are nice,"  said the 75-year-old retiree from Paris.  </P> <P> The canteen was established in 1969 by the privately run Philippine Assn. of  the Deaf (PAD). Association officials said they believe it is the only coffee  shop in the world run solely by hearing-impaired persons.  </P> <P> Simply named the PAD Coffee Shop, it has 50 employees -- a manager, cooks,  waiters, waitresses and janitors. All of them communicate through the quick  hand gestures of sign language.  </P> <P> Only Rodolfo Soriao, PAD director for food services, and a security guard are  not hearing handicapped.  </P> <P> Surrounded by acacia trees in the expansive park at the edge of sparkling  Manila Bay, the 250-seat open-air coffee shop is a favorite of foreigners and  Filipinos who yearn for some peace and quiet in crowded Manila.  </P> <P> Soriao said hearing-impaired from other countries also love to visit the place,  which is open 24 hours, because "they know that the sign language is universal  and they can communicate with each other."  </P> <P> Roofed with galvanized iron, the coffee shop has no walls. Breezes from the bay  keep it free of pollution from smoke-belching buses plying the crowded tourist  district and from smoke from a nearby oil-fired power plant.  </P> <P> Small gardens surrounding the restaurant filter noise from the traffic and from  a nearby business district. Steel chairs and tables are neatly lined in rows on  the concrete pavement.  </P> <P> Within full view is the park's huge fountain in front of the restaurant and the  elegant Manila Hotel across the grassy expanse.  </P> <P> As a client finds a table, he signals the waiter. Sometimes it takes more than  one signal because the waiter may be involved in joking or gossiping with  friends.  </P> <P> The waiter hands over a menu on which the customer is advised in bold letters:  "You are being served by the deaf." With the menu is a ballpoint pen and a  blank receipt where the customer jots down his order.  </P> <P> Soriao said the waiters know how to read and count. Most of them have completed  an elementary and high school education at an institution also run by the  association and partially paid for by the coffee shop. Employees also have been  given professional training.  </P> <P> "They are very industrious," Soriao said. "They have to be because they know  that they cannot easily find jobs outside this place. They're enjoyable to be  with and there is less intrigue here."  </P> <P> But Soriao said their handicaps sometimes hamper their work. For example, he  said, when they engage in conversation while washing the dishes, they waste  time because they have to stop and use their hands to communicate.  </P> <P> Bound by the common silence of their world, the employees find the canteen to  be as comfortable as home.  </P> <P> "When we go out we feel inferior because we become the butt of jokes," head  waiter Mises Castro said through an interpreter. "This is our small world."  </P> <P> But hard times have caught up with the business, Soriao said. Profit is barely  enough to subsidize the school, which offers free education to poor students.  </P> <P> Donations from private institutions in other countries such as Japan, West  Germany and even China have been of great help to the organization, Soriao  said.  </P> <P> Work in the canteen also has been rewarding to its employees.  </P> <P> Lila del Rosario, 57, the cheerful chief cook, and her husband, Ernesto, have  been working in the restaurant since 1971 and have been able to see their three  children through college as a result.  </P> <P> Soriao said most of the married employees have met their spouses in the  restaurant.  </P> <P> Children of the coffee shop employees who have inherited their parents'  handicap also often end up working in the restaurant.  </P> <P> "The anti-nepotism law cannot be applied here," Soriao said.  </P></p>

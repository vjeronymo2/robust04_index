			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L MOP-UP AGENCY;  </P> <P> HISTORY'S BIGGEST FIRE SALE  </P> <P> Its assets include a racehorse with syphilis, the world's first vertical  country club and the shell of a luxury condominium on a rocky ledge in Puerto  Rico.  </P> <P> In fact, the Resolution Trust Corp., which conducted its first business on  Thursday, will be the largest financial institution in the world.  </P> <P> To the RTC falls the distasteful task of being garbage man of the  savings-and-loan crisis, the agency that must clean up the littered streets  after an orgy of mismanagement, miscalculation, greed and outright theft.  </P> <P> The newest federal agency opened for business with a bulging portfolio of $104  billion worth of assets from the 262 failing S&amp;Ls that federal regulators  have seized since February. In the next two or three years, the RTC is expected  to close several hundred more S&amp;Ls and accumulate assets nominally worth as  much as $400 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Healthy Portfolios  </P> <P> The RTC will sell the healthy portions of the savings institutions it takes  over, such as portfolios of home loans.  </P> <P> That should be easy. The far trickier job will be disposing of the undesirable  real estate and problematic business ventures -- the churches built on  speculation, the shopping centers 10 miles from the nearest homes, the sperm  bank for buffalo. As much as $150 billion of the RTC's $400 billion in assets  is likely to be in this category.  </P> <P> "We're not having a thrift crisis. What we're having is a real estate crisis,"  said Jamie J. Jackson, president of Oak Tree Capital, a merchant banking firm  active in S&amp;L rescues. "The RTC will become the largest real estate owner  and manager in the history of the world."  </P> <P> Jackson said the agency will function as a property "undertaker, handling  bodies all over the United States."  </P> <P> The more the RTC makes, the better for the taxpayers, because money from the  sale of the assets will help pay the cost of making good on federal deposit  insurance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6 Distressed States  </P> <P> The new law lists six economically distressed states -- Texas, Oklahoma,  Colorado, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico -- where the RTC cannot sell a  property for less than 95% of market value. That may be a difficult goal to  reach, but Congress feared that excessive bargains would depress  already-lackluster markets.  </P> <P> "If they do too much too fast, they glut the market," said Mark J. Riedy,  president of the National Council of Savings Institutions. "If they do too  little too late, it raises the cost to taxpayers."  </P> <P> This biggest going-out-of-business sale in history is drawing swarms of eager  players. In Washington on Tuesday, a day before the RTC was born, more than 300  deal makers, accountants, lawyers, auctioneers, bankers and S&amp;L executives  jammed into a standing-room-only conference on the new agency.  </P> <P> "The noise up here is almost deafening," Riedy joked at the speaker's rostrum.  "From the podium, I can hear your meters ticking."  </P> <P> A worried Rep. Elizabeth (Liz) J. Patterson (D-S.C.) said recently: "There are  people out there waiting to pick the Resolution Trust Corp.'s pocket before it  has its pants on."  </P> <P> The potential "for scandal is tremendous," said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).  </P> <P> Guarding against scandal and setting RTC policies will be the responsibility of  an oversight board composed of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Federal  Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development Jack Kemp and two private citizens to be named by Bush.  </P> <P> On a daily operating basis, the RTC will be directed by L. William Seidman,  chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates banks and  guarantees their deposits up to $100,000.  </P> <P> The FDIC, which will supply all personnel for the RTC, expects to hire several  thousand new workers to keep track of the huge volume of real estate and other  assets that must be sold. Beyond that, the RTC will hire a small army of  subcontractors as property managers, disposal experts, sales agents and  auctioneers.  </P> <P> The new S&amp;L legislation orders the RTC to publish an inventory of all its  properties by January, a virtually impossible task. A few of the more bizarre  investments, such as the syphillitic horse, are widely known in the financial  community, although there are few details. But for the most part, the bankrupt  institutions being seized by the government are precisely the ones that have  been mismanaged by executives who kept sloppy records or none at all.  </P> <P> "It will take a lot more than four months to get your hands around the  inventory," said John A. Koskinen, chief executive of the Palmieri Co. in  Washington, which specializes in managing troubled companies. When his firm  worked on the Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy, he said, it took a full year  simply to locate the records for all of the 8,500 properties owned by the  company.  </P> <P> Koskinen's firm has encountered similar chaotic record-keeping while running  S&amp;Ls as a conservator on behalf of the government. For example, there were  scanty files on real estate loans with no information on how much money was  advanced, how much had been repaid or what had been offered as collateral. Some  loans for motels did not show the correct number of rooms.  </P> <P> Making it even harder to get a correct inventory is a severe shortage of  professionals to appraise and help sell properties.  </P> <P> Appraisers in Texas, the heartland of failed thrifts and repossessed real  estate, are in desperately short supply, said G. Ronald Witten, president of  the Dallas real estate research firm M/PF Research. The backlog of work already  stretches for two months and more, he said.  </P> <P> Unraveling the ownership of seized real estate could take years. Many  properties were held as joint ventures by various investors and had numerous  lenders. Title questions on some properties may take five years or more to  resolve, according to real estate experts familiar with properties the RTC will  control.  </P> <P> Those disputes will likely end up in court. Some real estate consultants  predict that as many as 100,000 civil lawsuits -- 15,000 more than were filed  in Los Angeles County last year for all purposes -- will swamp the RTC as  lenders and investors fight for the scraps of assets.  </P> <P> A shrewd eye and sound judgment will be needed to find the salvageable  properties -- the empty office buildings that can be rented with a bit of  renovation, the tracts of homes that can be completed and sold at a profit.  </P> <P> The RTC will first try to sell seized S&amp;Ls whole to healthy thrifts and  banks seeking to expand their branch networks and deposits. But when the  portfolios of bad real estate are too big, the RTC will have to strip out the  losing assets before making a deal to sell an S&amp;L.  </P> <P> "It's not Wilshire Boulevard property, it's primarily junk," said Joseph E.  Robert, chairman and chief executive of J. E. Robert Cos., an Alexandria, Va.,  firm that manages troubled loans and assets for government agencies.  </P> <P> William L. Callender, chief executive of California Federal Bank in Los  Angeles, has reviewed the portfolios of troubled thrifts, looking at assets  that he says are so bad they cannot be given away. The properties include  time-share vacation condominiums in Louisiana that look out over oil rigs and  apartment buildings with three-quarters of their units vacant.  </P> <P> And then there's the case of the vertical "country club." It's a club in a  high-rise building chock-full of recreational facilities but unfortunately  lacking a golf course.  </P> <P> Many of the assets are "totally unsellable at virtually any price," Callender  said.  </P> <P> But the RTC's mission under the law is to dispose of the properties  </P> <P> by Dec. 31, 1996, when it is scheduled to go out of business. The logistics of  disposing of such a huge portfolio are staggering.  </P> <P> "If you sold $10 million of real estate each day seven days a week for 365 days  a year, it would take 28 years just to sell $100 billion, and that's without a  day off," said James Gall, president of the Auction Co. of America, a  Miami-based firm used by the FDIC to sell assets from seized banks.  </P> <P> Gall hopes to snare a chunk of business from the RTC and the property managers  it hires. Arguing that auctions can help move an otherwise stagnant market, he  notes that his firm recently sold for $2.7 million a San Francisco condominium  that had stood empty for two years at a $3.1-million asking price.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Knows It's a Hard Sell  </P> <P> Merrill Butler knows from experience how hard it is to sell the holdings of  defunct S&amp;Ls. He handled the disposition of the bad assets of  Stockton-based American Savings &amp; Loan, which was seized by federal  regulators and sold to a private investor, Robert M. Bass of Texas.  </P> <P> Despite a major effort, Butler told a seminar in June: "We still have under  property management 1,700 condos, 540 single-family detached units, 8,000  apartment units, 2,500 acres of land, 13 hotels/motels with 2,400 rooms, 1.725  million square feet of retail space, 3.19 million of office space, a  kitty-litter mine, one marina with boat slips, the nation's largest indoor flea  market, one winery and one truck stop -- and a few other little parcels."  </P> <P> Even if all of RTC's assets were good, who has the money to buy them?  </P> <P> Japanese investors have spent huge amounts of money in recent years buying  choice U.S. real estate. Yet the Japanese own only $43 billion worth of such  property, compared with the $150 billion in undesirable properties the RTC may  control.  </P> <P> Some markets, especially in depressed Texas and Oklahoma, are already burdened  with real estate seized by S&amp;Ls when loans went bad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $3 Billion in California  </P> <P> As of March, U.S. thrifts owned about $31 billion in real estate that they had  taken back from buyers. About $3 billion of it was in California, second only  to the $16 billion worth of properties in Texas. Despite the comparatively big  holdings in California, experts expect little or no impact on the state's  healthy and diversified real estate market.  </P> <P> Even with a huge addition to the ranks of foreclosed properties as the RTC  proceeds, "we wouldn't even notice it," said Stan Ross, co-managing partner  with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based accounting firm  specializing in national real estate.  </P> <P> Robert A. Rosenblatt reported from Washington and James Bates from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPOSSESSED S&amp;L ASSETS  </P> <P> In millions of dollars as of March 31, 1989  </P> <P> States With Most

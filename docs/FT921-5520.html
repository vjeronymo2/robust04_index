			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Spectre of Le Pen stalks Marseilles ghetto: The advance of the French National Front in regional polls IN THE Maghrebin ghettos in the northern suburbs of Marseilles, parents warn their children that if they do not go to bed on time, Jean-Marie Le Pen will come to get them. The extreme right-wing National Front (FN), which Mr Le Pen leads, has made Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur (Paca), the Mediterranean region of which Marseilles is the capital, its main battleground for regional elections on March 22. Paca and Marseilles in particular are fertile ground for the FN's anti-immigrant policies, with the region's blend of high immigration and heavy unemployment. 'The old right, anti-Semitic and xenophobic, have traditionally been strongest here. . . . Yet this is also one of the most cosmopolitan regions of France,' says Mrs Edmonde Charles-Roux, the writer who is widow of the resistance hero and former Socialist mayor of Marseilles, Gaston Defferre. So it is that the FN has been getting 27 per cent of the vote in recent opinion polls in Paca; roughly twice its score in the rest of France and only three points behind Paca's ruling conservative UDF-RPR coalition. The FN is also well ahead of the 18 per cent of millionaire businessman and Marseilles football club owner Bernard Tapie, standing as an independent supporter of President Francois Mitterrand. Marseilles was where the FN first made its mark, when it started getting more than a quarter of the votes in central parts of the city in the 1985 cantonal polls. Among its core supporters are former French settlers in Algeria, or pieds noirs, who returned to France in the early 1960s after Algerian independence. But as elsewhere in France, the FN has also attracted protest votes, against the perceived dullness of the mainstream parties' policies and their failure to tackle unemployment. In Paca, the FN has also had the good luck to escape the recent political scandals which followed the brief arrest of the head of staff of Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, the conservative president of the region, over an alleged attempt - denied  - to discredit Mr Tapie. Against this murky background, Mr Le Pen looks like 'a knight on a white horse' to many voters, says one commentator. But Mrs Charles-Roux sees a 'real parallel' with the rise of Nazism, for her a frightening childhood memory as daughter of the French ambassador to Prague in the 1930s. 'Young people have no point of reference. They simply don't realise the danger,' she warns. Mr Robert Vigouroux, the city's left-wing mayor, believes the FN could be in part a temporary phenomenon, but still argues that there is a worrying parallel with the rise of fascism in the poorer regions of southern Italy - for similar reasons  - in the 1930s. 'It just goes to show that it is a mistake for the government to forget the south,' Mr Vigouroux warns. So it is no surprise that FN's top men, Mr Le Pen and his deputy Mr Bruno Megret, have both seized on Paca as the ideal place to make their mark and are standing in the region's two biggest departements or districts. Their message is as extreme in Paca as anywhere else: 'Marseilles has always been a gateway to the orient. But it must be a gateway through which people leave, not enter,' says Mr Ronald Perdomo, an FN regional councillor. The FN is the third group on the regional council after the UDF-RPR and the Socialists. Observers believe they have a real chance of getting a small relative majority on the council this time if there are many abstentions. 'It is a serious risk because FN voters will always turn out, while the abstentions will come from the centre,' says Mr Vigouroux. But even if the FN does not end up as the largest party, it could easily be so close behind the centre right that the regional council will be hard to govern - and local UDF-RPR politicians insist that they are not prepared to strike an alliance with Mr Le Pen. 'That is unthinkable,' says Prof Jean-Francois Mattei, a UDF member of parliament for central Marseilles. To the casual visitor, Marseilles does not look like a hotbed of extremism. Certainly, the acres of empty warehouses along the quays testify to the slow death of its port and some areas are desperately poor. But it is notable that the city has not been touched by the outbreaks of urban violence that have marred less poor parts of France over the past two years. The number of immigrants in the region is only slightly above the national average at 7 per cent of the population, according to Insee, the state statistics body, though the FN claims that it is more than double that. Unemployment, at 11.6 per cent, is two points above the national average Paca's problem is that it not only has France's fastest growing population but is also its most urbanised region, with nearly 80 per cent of the people living in the big port cities. Of course, the poverty is concentrated, with joblessness rising above 40 per cent in some city areas, and all this is next door to some of France's plushest resorts. As elsewhere in France, the regional election result will have more national than local importance. The powers of regional councils are limited: mainly high schools and roads, which are hardly likely to excite the populace at large - and the election is being fought on national issues. Paca is the main indicator of how the FN will do in general elections next year, the European poll in 1994 and the presidential election in 1995. 'We are at the beginning of what could be a complete change in the French political landscape,' says Prof Mattei.</p>

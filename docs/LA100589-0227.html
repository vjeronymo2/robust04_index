			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DISNEY CHARACTERS BOMBARDED AS COMPANY OFFERS PARIS SHARES  </P> <P> Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Pluto met a shower of ketchup and eggs on the  steps of the Bourse, the Paris stock exchange, today.  </P> <P> The sticky barrage was hurled by about 100 French communist demonstrators  seeking to spoil a party organized to announce the offer price of shares in  Europe's Disneyland.  </P> <P> Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., who was in Paris to announce the  offer price of $11.20 a share, was also a target for the missiles, along with  people dressed up in suits depicting other Disney characters.  </P> <P> The shares are being floated to help finance construction of a new Disney theme  park on the outskirts of Paris.  </P> <P> Demonstrators yelling "Mickey go home!" and "EuroDisneyland: dirty deal of the  century!" also showered onlookers with fake $500 bills as Disney executives  looked on. No police were present.  </P> <P> Eisner said the demonstration had nothing to do with Disney. "Those people were  asking for more money from the government. These local issues are not related  to the Disney company."  </P> <P> "Who could possibly be against Cinderella and Snow White? EuroDisneyland is  going to create 12,000 jobs in France," said Disney's European chief, Frank  Fitzpatrick.  </P> <P> Plans to celebrate the share launch with dancing in front of the Bourse were  called off after the demonstration.  </P></p>

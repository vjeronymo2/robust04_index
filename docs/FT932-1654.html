			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Safety move starts row on whose rules rule the waves: EC plans for safer seas have prompted concern about regional regimes on top of globally accepted conventions YOU WOULD have thought nothing could be controversial about improving safety at sea - particularly in the light of public anxiety over a spate of oil tanker accidents in European waters. Yet the European Commission has found itself in a row with the shipping industry over its plans to introduce a series of measures aimed at eliminating sub-standard vessels and crews from the Community. Concern about safety has been triggered by three recent tanker accidents in Community waters: the grounding of the Aegean Sea off the Spanish coast in December, the breaking up of the Braer off the UK coast in January, and the collision involving the British Trent off the Belgian coast earlier this month. As things stand, the safety rules intended to prevent accidents such as these are laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, a United Nations agency, through a framework of internationally accepted conventions and protocols. Even before the spate of European accidents began, however, the Commission had been considering independent action to toughen up on maritime safety within the Community: within days of the British Trent collision, EC transport ministers had put their names to a proposed common policy on safe seas calling for EC legislation to improve shipping standards. Examples of the measures planned are the development of common criteria for more thorough inspections of ships when they are in port, together with criteria for detaining or refusing access to ships which do not meet international standards; common standards for the classification societies which guarantee vessels' seaworthiness; minimum standards of training for crews; and better reporting systems for vessels carrying dangerous or potentially polluting cargoes. On the face of it, European shipowners might be expected to welcome the measures. After all, EC member states tend towards the upper end of the global league table when it comes to maritime safety, so tougher standards will operate to the advantage of EC shipowners by hitting their low-cost, low-standard competitors. According to Mr David Tomlinson, secretary general of the Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Associations, the measures also come at a time when the industry is keen to improve its tarnished image. 'Responsible shipowners everywhere believe safety standards have slipped,' Mr Tomlinson says. 'There is a recognition that things have not been as good as they should have been, and that everybody ought to pull their socks up.' Nevertheless, shipowners are acutely concerned over the EC safe seas policy  -not because they are at odds with the sentiments underlying it, but because of where it is coming from. The shipowners stress that shipping is a global industry, not a regional or local one, and therefore has to operate within the parameters of a globally-agreed set of rules. If national or regional governments start imposing their own sets of rules for vessels operating in their waters, they say, the result will be chaos. The International Chamber of Shipping, which speaks for the national shipowners' associations of the world's biggest maritime nations, says it is 'desperately keen to avoid' any suggestion that a regional regulatory regime should be interposed on a body of globally-accepted conventions. Mr Chris Horrocks, the chamber's secretary general, says shipowners are at present required to conform to a set of global regulations which are as acceptable in, say, Argentina as they are in Australia. 'What they do not want to find is that they are suddenly having to cope with marginally different regimes which make it a matter of uncertainty as to whether they are in compliance with the law in country A, B or C' EC transport ministers who support the safe seas policy, such as Britain's Mr John MacGregor, say this is to miss the point of the proposals. The idea is not to set new standards, they say, but to introduce more rigorous enforcement of the existing ones. The policy goes out of its way to stress the importance of operating within the framework laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, the commission says. The shipowners, however, are far from convinced. Mr Horrocks detects the hand of ambitious 'Eurocrats'. 'It's an attitude of mind coming down from Brussels that we find extremely worrying.' The commission is hoping to get its policy enshrined in legislation by the end of the year, but it has already had to tone the contents down in response to the shipping industry's anxieties. If shipowners get their way, the policy will be torpedoed.</p>

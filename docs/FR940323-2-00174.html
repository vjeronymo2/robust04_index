			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the Secretary returns an SAR to a student for verification of certain data items included on the application or notifies an institution through an ISIR that a student needs to verify application information, the student must verify the information. The student verifies the information on the SAR, and returns the SAR in the same manner as described for required corrections. This request for verification is separate and apart from the verification requirements contained in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Correction of Inaccurate Information_If an SAR or an ISIR reflects information that was inaccurate when the application was signed, the student must correct that information on the SAR and send the SAR to the appropriate address listed in table I or submit the change electronically. The SAR must be received at that address no later than August 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the corrected information may be transmitted electronically to the central processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recomputation of EFC_A student may request on his or her SAR that the Secretary recompute his or her EFC if the student believes the EFC is inaccurate because of an arithmetic or clerical error. The student must return the SAR to the appropriate address listed in table I, and that SAR must be received at the appropriate address no later than August 1, 1994. If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the request for a recomputation may be transmitted electronically to the central processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Request for Duplicate SAR_If a student wishes to receive a duplicate SAR, the student may write to the appropriate agency's address listed in table I or call the appropriate agency's telephone number listed in table I. All written and telephone requests must be received no later than August 1, 1994. A written request sent to the appropriate agency (listed in table I) must be received through a U.S. Postal facility by August 1, 1994. Individuals at the agencies listed in table I are not authorized to personally accept hand-delivered documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Although corrections and requests for a duplicate SAR will be processed through August 1, 1994, this deadline date does not extend the deadline date by which a student must submit to the institution's financial aid office his or her valid SAR, valid ESAR, or valid ISIR with an EFC that permits the student to receive a Federal Pell Grant. If the student does not submit such a valid SAR, valid ESAR, or valid ISIR to the financial aid office by his or her last date of enrollment or June 30, 1994, whichever is earlier, he or she will be ineligible for a Federal Pell Grant award for the 1993&hyph;94 award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

Verification of Information on Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a student is selected to have the information on his or her application verified under the verification procedures set forth in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668, subpart E), he or she must submit the requested documents as specified below in steps 1&hyph;4. The deadline date for the completion of these steps is the earlier of 60 days after the student's last date of enrollment for a student who leaves school because of graduation, completion of an academic term, or withdrawal; or August 30, 1994. A student who will still be enrolled in a course of study in the 1993&hyph;94 award year after August 30, 1994, must submit the requested documents by August 30, 1994.

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO A SLAIN ATHLETE  </P> <P> The 2,000 students of John Glenn High School in Norwalk filled the school's  quad Thursday for an emotional memorial service for Juan Enriquez, 18, a senior  football and wrestling star who was killed Tuesday in a drive-by shooting near  his south Norwalk home. Students carried red, white and blue balloons and the  football players wore their red jerseys.  </P> <P> "Only a few days ago he was playing out here with everyone who was close to  him," Principal Elias Galvan said, speaking at a podium decorated with  Enriquez's letterman's jacket. "He always had a smile and friends around him.  He always had a sense of pride and dignity. He did things to improve the image  of John Glenn High School."  </P> <P> Anger was expressed at gang activity.  </P> <P> Mayor Grace Napolitano said: "I'm speechless. It can't happen to us, but it can  and it did. We have had enough, guys, enough of the violence, enough of the  drugs. All of you have a responsibility to this (Enriquez) family, to yourself  and to the community to cure what the heck is going on in this community. Until  you wake up and start making a difference, who's going to be next?"  </P> <P> Ernie Gutierrez, a football player, directed his comments at any gang members  who might have been in the audience: "Chaka wasn't even in a gang . . . what do  you think the chances are for you?" Football Coach Willie Norman announced that  Enriquez's football jersey, No. 77, would be retired. The jersey he wore last  season was given to his mother, Theresa Enriquez, who sat on the stage with her  family and Caprice Fimbres, who had been Enriquez's girlfriend.  </P> <P> Tearful students expressed their feelings for Enriquez by sharing their  memories of him and by reading poems they had written.  </P> <P> Students also placed wreaths on the sidewalk at Horst Avenue and Algardi Street  where Enriquez was gunned down. Football and wrestling jerseys with memorial  messages written on them were left at the scene. Students also scribbled  messages on the pavement.  </P> <P> Members of Enriquez's family, including his mother, also visited the student  memorial.  </P></p>

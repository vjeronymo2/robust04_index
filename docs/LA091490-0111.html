			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL ALIENS ON FREEWAYS TO BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY  </P> <P> In a major policy change, the U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol  announced Thursday that they will begin apprehending undocumented aliens who  gather on freeway medians, in a plan to reduce the number of deaths occurring  when migrants dash across the highway and are struck by motorists.  </P> <P> Border Patrol and CHP officials said the new policy, which became effective  Wednesday, was instituted because the old one sometimes encouraged hundreds of  illegal aliens to loiter on freeway medians, knowing the Border Patrol would  not try to arrest them there.  </P> <P> Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said the previous policy prohibited agents  from attempting to apprehend aliens on medians "for obvious safety reasons."  </P> <P> "What we have been trying has not been working. People are still getting  killed, and that is unacceptable," Swofford said. " . . . We will try to  implement the new policy in a very cautious manner. We're not putting a lot of  pressure on them. We're pulling over on the median well away from them, so they  don't panic and run out in front of traffic."  </P> <P> However, Swofford said agents will pursue migrants who try to evade arrest.  </P> <P> "We'll try to do it as safely as we possible can," Swofford added.  </P> <P> According to figures released by the California Rural Legal Assistance, 83  illegal migrants have been killed on San Diego-area freeways within 5 miles of  the border since 1987. An additional 33 have died during the same period near  the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre in North County when they were hit  by cars traveling on Interstate 5.  </P> <P> On their trek north, illegal aliens frequently hide or wait on freeway medians  until they are picked up by smugglers who transport them away from the border.  Most of the migrants, especially those from the interior of Mexico, have never  seen a freeway and are unable to gauge a car's speed.  </P> <P> Deaths usually occur when they attempt to cross a busy freeway to get to the  median. At San Onofre, migrants are frequently killed when they try to  circumvent the INS checkpoint by jumping out of smugglers' vehicles and running  west -- across eight lanes of traffic -- to the beach. After walking north past  the checkpoint, they then recross the freeway and are picked up by the  smugglers to continue their northward journeys.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation has attempted to curb mounting  freeway deaths by posting signs to warn motorists in areas where aliens  congregate on the median. Lights have also been installed on freeway stretches  where aliens are known to gather. However, those efforts have met with little  success.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Jim Anderson said the CHP will assist the Border Patrol "only on a  casual basis" and will not respond every time agents attempt to arrest migrants  hiding on the median.  </P> <P> "If an officer can safely approach them on the median, we will detain them and  hand them over to the Border Patrol," Anderson said.  </P> <P> The new policy will be effective only in the San Diego area and not at San  Onofre, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Migrant rights activists immediately attacked the new policy.  </P> <P> "It's a totally irresponsible and reckless policy," said Roberto Martinez of  the American Friends Service Committee, a migrants rights group. "They're  gathering at the median to get away from the Border Patrol. When the Border  Patrol shows its presence, they will start dashing in and out of the freeway  again.  </P> <P> "The Border Patrol is jeopardizing people's lives just to apprehend them. . . .  Renewing this policy is like taking one step forward and two steps back,"  Martinez added.  </P> <P> Despite the criticism, CHP and Border Patrol officials said they will go ahead  with the apprehensions.  </P> <P> "We've had 80-some people killed over the past few years. Do you just sit there  and say that's an acceptable toll?" asked the CHP's Anderson. "This is almost  our last alternative. We've tried posting signs, installing freeway lights and  handing out leaflets at the border. Nothing has worked in the past."  </P> <P> According to Anderson, the CHP and Border Patrol have apprehended up to 300  aliens at one time on a freeway median. Some CHP cars have been pelted by rocks  thrown by aliens loitering on the medians, he added.  </P> <P> Swofford complained that critics of the policy would complain regardless of  what the Border Patrol did.  </P> <P> "If we can get people used to the idea that they cannot go out on the freeway,  these killings will stop," Swofford said.  </P> <P> Anderson said CHP officers will also be enforcing the law that prohibits  pedestrians on the freeway.  </P> <P> "Do they want to just let these people get run over and ignore the fact that  they're also breaking the law?" Anderson asked. "They're entering the country  illegally and breaking the law against pedestrians on the freeway."  </P> <P> Martinez countered that CHP officers are in effect going to be enforcing U.S.  immigration laws by getting involved in the apprehensions. "This is totally out  of their jurisdiction. They are only going to exacerbate the problem because it  will put more officers chasing people on the freeway," Martinez said. He said  the change in policy is premature and accused the CHP and Border Patrol of  acting unilaterally when both agencies are members of an advisory committee  formed by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) to find a solution to the  freeway deaths.  </P> <P> "They completely ignored what we're trying to do in the committee," Martinez  said. "It's very upsetting. We've been meeting for about six months, and they  go on and implement this policy on their own."  </P> <P> In a related matter, Martinez and California Rural Legal Assistance attorneys  wrote a letter to INS Commissioner Gene McNary, asking him to review Border  Patrol policy on chasing aliens on freeways.  </P></p>

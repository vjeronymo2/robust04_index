			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The Slovak Workers'  Association (ZRS), a newcomer to the Slovak political scene,  came fourth in March popularity polls of political parties,  Slovak Radio said today. Over five percent of the respondents  preferred the ZRS.    The news has aroused foreign interest, as evidenced by  today's talks between ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak and British  Ambassador in Slovakia David Bright.    Speaking on the radio, Luptak said Bright had been  interested  by the (blue collar) workers' negative attitude to market  economy being introduced throughout Slovakia. [sentence as  received]    "It is impossible to privatize quickly and at the same time  justly," Luptak said, pointing to the privatization of British  Rail, whose privatization he said has been going on for twenty  years despite Britain having a healthier economy (than Slovakia).    "The ZRS has made contacts with the international workers'  movement and is especially interested in the policy of the  Norwegian Workers' Party which won the latest elections," Luptak  said.</p>

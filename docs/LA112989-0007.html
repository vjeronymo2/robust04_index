			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAMMAR  </P> <P> Jerry Colburn argues that low achievement in writing is the result of "junking  the grammar lesson" and a failure to correct errors ("The Ostrich Method of  English Grammar," California Commentary, Nov. 20). Research over several  decades, however, has shown that direct teaching of grammar and error  correction has little or no effect on student writing. The research does show  that students who read more read better, write better, have larger  vocabularies, and even do better on grammar tests. Our students need good  literature programs and improved school libraries, not more sentence  diagramming.  </P> <P> STEPHEN KRASHEN  </P> <P> Professor of Linguistics  </P> <P> USC  </P></p>

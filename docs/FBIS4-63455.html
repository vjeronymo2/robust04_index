			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior source in the Ukrainian president's staff  has criticized Russian President Boris Yeltsin's comments on a  telephone conversation he had on Friday with his Ukrainian  counterpart, Leonid Kravchuk.    The comments, made in a television interview, "do not  reflect  the real content of the conversation," the source told  INTERFAX-Ukraine.    He said Yeltsin's words that "the main thing is that neither  Ukraine nor Russia should interfere in Crimean affairs" were  "surprising." They suggested that Russia, in its relationship  with Crimea, would like to have the same status as Ukraine, of  which Crimea is part.    As for Yeltsin's statement that Ukraine must not use force  against Crimea, the source said, "Ukraine is an independent  state, and the methods it uses to solve its internal problems  depend solely on the will of its people and parliament.  Undoubtedly those methods would meet the Constitution and laws  of Ukraine. Ukraine has observed and does observe international  legal standards."    "What was also surprising was the rhetoric of the Russian  president, who was speaking about the Ukrainian president in a  disrespectful and admonishing manner," the source continued.    "The statement of the president of the Russian Federation  would be much more constructive if he appealed to the  separatists in the Republic of Crimea not to put in jeopardy  peace in the region," the source summed up.</p>

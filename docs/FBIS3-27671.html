			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zong He (1350 4421): "While Inspecting Grass-Roots </F> Units Recently, Lu Rongjing Stressed: Value Opportunities, Pay  Attention To Refraining From Complacency, Press On to the Finish  Without Letup, and Sustain the Favorable Momentum for  Development"]    [Text] We are at a crucial stage whereby, if we push on, we  may succeed, whereas if we slacken our efforts, we will fail.  Various localities must comprehensively understand and  earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th (enlarged) plenum  of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee; we must  persistently endure hardships, press on to the finish without  letup, seize favorable opportunities and make progress, and  strive in every possible way to sustain the favorable momentum  for development. These views have been repeatedly stressed by  Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui provincial party committee,  during his recent inspection tour of grass-roots units.    Lu Rongjing was inspecting and conducting research in  various  localities including Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Shitai,  Guichi, and Dongzhi from 15 to 22 January. He was particularly  interested in learning how the guidelines of the 10th (enlarged)  plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee have been  implemented. He braved severe cold and snowstorms, visited  deeply in rural areas and enterprises, and studied the actual  situation through personal contacts. He also held extensive  discussions with grass-roots cadres and the masses. Wherever he  went, he fully affirmed and commended cadres and the masses for  their optimistic spirits and for the large number of laudable  examples among them.    Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's current situation is very good.  Various localities are earnestly formulating and promptly  implementing 1994's tasks according to the requirements of the  provincial party committee and government. However, we should  also notice that progress has not been balanced enough. After  achieving certain accomplishments in 1993, some localities  expressed the idea that they should take a rest, and they  somewhat slackened their efforts in arranging and carrying out  their work. We must attach importance to such a situation. Our  efforts should be enhanced but not slackened, and our enthusiasm  should be increased but not reduced. Various localities,  especially leading comrades at various levels, must continue to  be level-headed, and must not slacken their efforts or  vigilance. We should value the excellent conditions, should  seize rare opportunities, should continually promote the efforts  and enthusiasm we displayed in our work in 1993, and should  continue to make new efforts so as to attain a higher level of  fresh accomplishments.    Lu Rongjing pointed out: A whole year's work depends on a  good start in the spring. We should pay closer and closer  attention to various tasks, without any letup, at the beginning  of the year. Otherwise, if we are sluggish at the beginning, our  initial passivity will make us lag throughout the year. At  present, the situation is progressing very favorably: Everyone  is competing with one another. Stopping or moving slowly is  considered regression. Time passes very swiftly, and it will be  very difficult to catch up later. All of us must fully  understand the aforementioned concept. The Spring Festival is  approaching very soon. Our tasks in various fields are very  heavy. We should make overall plans after taking all factors  into consideration, should emphasize key tasks, and should  properly make corresponding arrangements. While strictly and  properly carrying out various other tasks, we should not  slacken, even for a moment, our efforts, particularly on  economic work, so as to lay a good foundation for competently  completing all the tasks in 1994.       Lu Rongjing stressed: Our key to accomplishing the tasks  laid down by the 10th plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party  committee lies in strictly carrying out various tasks. At  present, our reform tasks have entered a stage whereby we have  to comprehensively resolve tough problems and a lot of work has  become more complicated. They include ways to fulfill the  requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, how to  further invigorate enterprises, how to gear up for the market,  and ways to accelerate economic restructuring in the  agricultural sector. We need to make great efforts to study and  resolve many deep-seated contradictions and problems in the  aforementioned issues. Leading cadres at various levels should  truly involve themselves, should earnestly collect and  understand firsthand information, should conscientiously  summarize the creative work of the broad masses of cadres and  people during their actual practice of it, and should provide  specific guidance under various categories so as to help cadres  and people at the lower level promptly resolve their actual  existing problems. We should implement a rigorous  responsibility system so that every task will be earnestly  carried out.    Wherever he went, Lu Rongjing visited peasants' families,  expressed concern for their well-being, and meticulously  inquired about their production and lives. He repeatedly told  local responsible cadres who accompanied him: We must be  concerned for the masses' lives. We must warmly express  concerns, particularly for households which have been guaranteed  that they will be provided with clothing, food, housing, and  medical services during their lifetimes, and funeral services  when they die; for destitute families, and for dependents and  family members of active-duty service members and of  revolutionary martyrs. We must constantly get to know their  living conditions and must render timely assistance to them if  they have difficulties. Before the Spring Festival arrives,  various localities should mobilize and organize personnel in  various sectors to launch warmth-extending campaigns so as to  enable the broad masses of people to happily enjoy a pleasant  lunar new year.    During his inspection tour, Lu Rongjing also visited some  military garrisons, where he called on and extended festive  greetings to officers and service members.    Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Fang Zhaoxiang,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Ji Jiahong  [1323 1367 1347], secretary general of the provincial party  committee; and Lu Jiafeng [4151 1367 0023], deputy secretary  general of the provincial party committee and director of the  provincial party committee policy research center.</p>

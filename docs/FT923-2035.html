			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Russia 'needs up to Dollars 20bn' of external finance RUSSIA will need Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn in external financing next year to bridge its balance-of-payments gap even after a 'reasonable' foreign debt rescheduling, Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic relations minister, said yesterday. Mr Aven and his colleagues will make the first detailed presentation of 'four or five scenarios' for a rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.5bn) foreign debt to the Group of Seven industrial nations in Washington over the next few days. He said the various proposals had one common goal: to ease the debt burden so that Russia would only have to pay about Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn next year instead of the Dollars 20bn falling due in 1993. But even if that was agreed, Russia would still need additional balance-of-payments support while it pursued painful market reforms. He rejected a claim by the International Finance Institute, a Washington-based banking lobby, that Russia was capable of repaying more money if it put its house in order. Although he has himself estimated annual capital flight from Russia at Dollars 3bn, Mr Aven said 'only Hitler or Stalin' could stop such phenomena quickly. If a rescheduling accord is not ready for final endorsement by the wider Paris Club of creditor nations at the end of the month when a present debt deferral expires, the latter is to be extended for 15 days. Russia is also trying to persuade other republics to renounce claims on the former Soviet Union's assets in return for which Russia will assume sole responsibility for its foreign debt. None of them can make hard currency repayments, except possibly Turkmenistan, which has gas.</p>

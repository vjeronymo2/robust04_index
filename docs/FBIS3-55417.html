"One should wait," he declared to Ukrainian  journalists in the airport.    At the same time the deputy minister deviated from any  comments regarding results of the Ukrainian-American  negotiations held by the Ukrainian governmental delegation this  week.    Ukraine's Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov, head of the  delegation, is still in the United State and will return to Kiev  on Monday. Ukrainian officials are expected to voice their  statement on the result of the negotiations the same day.    Meanwhile, the official press release distributed by the  Ukrainian Embassy to the United States says that "during the  consultations held by the Ukrainian delegation in the US State  Department the parties focused their attention on economic  development of two countries."    The document says that in the course of a meeting between  members of the delegation with the US President Bill Clinton  "the parties have discussed a wide spectrum of issues related to  bilateral relations between Ukraine and United States and, in  particular, prospects of expansion of economic relations between  two states, military-political problems, and international  security issues."    The negotiations paid special attention to the discussion of  a program of negotiations of the Ukrainian governmental  delegation which is scheduled to visit the United States late  January.    In Pentagon the parties signed a statement on principles  related to the creation of an American-Ukrainian committee on  defense industry conversion.    The press release contains no information on tripartite  Russian-Ukrainian-American consultations on nuclear disarmament.</p>

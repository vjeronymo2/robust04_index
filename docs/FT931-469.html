			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / People: Airbus Industrie AIRBUS INDUSTRIE, the European aircraft consortium, has appointed a 54-year old German aerospace engineer as its new chief operating officer. Volker von Tein will replace another German, Heribert Flosdorff, in the number two position after the managing director, Jean Pierson. Since the post of chief operating officer was created in 1989 following an exhaustive review of the consortium's management structure, the job has traditionally gone to a German. Von Tein comes from Deutsche Aerospace, the German partner in Airbus. The three other partners are British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain. At Deutsche Aerospace, von Tein was general manager for space transport and propulsion systems and has also been involved in various international aerospace co-operative programmes. The new Airbus number two takes over at a particularly difficult and challenging time for the consortium which has been hit by the current prolonged recession in commercial aviation; more than 100 aircraft orders have been cancelled in the past 12 months.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P reviews Volvo's short-term debt rating STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday said it was reviewing the short-term debt rating of Volvo, the Swedish motor vehicle group, with a view to a possible downgrade, following a sharp increase in group debt and higher operating losses in 1992. S&amp;P said it had placed Volvo's single-A1 rating on Creditwatch with negative implications, but noted that the rating was unlikely to fall below single A2 because of the group's 'reasonable financial flexibility'. Last week, Volvo announced a SKr4.75bn loss after financial items, compared with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, with operating losses rising to SKr2.25bn from SKr1.17bn. Net debt amounted to SKr13bn, up sharply from SKr7bn in 1991, with around SKr2bn attributed to currency fluctuations. S&amp;P said: 'In the face of continuing difficult trading conditions in its key markets, Volvo is constrained in its ability to contain debt useage. Debt is expected to remain higher for the foreseeable future.' Last December, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Volvo's commercial paper ratings to Prime-2 from Prime-1.</p>

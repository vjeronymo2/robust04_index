			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CD News: Easier Steps for Imports] </F>   [Text] China yesterday issued two provisional regulations  on the automatic registration of specific product imports and  the management of product import quotas.    The two regulations were jointly announced by the State  Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation, People's Bank of China, the State General  Administration of Customs and the State Administration of  Exchange Control.    The move is to ensure the smooth implementation of the  reform  of foreign exchange management and to provide the information  needed to strengthen macro-economic supervision over major  product imports.    According to the new regulations, automatic registration  will  be in place for such products as rolled steel, billet, scrap  steel, used ships, nonferrous metals (copper and aluminium),  plastics materials, paper, fruits, and cosmetics.    Under the regulations, the procedures for import  registration  should be followed for categories including general-import  trade, imports based on foreign government or bank loans, mail  imports and leasing imports.</p>

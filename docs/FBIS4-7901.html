			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ross Crockford: "Eat, Drink and Be Merry, for </F> Tomorrow We Die"]    [Text] Thinking of spending another night in the pub,  relaxing over goulash, beer and a cigarette? You may not find  this news relaxing: According to a new Ministry of Health  report, the pub-going life is the main reason the average Czech  dies earlier than just about anyone else in Europe.    According to the report, released Feb. 28, the fatty diet,  smoking, excessive drinking, stress and physical lethargy common  to most Czechs also cause up to 60 percent of the illnesses and  syndromes that kill them prematurely.    Environmental hazards and inefficient medical care were each  deemed to be 20 percent responsible for the Czechs' short life  expectancies.    Czech men, on average, live to an age of 68.5 years, and  Czech women to 76.1 years. In neighboring Austria, by  comparison, the average life expectancy is 74 years for men and  81 for women. In the United States it is 72.3 years for men and  79 for women.    Standing outside a central Prague cafeteria where he had  just  finished off a lunch of boiled pork and mashed potatoes, Milan  Novak said he is aware of the statistics, but that they wouldn't  necessarily make him change his habits. "Everything is to blame  here: the air, the water, the poor hospitals and the food," said  the 30-year-old businessman. "But lunch is a break from work, so  I'm not going to worry about my health when I'm eating."    According to Rudolf Poledne, head of a laboratory conducting  arteriosclerosis research at Prague's Institute for Clinical and  Experimental Medicine, the biggest problem is the widespread  attitude of people like Novak that one's health is largely  beyond one's control.    "It's easy to blame the environment or the stress caused by  your work," said Poledne. "We were taught for years by the  totalitarian system that everything can be planned and directed,  so people didn't feel responsible for anything, including their  own health."    Instead, Poledne said, many have simply become accustomed to  fatal indulgences. Czechs guzzle more beer than anyone else in  the world--more than 150 liters (39.75 gallons) per person every  year. The average Czech also smokes around 1,900 cigarettes  yearly, down slightly from an all-time high of over 2,100 four  years ago.    One of the organizations attempting to curb this lethal  overconsumption is the National Center for Health Promotion.  Zdenek Kucera, the director of the center, said he is developing  several programs to educate people about such unhealthy  consumption. One campaign, called "Quit to Win," rewards those  who stop smoking with chances at $5,000 and a trip to the Canary  Islands.    Kucera acknowledged that while it seems contradictory for  the  Czech government to encourage the development of the alcohol and  tobacco industries and fund his center at the same time,  "similar situations exist in every country. There is a very  strong wish to organize educational campaigns, but they are very  careful not to violate the overall policy of the cabinet, which  is to be as economically liberal as possible."    It is unlikely that the government will do much more to  encourage people to change their ways. Jan Sorf, director of  physical education for the Ministry of Education, Youth and  Sport, said that no one had the funding to maintain, let alone  build, public athletic facilities. These initiatives, he said,  have to come from volunteer organizations such as the YMCA, or  entrepreneurs who have discovered that money can be made from  fitness centers and squash courts.    So far, economics has proven more successful than government  planning in changing unhealthy habits. Researchers have noted  that the amount of cholesterol coursing through the arteries of  the average Czech has dropped 5 percent since 1988. This is  thanks not to education, but to the skyrocketing prices of meat  and cheese--a consequence they jokingly refer to as "the Klaus  effect," after Czech Prime Minister and economic reformer Vaclav  Klaus.    It may only be a matter of time until Czechs adopt the  Western pursuit of immortality. But at least one believes there  also should be room for people to indulge their life-threatening  appetites. Back at the cafeteria, Mirslav Bunat, a retired  engineer, reported that he had just enjoyed a "fantastic" parek  (hot dog). "I think about how unhealthy it is sometimes," he  said, "but I still love Czech food. I live in Switzerland now,  and you can't get this kind of food there, so when I come back  here I eat it all the time."</p>

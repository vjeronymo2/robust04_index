			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 8 (BTA) -- The leader of Macedonia's  Human Rights Party, Bulgarian citizen Ilija Ilievski, said today  that during the upcoming census in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from June 21 to July 5  Bulgarians there will be deprived of the right to freely express  their national identity. At a press conference here, Ilievski  said the census will take place in the conditions of continuing  systematic violations of the human rights of citizens of  Bulgarian nationality and its results will not be objective and  reliable.    The leader of this opposition party outlawed by Macedonia's  Supreme Court in January said the questionnaires for the census  did not contain "Bulgarian nationality" as an option. He also  said this year's census will violate the major document of the  UN Economic and Social Council saying such censuses should take  place in a year ending in 0 or 5.    Ilievski discussed his Geneva visit from June 1 to 3 and  said  he briefed on these matters the International Conference on  Former Yugoslavia, the UN Commission on Human Rights and  international nongovernmental human rights groups.</p>

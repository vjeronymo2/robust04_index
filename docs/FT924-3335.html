			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / S African whites threatened A black guerrilla group has declared war on white South Africans and threatened to kill government leaders including President F W de Klerk, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The South African Press Association said yesterday Mr Congo Jibril, a leader of the exiled Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla), had told it the group would attack whites because they were 'part and parcel of the oppressive regime'. Right-wing white groups threatened attacks on the Pan Africanist Congress, Apla's political wing, and on 'communist organisations'.</p>

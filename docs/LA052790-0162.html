			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> NUMBERS, DOLLARS ADD UP FOR CANSECO  </P> <P> What do you apply to Jose Canseco's home runs, a tape measure or a calculator?  </P> <P> The distant drives of the Oakland Athletics' right fielder are about to become  far-reaching in a financial manner, as well.  </P> <P> Canseco has the A's over a barrel to the extent that they have no choice but to  hand over the keys to the bank.  </P> <P> With each game, as the stupendously talented Canseco enhances his stature as  baseball's best active player and generates comparisons to the best ever, he  drives up his price.  </P> <P> A's General Manager Sandy Alderson, who began negotiations with Canseco's  agent, Dennis Gilbert, on a multiyear contract Tuesday, doesn't know whether to  laugh or cry.  </P> <P> "He's making it tough on us," Alderson said of Canseco's daily display of  power. "We might have to go from negotiating to begging."  </P> <P> Canseco seems destined to make Don Mattingly and Will Clark look like paupers.  </P> <P> In the culmination of baseball's madcap salary signings of last winter, Clark  agreed to a four-year, $13.2-million contract with the San Francisco Giants,  and Mattingly signed a five-year, $19.3-million deal with the New York Yankees.  Outstanding players, those two first basemen, but their overall skills don't  compare with Canseco's.  </P> <P> Neither runs as well, hits with as much power or plays as challenging a  position as Canseco, 25, whose defensive skills have improved to the point that  he merits Gold Glove consideration.  </P> <P> "We feel that you have to equate salary to ability," Gilbert said. "Jose is the  best player in the game right now. Therefore, we feel he should be paid the  most."  </P> <P> The A's are believed to have made a five-year, $20-million offer.  </P> <P> Canseco, eligible for free agency after the 1991 season, is believed to be  thinking in terms of $25 million, with the first pure $5-million-a-year salary.  </P> <P> He has talked about the free-agent potential of New York and Los Angeles, but  "if the money is right, he would be happy to stay in Oakland," according to  Gilbert.  </P> <P> Said Canseco: "As long as they want me here, I'll stay. I can't imagine  leaving. I wouldn't mind having a 10-year deal. But the longer the A's take to  sign me, the more difficult it's going to be. They see what I do in opposing  ballparks. I mean, the Oakland ballpark could cost me 40 points a year on my  batting average and 15 to 20 home runs, and if I get the chance, I'll prove it  to them."  </P> <P> Some of that is negotiating rhetoric, though there is no doubt that he pays a  statistical price in Oakland.  </P> <P> On a recent eight-game trip, Canseco batted .424, drove in 16 runs and hit  eight homers, including a grand slam in the Toronto SkyDome that bounced off  the windows atop the center-field restaurant and revived memories of his  international launching there in Game 4 of last year's American League playoff  series against the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> There have been 79 homers hit in 27 games at the SkyDome this year, and Canseco  said, "60 (by one player) would not be safe in a place like this" if he played  there.  </P> <P> Would he consider it?  </P> <P> "Being paid in Canadian money and being taxed twice? Forget it," he said.  </P> <P> Presently, Canseco looks as if he can hit 60 anywhere, even Oakland.  </P> <P> Canseco has hit 10 homers and driven in 26 runs in the A's last 14 games. He  has 18 homers, 47 RBIs, a .340 batting average and 11 stolen bases in 41 games.  He leads the majors with 38 runs.  </P> <P> "I probably think he's better than he thinks he is," A's Manager Tony La Russa  said. "As far as pure talent, I think he's in the echelon with anybody you want  to mention, anybody who has ever played."  </P> <P> Said third baseman Carney Lansford, of the current negotiations: "I'm not the  one laying out the iron, but from a business standpoint I'd tie that guy up for  as long as I could, as soon as I could. I've played with some Hall of Famers,  and he's the best. I have to believe he's the best who ever played."  </P> <P> Canseco is being paid $2 million this season. Last winter, the A's signed  Rickey Henderson to a four-year, $12-million contract and gave Dave Stewart a  two-year, $7-million extension. They also considered a multiyear deal for  Canseco, but Alderson said that with the threat of a work stoppage and severe  financial damage to the franchise, "We weren't prepared to take the risk with  another big contract."  </P> <P> Too bad, for them. Canseco said he probably would have signed for less than  Clark at that time. If so, his price has doubled.  </P> <P> "The A's and Sandy Alderson had a chance to sign me for peanuts and didn't do  it," Canseco said. "Thank you, Sandy Alderson. Thank you, Oakland A's."  </P> <P> Canseco is making an attempt to improve his image, ensuring the A's interest.  </P> <P> The profits from his 900 talk line are being used to bring underprivileged  children to his summer baseball camp.  </P> <P> And the other day, when Stewart handed him a $10,000 check as payoff on his  1988 bet that Canseco would not get married before the 1989 season, Canseco  said he will match it and buy a van for a handicapped fan in his hometown of  Miami.  </P> <P> All of that is to be applauded, but Canseco still marches to the beat of his  own bat.  </P> <P> "I'm like Madonna," he said the other day. "We don't abide by the same norms  and don't put limitations on what we can do."  </P> <P> The political conventions might want to consider Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven as  their keynote speaker.  </P> <P> Since his blistering indictment of the club's offense on May 12, including the  conclusion that "We stink," the Angels had a 9-3 record going into Saturday  night's game, the awakened offense averaging 5.6 runs and 10.6 hits per game.  </P> <P> The Montreal Expos' Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had not pitched a shutout since June  9, 1985, before adding to the San Diego Padres' misery by shutting them out  twice in a 10-day span.  </P> <P> Boyd is 1-2 with a 5.08 earned-run average against the rest of the National  League and 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA against the Padres, whose manager, Jack McKeon,  said he didn't think Boyd was that good, "but he ought to send these guys plane  tickets so he can see more of them."  </P> <P> In the wake of his arm problems, the Can has become a finesse pitcher.  </P> <P> "Sometimes on the mound, I mess with the ball now," he said. "I don't do  anything illegal, but I take extra equipment with me -- my thinking cap."  </P> <P> One aspect of the Houston Astros' disappointing start was the poor play of  catalytic center fielder Gerald Young, who was optioned to Tucson the other day  with a .179 batting average and some private concern among club officials  regarding his work habits and habits in general.  </P> <P> "It could be for two weeks, it could be for two months and it could be for a  year," General Manager Bill Wood said of the demotion. "It's up to him to get  his game turned around."  </P> <P> On the day of Young's departure, the Astros stole eight bases, including four  by center-field successor Eric Yelding.  </P> <P> Two deserving players, Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Len Dykstra and White  Sox shortstop Ozzie Guillen, had some thoughts about their chances to be voted  into the All-Star game by the fans.  </P> <P> "It's tough to break the mold," Dykstra said. "You know the big-name guys are  going to get the votes."  </P> <P> Said Guillen: "No one knows who I am. I'd have to kill all the other  shortstops. I'd have to take care of Cal Ripken, Alan Trammell, Tony Fernandez  and Kurt Stillwell, and then I'd be in jail and couldn't play anyway."  </P></p>

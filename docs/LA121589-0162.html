			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTRIC ATTIRE;  </P> <P> HIGH FASHION NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE  </P> <P> April Artinger plucked another party dress from a rack filled with taffeta and  added it to the growing pile cradled in her arms.  </P> <P> "We're having a formal party, and everyone dresses so nice," said the 30-ish  Huntington Beach woman.  </P> <P> Artinger couldn't help laughing at the idea that she will be greeting her  stylish guests in a dress she bought for less than $50 at Sutter Place, a  factory outlet for Jessica McClintock's Victorian-inspired formal wear.  </P> <P> "This is the same stuff they sell in the mall for about $200," Artinger said,  "but I'm spending about $28. Isn't that funny?"  </P> <P> Glitzy costumes for the holiday season's swanky parties can easily cost $1,000  or more each, something most party-goers don't find amusing. That's big money,  especially if you travel in a social circles that require a different ball gown  for every gala.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Orange County offers plenty of alternatives to costly designer  dresses, so budget-conscious socialites don't have to empty their Christmas  accounts for a new dress.  </P> <P> In the Back Room at Loehmann's next to Sutter Place at Loehmann's Five Points  Plaza in Huntington Beach, party-goers can find evening gowns glittering with  sequins and rhinestones for $350 to $400, about half their retail prices. Many  dresses are by top names such as Oleg Cassini, Christian Dior and Anne Klein.  </P> <P> One floor-length sheath with a low V back features an intricate swirl pattern  of green sequins and beads and a band of silver tube beads around its jewel  neck; it's $325. A three-piece royal blue silk ensemble for $289 has a  bead-trimmed jacket and heavily beaded belt to accompany a long dress. For  less-formal affairs, there's a straight short dress of black sequins dress and  a white organza ruffle around the neckline for $60.  </P> <P> The discounts at Sutter Place, which also sells overstock of Jessica  McClintock's Scott McClintock and Gunne Sax lines, range from 50% to 70% off  retail.  </P> <P> "I get all of the overflow," says Julie Georgeson, manager of Sutter Place.  "Once the merchandise reaches our floor, it means they're no longer making that  style. This is the end of the totem pole."  </P> <P> The end is not such a bad place to go. Shoppers can get a tea-length dress with  a black velvet bustier and a full black lace skirt for $82 rather than $180.  During one of the store's frequent sales, a dress such as this might sell for  $41, half the normal discount price.  </P> <P> "We have $300 dresses for $78," Georgeson says. A floor-length black velvet  skirt was selling for $14 during a recent sale.  </P> <P> "I know people who come from all over Los Angeles to shop here," says Karen  Noteboom of Huntington Beach, who was toting a sleeveless black velvet frock.  </P> <P> "You can buy a party dress for $25 to $50, wear it once, and you don't mind  because you're not putting a big investment in it," Noteboom said.  </P> <P> Although fans of McClintock's feminine styles give up certain amenities by  shopping at the outlet -- things can't be ordered in different sizes or colors  or be returned -- they do get bargains.  </P> <P> Women who prefer more contemporary clothing at a price find innovative styles  by California designers at SUO, a new boutique in the Westminster Mall.  </P> <P> "We direct styles to the customer who likes different looks but who's not  trendy," says Jackie Brooks, general manager and buyer for the two SUO stores  in Westminster and West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Most ensembles there can be pulled together for less than $500, and the designs  are unusual enough that it's not likely you'll run into a party guest wearing  the same outfit -- something that happened to no less than Christie Brinkley  and Cheryl Tiegs at a big event a couple of years ago.  </P> <P> For evening, a simple black camisole trimmed with stretch lace and green and  rust-colored sequins by East Wind Code would dress up any outfit. The tank,  which is $136, goes well with Kymio's Spanish-style black crepe jacket with a  cape-size square collar ($204) and wide-legged loose pants ($90).  </P> <P> SUO's dress selection is also distinctive. An elegant black crepe dress by  Linda Christina with chiffon ruffles on the collar and cascading down the back  is $172.  </P> <P> "Chiffon is a real strong statement for holiday dressing," Brooks says. "Our  designers tend to like soft, basic fabrics with a little flow to them."  </P> <P> Party girls who don't mind clothes that cling can find plenty of dresses to fit  a tight budget.  </P> <P> The Judy's chain, for instance, carries a variety of short fitted tank dresses,  many embellished with sequins and gold embroidery, for about $50 to $150.  </P> <P> At the South Coast Plaza store in Costa Mesa, a black Lycra number by Radar  with gold embroidery sells for $60. Another, more elaborately made tank dress  with black and gold sequins is $144. For a more covered look, there is a  long-sleeved dress with a full green taffeta skirt and black velvet top stamped  with red roses for $152.  </P> <P> "People are getting more dressed up this year," says Mindy Powell, manager of  the store. "At our Christmas party, everybody got decked out."  </P> <P> Previously owned clothes are another alternative. Many a lavish party dress or  other pricey garment will be worn only once before being turned over to a  second-hand store.  </P> <P> "The owner of this coat couldn't wear it again among her circuit of friends,"  says Jeannie Quaintance, owner of Rag Street Consignment Apparel in Laguna  Beach. "She was lucky to wear it twice."  </P> <P> Whoever buys the hand-painted gold silk coat could be even luckier: It  originally sold for $1,500, and it's now priced at $500.  </P> <P> On a recent trip, a visitor spotted a red crushed velvet blazer for $130, a  gold lame camisole for $24, a green velvet cropped top and matching straight  skirt for $49 apiece, and a black sweater decorated with multicolored metallic  knit bows for $29. If certain pieces don't sell quickly enough, Quaintance will  add a discount of 20% or more.  </P> <P> "We have extremely dressy things that have been seen in all of the best  places," she says. Rag Street also carries samples of new items from 29  designers and manufacturers.  </P> <P> One of these, a peplum jacket in black pleated crepe with a matching tea-length  skirt by Kathy Hoshijo would retail for $420 but is only $175 at Rag Street,  she said. The silk fuchsia scarf to go with it is $35.  </P> <P> "Kathy's gown can go anywhere -- to a formal, to the Orange County Performing  Arts Center or to the White House -- and be smashing," Quaintance says.  </P> <P> As long as no one's the wiser, social butterflies can also rent an outfit that  they would never buy for a single night of revelry.  </P> <P> Rental Boutique in Santa Ana stocks floor-length gowns, tea-length taffeta  dresses, sequined jackets and Lurex sweaters. A dress that would sell for $500  in a department store can be rented for about $60 here.  </P> <P> Kathi Schanz of Laguna Niguel rented a long-sleeved black sequined dress for a  recent Christmas party.  </P> <P> "If I'd bought it new, it would have cost at least $450," Schanz says. "I paid  $60, and I was the best-dressed person at the party."  </P> <P> Among the boutique's better quality rentals: a long strapless black gown by  Lillie Rubin with a ruched bodice and big bow at the back, for $100, and a  simple orchid-colored lame skirt and a black velvet top for $65. Both outfits  would sell for more than $500, according to Judith Gaon, owner of Rental  Boutique.  </P> <P> Gaon says her customers are more willing to experiment with new styles if they  don't have to pay to keep them in their wardrobes.  </P> <P> "This one woman's going to a party. She's very conservative, but look what  she's wearing," said Gaon, showing off a strapless gown of cobalt blue lame,  blue satin gloves and a matching evening hat trimmed with net.  </P> <P> "The customers can rent something that's not them because they don't have to  own it. They're wearing a costume, even though it's evening wear."  </P> <P> Styles by Gianna Majzler; hair by Chad Fults, Salon Oloumi, Huntington Beach;  makeup by Nancy Viele (assisted by Kim Brackman); velvet clothing and model  courtesy I.

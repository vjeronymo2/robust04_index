			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Scots nationalists attack Labour THE SCOTTISH National Party got into the stride of its conference yesterday with attacks on Labour, which it must defeat if it is to become the dominant party in Scotland. 'Our real enemies in Scotland are the Labour party,' said Mr Gordon Wilson, a former leader of the party. 'The Tory government relies upon the grace and favour of the Labour party.' Underlying the debate was the question of the extent to which the SNP should work with Labour in Scotland United, a pressure group for constitutional reform. Mr Wilson described Mr George Galloway, a Labour MP particularly involved in Scotland United, as one of the SNP's enemies. Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP parliamentary leader, warned: 'A vote cast for the Liberal Democrats or the Labour party is the same as a vote for the Tories. These are unionist votes, used by the present government to justify the implementation of its policies in Scotland and Wales.' She attacked Labour for failing to deliver its promises: 'Vote for us, they said, and a Scottish parliament will be along in a tick. I say that the Labour party has, for far too long, lived on tick in Scotland - your credit has run out.' The SNP later postponed having to make a clear decision on its own political direction. A motion declaring its the philosophy of the SNP to be 'based on social justice, economic progress and a commitment to democracy in the mainstream of the European social democratic movement' was remitted to the national council for further consideration.</p>

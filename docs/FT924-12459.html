			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Growth in volume helps boost GTE 9% GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday posted a 9 per cent advance in third-quarter earnings from continuing operations, reflecting volume growth and strong gains in the mobile-cellular busi-ness. For the three months to September 30, earnings rose to Dollars 500m, or 55 cents a share, from continuing businesses, compared with Dollars 457m, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Revenues and sales were 2 per cent higher at Dollars 4.97bn, against Dollars 4.85bn. The figures, which met analysts' expectations, do not include GTE's electrical products operations it sold in the third quarter in two separate deals valued at Dollars 1.1bn. Operating income from the group's local telephone operations rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn. Revenues increased 2 per cent to Dollars 3.99bn, helped by a 7.7 per cent annual rise in usage of the company's local network for long-distance calling and a 3.6 per cent annual increase in access lines. These increases, however, were partly offset by lower tariffs charged to long-distance carriers for access to its local network. Operating income from GTE's cellular telephone business climbed to Dollars 65m from Dollars 32m on revenues which rose 5 per cent to Dollars 980m from Dollars 935m. The number of new customers rose about 34 per cent, including 57,000 in the quarter, bringing the total to 977,000 from 727,000 a year earlier. Average revenues per subscriber fell slightly in the quarter, to Dollars 77 a month. For the first nine months, earnings from continuing operations advanced to Dollars 1.37bn, or Dollars 1.51, against Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 1.16, last year, when it took a net charge of Dollars 204m, or 12 cents a share, related to last year's Dollars 6bn merger with telecommunications group Contel. Stripping out last year's one-time charge, earnings per share from continuing operations rose 9 per cent in the first nine months. Revenues and sales were up at Dollars 14.85bn from Dollars 14.39bn.</p>

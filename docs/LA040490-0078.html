			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY GIVES QUINA FOOTBALL JOB  </P> <P> Stan Quina hopes to become a Pioneer in the truest sense of the word after  becoming one, at least in name. At a news conference Tuesday at Simi Valley  High, Quina officially was introduced as the school's new football coach.  </P> <P> For Quina, 34, it is his first head coaching job and it brings with it the  challenge of rebuilding a program that has struggled to a 1-19 record the past  two seasons. Quina, an insurance salesman who will be a walk-on coach, intends  to use a positive attitude to blaze a trail out of the league's cellar.  </P> <P> "They haven't had a lot of success here in terms of wins and losses, and I  don't think there was anything necessarily wrong with what the old regime did,"  Quina said. "I just think they needed some new enthusiasm."  </P> <P> Quina succeeds Dave Murphy, who resigned in November after a six-year tenure in  which the Pioneers were 21-40-1. Murphy, the school's second-winningest coach,  said a lack of support slowed the program's progress.  </P> <P> "I haven't set any league-championship goals because I don't think it's  realistic," Quina said. "My first goal is to increase interest."  </P> <P> Quina will try to bring optimism to a program that has not had a winning season  since 1985, when it posted its best mark (9-3) and won its only Marmonte League  title.  </P> <P> "If we can get the kids to believe in themselves, that they can win, then we  will do well," Quina said. "The importance is in effort and attitude."  </P> <P> Quina, an assistant at Moorpark High the past two seasons, graduated from Royal  and was an assistant there from 1980-84.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Hitting the roof over reform: Calls for changes to UK commercial property leases are gathering pace 'Upwards-only rent review clauses seem designed for a world which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values. This pattern is not in the interest of the economy as a whole, and the thrust of our anti-inflationary policy is intended to make it obsolete.' Bank of England The row unleashed last week over the UK government's plans to allow leaseholders to buy the freehold of their homes is matched by a quite separate but equally controversial debate over leases in the commercial sector. Since the Bank of England threw its weight behind the case for reform in January, the battle has continued to rage. Its attack focused on one of the most cherished principles of the UK property investment industry: that rents should move only upwards after their five-yearly reviews. It also criticised the 'apparently absurd outcomes' that stem from privity of contract, another mainstay of the standard 25-year commercial lease. This means that tenants who pass on a lease when they cease to occupy a building remain liable for rent if a subsequent tenant defaults. The system was an example 'of responsibility without power', said Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor. His remarks drew an angry response from many commercial landlords, who depend heavily on the reliability of the rental income. 'The Bank appears to be sweeping the carpet out from under our feet,' said Mr Michael Mallinson, a past president of the British Property Federation. Mr John Ritblat, chairman of the property company British Land, concurred: 'It was an uninformed, impoverished statement that was greatly damaging to the industry.' But the Bank of England has not been alone. As the recession deepened, the case for change was voiced by businesses, politicians and academics with increasing urgency. Mrs Angela Browning, Conservative MP for Tiverton, in a Commons debate last November, cited the example of some constituents who had been forced to sell their home to discharge rental debts relating to former premises. 'This has done more to devastate small businesses than even global recession,' she said. But privity of contract is not simply a problem for small businesses. Boots the Chemist made a provision of Pounds 5.8m in its last financial year related to 'leases where the assignees have defaulted'. The Adam Smith Institute, the free-market think-tank, recently published a paper arguing that the rigid UK lease structure that allowed rents to rise while retailers' turnover was falling 'had created a situation of nightmarish crisis on the high street'. As well as condemning the structure of leases, it criticised the process by which rents are agreed and the prevalence of confidentiality clauses on the terms of rent agreements, which it claimed tended to favour the landlord. Critics emphasise that the 25-year, upwards-only lease is almost unknown outside Britain. US and continental leases are generally far shorter and less rigid. In France, for example, tenants sign leases for nine years, with the right to break the lease every three years. Rent reviews are pegged to inflation. Some aspects of the system differ in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which have no privity of contract. Tenants have no continuing liability once they have passed their leases to another tenant. However, investors enjoy some protection, as they have the right to stop the lease being passed on to a financially weaker tenant. Many UK investors would be prepared to replace privity of contract with the Scottish approach. A few landlords are prepared to question whether a 25-year lease acts in their interest. They believe that slightly shorter leases, perhaps of 15 years, might enhance their property's value, as it would give them a chance to upgrade the building more regularly to attract higher rents. But, in general, most landlords view with dismay any suggestion that they should relinquish the present UK lease structure. They say any change would severely reduce property values by undermining the security of their rental income. They argue that the impact of falling commercial property values could go beyond their own industry and damage the entire economy. First, it could further reduce institutions' appetite for property. That would be a blow for the banks, which are concerned about how the record Pounds 39bn they have lent to the industry over the past few years is to be repaid. Second, there is a danger that the erosion of companies' asset values could hamper their capacity to borrow, and thus stifle the growth that would spur economic recovery. Commercial property accounts for 30-40 per cent of companies' assets, according to a London Business School study. This fear is given credence by a recent study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The report calculates that a 10 per cent drop in property prices would result in a Pounds 10bn fall in borrowing over the next two years. This would reduce gross domestic product by about 1.5 per cent or Pounds 9.7bn over the period compared with what it would have been if property prices had not fallen. The landlords' defence of the existing lease structure extends to claiming that it works in the tenants' best interests. 'The irony of the debate about upwards-only reviews is this: only in the current extreme situation does that provision work against tenants' interests,' said Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential life group. He argued that, if security of income were removed and institutions became less willing to invest in property, the supply of property would dwindle and rents would rise. 'If the laments of tenants win the day, they will actually be doing themselves more harm than good,' he said. This argument cuts little ice with tenants. With few exceptions, they view their landlords' interests as incompatible with their own. Their hope is that the property market will remain weak for long enough to allow them to make lasting changes in Britain's commercial lease structure. Already, many leases signed in the past year involve concessions by landlords - such as giving the tenant the right to break the lease - which would have been unimaginable a few years ago. But without government intervention, reform is likely to be a slow process, since on average just 4 per cent of leases expire in any year. The pressure for change creates a dilemma for the government, which promised to consider overhauling privity of contract in its manifesto last year. However, the Lord Chancellor, who has been lobbied intensively by both sides of the debate, has not yet arrived at a suitable compromise. There is a conflict between the needs of struggling tenants and the rights of landlords, who say they would take the government to the European Court if it passed 'confiscatory' legislation affecting existing contracts. 'The government is on a hiding to nothing,' says one of its advisers. 'They have strong constituencies among the property industry and among small business people. They will risk alienating one side or another.' One area in which the government could act is by legislating on new leases, which could remove privity of contract, upwards-only rent reviews and confidentiality clauses. While this would be seen by many landlords as an unwarranted interference in the free market, it would nevertheless be less controversial than any tampering with existing leases. For the Conservatives, the dilemma is acute. The government is reluctant to interfere with a system that underpins the strength and security of many financial institutions, from pension funds to banks. Nonetheless, the recession has illustrated powerfully the case for an overhaul. Otherwise, property's importance as an investment medium risks overshadowing its more fundamental productive role in the British economy.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Medeva in Pounds 94m rights issue MEDEVA, the fast-growing pharmaceuticals company, yesterday launched its fourth cash call since 1990 and announced it was raising Pounds 94.4m to make its maiden acquisition in Germany and wipe out net borrowings. Medeva is buying Ribosepharm, a private company specialising in cancer treatment products, for DM125.5m (Pounds 52.3m). The rest of the money raised will be used to repay borrowings, which stood at Pounds 38.6m at March 12. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, said cutting borrowings would allow Medeva to continue its acquisition-led growth. 'By eliminating borrowings we probably have the ability to do up to Pounds 100m of acquisitions in the next 12 to 18 months without referring back to shareholders, assuming the opportunities come up,' he said. The one-for-four rights of 54m new shares at 180p a share was underwritten by Lazard Brothers. The acquisition was well received by the stock market and Medeva's shares gained 3p to 230p. Ribosepharm was founded in 1984 and last year made pre-tax profits of DM9.9m on sales of DM30.3m. Medeva has been keen to enter Germany, the world's third largest pharmaceuticals market, and the purchase also gives the company a new product line similar to its severe pain management products. The German company's products, which mainly reduce the side effects of toxic cancer treatments, could also be sold through Medeva's UK and US sales forces. Two months ago, Medeva made its first acquisition in Europe, Institut de Recherche Corbiere, a French distributor of ethical products for Pounds 11.6m. IRC markets products to GPs while Ribosepharm has a sales force of 11 marketing to cancer specialists in Germany and Austria. Its largest product, Ribofolin, accounted for about 60 per cent of last year's sales. The purchase price of DM125.5m included DM18.5 in existing shareholders' loans, a DM14.1m tax liability which will arise upon completion and a bonus of DM2m to the group's owner which depends on sales. Medeva has also agreed to DM2m as bonuses to senior staff. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Glaxo's export sales advance 31% to Pounds 837m Correction (published 12 September 1992) appended to this article. SIR PAUL GIROLAMI, Glaxo's chairman, was in expansive mood yesterday as he announced a 12th year of rapid growth in profits and sales. The Pounds 700m increase in turnover was greater than the sales of the whole group less than 10 years ago, he pointed out. Meanwhile, the group's exports from the UK increased 31 per cent from Pounds 641m in 1991 to Pounds 837m in 1992. Such growth was impressive said Mr Ernest Mario, deputy chairman. This was particularly true when Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, was losing market share. The drug, with sales of Pounds 1.81bn, represented 44 per cent of group sales, and this percentage would fall as the product continued to mature, said Mr Mario. Sales of Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug, nevertheless, increased 13 per cent (9 per cent at constant exchange rates). In the US sales were up 13 per cent in local currency. Mr Mario said the increase in Zantac sales was partly the consequence of an expansion of the US sales- force by 500 representatives in anticipation of the licensing of Imigran, a migraine treatment also known as Imitrex. While waiting for the drug to be licensed, they were marketing Zantac. Sales of respiratory drugs increased 24 per cent to Pounds 964m, representing 24 per cent of group sales. Sales of Ventolin, an asthma medicine, increased 15 per cent at constant exchange rates. Sales of another asthma drug, Becotide, also known as Beconase, increased 26 per cent. Revenues from Serevent, a long-acting asthma drug and one of Glaxo's most promising medicines, increased from Pounds 9m to Pounds 37m. Mr Mario said this was in spite of the fact it had not yet been launched in five of the 10 largest pharmaceuticals markets - the US, Japan, Germany, France and Spain. Antibiotics, representing 17 per cent of group sales, increased 12 per cent to Pounds 681m. In the US sales grew only 2 per cent at constant exchange rates because of pricing pressures, said Mr Mario. Sales of Zofran, a drug used to prevent nausea in patients receiving radiation and chemotherapy, increased from Pounds 181m to Pounds 259m. The company is hoping to receive a licence for use with post-operative patients. Imigran, Glaxo's controversial migraine drug, had sales of Pounds 43m. Mr Mario said he was pleased with the patient acceptance of the drug, which is yet to be licensed in the US, Japan and Germany. See Lex CORRECTION Pre-tax profits of Glaxo Holdings increased by 11 per cent from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.43bn in the year ended June 30 1992. In a report in yesterday's Financial Times the figures were incorrect.</p>

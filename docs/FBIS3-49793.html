			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tomorrow the Polish Government will adopt a final  view on Poland's participation in the American Partnership for  Peace program. During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to  Russia, Boris Yeltsin came out for Russia's full participation  in the program. According to President Yeltsin, it is possible  for Russia to join NATO, but only together with all former  allies of the East Bloc.    We asked Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk whether  possible access to NATO by Russia would not undermine Western  security guarantees to our country.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Nobody is going to give full  guarantees. We have to strive after them, this is obvious. The  statements by President Yeltsin, however, well, they vary in  tone and they are not always consistent.    Still, I think that Clinton achieved a lot. If Yeltsin  accepts the participation in the Partnership for Peace, it means  that we can feel a little safer -- if these intentions are  genuine. No security system without Russia or, even worse,  against Russia would be either permanent or safe. That is why I  receive the statement favorably. We will see how it is going to  look in practice.

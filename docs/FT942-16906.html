			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talks power Hogg News from Hogg Group, the insurance broker, that it is in discussions with a number of potential bidders triggered another strong burst of buying interest. Dealers said they expected an opening shot of around 210p in a bidding auction for Hogg and that an eventual take-out price for the group would be in the region of 250p a share. Hogg shares finished 23 stronger at 205p. There was widespread speculation as to the identities of the other companies involved in talks with Hogg. Inchcape, which held takeover talks with another UK insurance broker, CE Heath, last year, was seen as a possible bidder, as was Heath, JIB Group and Hambros Insurance Services. There was also talk that a number of US companies might be interested in Hogg, principally Aon Corporation.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Bundesbank fails to halt dollar rise after US retail surge A bigger-than-expected increase in US retail sales last month pushed the dollar up sharply yesterday in spite of Bundesbank intervention. Retail sales rose 0.8 per cent last month and by 6.9 per cent in the year to December, the Commerce Department said. Most economists had expected a December rise of only about 0.3 per cent and the figures caused economists to revise upwards their estimates of US fourth-quarter economic growth. Separate inflation figures showed a rise in the consumer price index of 0.2 per cent last month and 2.7 per cent in the year to December, roughly in line with projections. Many Wall Street analysts have raised their estimate of growth in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 5 per cent or slightly more. But most expect growth to moderate this quarter. Nevertheless, the figures caused the dollar to break through its 1993 high of DM1.7480, and then breach a second key market barrier of DM1.7520. The dollar closed in London at DM1.752, up nearly 2 pfennigs on its Tokyo overnight level. In New York it finished at DM1.7513. The Bundesbank's attempt to defend the D-Mark against the dollar was the first for at least seven months, dealers said. After rumours of Bundesbank intervention swept the European markets in the morning, the Bundesbank bought D-Marks worth 'several hundred million dollars', according to one dealer, in an attempt to hold the dollar at DM1.7440. Mr John LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said he saw little reason for an early adjustment of monetary policy. 'The inflation outlook is favourable,' he told business people in Boston. He predicted the annual rate of inflation would stay in the 2.7-2.8 per cent range this year. The Fed expected the economy to grow by 3-3.5 per cent this year after expanding at an unsustainable annual rate of 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, he said. Some analysts cautioned that the retail sales figures were less robust than they appeared, especially after adjustments for a fourth-quarter surge in car sales. Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs, said the momentum of consumer demand probably slowed as the economy moved into the first quarter of this year, despite strong figures for December sales. Goldman predicts real economic growth will decline to an annual rate of 2 per cent by the second quarter. Government bonds, Page 29 Currencies, Page 31 US stocks, Page 37</p>

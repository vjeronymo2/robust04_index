			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Sir Sidney Nolan - Obituary The reputation of Sir Sidney Nolan, who died in London at the weekend at the age of 75, is in many ways characteristic of our times; that is to say it remains contradictory, uncertain and ambiguous. He died full of honours - RA, a knight, member above all distinctions of the Order of Merit. Of all Australian artists, he was as he is likely to remain the most famous, patronised and collected by the highest in the land, known and admired for his work by a society not exactly renowned for its support for the contemporary and the avant garde. And yet, within the community of British and Commonwealth artists he was increasingly dismissed and neglected, remembered if at all as a figure from a period that was past, fixed for ever, as Ned Kelly was within his iron mask, with the single memorable image of that square-headed, half-mythical figure, outlaw and anti-hero. His tragedy was that after his extraordinary and immediate success of the 1940s and early 1950s, and his extended development of the Kelly sequence of paintings, though he continued to change in his own work, without his central character, no one took any notice. And the more no one looked, the more desperate and disillusioned he became. Meanwhile, there were other and technically better painters among his contemporaries, whose work was less constrained by a particular image and more natural and consistent in its development - Arthur Boyd outstanding among them. Nolan rather was, so it seems now, a classic victim of his own good luck and early success, taken up by the powerfully well-intentioned and encouraged to cut himself off from his imaginative roots, from the landscape of the Australian outback and its myths of the eternal vagabond and outsider. Go to England 'and I'll help you do an exhibition", said Sir Kenneth Clark to the the young painter in the late 1940s, 'but you have to realise that if you leave Australia, perhaps you'll never go back.' Perhaps in spirit he never did, but for all that, and for all the subsequent critical obloquy and neglect, the Ned Kelly series remains a considerable and lasting achievement. These paintings were seen most especially and to great advantage in the Arts Council's Angry Penguins exhibition at the Hayward four years ago, set in their true context, with the work of the other Melbourne painters of the 1940s, Boyd, Perceval, Tucker and the rest. They remain his monument. It is perhaps no bad thing to hit upon a powerful and particular image after all.</p>

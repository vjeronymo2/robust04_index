			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- Central newspapers highlight  two most important events today -- Russo-Ukrainian talks on the  Black Sea Fleet and an anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that according to a  trustworthy source, Ukraine expressed readiness to lease  Sevastopol to Russia for a term of five years as the main base  of the Black Sea Fleet with the subsequent extension of the  lease and remove the headquarters and other facilities of the  Ukrainian Navy from Sevastopol.    However, Kiev insists that the Black Sea Fleet marines  abandon the cities of Ismail, Ochakov, Odessa, Nikolayev and  Crimean settlements. Russia agrees to Kiev's proposals in the  main, but objects to the removal of its units from the towns of  Feodosia and Novoozerny (Donuzlava). Ukraine suggests dividing  the fleet in half so that 15-20 per cent of warships and  auxiliary vessels remain in the possession of the Ukrainian Navy  and the remainder (30-35 per cent) be transferred to Russia on  mutually advantageous terms. "It seems that only the Russian  side is willing to undo a tight naval knot tied around the Black  Sea Fleet and only in part concerning payments of overdue wages  to the personnel of the fleet," said Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev.    "The first round of talks between delegations of the Russian  and Ukrainian Defence Ministries ended to no avail," the  newspaper said.    KRASNAYA ZVEVZDA writes that passions running high at the  talks and their complexity leave no doubt that the final  document "will be borne in pain", and there are no guarantees  that mutual understanding will be reached in the course of one  session only.    The delegations are planning to work an extra day on April  22  when a news conference devoted to the results of the talks will  be held. "One would like to hope that emotions and mutual  reluctance to accept each other's positions will not take the  upper hand at the talks. Politicians have had they say on the  matter. Now, a fair division of the Black Sea Fleet depends on  the common sense of the military, " the newspaper said.    The newspaper SEGODNYA writes that "by all appearances, the  Russian side was prepared to make serious concessions to  Ukraine. At least, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev hinted  at a meeting with the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet on  Thursday that former Black Sea naval bases in Odessa, Nikolayev  and Ismail are likely to be transferred to Ukraine on condition  that 85 per cent of ships of the Black Sea Fleet remains in  Russia's possession. (We shall transfer 15 per cent to Ukraine  and subsequently, buy them from Ukraine, the minister said). At  the same time the Ukrainian delegation arrived at the talks with  rather a tough goal: Sevastopol must remain a naval base under  double Russo-Ukrainian jurisdiction," the newspaper said.    Commenting on the anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth, the  newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes that the Lenin museum marks  its 70th anniversary on April 22. In old days, the date used to  be celebrated with proper pomposity, but now, the situation is  different. "Is this fair and whether those who have embarked  upon the road of downright blemishing their own history have  made a mistake? All these questions will have to be answered  yet," the newspaper said.    The newspaper NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA writes that "there  is no "nationwide April" now, no May 1 holiday, and many people  say that there is even no Victory Day now. However, these dates  survive by themselves and cause genuine concern. New leaders  capable of making a crowd go against the authorities and stage  pogroms, hiding behind the back of hungry old women, are being  born during these days, which is seen from the example of the  last May 1 holiday. New authorities are afraid of these  holidays and post guards of special task force and riot police,  the newspaper said.    The newspaper SAN PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI writes that no  emergency measures are planned to be taken in St. Petersburg by  the command of northwest interior troops. All building and  facilities of interior troops will be heavily guarded during  these days. No special task force units are expected to appear  in the streets of the city.    The newspaper TRUD carries an interview with deputy chairman  of the Russian Government and minister for the affairs of  nationalities and regional politics, Sergey Shakhray, devoted to  the problem of Cossacks. According to Shakhray, the Russian  Government will submit a draft law to the State Duma and adopt  its own resolutions on tax privileges, problems of Cossacks'  land owning and will render assistance in holding a session of  the all-Russia Cossack union scheduled in autumn.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about a ceremony of bidding  farewell to Russian troops withdrawn from Germany.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes an extract from a book by  Sergey Beriya, the son of the former Soviet Interior Minister  Lavrentiy Beriya, executed in 1953, containing reminiscences if  his father.</p>

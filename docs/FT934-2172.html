			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Fluctuations in the balance The past 15 months have seen one of the most spectacular series of exchange rate upsets in Europe since the breakdown of the gold standard in the 1930s. Since early September 1992, the lira, Swedish krona and peseta have declined by between 23 and 24 per cent against the D-Mark. Sterling's fall has been a less dramatic 7 per cent, although at one stage 10 months ago it was down 16 per cent. Moreover, because Europe's hardest currencies, the D-Mark and guilder, themselves have declined by 14 per cent against the dollar over this period, the lira, krona and peseta have fallen by roughly 35 per cent against the US currency during the last 15 months. Analysing the effects of these changes on countries' trade balances is a complicated matter. This is partly because exchange rate changes affect exports and imports in different ways and with long and variable time lags. Measurement has been made especially complicated by the erratic quality of trade figures this year for countries of the European Union, because of statistical changes after the introduction of the single market at the beginning of 1993. Unpublished figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, however, give an indication of the consequences. These figures, based partly on estimates because of delays in collating EU statistics, show the total volume of exports of manufactured goods from Germany and France fell by an annual rate of 10.8 and 11.3 per cent respectively in the first six months of 1993. This followed increases of 1.9 and 5 per cent respectively in 1992. Among other ERM members, Belgian manufacturing exports fell 6 per cent in the first half, while for Holland the volume fell 3 per cent. The largest export gains in the first half of 1993, according to the OECD, were registered by Finland (up 25.1 per cent), Spain (up 12 per cent) and Italy (up 9 per cent). British manufacturing exports fell 2 per cent by volume in the first half, apparently reflecting sterling's relative firmness after its earlier sharp falls, following a 2.6 per cent increase in 1992. Individual countries' trade figures, although affected by greater than usual statistical uncertainties, also provide a measure of the impact. According to official Italian figures, Italy's total exports rose 19 per cent in value in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 1992. The rise in volume terms was 7 per cent. The UK's overall visible trade deficit declined to Pounds 7.6bn in the first eight months of the year from Pounds 13.4bn in the whole of 1992, with the improvement particularly in trade with non-EU countries. Spain, too, has profited from three devaluations of the peseta within the ERM since autumn 1992. Improved export competitiveness, combined with the effect of recession in reducing imports, has led to a sharp reduction in the trade deficit this year, with Spanish exports growing by an estimated 7 per cent in real terms this year, according to official Spanish statistics.</p>

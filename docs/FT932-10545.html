			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Pressure on Major to reshape cabinet after election defeats: PM admits voters gave government a 'bloody nose' MR JOHN MAJOR was under mounting pressure last night to reshape his cabinet after the worst set of election results for 20 years delivered a serious jolt to his premiership. As Conservatives digested a humiliating defeat in the Newbury by-election and unprecedented losses in county council elections, ministerial speculation intensified that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would be moved in a late July cabinet reshuffle. But Mr Major also faced criticism from Conservative MPs of his own style, with hints from some that his leadership could be questioned unless he moves quickly to restore the government's authority. With the prime minister conceding that voters had given the government a 'bloody nose', his associates said the government would have to re-examine its political agenda for next year, broadening its appeal to an angry electorate. As voters punished the Conservatives for the recession, the spectacular Liberal Democrat victory in Newbury marked the biggest by-election defeat suffered by a Tory government since 1972. A surge in support for Liberal Democrats and Labour in the local elections swept Tories from control across England, leaving them with the leadership of only one shire county. Senior ministers will be told next week to produce a series of populist measures to add to a legislative programme for the coming year that was to have concentrated almost entirely on law and order and deregulation. There were also suggestions that the government might slow the pace of British Rail privatisation and London bus deregulation. Mr Major insisted he would 'listen and learn' from the results but would not be panicked. His associates made it clear that he had not yet made any decisions about cabinet reshuffles. The prime minister told reporters: 'People were determined to give the government a bloody nose, and that, in practice, is what they did.' But he added: 'Never forget the Conservative party is perhaps the most formidable political fighting force anywhere in western Europe.' Mr Lamont became the principal focus for Tory alarm. Last night he said the government had received 'another clear reminder of the pain and difficulties of the recession'. But speaking to the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, he offered no hint that he was preparing to move aside. 'We do still have a long way to go,' he said. 'We must work harder. But the economy is now clearly moving in the right direction.' By contrast, senior Tory backbenchers lined up to offer scarcely-veiled warnings that Mr Major had to revamp his government to survive. 'I shall be surprised if we don't have a reshuffle over the next few months,' said Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 committee. Another Tory MP added privately: 'I suspect that the prime minister has got a year or his leadership is in question.' Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats vied to claim the bigger victory. The counties will see local deals between the main political parties on an unprecedented scale as Labour becomes the largest party in the shires - both in terms of the 14 councils it controls and its number of councillors. The Liberal Democrats claimed their own record: they now have more than 800 county councillors and control three counties. Independents control one, but the majority of county councils, a total of 28, are now under no overall control. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, hinted that the results could act as springboard for closer co-operation between the two opposition parties but Mr John Smith, Labour leader, went out of his way to reject suggestions of an electoral pact. Analyses of the county council results suggest Labour won the equivalent of 41 per cent of the national vote, the Tories 32 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats 24 per cent. Mr Smith said the government had 'totally lost the confidence of the men and women of Britain'. If reflected in a general election, the results would mean Labour having a majority at Westminster of more than 100 seats, he said. He said the damning verdict went to 'the very heart of government', and could not be resolved simply by a reshuffle.

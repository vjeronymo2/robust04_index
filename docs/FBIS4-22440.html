			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shod Muladzhanov: "Codeword: `Power Vacuum;' </F> Response: `Arbitrariness'"]    [Text] The apparat of bodies of authority is swelling  minute by minute. Almost every day there are reports of an  administration created, bosses appointed, a department expanded.  I am afraid that soon Moscow itself will be too small to  accommodate this gigantic army of do-nothings, bureaucrats  generating red tape on any question except one--their own  interests. These particular interests they tend to meticulously.  And generate one decision after the other, whose main purpose is  obvious: obtaining money for the budget to pay bureaucratic  salaries and create the conditions for unofficial  supplementation of these salaries with large bribes.    I apologize in advance to those few persons in ministries  and  agencies who do perform work that benefits the state, the  economy, and society. But there are thousands of others... One  gets the impression that someone is pursuing the goal of pure  sabotage: As soon as the situation in the economy and the social  sphere stabilizes slightly, decrees are adopted and directives  signed that inevitably lead to an explosion, another round of  inflation, and create problems for production, commercial  activities, and the consumer market. I am not inclined to think  in terms of sabotage, however. I insist on another explanation:  personal gain. Naturally, the growing budget deficit plants the  idea among the masses not included in the apparat orbit that it  is time to reduce bureaucratic agencies. Naturally, the presence  of numerous holes both in legislation and in approaches to its  implementation permits functionaries to extort considerable  money from anyone who wants to survive in the current chaos.    As if the first hike in customs duties was not enough--they  had to hit prices with a whip so hard that they jumped right  through the roof. As if it was not enough to add a 3 percent  surcharge to the absolutely contrived and unjustified in our  conditions value-added tax--beginning in April they decided to  quietly milk enterprises some more by increasing deductions,  which in the end go, again, not to pensioners and the disabled  but into the "fund for salvation of bureaucrats, bankrupts, and  producers of defective goods," which is what the state budget is  to a considerable extent today.    Arbitrariness awaits us everywhere; it is growing stronger,  propped up on the shoulders of the power vacuum. The law is not  a deterrent for those who turn off water and electricity in  homes, refuse to transport a patient to a hospital, in violation  of property rights tow automobiles away from the streets and  take them who knows where on the contrived grounds of illegal  parking--as if there is any place where they can be parked  legally. Some are arrested and then receive lengthy apologies;  others are left alone, despite clear signs of criminal  activities. This is everyday life. And in the economy, under  loud proclamations of loyalty to reforms, they strengthen the  monopolism of the poor excuse for producers who are incapable of  competing with the Thai cottage industry and African farmers.    How long can one try people's patience by playing with  presidential, government, and parliament decisions that span the  gigantic amplitude from "hurrah" and "this is the only way" to  "we apologize" and "we will take a different road now"? We are  in no danger of getting either a wise tsar or a wise leadership,  given the current disposition of forces in the top echelons. It  is time to search for and promote new intelligent people, who  could replace the current generation of powerless  powerholders--and not in a decade but in the nearest elections.  Civil accord is necessary and possible, but not on the basis of  a compromise between groups of chatterboxes--only on the basis  of true reforms in the economy and a well-defined approach to  social problems.</p>

The Catastrophic State of Nuclear Power  Engineering in Ukraine"]    [Text] Energodar-Zaporozhye -- The Ukrainian Supreme  Council has lifted the moratorium which it introduced in August  1990 on the construction of new units at the republic's nuclear  stations. The ban is lifted, but the chain reaction provoked by  it continues.    The Chernobyl disaster hit Ukraine twice. The first time was  in April 1986; the second in the summer of 1990. Behind the  "concern for the people's welfare" which moved some people's  deputies to conduct an unprecedented antinuclear campaign could  be seen a desire to reap political capital quickly for  themselves.    Hotheads, only superficially familiar with the problem,  assured the people that Ukraine could get by without nuclear  electric power stations [AES], and if they were all closed no  one would notice. Things never got as far as closures, but a  moratorium, the idea of which was supported by the Ukrainian  Communist Party and Communist deputies in parliament, was  adopted.    ...Ukraine's five AES's have fourteen power units with a  total capacity of 12.8 million kw. In 1990 they provided a  little less than one-third of all electricity generated in the  republic. Today nuclear stations bear 40 percent of the load.    But at the same time the symptoms of the current power  crisis  were already more than obvious. Since 1988 the generation of  electricity in the republic has constantly declined. There are  two reasons for this: First, half of the equipment at thermal  electric power stations [TES] is worn out and needs to be  replaced. Second, the extraction of energy sources has declined  in both Russia and Ukraine, and their price has risen. But  whereas TES's have reduced production, AES's have increased  theirs year after year.    ...Parliament's former decision halted the construction of  three megawatt units in the Zaporozhye, Rovno, and Khmelnitskaya  AES's. Economists have estimated that, given international  electricity prices of 6-7 cents per kilowatt, a year's  moratorium on one unit costs the country $500 million. However,  this is not all: In shutting the door to nuclear power  engineering, the Supreme Council automatically halted the  development of high technologies in Ukraine.    The first to disperse were the builders. Then came the turn  of personnel operating the AES's themselves. Clever people, the  majority of them young, at once understood that the moratorium  sounded the death knell to their careers in Ukraine. No new  units -- no new positions. And pay? In Russia the controller  of a unit [operator upravlenii blokom] earns $300 a month,  whereas at the Zaporozhye AES it is 10 times less. Many, just  to support their families, are forced to dash off to Moscow  after their shift and sell goods...    When Russia began to launch its own nuclear power  engineering  program, recruiters went in droves to Energodar and other  Ukrainian AES's. They offer the specialists they need not only  a decent wage, but also apartments. Highly skilled workers,  whose training takes from three to five years, began to pack  their suitcases en masse. This year alone around 400 qualified  nuclear engineers left for Russia. If things continue like  this, Vladimir Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye AES stated,  there will be simply no one to operate the sixth unit.    The moratorium forced plants producing equipment for AES's  to seek orders more crudely. The quality control system became  unnecessary and collapsed. As a result, many enterprises can no  longer deliver equipment meeting the requirements of nuclear  power engineering. The shortage of equipment and its low  quality and high cost have slowed the rate of the refitting of  operational units. It is clear that their safety has not  increased as a result.    It is now clear that the aims declared by the moratorium's  supporters were not achieved. The ecological situation in  Ukraine has not improved; rather the reverse. The generation of  electricity has fallen.    What should be done next? The moratorium has been lifted,  but, alas, this will not affect the power crisis in the  republic. The sixth unit at the Energodar AES will come on  stream not earlier than next March-April. Zaporozhye AES  workers, despite the ban, have nevertheless been able to  assemble the equipment and keep it in pre-operational mode. At  the Rovno and Khmelnitskaya stations construction of units is  not complete, and the equipment is not yet all in place. Now it  will have to be collected from all over the CIS or production  will have to be set up in Ukraine. Specialists believe that, on  condition that it is given strong state support, work could be  completed there in 1995-1996.    But what question can there be of support, when the Ministry  of Power and Electrification owes the Zaporozhye station alone  more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy already produced?  Ukraine's debt to its neighbors is great. So that the future  of these units is unclear, as is the future of power engineering  in the republic as a whole.</p>

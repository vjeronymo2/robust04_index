			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Crop fears lift potato prices - Market jitters mean good news for beleaguered British growers There is nothing like the suspicion of a shortage to stir up the markets - and the effect this has had on potato prices has put smiles back on the faces of Britain's 15,000 growers. Paradoxically, prices are rising mainly because the crops growers are harvesting are producing below budgeted yields. Twelve months ago, when last year's potatoes were being lifted, prices paid to farmers were around Pounds 60 per tonne. Excess supply kept the average ex-farm price around the same level until June this year. It was a barely break-even return for even the most efficient growers and resulted in substantial losses. This year has been different - and looks like continuing that way. There are three main reasons for this. First, last year's losses led to a slight under-planting against quotas in spring 1994 by growers who were feeling insecure. Not only had they made inadequate returns on their 1993 potatoes, they had also been forced to lift them during the wettest autumn for years. Second, they were aware that the future of the Potato Marketing Board, on which they had relied since the 1930s to support the market, was under threat from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Third, the spring was wet, cold and late. This meant that most potatoes were planted several weeks later than optimum, and soil temperatures were too low to promote normal growth. Early growth and maximum leaf cover before the heat of the summer are crucial to high yields, and in many cases this year that cover was not achieved in time - a problem made much worse by the July heatwave. This combination was potentially lethal for the potato crop, and 20 years ago would have led to a truly disastrous shortage. Fortunately about 60 per cent of UK potato growers are now able to irrigate their crops, saving a great many potatoes from being virtually burned in the soil. As a result domestic supplies, although reduced, should be adequate - with a little luck. That luck will be needed during the next few weeks as the so-called maincrop potato harvest gets under way. Provided there is not too much rain, the remaining acreage should be gathered safely, guaranteeing supplies until next spring. It is the possibility that the weather could turn wet again - and that this could cause losses when supplies are tight - that is presumably behind the feverish futures market and the high spot prices. Most farmers are being paid at least Pounds 100 per tonne - and in some cases Pounds 150 per tonne - more for potatoes this year than last. The futures price for next May went up last week to Pounds 240 per tonne. Given that this year's anticipated tonnage is 5.5m-5.6m tonnes, compared with about 6.2m tonnes last year, it may appear difficult to understand why prices should be so much higher. One reason may be that there is a shortage of alternative supplies in Europe. In Amsterdam and Lille, for instance, potato futures markets are said to be even more excited than London's. The same weather that reduced UK potato yields has affected crops in Holland and France, and those countries which can usually be relied on as sources of cheap surpluses are unlikely to be able to oblige this year. There will be plenty of happy faces at this week's potato harvesting demonstration near York, for there are few farm crops which respond to the suspicion of a shortage more dramatically than potatoes. This buoyancy has led to headlines in the tabloid press saying that retail potato prices will double or more during the coming winter. The sources of these stories can only be guessed at, but are they justified? Consider these figures: the current ex-farm price for top quality King Edward potatoes is Pounds 200 per tonne, or 20p per kg. The wholesale price for the same grade and the same variety is 24p per kg. But last weekend the retail price for King Edwards, packed in plastic bags of 2.5kg at my local supermarket, was 66p per kg - or Pounds 660 per tonne. I am well aware that packing, transporting and displaying potatoes on shelves costs money. But I would have thought there was a sufficient margin between the wholesale price and retail price for a fair proportion of the kind of ex-farm increases I have described to be absorbed without significantly affecting profitability. Retailers often say that consumers prefer price stability. No doubt that is why they hold prices higher than they need to be when wholesale levels fall. Many farmers believe that policy has governed the retail price of potatoes over a number of years. The coming winter will be an ideal opportunity for those retailers to demonstrate that they really do believe in price stability - even when the market goes modestly against them.</p>

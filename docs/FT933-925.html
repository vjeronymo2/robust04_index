			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Brittan starts hunt for concessions: Sir Leon has to get some sort of deal for France on farm trade SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will be in an unenviable position when today in Washington he meets Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to try to agree on a compatible EC-US agenda for concluding the seven-year-old Uruguay Round world trade reform talks. Sir Leon has to get some sort of deal for France on farm trade, in the knowledge that failure to deliver apparent US concessions may well sink the Gatt round and embroil the EC in a profound internal crisis. But US flexibility on farm trade, if at all possible, will very likely come at the expense of EC settling for less in other areas of the trade talks, such as access to the US financial services market. So what margin for manoeuvre does Sir Leon have? First, it lies in American willingness to be flexible on some of the details of Blair House. Second, political presentation of any eventual deal will depend on the fact that the details of Blair House are not widely known - especially, Paris appears to be assuming, in France. Paris demands that food aid should be exempt from the 21 per cent cut over six years in subsidised food exports prescribed by Blair House, which is France's main concern about the agreement. Food aid, however, is already exempt from the Blair House curbs. Whether Sir Leon can get any concessions at all, however, is far from assured. France's overall aim is to ensure that the 21 per cent cuts on subsidised food exports never have to be made. Last year's reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy introduced big price cuts and restraints on overproduction. The European Commission maintains that by around mid-way through the Gatt/Blair House timetable, EC prices will as a result dip to around world market levels - making export subsidies and therefore the Blair House cuts superfluous, and EC prices competitive not only abroad but against imports. The US and other agri-exporters do not take these estimates on faith, and nor does France, although it signed up to CAP reform in May 1992. Although France could not then, and can not now, say this publicly, French officials privately admit that their main concern was that the CAP reform did not cut prices enough. If EC prices are still above world level when the CAP reform cuts have run their course (at the end of 1996) and a Gatt deal on farm trade comes on stream (probably around mid-1995) French subsidised exports will be hit. The alternatives would be to dispense with the export subsidies anyway, or drop EC prices further. Blair House allows full compensation to farmers for price cuts, but Paris appears politically unwilling to risk either of these options, much less proclaim them as solutions to France's militant farmers. What the French therefore appear to want Sir Leon to concentrate on with the Americans is so-called 'front-loading' and food stocks. There may just be room for settlement on these two issues. On 'front-loading,' the Uruguay Round draft agreement or 'final act' calls for the 21 per cent export volume curbs to be made evenly, at about 3.5 per cent a year, over the six years. But the 'final act' is still a draft, open to some modification. France wants to be able to shift the cuts to the end of the timetable, in the hope they will not have to be made at all. France's attempt to get the EC's food mountains exempted from the curbs is directly linked to this. Flexibility on timing would allow the EC to get rid of its stocks without running into the export curbs. Blair House was originally vague on this problem. But EC negotiators have told the FT that a subsequent EC-US memorandum established a formula, requiring full cuts in the first and sixth years of the accord, with freedom to postpone cuts during intervening years, provided these are 'paid back' within no more than a year. Interpretations of this vary. One of the main negotiators of Blair House says 'it really means equal amounts' to be cut each year. Another says 'if the Americans want to be helpful, that is an area in which we can resolve this.' If Sir Leon can get some movement in this area, the Commission and France's partners must also work to help Paris dress up any eventual deal. It is not widely appreciated, for instance, that Blair House will require the US to cut its wheat exports from 19.7m tonnes to 14m tonnes. Moreover, both US and EC negotiators of Blair House believe that it 'gives less access to the Community market than was the case last year,' as one European negotiator put it. On stocks, the underlying rise in EC grain stockpiles is running at about half the level prior to CAP reform; French officials are at the moment choosing to dramatise the stocks figures by ignoring seasonal trends and developments since CAP price and output cuts started to bite this summer. One of the EC architects of Blair House maintains, furthermore, that the 'worst case scenario' drawn up by independent economists - premised on annual 1 per cent grain yield increases nullifying part of the CAP reform restraints - 'still leaves us on the wrong side of the Gatt limits for (exporting subsidised) bread-making wheat by only 1m to 1.5m tonnes - and that can be given out as food aid.'</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Braddock prescribes some healthcare for his future - The move to fast-growing Medco by the former Citibank president is intriguing WALL STREET was taken by surprise last October when Mr Richard Braddock, the president of Citicorp, America's largest bank, announced he was resigning. But many are even more intrigued at the new job the 51-year-old Mr Braddock has just landed - this time as chief executive of a small, but fast-growing, healthcare company located in suburban New Jersey. Conventional wisdom had it - and Mr Braddock admits he was prone to the same view - that the Citicorp man would go into executive hibernation for several months until he had found a suitably traditional and high profile corporate post. There was even speculation Mr Braddock might be asked to succeed Mr James Robinson, who will be resigning as chief executive of American Express, the rather battered financial services and travel group. Instead of a conventional career move, Mr Braddock - who began his pre-Citicorp career in consumer marketing at General Foods - will this month become chief executive of Medco Containment Services, a company with 6,000 employees and Dollars 1.8bn of revenues in its last financial year. Medco is a darling of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, although its share price of about Dollars 38 is no bargain at nearly 40 times prospective 1993 earnings. But the company is the leading mail service distributor in the US of prescription drugs to employer and insurance company healthcare benefit plans. It acts as a middle man, buying from drug manufacturers and offering discounted prices to beneficiaries of company healthcare plans. Mr Kenneth Abramowitz, a healthcare analyst at the New York research firm of Sanford Bernstein, reckons Medco controls about 50 per cent of the Dollars 4bn-a-year US market in mail service prescriptions. He and other analysts say the market is likely to enjoy annual growth of 25 to 30 per cent during the 1990s. 'Medco is a very tough competitor and a very innovative company, so I would expect them to hold the market share,' says Mr Abramowitz. He is not the only analyst who has been heaping praise on the company. A recent study by Merrill Lynch noted Medco held the key to success by combining large pools of healthcare beneficiaries with economies of scale and then relying on systems and software to get the most cost-effective medicine to patients. 'We know of no other company presently that possesses all these attributes for success,' said Merrill Lynch. Medco at present has more than 1,200 institutional clients, ranging from dozens of Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric to federal employees; it is a pool of more than 32m people in the US. The company earned Dollars 102m of net profits in the year to June 30, and analysts expect it to make Dollars 130m on 39 per cent higher revenues of Dollars 2.5bn in the year to next June. The need to reduce healthcare costs has been a big theme of President-elect Bill Clinton and was also discussed last week by Mr Harold Poling, the Ford chairman who complained that 'the rapidly rising costs of healthcare are a concern not only to Ford, but to the entire nation.' Thus corporate managements, insurers and government agencies all need to manage their healthcare liabilities. That is perhaps why Mr Braddock displays such a boyish enthusiasm for Medco, saying the company has 'an awesome upside potential'. His bullishness is doubtless helped along by a five-year contract which will pay him Dollars 750,000 a year, plus an attractive stock options package for 1.25m shares of Medco and half a million more shares in two quoted Medco subsidiaries. The job offer came to Mr Braddock the day after his Citicorp resignation was announced. Mr Martin Wygod, who founded Medco eight years ago and serves as its chairman, telephoned him immediately, having got to know the Citicorp president as a private banking client of the bank. Mr Wygod says he was motivated by the success Mr Braddock had in the 1980s in managing high-growth businesses on the consumer side of Citicorp and by his consumer marketing background. 'I was always interested in him. It's very hard to find somebody who can deal with a substantial amount of change, who can turn a short-term advantage into a long-term strategic advantage,' he says. Mr Wygod, who is 52, has experience as an entrepreneur. Just before he founded Medco in 1983 he had sold out Glassrock, another publicly-quoted healthcare company he had started. The buyer, for a total of Dollars 125m, was British Oxygen. For his part, Mr Braddock says he wanted to get out of banking. 'I don't consider myself a banker,' he explains, noting that his real desire was 'to manage a rapidly-growing consumer business'. As the new chief executive, Mr Braddock expects to develop Medco's retail side, where the company has point-of-sale ties to 57,000 pharmacies across the US. Both he and Mr Wygod are also keen to make more acquisitions, such as last month's takeover of American Biodyne, a California-based manager of cost containment in mental healthcare with Dollars 130m of annual turnover. 'This company,' says Mr Braddock, 'can define its own upside. What we have to do is make the right strategic choices and get the right people.' Mr Braddock cites as possible growth options the widening of product lines beyond prescriptions and mental healthcare to workmen's compensation, as well as increasing market share by signing up more employee benefit schemes. And he notes with relish that Medco has a unique database of patients, many of whom have a plastic card that could be developed for other products. While he is excited about his new career, Mr Braddock is distinctly unsentimental about leaving Citicorp. 'It's history,' he says with a shrug. He also notes ('to put things in context') that Medco's market capitalisation of Dollars 5.9bn is not far from that of Citicorp, which is about Dollars 7.8bn. Medco's prospects as a go-go company in the 1990s are summed up by Mr Abramowitz, who believes pharmaceutical cost-containment is still in its early days. 'Drug costs in America are out of control and very few companies know how to control them. Medco is one of the very few that can.'</p>

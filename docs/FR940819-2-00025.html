			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  G&amp;A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal year. As such, the Department calculated G&amp;A on an annual historical basis. In order to avoid overstating G&amp;A expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary effects, we applied the G&amp;A ratio ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the ratio of annual G&amp;A expenses to cost of goods sold reflected in the financial statements) to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. In addition, CBCC had failed to include Solvay do Brasil's G&amp;A expenses. Therefore, we applied a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&amp;A in the final calculation of these costs (see CBCC Calculation Adjustment Memorandum, February 2, 1994). This is consistent with the method we used to calculate G&amp;A expenses in the remand determination in the underlying investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in the calculation of CBCC's raw material costs. Petitioners contend that these taxes are included on home market sales, and must, therefore, be included in the COP of home market merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners' argument that ICMS and IPI taxes are included on home market sales is not relevant since CBCC's home market sales were insufficient to form a basis for FMV and, therefore, FMV was based upon third country sales. However, we agree that, since the ICMS and IPI taxes resulted in a net cost to CBCC, the Department should include this net amount of ICMS and IPI in the submitted COP and CV amounts. Our reasoning for doing so is discussed further in our response to comment 6, which involved a similar situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners argue that the Department failed to include CBCC's and Minasligas's imputed credit expenses in the preliminary CV calculations. Petitioners argue that the Department should make an adjustment for imputed credit in the final calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners. In these final results we have included CBCC's and Minasligas's imputed credit costs in our calculation of CV. We based this adjustment on the credit expenses that these companies incurred on home market or third-country sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend that the Department should use the quartz replacement costs reported by Minasligas in its original COP/CV response rather than the costs reported in Minasligas's revised response of November 9, 1993. Minasligas provided average quartz delivery charges in its revised COP/CV response. Petitioners note that the Department's verification report indicates that averaging freight charges significantly understates Minasligas's type A quartz costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minasligas contends that, while the corrected cost data may result in lower delivered prices for type A quartz, the revised data result in significantly lower overall replacement costs for that material. Minasligas indicates that it does not object to use of the quartz replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response, and notes that the Department used these costs in the preliminary calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the delivered cost of type A quartz, by allocating the delivery charges among all quartz purchases. Accordingly, we have rejected the revised replacement cost for quartz and relied upon the cost information Minasligas reported in its original COP/CV response. As Minasligas notes, this is the information we used in reaching the preliminary results of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 15: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners state that the Department determined at verification that Minasligas did not include forest amortization costs in its calculation of charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners argue that omission of these expenses significantly understates the cost of the charcoal which Minasligas produced. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the costs associated with Minasligas's purchase of charcoal from unrelated suppliers in the final calculation of charcoal replacement costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minasligas argues that the charcoal replacement costs it reported in its original COP/CV response were exclusively based on the delivered price charged to the company by suppliers cutting trees on land that Minasligas did not own. Minasligas contends that it pays less for charcoal cut from trees on its own land, and that its corrected charcoal costs are significantly lower than those reported in its original COP/CV response. Minasligas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the Department should use the charcoal replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response, if the Department decides not to use the corrected charcoal replacement costs supplied by Minasligas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the replacement cost of charcoal by averaging the payment to subcontractors for charcoal obtained from company-owned land with the higher costs from unrelated charcoal vendors. This calculation does not include any cost to Minasligas for acquiring forests or planting and maintaining forests. Accordingly, we have rejected the revised replacement cost for charcoal and relied upon the cost information provided by Minasligas in its original COP/CV response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Arguments the same Sir, In the Lex column, powerful arguments were advanced in favour of the rationalisation (by merger) of the US rail network ('US railroads', October 7). The comment was made that the 'fragmented rail network is an immense burden on the US economy. It drives up costs. . .and prevents the sector winning business from road haulage. Rationalisation would also allow rail companies to cut duplicative headquarters, rail routes. . .'. Forgive me for quoting so much. The reason is that the arguments apply with equal, indeed greater force, to the forthcoming fragmentation of the British Rail network. Would it not be sensible to call a halt before further costs are incurred and the network is actually broken up.

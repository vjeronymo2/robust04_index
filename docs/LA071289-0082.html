			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KPWR, THOMAS ON TOP -- ARBITRON POLL  </P> <P> KPWR-FM(105.9) is still ruling the airwaves as it has for the past two years,  according to the latest quarterly audience survey, released Tuesday by Arbitron  Ratings Service. And Jay Thomas, morning drive-time deejay for the station that  calls itself "Power 106," has overtaken Rick Dees of rival KIIS-FM (102.7) as  the Los Angeles area's top-rated morning personality.  </P> <P> Overall, KIIS slipped from No. 2 to No. 4 in the ratings, slightly above the  newest rock station, KQLZ-FM "Pirate Radio" (100.3), which jumped to No. 5 in  the ratings with a 62% increase in listenership from the previous quarter.  </P> <P> KOST-FM (103.5), which plays "easy listening" hits, has taken over KIIS' No. 2  spot. KABC-AM (790), Southern California's well-established talk station, came  in at No. 3, maintaining its stronghold as the only talk station in the top  five.  </P> <P> Although this quarter generally did not differ markedly from previous ratings  periods, the most startling development was hard-rocking newcomer KQLZ. "Pirate  Radio" scuttled its easy-listening format on March 17 and, amid a major  advertising blitz, has drawn audiences tired of deejay banter, commercials and  dance music.  </P> <P> For its first 10 days, the station, which program director and morning deejay  Scott Shannon decribes as "free-form Top 40," had no commercial interruptions  and it still has fewer ads than other rock stations.  </P> <P> KIIS, known for its big-money giveaways and top 40 playlist, had ranked No. 2  in the previous quarter and No. 3 for the two previous periods. KIIS officials  were unavailable for comment on the station's ratings drop.  </P> <P> The rest of the Top 10 provided few changes from the previous quarter, with  "easy listening" (also known as adult-contemporary) formats placing high.  Besides KOST, KBIG-FM (104.3) came in at No. 6, followed by another  easy-listening station, KJOI-FM (98.7).  </P> <P> The Arbitron survey covered a 12-week period from March 30 through June 21 and  based its data on information recorded by listeners in personal diaries over a  seven-day period.  </P> <P> "Power 106," the teen dance music station, has been No. 1 in Arbitron surveys  for the past eight quarters, according to promotions manager Jim Peterson, but  Thomas has never before been the top-rated morning morning deejay.  </P> <P> Top morning drive-time personalities behind Thomas were KABC's Ken Minyard and  Bob Arthur and KLOS-FM's (95.5) Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps. Dees was  fourth.  </P> <P> The quarter saw several other format changes besides KQLZ's. Former rock  station KEDG-FM (101.9) bought the easy-listening record library that KQLZ had  been using as KIQQ, nicknamed K-LITE, and took over the nickname as well on May  12. Since the switch, its ratings have dropped still lower, from .9 to .7  despite a high-profile advertising campaign.  </P> <P> KNX-FM, which changed its call letters to KODJ-FM (93.1) and its format from  album-oriented rock to oldies on March 2, placed 17th, beating out "classic  rock" station KLSX-FM (97.1), which came in 21st. KLSX tied with all-talk  station KFI-AM (640), which, despite its stronger signal and promotional  assaults, has not been able to come close to all-talk leader KABC.  </P> <P> Here are the area's top 15 stations, followed by their ratings for the most  recent spring quarter and the preceding winter quarter, as measured by  Arbitron.  </P> <P> Spring Winter  </P> <P> 1.

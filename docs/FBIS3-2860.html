			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- China's open policy  has injected vitality into the economies of its border areas.    Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) expressed  appreciation of Premier Li Peng's call for border areas to open  wider in his government work report delivered at an NPC session  Thursday [10 March].    Shao Qihui, provincial governor of Heilongjiang, which  borders on Russia, said the opening of border areas has brought  a historical development opportunity to the province located in  the northeast Asia economic region.    Heilongjiang shares a 3,000-km-plus border with Russia.  Since the adoption of the open policy, border trade has boomed  between Heilongjiang and Russia, he said.    Last year, Heilongjiang-Russian border trade reached 2.6  billion Swiss francs, two-thirds of China's total border trade  with Russia of that year, Shao said.    To further open up, the governor said, Heilongjiang will  speed up the construction of an international trade route  network, with priority given to completing railways and highways  that go from the provincial capital of Harbin to Russia via the  province's major border cities.    The province will also open up land-sea and river-sea  transport routes and air routes to Europe and America.    Heilongjiang will also look for new markets and take an  active part in economic cooperation in the northeast Asia  economic region.    Shao said the province will encourage cities along the  border  to establish friendly and long-term cooperative ties with  corresponding areas and cities in Russia.    Priority will also be gradually shifted to Sino-foreign  economic and technical cooperation from traditional barter  trade, the governor said.</p>

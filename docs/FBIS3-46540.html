The special teams, which are similar to the task forces that  China formed to prepare for normalization of diplomatic ties  with the United States and Japan, are led by Vice President Kim  Yong-chu, who is President Kim Il-song's younger brother and was  only a few weeks ago reinstated by the party, and Party  Secretary Hwang Chang-yop, respectively.    "The special teams control all the negotiations related to  South Korean and U.S. affairs," the official said. "The special  team for South Korean affairs is headed by Kim Yong-chu and Kim  Tal-hyon, who was recently dismissed as State Planning  Commission chairman and vice premier, while the team for U.S.  affairs is led by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, a party  secretary," he said.    "North Korea established the teams because Kim Chong-il  aspires to epochal achievements in foreign and inter-Korean  relations, including the forming of diplomatic relations with  Washington, this year, the 20th year since he was named  successor to Kim Il-song."    Kim became chairman of the National Defense Committee last  year, assuming the big three powers of the party, the government  and the military, and is expected to take over as party general  secretary this year.    Kim Yong-chu became vice president at a plenary meeting of  the Workers' Party Central Committee last month while Kim  Tal-hyon was dismissed as vice premier and State Planning  Commission chairman "to be transferred to other post."</p>

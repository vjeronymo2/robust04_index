			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Housebuilding rises despite slow market Building of new houses increased early this summer in spite of a sluggish housing market, figures published yesterday by the Environment Department indicate. These show that the number of new homes started by builders rose by 15 per cent during the three months to the end of July compared with the corresponding period last year. Housing starts were also 1 per cent higher than during the previous three months, said the department. Private-sector starts, although 13 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year, were 2 per cent lower than during the previous three months. The number of private homes started by builders in the first seven months of this year rose by 14 per cent to 91,200 compared with 79,800 at the same stage last year. New-house sales, although only about 10 per cent of the market, have outperformed the general housing market this year, taking market share from sales of existing houses and flats which have remained sluggish. House prices as a result have barely moved. According to Halifax Building Society they fell by 0.3 per cent during the 12 months to the end of August. New house prices had risen by 2.6 per cent over the same period, the society said. Builders, which had become concerned at a dip in sales during June and July, have recently reported a recovery in August. Persimmon, the country's eighth-largest builder, last week said that its August sales were a quarter higher than during the corresponding month last year. Wilson Bowden, which yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 16.5m, said that it had seen a slight increase in August but not to the same extent as other builders had reported. Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, said that new house prices, after allowing for the removal of sales incentives and discounts, had risen by about 3 per cent over the past 12 months. Sales traditionally rise in September and October after the school holidays. Wilson Bowden results, Page 25</p>

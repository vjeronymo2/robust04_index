			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Dutch financial group climbs ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, reported an 18.7 per cent rise in nine-month net profit to Fl 1.65bn (Dollars 943m) from Fl 1.39bn, as both banking and insurance operations recorded strong gains. The nine-month performance, which exceeded analysts' expectations, prompted ING to forecast that net profit per share in 1994 will be higher than the Fl 8.04 posted in 1993. Previously, ING had predicted that per-share earnings would at least match those of last year. In the third quarter alone, net profit rose by 18.4 per cent to Fl 580m from Fl 490m a year ago, the company said. In insurance, pre-tax results for the first nine months rose by 26.0 per cent to Fl 1.25bn, with Dutch operations in particular contributing to the strength of the increase. Life insurance showed a 23.2 per cent increase, while non-life insurance jumped by 96.3 per cent, though this was due partly to the deconsolidation in April 1993 of Orion, ING's UK subsidiary. ING noted that non-life results in the US fell into loss because of extreme weather in the early part of the year. Pre-tax banking results were up 19.4 per cent at Fl 1.14bn for the first nine months, reflecting improved interest margins and expanded business volumes. ING's banking arm was also helped by the recent recovery in the price of Latin American bonds. In the first six months, sharp price declines caused the group's results from financial transactions, securities and participations to fall into a loss of Fl 8m from a profit of Fl 566m. However, at the nine-month stage, trading results were back in the black at Fl 404m, though still well below last year's Fl 777m.</p>

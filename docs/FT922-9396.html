			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims to woo fishery investors INDIA IS aiming to build on the impressive growth it has achieved in the past two years in the export of marine products. It is planning to encourage the participation of foreign companies in deep sea fishing, coastal aquaculture and production and marketing of value-added sea food in consumer packs. Joint ventures, in which the foreign partners can have majority equity participation, will be allowed to import new as well old vessels for fishing and given freedom to hire 50 per cent of their crews abroad. The Indian Marine Products Export Development Authority has been assigned the task of wooing foreign investors. According to industry experts, India's 2m sq km (770,000 square miles) of sea area offers a potential catch of more than 4.5m tonnes of seafood a year. At present, however, the annual harvest is only about 2.3m tonnes. India has nearly 1.4m hectares (3,500 acres) of brackish, marshy lands on the sea coast offering vast scope for aquaculture, of which less than 70,000 ha has so far been brought into production. Out of the 60 varieties of shrimp found in Indian waters, six have so far been identified as suitable for aquaculture. A number of big Indian companies, including the Tatas, ITC, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Thapars, DCM and Escorts, have plans for major investments in aquaculture. The government believes, nevertheless, that without foreign participation India's progress in capture and culture fishery will be less than satisfactory. The country's marine products exports in the year to March 1992 increased by 10.75 per cent to Dollars 557.42m. In terms of quantity, it shipped 171,989 tonnes representing a growth of 23.36 per cent. According to Mr CT Sukumaran, chairman of Impeda, Japan continues to be the single biggest market for Indian marine products, accounting for 50 per cent of exports by value. The other important markets for India are Western Europe, the US, Singapore and Hong Kong. The dominant export item is frozen shrimp, which constitutes more than 70 per cent of the total export value of marine products. India also exports lobster, squid, shark fins and fresh and frozen fish. If Impeda succeeds in its mission to attract adequate foreign investment and if Indian business houses' new-found interest in marine products is sustained, then India should be able to achieve its export target of Dollars 1.184m by 1996-97, the final year of its eighth five year plan.</p>

And ties between the two big powers are facing a  rocky period. Lin Shaowen has the details.    Moscow said Wednesday [23 February] that it would expose CIA  agents in Russia in retaliation for accusations by the U.S. that  an American spy for Russian bought [as heard] secret documents.  It is the first time that Moscow has responded since the spying  case came to light this week. Aldrich Ames, the former chief of  the CIA's counterintelligence network, and his wife were  arrested in Washington on Monday. They were accused of spying  for the former Soviet Union and Russia for nine years. The  Department of Justice said that they had received more than $1.5  million for selling vital information on CIA operations and  personnel.    U.S. President Bill Clinton described the case as very  serious and ordered an official protest to the Russian  Government. Some American senators called on the government to  freeze aid for Russia immediately. Moscow had no reply in the  beginning. The U.S. demanded that Russia withdraw diplomats who  were involved in the spying case or America would take the  action themselves. But Russia would not bow under the pressure  easily. It has been enjoying the limelight after its successful  mediation of the Sarejevo crisis. Senior Russian officials said  that the spy scandal might have been revealed to discredit the  success of Russian foreign policy in the Balkan region. Russian  Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said the case was a  return to the psychology of the Cold War. He said that  exaggerating the scandal would be harmful to relations between  the two countries. Russia has recently taken a tougher stance  on several issues. President Boris Yeltsin publicly criticized  the West for trying to resolve major international issues  without involving the Kremlin. Although the American Government  is uneasy about a stronger Russia, there is not much it can do  about it. Even a top White House official admitted that many  vital American interests are tied up in the relationship with  Russia. Washington has committed $2.5 billion of aid to Russia  this year to foster its economic reform. And even after the  espionage case surfaced, President Clinton reaffirmed that  Washington will continue to pursue its supportive policy toward  Yeltsin. Russia isn't likely to ignore the U.S. demands  completely. If it wants to restore its status as a superpower,  it will have to learn how to play ball according to a few rules.  The U.S. and Russia were old competitors for several decades.  In recent years, relations have become a lot warmer. But a lot  of negotiations are going to be needed this time to keep the  honeymoon going and the couple away from divorce court. For  China Radio International, I am Lin Shaowen.</p>

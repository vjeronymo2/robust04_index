			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Marching Toward a Modern Enterprise System" column, by </F> staff reporter Mo Xinyuan (5459 2450 0337): "Molding Oneself  According to the Owner's Demand--Reports on Comprehensive  Reforms Carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation (second installment)" -- first paragraph is editor's  note]    [Text] Editor's Note: The first installment, entitled "The  Market Calls For a New Role," mainly relates the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation's efforts to explore reform before  it became a state asset management company, suggesting that its  transformation into a "new role" has been entirely the outcome  of deepening reform and an inevitable progression in coping with  market economic development. This article mainly explains the  difference between the new Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation and the old one, following its transformation. What  are its responsibilities and rights in its relations with the  higher authorities? How will it affect its subordinate  enterprises as the "boss" of state assets? How have they changed  their relationship from one between "mother-in-law and  daughter-in-law" to one between "mother and son?"    "The separation of asset management from government  administration is an important condition for the separation of  enterprise management from government administration. The  universal significance of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation's reform finds expression in the creation of state  asset representatives in enterprises themselves. They can  ensure and increase the value of state assets and operate state  assets according to market economic demands." -- Written by a  person in the State Structural Reform Commission who is familiar  with the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform.    At its 19th Standing Committee meeting on 13 August 1993,  the  Beijing Municipal Government decided to authorize the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation to manage state assets.  Subsequently, in accordance with the decision by the municipal  government and under the specific guidance of the Beijing  Municipal State Asset Administration, the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation completed the verification and appraisal  of the corporation's state assets after three months of busy  work. On 7 December of the same year, it registered the  following: Legal person's name: The Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation. Registered capital: 1.288 billion yuan.  First item in its business scope: State asset management.    In Beijing, this was the first enterprise granted the right  to manage state assets.    After an enterprise is authorized to manage state  assets, is it an operator or the owner's representative? If it  is the former case, reform is stagnant; if it is the latter  case, a breakthrough is made in reform. The Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation has transformed itself from an "employee"  into the "boss" representative.    What does it mean to authorize an enterprise to manage state  assets? On this question, this reporter [Mo Xinyuan]  interviewed Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation.    [Cui] There are still different opinions on this question.  Some people are still of the opinion that what has been granted  to the enterprise is only an operationing right; the state is  still the owner and the enterprise is only an operator. We do  not agree with this view. In our opinion, this authorization  has made us a representative of the owner who possesses that  part of state assets. We represent the state in exercising  ownership, therefore we are the owner.    [Mo] What is the difference between being an operator and  being the owner?    [Cui] According to these people's opinion, the state is the  owner and we are only the operator. In this case, our reform is  stagnant. For a long time, the relation between management and  ownership in state enterprises has been unclear. It has been  unclear who will represent the owner of state assets. Under the  planned-economy structure, the entire country was a great  factory and all enterprises were its workshops. This no longer  suits the market economy. Only when an enterprise becomes a  competitive body of "four self's" [self-accumulation of funds,  self-construction, self-management, and self-assumption of  responsibility for profits and losses], can it enter the market.  This is an essential demand of the market economy. If the  enterprise is an operator and the state is the owner, problems  will arise in two aspects. The first is that if the state is  the owner, it is "false" because either everyone or no one can  represent it--a case resulting in the falsification of the asset  ownership body and a large-scale loss of state assets. The  second aspect is that if the owner is represented by a  government department, this will cause the mixing of enterprise  management and government administration, and the enterprise  will become the subsidiary of a government department.  Moreover, if a government department is the owner, it will find  it difficult to enter the production factors market or to engage  in the trading of proprietary rights; thus it is also impossible  to display the basic role of the market in optimizing resource  distribution.    In its reform, the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation faced not only low economic results, but  a number of problems as well, such as upgrading its production,  adjusting its arrangements and structure, and optimizing its  resource distribution. To resolve these problems, it will not  do to rely on enterprise reform alone; there is a need to create  a new type of state asset representative that can perform  ownership over the part of state assets within the framework of  authorization and also can operate this part of state assets in  the market as an enterprise.    [Mo] With this authorization, the enterprise has ownership.  Does this mean carving out state ownership over state assets?    [Cui] This is not carving out state ownership, but grading  it. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee formed the concept about the proprietary right  of an enterprise's legal person. This is a major breakthrough  in China's enterprise reform theory, and points out the  orientation for clearly defining the relationship between  management and ownership. The state has final ownership,  whereas the enterprise has the legal person's proprietary right.  This is graded ownership. Without this graded ownership, the  separation of enterprise management from state administration  will forever remain empty talk. Through our own reform, we have  understood that the asset dispenser's ownership can be derived  from between these two tiers of ownership. This asset  dispenser's ownership will be undertaken by the state asset  representative authorized by the state so as to ensure state  asset value and increments in this value. The essence of  authorized operation is the separation of government  administration from asset management. The enterprise will  operate this part of state assets and also can make investments.  Therefore, the grading of state asset ownership does not change  the nature of state ownership over state assets; it confirms the  rational existence form, task, and responsibility of state asset  ownership at different levels of economic operations according  to market economic demands so as to promote state-owned economic  development. Obviously, this falls into the category of system  formation.    With this authorization, we have formulated regulations that  provide, among other things, for the following: "This  corporation is a state asset representative with legal  registration and is a wholly state-invested corporation with  limited liabilities." "As the asset owner, this corporation  represents the state in operating and managing the part of state  assets within the framework of government authorization." With  this new status, we can possess the "key" to practicing the  optimal distribution and rational circulation of the state  assets in the former light industrial departments affiliated  with the corporation.    It does not matter whether one's power is great or  small, but the most fearful thing is undefined responsibility.  With a clearly defined relationship between management and  ownership, enterprises can perform their different duties and  functions. The relationship between the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation and its affiliated enterprises has  changed from one between "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law" to  one between "mother and son."    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has 122  enterprises and institutions. These include enterprises  manufacturing brand-name products, like the Xinghai Piano  Factory, the Hongxing Brand Liquor Distillery, and a wristwatch  factory. There are enterprise groups comprising dozens of  enterprises, such as the glass group company, the paper  manufacturing group company, and the Liyuan company. There are  also 85 joint-venture factories, centers, and projects. What  changes has the establishment of the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation as a state asset owner brought about in  these enterprises? What impact has it had? Let us listen to  Assistant General Manager Yang Zhide's explanations:    [Yang] After clearly defining the corporation's reform  ideas,  we held several discussions with enterprise leaders. Early this  year, we held a work meeting for leaders of enterprises and  institutions affiliated with the corporation, during which our  reform program was submitted for discussion. This reform  program was unanimously supported by the participants.    The most important change was the establishment of the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as the "boss," which  can influence its subordinates with its power. It has the right  and power to benefit from the assets, to make major decisions,  and to select managerial personnel, but it does not interfere in  the daily production and operations of its affiliated  enterprises. The assets of its affiliated enterprises are  formed with the corporation's investments, and these enterprises  are responsible for ensuring the value of these assets and also  their increments. Thus the relationship between the corporation  and its affiliated enterprises has changed from one between  "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," which is of an  administrative subordination nature, to one between "mother and  son," which is characterized by the relationship between  management and ownership.    [Mo] Does this change make enterprise leaders feel they have  been "downgraded"?    [Yang] The separation of the owner from the operator is the  demand of social productive forces' development. The positions  of the owner and the operator must not be mistaken, as this  could lead to confusion. Some of our enterprise leaders think  they are the owner's representatives. This is a  misunderstanding resulting from a confused idea about the  relationship between management and ownership. As a matter of  fact, a clear definition of enterprise roles, responsibilities,  and rights will be more favorable for them in the performance of  their duties and functions.    In the past, when a government  department formed a company, it abolished the legal person's  position of the enterprise affiliated with it. We do not do  this. The mother company and the branch company are independent  legal persons enjoying an equal position in civil rights. The  branch company possesses the right to the legal person's assets  formed with the investments of the asset dispenser, including  the state. It carries out independent operations, assumes sole  responsibility for its profits and losses, pays taxes according  to regulations, and enjoys all the rights provided by Enterprise  Law, the Regulations on the Transformation of State Enterprises'  Operational Mechanisms, and Beijing's methods for implementing  these regulations. Therefore many enterprises are of the  opinion that we are not withdrawing powers from them, but are  delegating powers to them. Comrades in these enterprises said  jokingly: Evidently, "mother is more intimate to son" than  "mother-in-law to daughter-in-law."    [Mo] How does the mother company manage the assets?    [Yang] First, it practices a new leadership system, which is  the general manager responsibility system under the leadership  of the board of directors. Second, it has established rules and  regulations, such as the company's regulations, methods to  operate and manage state assets, and methods to award or punish  operators. Principal enterprise leaders will be awarded or  punished according to the letter of responsibility for state  asset operation and the contract of responsibility for target  fulfillment, by referring to the increment rate, profit rate,  and net turnover of state assets, as well as the fulfillment of  other targets. In short, the previous practice of exercising  management over enterprises to the neglect of state assets has  been changed to the current practice of exercising management  over state assets while relaxing control over enterprises.    In the next step, we will introduce graded authorization.  Large group companies will be granted asset operational rights  in light of their specific conditions so that they will be  entitled to an asset dispenser's status, which will be favorable  to asset invigoration in the group companies themselves.    "Through a thorough transformation, we can free ourselves  from miscellaneous administrative affairs and concentrate on  this entirely new field: Making an overall plan for further  development of assets, optimization of resource distribtuion,  and adjustment of the structure," Cui Zhian said excitedly.  "The power of models is limitless. Now many enterprises and  staff members in cities who cannot see their development  prospects have asked us to `optimize their resource  distribution' as soon as possible so they can learn from the  match factory in revitalizing itself.

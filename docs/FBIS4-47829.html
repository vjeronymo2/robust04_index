			<p>BFN     [Text] No election results have been announced since  yesterday evening, but they should begin flowing again this  morning. The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] decided to  revise its counting procedures last night, and instead of  entering batches of votes into the computer as they come in,  they are now entering the total number of votes at counting  stations.    IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje says the vote counting is  complete in all regions except the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] and KwaZulu/Natal, and that more than 50 percent of  the votes in KwaZulu/Natal have been counted. He said the final  allocations of seats in the National Assembly and the provincial  legislatures and a ruling on whether the election was free and  fair could be expected late tomorrow afternoon.    The last results showed that with just over 53 percent of  the  votes counted the ANC had 62.5 percent compared with 22 percent  for the NP [National Party], and 8.3 percent for the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party]. The Freedom Front has 3 percent,  followed by the DP [Democratic Party] with 1.7 percent, and the  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] with 1.3.</p>

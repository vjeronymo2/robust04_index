			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD STILL AT ODDS WITH EMPLOYEE UNIONS OVER RAISES, BENEFITS  </P> <P> Negotiations with most of Oxnard's city employees who have been without a  contract since July 9 remained deadlocked, negotiators said this week.  </P> <P> Only the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 501, which represents  the city's approximately 342 blue-collar workers, had not declared an impasse  by Wednesday, said union spokesman Ron Coleman.  </P> <P> "Both sides are still negotiating in good faith," he said.  </P> <P> But relations were not as smooth with either the Public Employees Assn. of  Ventura County, which represents the city's 305 clerical, professional and  technical workers, and the International Assn. of Firefighters Local 1684,  which represents 87 rank-and-file members of Oxnard's Fire Department.  </P> <P> The firefighters' union called in a state mediator to settle the dispute in the  middle of July, and early last week the public employees' union followed suit.  The mediator, Draza (Merv) Mrvichin, took the unusual step of meeting Tuesday  with City Council members, but neither side would disclose what happened in the  closed-door meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Noisy Picketing  </P> <P> In a noisy display of dismay, public employees' union members picketed Oxnard  City Hall for two hours on Tuesday, carrying signs that referred to pinched  fiscal conditions at the city, which hopes to save 6% on salaries by filling  vacancies more slowly than usual. "Don't balance the budget on my back," one  sign read.  </P> <P> Oxnard firefighters have been less demonstrative. Union president Bill Gallaher  declined to detail the union's demands but said that in addition to wage  increases it is asking for improved working conditions in the department, where  cutbacks have forced some firefighters to shoulder additional responsibilities.  The budget cuts also have caused the sporadic closure of some fire stations.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy with the situation," he said, "but I'd prefer to give the city  one more opportunity to come across."  </P> <P> Barry Hammitt, public employees' union executive director, was more open.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Management to Get Raise  </P> <P> The city, which last month agreed to give management a 3.9% increase, has  offered the public employees a two-year contract that calls for a 3.3% salary  increase this year, effective in November.  </P> <P> Next year, under the city's proposal, employees would be given either a 3.5%  increase with added health benefits or a 4% increase with no new health  benefits.  </P> <P> The union is asking for a raise of 4.2% -- the consumer price index -- and a  salary increase next year of between 4% and 10%, depending on the consumer  price index, with some health benefits, Hammitt said. This year's raise would  be retroactive to July.  </P> <P> Under both scenarios, salaries that fall below those being offered for  comparable jobs in comparable cities would be adjusted upward in April. But  Dene Jones, Oxnard personnel and employee relations director, said there has  been some disagreement over just which cities are comparable.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORTEGA OFFERS TO HOLD EARLY VOTE IN 1990  </P> <P> Nicaragua's Sandinista leadership, under pressure from Central American  neighbors to ease its tight control of the country, offered Monday to hold next  year's general elections at least nine months ahead of schedule.  </P> <P> Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega made the announcement in a closed meeting  with the presidents of four other Central American countries here. He told them  that the voting scheduled for November, 1990, will instead take place within  the first months of next year.  </P> <P> Manuel Espinoza, the Nicaraguan minister of information, who briefed reporters,  said the offer was a "gesture of our intentions to comply in full" with a 1987  Central American peace accord that helped disarm the U.S.-backed rebellion by  Contras against Sandinista rule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Details Still Unclear  </P> <P> Espinoza said that Ortega first raised the possibility of early elections in  private meetings with opposition political parties in Managua last week and  that details are still to be negotiated.  </P> <P> "The only thing that could upset this plan is if the opposition parties do not  go along," Espinoza said.  </P> <P> The voting will be for president, vice president, a 96-member National Assembly  and, for the first time in Nicaragua, municipal councils.  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, the principal Nicaraguan opposition  group, criticized the offer as insufficient but did not reject it outright.  More important, they said, is that the government first meet their demands for  reforms that would ease Sandinista control of the army, the press and the  electoral process.  </P> <P> "If elections are held only to legitimize the party in power, then it does not  matter when they take place," said Carlos Huembes, president of the dissident  coalition.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas came to power in a guerrilla insurrection in 1979 and first  held elections in November, 1984. Ortega won a six-year presidential term,  defeating six other candidates. The Democratic Coordinate boycotted the vote,  saying that the rules favored the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> Under the peace accord signed 18 months ago, Central American leaders agreed to  try to halt guerrilla wars through democratic reforms that would guarantee free  elections. The two-day summit that opened Monday is considered a last-ditch  attempt to save the pact from failure.  </P> <P> Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, author of the agreement, is trying  to use the summit to oblige the Sandinista government to ease its political  control of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran authorities to reconsider a guerrilla  proposal that presidential elections be postponed so that the rebels can take  part.  </P> <P> But Arias received a setback when El Salvador refused to discuss the guerrilla  proposal here. "The battle is going to be hard," one Costa Rican official  commented during a break in the meeting.  </P> <P> Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, thinned by his fight against liver  cancer, opened the summit in a palm-shaded beachfront hotel in this Pacific  coastal village. It was his fourth meeting since May, 1986, with Arias, Ortega  and Presidents Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and Jose Azcona Hoyo of  Honduras.  </P> <P> With Duarte's term due to expire in June, and Azcona and Arias to leave office  within a year after that, this is expected to be the final gathering of the  agreement's five signers.  </P> <P> "Whoever succeeds us will be less committed to the peace plan than we are,"  Arias said before traveling to El Zapote. "That is why we must make a great  effort to reach important agreements that will restore the Central American  people's faith that we can soon achieve peace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Truce Talks in 3 Conflicts  </P> <P> The 1987 accord led to cease-fire negotiations in the region's three guerrilla  conflicts. Those talks broke down quickly in El Salvador and Guatemala. But in  the case of Nicaragua, the talks prompted the U.S. Congress to cut off military  aid to the Contras a year ago and led to a truce last March.  </P> <P> Further talks aimed at a final Nicaraguan peace treaty collapsed last June,  however, when the Contras accused the Sandinistas of evading their obligations  under the regional pact to allow amnesty for political prisoners, press freedom  and "total political pluralism."  </P> <P> Most Contras have since withdrawn to border camps in Honduras, keeping that  U.S. ally in violation of a clause in the accord that bars any government from  harboring guerrillas trying to oust another government.  </P> <P> Differences over how to untangle the peace process have delayed the summit  three times since August. Apparently to minimize public friction, the  presidents canceled a series of pre-summit press conferences. At at a brief  photo session, only Duarte spoke, expressing vague "optimism" about "favorable  conditions for peace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rebels Pledge Restraint  </P> <P> Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas promised to observe a truce during the summit,  but the U.S.-backed army did not follow suit and posted a large contingent of  soldiers around the meeting site 40 miles southeast of the capital.  </P> <P> Arias is seeking to focus the summit on two issues, one involving El Salvador  and the other involving Nicaragua.  </P> <P> In El Salvador, the issue is a rebel proposal to delay scheduled March 19  elections by six months so that electoral guarantees can be worked out for the  rebels and their supporters. The rebels have yet to take part in any voting  during their nine-year-old war.  </P> <P> Arias met with two Salvadoran rebel leaders before coming to El Zapote and held  talks Sunday night with Duarte. A Costa Rican official said that Arias urged  Duarte to consider the rebel proposal "as a basis for new peace negotiations"  but that Duarte maintained his opposition. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ricardo  Acevedo Peralta told reporters that the issue is "an internal matter" with no  place on the summit agenda.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Associated Press reported that El Salvador's defense minister, Gen.  Carlos Vides Casanova, warned of a coup if Duarte agrees to postpone the  election.  </P> <P> "If the president retains power beyond the end of his term, the armed forces  would be obliged to depose him -- either the armed forces or the legislative  assembly," Vides was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Push for Concessions  </P> <P> The other issue involves efforts by Arias, Duarte and Azcona to push Nicaragua  into what they call "democratic concessions" that would satisfy the Bush  Administration, bring the seven-year-old Contra war to a formal end and ease  regional tensions.  </P> <P> As in previous summits, Ortega came ready to negotiate. Besides announcing  early elections, he offered to free about 3,150 political prisoners if Honduras  accepts his proposal that it disarm the Contras and dismantle their border  camps.  </P> <P> Arias recently said he expects more of the Sandinistas. He has called for  abolishing their press censorship powers, giving anti-Sandinista groups a  television station and rewriting the 1988 election law to dilute the ruling  party's advantages. Contra leaders have urged Arias to go even further and  demand an elected assembly to rewrite Nicaragua's constitution.  </P> <P> More important to Ortega, who is seeking to normalize relations with the United  States, is how each country's steps toward democracy under the peace accord  will be judged for outsiders.  </P> <P> On Monday, he asked the other presidents to allow the Inter-American Human  Rights Commission, an arm of the Organization of American States, to report  every three months on each country's record. He also asked that the OAS and the  United Nations send observers to monitor elections in each country.  </P></p>

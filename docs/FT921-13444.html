			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GWR Dollars 24m in loss and cost-cut plan launched GREAT Western Resources, the troubled US-based oil, gas and coal company with a USM quote in London, yesterday announced a swingeing cost-cutting programme and suspended the dividend as it revealed pre-tax losses of Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.4m) for the year to September 30. The loss, which compared to previous profits of Dollars 4.7m, was struck on revenue down 13 per cent to Dollars 134.7m. The disproportionate decline in profits partly stems from GWR's legal dispute with its largest customer, the South Carolina Public Services Authority. SCPSA, which disputes the validity of the GWR contract, has withheld Dollars 33m in payments for coal shipments. Mr Howard Wolf, who replaced Mr Dan Pena as chairman in December, said the group had recovered between 25 and 30 per cent of the SCPSA business through new customers. 'We are doing everything we can to ensure the long-term survival of the company,' he said. Overheads would be cut by up to 40 per cent this year, he added, and a compensation committee would review executive salaries and fees. Exploration and development programmes in the oil and gas division were also being curtailed after talks with banks. These had agreed to defer debt payments totalling Dollars 10m until October 31 1992. GWR carries total debt of about Dollars 75m. During the year, the group increased remaining proven oil reserves, after accounting for production, by 41 per cent. Remaining proven gas reserves rose 16 per cent. Losses worked through at 26 cents (earnings 6 cents). Dividends for the previous year totalled 5.5p.</p>

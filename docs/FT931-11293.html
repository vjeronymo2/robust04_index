			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management European investors have always been wary of Waste Management International. The flotation of a 20 per cent stake last April was over-subscribed, but US institutions took more than their fair share. The westward drift of the share register has been evident ever since. Despite yesterday's impressive full year figures, investors might be forgiven for being disoriented by the whirl of acquisitions. The suspicion remains that WMI will be hard pressed to maintain its rate of growth. In theory, the long-term investment argument in favour of waste management is compelling. Privatisation of waste collection and disposal shows no sign of abating. Tighter regulation by governments should work to the advantage of the bigger and better-capitalised operators. On that basis, a 50 per cent rise in pre-tax profits will doubtless please the company's admirers, but they still need stout hearts. Although margins widened again, the company admits the process can only be taken so far. Customers may also be less willing to accept price rises this year as continental Europe moves into recession. That suggests the acquisition programme will have to accelerate from the 25 deals completed last year. Thanks to a rich parent and high multiple, that can probably be financed without undue reliance on bank debt, but there is clearly a risk of Waste Management buying some rubbish. In a litigious and uninsurable business like waste management, mistakes can be costly. Since WMI pays no dividend, the shares will look all the more exposed if growth prospects are called into serious doubt.</p>

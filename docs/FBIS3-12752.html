			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Labor Minister Khalid al-Ghizawi has chaired a  meeting comprising an International Labor Organization [ILO]  fact-finding team and representatives of the Royal Committee for  Jerusalem Affairs, the Palestinian Affairs Department, the Amman  Chamber of Industry, the Trade Union Federation, and the Union  of the Chambers of Commerce at the meetings hall in the Ministry  of Labor.    During the meeting, the labor minister delivered a statement  urging the ILO to implement the decisions made by the  international labor conferences in 1974 and 1980. These  decisions call for extending all forms of aid to the Palestinian  people and their labor forces in order to support their  steadfastness on their land. [passage omitted]    Minister al-Ghizawi noted the inhumane policy that Israel is  pursuing in the occupied Arab territories. He said: We in  Jordan only recognize the sovereignty of God Almighty over the  Islamic holy places. He also pointed to Israel's policy, which  aims to Judaize Jerusalem, and, consequently, complete the  greater Jerusalem project. The minister added that Jordan  condemns and vehemently denounces all forms of Judaization, and  urges the international bodies to intervene in order to protect  the mosques and churches, so that they will be outside the  framework of the bloody conflict.    He said that Jordan also demands a halt to the building of  Israeli settlements, the disarming of the settlers, and a total  transfer of the settlers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

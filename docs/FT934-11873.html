			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Rail rebels back Tory compromise THE GOVERNMENT last night appeared to have headed off a backbench revolt over rail privatisation after Sir Keith Speed, leader of the potential rebel MPs, backed a compromise allowing British Rail to bid for some franchises. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has tabled an amendment to the Lords amendment to the privatisation bill preventing BR bidding for any franchise for which there is a 'credible' alternative, either a management buy-out or a private-sector bidder. In practice under the compromise, the franchising director is unlikely to allow BR to bid for responsibility for running rail services in more than a few of the 25 franchise areas. Government officials said potential Tory dissidents who had threatened to rebel over the original proposals, under which BR would not have had the right to bid at all, had made clear they would support this latest move. Asked whether the partial retreat was simply aimed at preventing another backbench rebellion Mr MacGregor said: 'This is not a sleight of hand. It will still be possible for BR to bid (for franchises).' The Lords' amendment gave BR the right to bid for franchises. This was opposed by the government on the grounds that it would give BR the ability to undercut competitors by cross-subsiding its bid with revenues from other services. Mr MacGregor's amendment to the railways bill, which returns to the Commons next week, will provide that the franchise director can allow BR to bid only if the director is not convinced that any other bidders comply with basic standards. The minister is understood to believe that his proposals will encourage buy-outs and prevent BR, which will not be able to cross-subsidise bids, from winning more than a small minority of the franchises. Earlier in the day Mr John Major said it would not be right to treat BR on the same basis as private bidders. During an exchange at prime minister's questions, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of 'blatant and discreditable' manoeuvres by introducing amendments to allow BR to bid for franchises, but under strict conditions. Mr Smith claimed the government was indulging in a 'cynical trick'. Mr Major replied: 'You accuse us of shams while a Labour transport spokesman had accused the government of a U-turn - it can't be both.' The franchises will be established gradually over the next few years. Mr MacGregor is understood to expect only one or two to be set up next year after BR has created 25 'shadow' franchises. About five more should be established the following year.</p>

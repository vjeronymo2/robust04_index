			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with DPRK President Kim </F> Il-song by special correspondent Pedro Margolles Villanueva at  the Government Palace in Pyongyang on 18 April]    [Text] Pyongyang--DPRK leader Kim Il-song has denied his  government's intentions or capacity to produce nuclear weapons  because this would make no sense. However, Kim warned that the  United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and  coercion it can bring the DPRK to its knees.    The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an  exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace.    In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim Il-song talked about  the  tense situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations  with China and other countries, foreign investments, and the  prospects for the country's reunification. Kim also spoke  fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President Fidel  Castro.    In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern  buildings and wide avenues welcome a sunny spring.    Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the  celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as  the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in  Pyongyang.    One does not get a sense of a war-like atmosphere in some  areas of the Korean countryside. The peasants work the land,  grow rice, and the industries continue operating.    An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in  the  august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim  Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly.    "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing  nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we  did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria  ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to  ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said.    Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction  of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The  United States deployed a large number of these weapons to  maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to  confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy  in the Asia-Pacific region.    Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula began with the hostile U.S. policy toward his country,  and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral negotiations.    Considering that in recent years the Cold War ended  worldwide  and North and South Korea have signed nonaggression agreements  and a joint declaration on denuclearization of the peninsula,  there is no justification for the United States to continue  maintaining its nuclear arms in the South, the president pointed  out.    The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in  the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after  the monumental battles of 1945.    Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion  of  Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce  battles were waged and the country was virtually destroyed. The  38th Parallel and Panmunjom became fixed in the memory of  humanity through persistent anticommunist propaganda that  depicted U.S. citizens as defenders of noble ideals.    Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the  leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including  Pyongyang, which had been razed. Industry was constructed and  agriculture reestablished.    Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has  eradicated poverty.    That same man, who has a great deal of history in his  background, now explains that "in order to not lose the control  they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the  North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading  groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the  situation." South Korean authorities have joined this nuclear  scandal and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war.    The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he  said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing  international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it  worsened the situation to the extreme, he added.    Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure and coercion can  never be the method to resolve problems.    The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through  pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees,  because they value independence as they value their own lives.    If it becomes obstinate in pressuring our republic, we will  be forced to adopt legitimate self-defense measures to safeguard  the nation's dignity and sovereignty.    During the interview, the paramount Korean leader  reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic Korea is  to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. Whether it can  be resolved through peaceful means depends entirely on the  United States, which must cease its clumsy international  pressure against our republic and adopt a trustworthy position,  he added.    International organizations should not support the unjust  demands of this power (the United States); instead, they should  endorse solutions to the problem, Kim Il-song stressed.  <H5>  Foreign Relations </H5>   Korea wants to maintain good relations with its neighbors.  With China, relations are good; with Japan, they are hostile.  The traditional friendship between Korea and China continues to  develop. The Japanese Government has maintained unalterable  hostility, and if an unexpected incident takes place here, it  would not bode well for Japan, he said.    When dealing with international relations, the paramount  leader of the DPRK confirmed that his government's foreign  policy is based on the ideals of independence, peace, and  friendship. He said Korea hopes to foster cooperation with  socialist and nonaligned nations and to establish links with  capitalist nations that respect its sovereignty.    Korea opposes all types of domination and submission, and it  attributes a great deal of importance to linking itself  peacefully to nearby nations, "some of which, he indicated, get  along well with us, while others do not." With China we have  good relations.'' Korea and China are neighbors, separated by  rivers, and their peoples are beloved comrades in arms and  brothers who struggle for a common cause. Resolutely united,  they have struggled and shed their blood in the fight against  imperialism. They have been supporting and cooperating with  each other in their efforts for socialism.'' [quotation marks as  received]    The president explained that the traditional friendship  between Korea and China continues to develop in the political,  economic, and cultural fields because of joint efforts of the  two nations' government parties and peoples.    In terms of Japan, he indicated that, on the contrary,  normal  relations have not been established between the two nations  because the Japanese Government has maintained a policy of  unalterable hostility. In recent times, it has played into the  hands of the United States in its conspiracy against Korea,  thereby undermining the resolution of the nuclear problem on the  peninsula. It is attempting to realize its dirty political and  military ambitions. He warned: "If the situation worsens here  and an unexpected event takes place, this would not bode well  for Japan. The Japanese Government should look at the reality  of the situation and act with moderation."    As for economic relations with other countries, he  explained that they are being expanded and developed not only  through trade but also through other means such as joint  administration and cooperation, which helps build the economy  and follows the trend of international economic cooperation.    He said that a foreign investment law and other laws have  been established in the DPRK to encourage foreign investment in  the republic. All of these measures are based on the principles  of complete equality and mutual benefit, protection of the  foreign businesses, and safeguard of the foreign businesses'  legitimate rights and interests.    Kim Il-song explained that the Rajin-Sonbong zone has been  created as a center for free trade and a free economy, where a  better environment and better conditions for investors are  promoted. It is located on the border with China and Russia. It  has great potential because of its advantageous economic and  geographic conditions. Many countries want to invest in the  Rajin-Sonbong zone, and the government of the republic has its  doors open to foreign investors, he indicated.  <H5>  The Reunification of Korea </H5>   Our people face great difficulties and obstacles for the  reunification of the fatherland, but the prospect is viewed  optimistically, President Kim Il-song said.    The paramount leader of the DPRK explained that every effort  is being made to undertake at all costs this historic task in  the 1990's.    Last year, the "10-Point Program of the Great Pannational  Unity for the Reunification of the Fatherland" was presented.  It unanimously reflects the aspirations of all fellow  countrymen in the North, South, and overseas to achieve  reintegration and national prosperity, above differences of  ideology and regime.    Nevertheless, he said, the South Korean authorities ignored  that aspiration of the entire nation, following a path of  submission to foreign forces and of confrontation with the  North. The current "power" in South Korea is a servile and a  turncoat power, which faithfully follows the foreign forces.    The president indicated his people face great difficulties  in  their struggle for the reunification of the fatherland, but they  are optimistic about the prospects for this task. "The forces in  favor of reunification irreversibly will overcome and defeat the  separatists."    The so-called Korean war began on 25 June 1950 when South  Korean Army troops launched, with the support of the United  States, an invasion into the northern region of the peninsula  where the DPRK was established in 1945, after having defeated  the fascist Japanese Army. The response by the North was strong  and the North's military units occupied Seoul.    The United States directly involved itself in the conflict  to  save its about-to-be-defeated allies. Three years of war went  by. This aggressor, the Yankee army, suffered 405,998  casualties; the puppet South Korean Army suffered 1.1 million  casualties; and countries that were allies of the United States  in this war suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Much of North  Korea was virtually destroyed. The war ended on 27 July 1953.  The United States was unable to occupy the North. The country  remained divided. Forty years have gone by since the war ended.  The North has been totally reconstructed and prosperity is  tangible.    President Kim Il-song continued: Now, considering that there  are ideologic differences and different social regimes in the  North and South, we have drawn a more rational path for the  reunification of the fatherland. Our proposal is to unite in a  confederated state that features two regimes and two governments.    He said this proposal is fair and realistic and permits an  expeditious reunification of the country in an independent and  peaceful way, without either side defeating the other. After  its reunification, Korea will function as a neutral nation  without becoming a satellite of any other nation and without  participating in any military alliance or political bloc.  <H5>  Total Support and Solidarity for the Cuban People </H5>   The Korean president expressed high esteem, total support,  and firm solidarity with the Cuban people who are honorably  fulfilling the strategic tasks of the "special peacetime period."    From the very start of the interview, the veteran leader,  who  for more than 60 years has worked for the national liberation of  his nation, asked about President Fidel Castro and Revolutionary  Armed Forces Minister Raul Castro, both of whom he characterized  as brothers-in-arms and for whom he expressed high regards.    "Even today--he indicated--I recall our 1986 encounter with  Fidel Castro, which took place in Pyongyang. It was the first  historically significant meeting, which we had been both  pursuing for some time. We were able to talk for several hours  in a climate of camaraderie. The leaders of the two countries  were able to review diverse issues of common interest, including  the possibility of increasing and promoting relations of  friendship and cooperation."    That visit left an unforgettable and profound impression on  both nations, and from then on our relations attained new  momentum.    The DPRK and Cuba are separated by oceans and continents,  and  yet their respective peoples retain friendly ties as if they  were neighbors. This is the friendly pugnacity of brothers of  similar mettle who are struggling against imperialism and for  the victory of socialism. Our friendship is genuine and solid  because it is based on revolutionary principles and moral  camaraderie, Kim Il-song stated.    He stipulated: "Complex and unexpected events have appeared  on the international scene, and yet the links of friendship and  cooperation between both nations continue to develop without  changes in accordance with what was agreed upon during the two  leaders' meetings. These ties remain steadfast amid this  traumatic historical phase, which is decisive for the future of  socialism. [no closing quotation marks as received]    In reference to the critical times the island is facing, Kim  Il-song pointed out that the Cuban people are firmly defending  their role as the vanguard of socialism in the Western  Hemisphere amid difficult conditions under which the  imperialists are relentlessly pursuing all sorts of schemes to  isolate and destroy it.    In this respect, he indicated: "Our people have high regard  and express their total support, as well as their firm  solidarity, for our Cuban brothers who are honorably carrying  out the strategic tasks of the special period during times of  peace, and who are singularly united around the Communist Party  led by Comrade Fidel Castro. [no closing quotation marks as  received]    In the future, the Korean people will do everything within  their power to bolster relations with their Cuban brothers.    Kim Il-song concluded the interview by sending friendly  greetings to the Cuban people and expressing his hope for  greater successes in the struggle to safeguard the independence,  sovereignty, and development of socialism.</p>

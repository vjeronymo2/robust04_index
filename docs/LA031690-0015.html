			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> PHONE SOLICITOR WARNING ISSUED  </P> <P> A top Oxnard school official has warned residents to beware of unauthorized  telephone solicitations for contributions to pay for schoolbooks.  </P> <P> Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, asked  for a police investigation of the unauthorized solicitations.  </P> <P> The pitch involves a request to contribute money to help buy coloring books for  elementary school students, made in the name of a group called Californians  Against Drugs, Brekke said.  </P> <P> Representatives of the group could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In fact, the district has not endorsed the project, Brekke said.  </P> <P> "It appears that there is some considerable pressure to get these  contributions," Brekke said. "A courier would come to the home within the hour  to pick up the donation."  </P> <P> The solicitations came to light when a number of residents called the district.  Brekke had no information on how many contributors are involved. CAROL  WEINSTOCK  </P></p>

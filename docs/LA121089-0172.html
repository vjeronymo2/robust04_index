			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HATTIE THE LIFE OF HATTIE MCDANIEL BY CARLTON JACKSON  (MADISON BOOKS, 4720 BOSTON WAY,LANHAM, MD. 20706: $18.95; 221 PP.)  </P> <P> Best known as Scarlett O'Hara's mammy in "Gone With the Wind," Hattie McDaniel  played in about 300 films. It was not until after she received the Academy  Award -- the first black person ever to win the honor -- that she was  automatically given screen credits, although she was at the time no newcomer to  the screen; her previous appearances had included "The Blonde Venus" and "I'm  No Angel." "Hattie" draws on the actress' personal papers to tell the story of  her life and career. A detailed chapter on the filming of "Gone With the Wind"  gives insight into her professional relationships with fellow cast members  Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Butterfly McQueen.  </P> <P> McDaniel's portrayal of stereotypical black roles earned her the criticism of  Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP. A performer from age 15, the  first black woman to sing on radio and among the first to appear regularly on  television, McDaniel was proud of the advances she had made in her career, and  deeply resented White's accusations. A chapter detailing this feud -- "The  Crusade Against 'Mammyism' " -- gives insight into the inner workings of  Hollywood negotiations, and airs the contemporary arguments on the role of film  in promoting or combatting racial stereotypes; it is interesting to see how  little has changed.  </P></p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Frosty relations between 'Vikings' and 'Amigos' The Nordic nations now engaged in tortured negotiations to join the European Union tend to believe that the Spanish have got it in for them, a view shared by many of Spain's EU partners. Spanish negotiators in the enlargement talks in Brussels this week with Finland, Sweden, Norway (and Austria) have raised a thicket of obstacles for the applicant countries to weave through, most recently over their future entitlement to EU regional aid. But Spain was instrumental yesterday in inventing a new kind of Euro-region, to ensure that the almost empty, frozen north of Norway, Sweden and Finland will get development aid from Brussels. The neat-minded European Commission originally proposed including these regions under 'Objective 1' of the existing 'Structural Funds'  - the highest level of EU aid reserved for poor and backward regions such as Andalucia in southern Spain. Spain (and others) objected that areas such as Norrbotten in north Sweden, however remote, had a per capita income at 113 per cent of the EU average. This is about double Andalucia's average incomes and over the Objective 1 threshold of 75 per cent. Not to be dissuaded, the Commission came back with with a proposal for a new 'Objective 1A' classification, covering regions with a population density no greater than seven people per square kilometre. '1A for Arctic' snorted the Spaniards, who as relative newcomers to the Euro-club are less impressed by the acronymic logorrhea and procedural wheezes of the more established Eurocracy. So '1A' was thrown out, for fear the rich newcomers would create confusion with the really deserving recipients of EU money, that is Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland. But Spain did not want to be ungracious, and agreed on a special Nordic regime for areas with eight or fewer inhabitants per square kilometre of ice. Spain's European affairs minister, Mr Carlos Westendorp, one of the hardest negotiators on the EU circuit, came prepared to do a deal. On the flight from Madrid, he decided that the Nordic gods would smile on the applicants, and that therefore the new regional scheme should be called Thor (Territorial Help for Overfrozen regions), or Odin (Outstanding Donation for Iced North). Not to be outdone, his negotiating colleagues added Viking (Viable Indicative Kit for Incorporating Nordic Goals) and Fiord (Financial Instrument for Overfrozen Regions Demanding it). In case these suggestions were 'returned to sender', they were countersigned 'Amigos'  - Arctic Most Isolated Genuine Overfrozen System.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MAMMOTH LAKES;  </P> <P> CHARGES RULED OUT IN LAKE DROWNINGS  </P> <P> No criminal charges will be filed in the deaths of three boys and four would-be  rescuers who drowned in ice-covered Convict Lake in February, Mono County Dist.  Atty. Stan Eller said.  </P> <P> A sheriff's investigation failed to find enough evidence to support charges  against staff at Camp O'Neal, a group home for troubled boys, in the Feb. 19  drownings, the prosecutor said. "After review of the reports compiled by your  department, I will not be filing any criminal charges regarding this tragedy. I  feel that there is insufficient evidence to establish criminal liability beyond  a reasonable doubt as it relates to the action of individuals at Camp O'Neal,"  Eller said in a memo to Sheriff Martin Strelneck. State investigators blamed  the drownings on a "lack of appropriate care and supervision" by the staff, and  closed the camp. A hearing on the camp's appeal of the decision is set for Aug.  27.  </P></p>

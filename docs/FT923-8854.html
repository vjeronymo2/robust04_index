			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Shakespeare's revenge THE MIRROR AND THE GLOBE by Felix Pryor Handsaw Pounds 38, 253 pages ANYONE thinking that 'Hawks and Handsaws' is an abstruse coinage belonging to the Weekend FT please refer to Hamlet II/ii for the line: 'I am but mad north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.' Then try the commentaries on this 'pregnant quibble' of Hamlet's. Some say Hamlet is talking fowl: for handsaw read "hernshaw,' which means a heron. Others say Hamlet is talking tools, in which case a hawk is deemed to be a plasterer's mortar board. Either way, Hamlet is reckoned to be warning his hearers (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) that he knows what is what. Glossing Hamlet's expression like this assumes that he is making sense. The commentators are reluctant to take it as a splinter of gibberish in such a monumental play. But now, Felix Pryor has come up with a new and more sophisticated reading, which goes like this. Just across the river Thames from Shakespeare's Globe, there was a theatre in the cathedral precincts of St Paul's. A troupe of child actors performed there, known as the Paul's Boys. One of the playwrights attached to the juvenile company was John Marston, best known (if at all) for his tragi-comedy The Malcontent. Marston specialised in fabricating lurid language and - appropriately - puerile innuendoes. He produced some spoofs of Shakespeare for his lads: the Bard responded with his own send-ups of Marston's grotesque diction and the ham acting of the Paul's Boys. Hence the hawk: Shakespeare's own emblem. And the handsaw? Possibly a sneer at the zig-zig motif on Marston's coat of arms or, more likely, a jibe at the ludicrous sawing gestures made by boy actors unsure what to do with their hands on stage. North-north-west? Well: from the site of the Globe, St Paul's is (you've guessed) due NNW . . . As an exercise in ingenious glossary, I like this. We know about these erstwhile choirboys at St Paul's: Ben Jonson described them as 'rascally tits.' They may well be the baby hawks ('little eyases') who come to play at Hamlet's Elsinore. There may be more satire of Marston in Hamlet: the trouble is that Shakespeare out-Marstons Marston so adroitly that we struggle to recognise the force such satire might once have had. Pryor's investigation explores the many possibilities. If there is a fault to his speculations, it is that he makes Shakespeare take the rivalry too seriously. Certainly, this book does nothing to raise one's opinion of Marston. He was hardly a rival of Shakespeare: more a bothersome gnat. Marston's subsequent obsession with Hamlet is not explored by Pryor. Mediocrity is allowed to drift wittingly into oblivion. So, the Bard is performed in Azerbaijani and Marston remains for literary specialists. Books of this sort are always vulnerable to the scepticism of scholars and the indifference of a wider reading public. But this is an engaging example of its genre, reflecting nicely the contest between poets and poetasters for domination of the late Elizabethan theatres. It deserves to be priced more attractively.</p>

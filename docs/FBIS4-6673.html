			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated  that a February package of measures to stimulate Japan's economy  generated the effect of increasing Japan's gross domestic  product [GDP] by only 0.7 percent. The Japanese Government is  refuting the IMF's estimate, arguing "The IMF has underestimated  the effects generated by the package." Commenting on the IMF's  estimate that the February package generated the effect of  cutting Japan's current account surplus by only $2 billion, the  Japanese Government is expressing discontent with the estimate  made by the international monetary organization, asserting, "The  package is supposed to have generated the effect of reducing  Japan's current account surplus more than the IMF has estimated  it has." The Finance Ministry is wary of the possibility that  the United States will ask Japan to map out an additional  package of measures to spur its economy.    At the time of formulating the February package of economic  stimulus measures, the Japanese Government announced that the  package would cause Japan's GDP to increase by about 2.2 percent  within one year. The IMF has estimated, however, that the  February package generated only one-third of the desired effect  for stimulating Japan's economy. The Economic Planning Agency  [EPA], which was in charge of formulating the package, assumes  that the IMF has probably underestimated the role of the income  tax cut and financial investments and loans in stimulating  Japan's economy.    The Japanese Government has not made public how the package  of economic stimulus measures has generated the effect of  reducing Japan's current account surplus out of the fear that  "the U.S. Government may use the effect as numerical targets."  Commenting on the IMF's estimate that the February package  generated the effect of reducing Japan's current account surplus  by only $2 billion, the EPA argues, "The package generated the  effect of expanding domestic demand to a greater degree than the  IMF has estimated occurred." The EPA anticipates that the  package will further reduce Japan's current account surplus.    The IMF has estimated that Japan will achieve 0.7-percent  real growth in 1994. A senior EPA official says: "In September  1993, the IMF announced that Japan would achieve 2.0-percent  real growth in 1994. We cannot understand why the IMF has  lowered its original prediction of 2.0-percent real growth for  Japan by 1.3 percentage point despite the fact that personal  spending has shown signs of recovering since late last year and  Japan's economy is moving toward a recovery."</p>

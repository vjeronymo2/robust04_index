			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Jyske Bank moves back into surplus JYSKE Bank, the first of the larger Danish banks to report on the first half, moved to a profit this year of DKr394m (Dollars 57m) from an operating loss of DKr479m in 1992. Net interest and fee income soared by 33 per cent to DKr1.06bn from DKr795m. Provisions declined to DKr387m from DKr677m, and the adjustment for the market value of securities since the end of last year added DKr382m to profits, compared with only DKr57m last year. The bank made an unrealised loss of DKr135m in the recent currency turmoil, but maintained an earlier forecast that operating earnings for the year will be in the region of DKr150m to DKr250m, compared with a loss of DKr913m for the whole of 1992.</p>

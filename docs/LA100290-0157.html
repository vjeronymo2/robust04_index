			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY ON BOTH ENDS  </P> <P> Regarding David Emmes' commentary "Storm of Controversy Over Public Funding  Blows Ill for Arts," (Sept. 23): Mr. Emmes has difficulty understanding the  furor conservative taxpayers are making over a "handful of change" given from  public funds to a cause that violates our sense of decency and moral ethics.  </P> <P> Let me ask Mr. Emmes how he would feel if public funds were allotted to pay for  the Catholic sisters' living expenses, or perhaps he would not oppose the city  of Costa Mesa supporting the choral directors in the local churches.  </P> <P> Surely, in the name of art, Mr. Emmes would not mind giving some of his tax  monies to the development of this art form. He implies that challenging  traditional values is a good and needful thing, but when his values are  challenged, he labels it bigotry. You see, Mr. Emmes, bigotry does exist on  both ends of the moral spectrum.  </P> <P> It's not that conservatives wish to silence all views but their own, or to take  away anyone's right to say what he or she thinks or believes. It's that we  object to their doing it with our money. Public funding must reflect the views  of all those contributing to the said fund. Therefore, it will not be as  "free-spirited" as that which is supported by a particular group.  </P> <P> I ask Mr. Emmes, please don't ask me to support in any way those things that  violate my moral and spiritual beliefs, and I will not expect to be seeing any  of his monies in our collection plate.  </P> <P> In these troubled times, more would be accomplished if we sought to understand  those who oppose us, rather than resorting to accusations and name-calling.  Perhaps, then, solutions could be reached.  </P> <P> BEVERLY SPURLOCK  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

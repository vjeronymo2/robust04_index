			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/18/94--Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared on 16 May, an agreement  was reached on stationing the Russian peace-keeping forces in  the region, starting from 24 May. Nevertheless, the Azeri  Defense Minister has been refusing to sign this agreement till  late evening. According to reliable sources, signing the  agreement was postponed till 1000 on 17 May. The Azeri  representative didn't come to this meeting, having left for Baku  during the night, without notifying the sides. Political  experts believe, the departure is related with aggravation of  political situation in Azerbaijan, as opposition parties  threatened to start political actions, if the agreement is  signed.    Russian President's Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov left to  Baku on the same day. It's hard to guess whether Kazimirov will  be able to persuade Azerbaijan in necessity of Russian presence,  but he has declared several times that Russian forces will enter  the conflict zone only if all sides agree with this.    Reliable sources report, CSCE Minsk group chairman went to  Moscow to participate in this meeting, but wasn't allowed doing  so.    We would like to remind that the Russian project stipulates  a  withdrawal of forces without preconditions in three days after a  cease-fire is established. According to this project, troops  will be introduced to Zangelanskiy and Dzhebrailskiy districts;  regular police forces will be stationed in Agdamskiy and  Fizulinskiy. Blockade is to be lifted only after the Armenian  forces are withdrawn from Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy  districts.    At the same time "AZG" reports, the Azeri representatives  asked to postpone their decision till 2400 on 17 May, and  refused to sign the document when the time came. Baku radio  reported that the Azeri delegation didn't have the power for  signing such an agreement. This information is confirmed by  Russian "Novosti" TV program which said, there were two  hindrances to the agreement. First is the Armenian demand to  recognize Mountainous Karabakh as a side of the conflict and  second, Azeri side not being empowered to sign the agreement.  According to Novosti, the Azeri side declared yesterday they  have no such power, and left to Baku for additional  consultations. At the same time "Azatutyun" radio reported,  after preliminary talks to the Azeri side Armenians have got the  impression that Azerbaijan is ready to discuss the status of  Mountainous Karabakh earlier than planned, ie immediately, after  a cease fire is established.</p>

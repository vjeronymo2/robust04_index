			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Sniper rifle is sold in US shops One of the weapons which IRA snipers are believed to be using near the border with the Irish Republic - a Barrett Light Fifty rifle - is freely available on the US market at a basic price of Dollars 6,750 (Pounds 4,560). The weapon poses a serious tactical challenge to those of the 10,000 security forces personnel in the province who operate in the so-called 'bandit country' near the border. Security sources say the killing by a sniper of a British soldier on Thursday has underlined how the IRA use suprise to defy the heavy military presence in the area. Names such as 'black widow' and 'Goldfinger' are being bandied about in order to perpetuate the notion of IRA invincibility. Mr Ian Hogg, editor of Jane's Infantry Weapons, said yesterday that the rifle was used widely by US police and soldiers. The manufacturers claim that it is accurate up to 1,400 yards. The soldier was the ninth member of the security forces to be killed by a single shot from a sniper since August 1992. Forensic examinations have established that most of the attacks have involved a large-calibre weapon using an armour-piercing bullet fired at long range. No sniper has been detected by the army's control towers in the border area. The army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary insist there is no evidence to suggest that all the killings were the work of one person.</p>

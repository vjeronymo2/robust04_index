			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eleni Apostolopoulou] </F>   [Text] According to information received this morning from  a diplomatic source at the Greek Embassy in Tirana, there is  concern about the arrest of six members of Omonoia, the Greek  minority party in Albania, because it is not known how long they  will be in prison.    The six members were charged with illegal possession of arms  and with being associated with secret Greek groups seeking to  change Albania's territory. The charges, which are considered  to be equal to treason, were made against Theodhoros Bezanis,  Iraklis Sirmos, Konstandinos Kiriakos, Evangelos Papakhristou,  and Konstandinos Tsiavos [five names as heard].    Greek minority circles believe the charges are unfounded  because no arms other than hunting rifles were found in the  possession of the six men. They also believe the Albanian  Government is taking this action to create more problems in its  relations with Greeks and to warn Omonoia what will happen if it  publicizes its opposition to Tirana. Today's Albanian press did  not carry any reports on the arrest of the six members, and  there has been no official reaction so far.    Responding to a question on the arrest, Government Spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos said Greece's stance toward Greek Albanians  and the activity of the Albanian authorities is firm and well  known. He said: We want the protection of Greeks within the  framework of Albanian and international law.    Venizelos noted that the government has accepted the  proposal  for a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two  countries, but added that it would be more meaningful if a  meeting of experts was held in advance. He stressed: A top  issue is respect for the human rights of the minority and for  Albania to become a just state.    Referring to the visit by Yasushii Akashi, the UN secretary  general's representative, to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and his meeting with [President  Kiro] Gligorov, the spokesman noted that this visit must be  evaluated along with developments in UN mediator Cyrus Vance's  initiative.</p>

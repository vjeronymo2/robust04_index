			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / MPs sharply criticise second Welsh agency The conduct of another Welsh development agency was sharply criticised by members of the Commons public accounts committee last night. The MPs also questioned the effectiveness of the Welsh Office in scrutinising the Development Board for Rural Wales and for the lack of disciplinary sanctions. The attack followed the committee's scathing report last year on some activities of the Welsh Development Agency. The committee yesterday questioned Mr Michael Flanagan, the agency's chief executive, and Mr Michael Scholar, the Welsh Office permanent secretary, after a report by the National Audit Office criticised the agency's housing allocation policy and a car leasing scheme. This report followed a finding by the ombudsman for local administration that there had been gross maladministration. The agency allocated houses under a published set of rules but also under another, unpublished set. The housing officer was involved in allocating a house to himself and to his former wife. Under a car leasing scheme, there was irregular expenditure of Pounds 27,000 in 1991-92. Mr Robert Sheldon MP, the committee chairman and Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, referred to it as a 'sad story', and Mr Michael Shersby, Tory MP for Uxbridge, said it was 'a disgraceful state of affairs'. Mr Scholar and Mr Flanagan acknowledged that it had been unlawful to allocate houses under unpublished rules. Several MPs commented on the lack of sanctions taken against the agency by the Welsh Office. Mr Scholar said that Mr Flanagan had been rebuked and the housing officer admonished but no other disciplinary action had been taken yet. Asked what action had been taken by the Welsh Office in the light of the criticism of the Welsh Development Agency, Mr Scholar said a compliance review of all the Welsh non-departmental public bodies had been set in train, and also an efficiency scrutiny of the Welsh Office's sponsorship of these agencies.</p>

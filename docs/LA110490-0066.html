			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEDERLANDER: KINDER, GENTLER YANKEE BOSS  </P> <P> For the first time since becoming the New York Yankees' general partner, Robert  Nederlander met with the media Wednesday. He sounded like a man who had watched  and witnessed and charted George Steinbrenner's 17-plus seasons and who had  decided to do everything the opposite way.  </P> <P> Nederlander must have heard those "George Must Go" chants.  </P> <P> In the relaxed one-hour session also attended by General Manager Gene Michael  and Assistant General Manager Bill Bergesch, Nederlander frequently used the  phrase "fiscally responsible," which may mean they'll never even bid for Mr.  Jose Canseco Numbers -- Darryl Strawberry. Nederlander also said he likes  stability and vows to give young players ample opportunity. High on his no-no  list is second-guessing baseball executives.  </P> <P> In other words, no George II.  </P> <P> "I don't like to comment on what he did before -- after all, he did win more  games than anyone in the '80s," Nederlander said. "Let me just say he did  things the way he saw fit. And I'll do them the way I see fit. Who's to say  what's right?"  </P> <P> Right away, the media gatherings are different. Steinbrenner definitely ran  those shows. At his last press gathering-luncheon, before the 1990 season,  Steinbrenner spoke often. When General Manager Pete Peterson or Manager Bucky  Dent spoke, it was because Steinbrenner requested it.  </P> <P> This Nederlander production was decidedly low-key. Nederlander often deferred  questions to Michael, almost as if he were an equal.  </P> <P> "We have an excellent baseball team here," Nederlander said, referring not to  his last-place club but to his team of executives. "I'm going to rely heavily  on their advice. I informed them that I won't be second-guessing them. Everyone  makes mistakes. Of course, I hope we don't make too many."  </P> <P> That should not be construed as a threat. Unlike Steinbrenner's now-infamous  pre-1990 gathering at which he proclaimed Dent would manage the entire season,  Nederlander made no headline-grabbing statements.  </P> <P> Given a chance to repeat Steinbrenner's mistake, Nederlander said only, "I  don't look to fire anybody at this point. We have good people who have only  been there a few months. You have to give people time to prove themselves. Our  baseball people are high on (Stump Merrill). I'm sure he's going to be around  awhile."  </P> <P> Nederlander has spent most of his 57 years in the theater business, though it  wasn't manifested Wednesday -- there were no theatrics. "Saturday Night Live"  is unlikely to make his resume.  </P> <P> On one point he did offer a nice monologue. Asked about the perception he is  more theater man than baseball man, Nederlander responded, "It's the  entertainment business. I've been in the entertainment business my whole life.  I've been around stars, whether it be Phil Silvers or whomever. I understand  stars. Baseball players are stars."  </P> <P> Well, not all of them, which is why the Yankees went 67-95.  </P> <P> While Nederlander said big stars deserve big money, he also said the front  office hasn't discussed the possibility of courting Strawberry, the home run  ball in this year's free-agent crop (though, strangely, Michael volunteered  that Strawberry's name came up in a conversation on another matter between  Bergesch and agent Eric Goldschmidt). Instead, the Yankees have concentrated on  their top priorities, third basemen and starting pitchers.  </P> <P> "We haven't even gotten to Mr. Strawberry yet," Nederlander said.  </P> <P> That, apparently, is the strategy. The Yankees do not deny interest in the  crosstown megastar, with Michael conceding, "We know he's a player and we're  going to have to assess it."  </P> <P> Michael also said, however, that before they jump in, "We want to see figures  in the paper ... We want to know how much it's going to take."  </P> <P> Asked specifically about Strawberry, Nederlander chose to talk generally about  escalating salaries. Another chance, another lost headline.  </P> <P> Michael was more outspoken. In direct contrast to the Yankees' past  free-spending, first-bid style, Michael said, "We don't want to be the first  ones in. In the past we drove prices up, and we're not going to do it anymore."  </P> <P> Which brings us to Pascual Perez, a $5.7 million lesson. "We will try to look  at the health a little more," Michael said.  </P> <P> So among free-agent pitchers, the injury-plagued Ted Higuera and Danny Jackson  may be somewhat less desirable than Mike Boddicker, Bob Welch, Tom Browning and  even Bud Black.  </P> <P> Of course, their own free-agent pitchers, Dave Righetti and Tim Leary, still  interest them. Though neither seems particularly close to re-signing, Michael  -- who met Wednesday with Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein -- said, "I think we  could sign them both but we might be a little ahead with Righetti."  </P> <P> Regardless, Michael and Nederlander insist that young players are the Yankees'  future. "Teams have to rely on young players for stability," Nederlander said.  Michael even said he is counting on Hensley Meulens as the starting left  fielder and Dave Eiland as one-fifth of the starting rotation.  </P> <P> And as far as his own future is concerned, Nederlander said he is nobody's  caretaker. Not George Steinbrenner's, not Hal Steinbrenner's, not anybody's.  </P> <P> "When I came in, I came in with no conditions to leave at any point,"  Nederlander said. "I'm 57. I will be here for some time. As to how long, that  will depend on how long I want to do it and how the other partners feel I'm  doing."  </P></p>

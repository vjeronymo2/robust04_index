			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): An angel at your boardroom table - Richard Gourlay starts a series on business angels with a profile of Sir Peter Thompson For a man who says he has spent most of his life as 'a boring big-company man', Sir Peter Thompson's first investments in small private businesses have been remarkable. So successful has the former chairman of National Freight Corporation been that the most reticent of investors might be tempted to follow him into a second career as a business angel. This is exactly what he would like to see. Sir Peter's great passion is NFC and the concept of employee capitalism that made many of the former nationalised industry's workforce rich individuals when the company floated in 1989. But his latest crusade is to try to encourage people like himself 'fortunate enough' to have amassed wealth to recycle some of it into investments in private companies at early stages of development: 'Many people have followed the MBO route that NFC pioneered and it is really they who should be prepared to take the risk and invest in a second layer of wealth creation.' He is not setting a bad example. Early in March, Mercury Communications paid Pounds 3.8m for a 37 per cent stake in M33, a company which owns Andromeda Interactive, publisher of CD-Roms and reference books. Three years ago Sir Peter invested Pounds 100,000 and became non-executive chairman. He became involved in one of his earliest investments, a company building private hospitals, while in the middle of persuading the government to let him lead the MBO at NFC. The company, now called Community Hospitals, floated in 1989 and is valued at Pounds 90m. 'It was my first insight,' says Sir Peter, who became non-executive chairman. 'Entrepreneurial groups don't just need money, they need managing as well.' Possibly his most successful investment has been in FI Group, which makes and services software through a network made up mainly of women working part-time from home. 'Steve Shirley (the founder) said 'I want the employees to buy some of my shares', and off we went down the route of an employee-owned company,' Sir Peter says. 'The company has just taken off.' A modest man, he insists his record of private investing is not unusual. 'I am no better than my peers but I have invested in six companies and none have failed. My perception of the return is that it is very good - much better than putting it into BTR,' he says. He is critical of venture capital companies that no longer take real risks. 'The reason people have moved out of true venture capital is the massive failure rate,' he says. 'I think they (early stage companies) fail because they are never given enough support - not in the financial sense but all the other support they need.' Sir Peter says the lessons angels have picked up in their own varied careers are as useful as the money they bring to young companies. In his own career Sir Peter has taken his share of knocks. When he arrived at NFC the company had made a Pounds 35m loss and was working with a government controlling every penny. 'Managing your way out of that kind of desperate situation was a very interesting experience for me and I am sure it actually began to mould the basic philosophies I began to develop,' Sir Peter says. Again in 1989, joining John Gunn's British &amp; Commonwealth after its disastrous acquisition of Atlantic Computers, he fought and lost the battle to persuade banks to back his rescue plan. 'I think the lesson that came out of B&amp;C was the importance of cash and the importance of having a banking arrangement which was empathetic to what you were trying to do.' He finds the advice he gives the management of the companies in which he invests is very similar. One lesson he preaches 'almost obsessively' is how managers need to find quality income streams or ways of securing the cash flow from a large slice of the business. And he repeats relentlessly the 'universal truth that you can only run out of cash once'. Take his investment in M33 where Mercury Communications has just taken a stake. 'Most of that (success) is due to the flair and entrepreneurship of the two guys who set it up,' Sir Peter says. 'But I constantly pressed on them that I have known companies go bust in the full flush of expansion because they run out of cash.' At M33 he will now be advising how it should provide information to and deal with a large corporation now that Mercury has taken a significant minority stake. On a smaller scale, he suggested that the entrepreneur whose executive recruiting agency he backed should base himself in an office next to his own in Newport Pagnell. This gave the entrepreneur in the early days the chance to 'have beer and sandwiches at lunchtime ' and talk over problems. Sir Peter says he has also helped school this entrepreneur in the disciplines of presenting cash flows, budgets and strategies to board meetings. He says the angel can also help on simple things like how to deal with the bank manager: 'Give the bank more information than they could conceivably want, particularly if things are going badly.' Sir Peter's investment record has been so short of disasters that it is tempting to suspect he has access to a special supply of deals. But he says he came across most of the investments by chance. For that first investment in Community Hospitals, Sir Peter was approached by Robin Hodgson, chief executive of Granville, then an issuing house and a small venture capital supplier. The meeting with M33 was more haphazard. In 1990 he answered an advertisement in the Financial Times for a correspondence course on how to make money out of the reverse yield curve on gilts. 'I realised I had been creating wealth and managing it and in the process some had stuck to my fingers but I had never given any time to personal finance planning.' After seven lessons, the managing director of the company supplying the course asked whether his illustrious student would endorse the product. Sir Peter said he could be of greater help contributing management ideas and became non-executive chairman. Shirley found Sir Peter after reading his book Sharing the Success about employee share ownership and NFC. She wanted advice on how to implement her plans to allow the workforce to take stakes in the company. Despite relying on chance to find his investments, Sir Peter hopes there might one day be a comprehensive forum to bring angels together with prospective businesses. And he holds high hopes for the new Enterprise Investment Scheme, which replaced the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of last year, as long as sponsors do not find ways to hijack it with risk-free investments. His greatest contribution towards creating a more vibrant angel environment may be as a role model and as a gentle goad to other successful business people. 'I would not bet the farm on this,' he says. 'But I see too many of my old colleagues saying 'Let's give our money to an institution to manage' and who are not really creating a second layer of wealth.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  in a telephone conversation Friday morning, instructed Prime  Minister Yi Yong-tok to take all necessary steps in connection  with the U.N. move to slap sanctions on North Korea.    He gave the instruction after receiving reports on the  latest  developments in the North Korean nuclear issue from Chief of  Staff Pak Kwang-yong in Seoul and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  and foreign affairs and security aide Chong Chong-uk in Moscow.    Tension over Pyongyang's nuclear program is mounting as the  U.N. Security Council moves toward sanctions against the  Stalinist state, and the government should be scrupulous in  dealing with such tension, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik  quoted Kim as telling Prime Minister Yi.    The transparency of North Korea's nuclear development  program  must be guaranteed under all circumstances, and on this  principle the government should maintain close cooperation with  the United States and Japan in considering future action,  President Kim said.    Kim asked Prime Minister Yi to ensure that the people can go  about their business with full trust in the government and  without any sense of crisis.</p>

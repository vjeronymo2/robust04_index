			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1,200 NATURE LOVERS TAKE A HIKE TO PRESS CALL FOR MORE PARKLAND  </P> <P> More than a thousand nature lovers -- including barefoot hippies, mounted  cowboys and heavy-breathing runners, invaded the hills above Malibu on Sunday,  hoping to persuade their leaders and neighbors of the need for more parkland  near urban areas.  </P> <P> Sponsored by a number of conservationist groups, including the Santa Monica  Mountains Parkland Assn., supporters said the Los Angeles "March for Parks" was  expected to be the largest in the nation.  </P> <P> Dozens of other large cities staged similar walks nationwide Sunday to raise  money for acquisition of parklands.  </P> <P> Locally, nearly 1,200 people set off on the winding trails of Malibu Creek  State Park seeking a brief respite from the hum and hustle of the crowded city  before arriving at Paramount Ranch five miles away, where music and  demonstrations awaited.  </P> <P> The National Parks and Conservation Assn. also took the opportunity to recruit  walkers and solicit money for its efforts to set aside more parkland.  </P> <P> "This out here, in nature, is the real life on our planet. It doesn't exist in  the frenzied, chaotic world of the city that we created," said Ronn Hayes, a  Malibu conservation activist who was master of ceremonies for the program.  </P> <P> "With all the despair in the inner city, we need to make sure we have this land  for people to re-touch nature," he said.  </P> <P> As the noontime sun burned gauzy fog off the rugged hilltops in Malibu Canyon,  the dirt trails twisting through scrub oaks were alive with motion: horseback  riders, speeding mountain bicycles and parents with strollers crisscrossed on a  maze of trails.  </P> <P> But even as cottontail rabbits dodged into the brush and bird watchers watched  the creek bed hoping for a glimpse of a rare Eurasian widgeon, the business of  the city was all to close at hand for some participants.  </P> <P> "Damn!" gasped one man as he ran back toward the parking lot where the walk  began. "My beeper just went off!"  </P> <P> The meeting place between the urban and the wild was apparent as a group of  horseback riders warned two boys on bicycles to slow down before racing behind  the horses in a cloud of dust.  </P> <P> "As long as people are ecologically concerned, I am all for having everybody  come see this beautiful place," said Hidden Hills resident Ed Berliner, perched  atop a patient paint horse. "It is nice to come out here without running into a  lot of concrete and fences."  </P> <P> For many, the lazy creeks and steep hillsides above Malibu reminded them that  development is gradually swallowing much of the open space around Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It is all being used up so fast. It's hard to see this land go down the  tubes," said Malibu resident Douglas Rucker, listening to a folk singer after  completing the five-mile walk. "Today is a celebration of the land, but it is  also a funeral. I hope this makes people more aware of the value of this land."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Qingyu (2799 1987 3842): "Food Industry Should </F> Become Hebei Province's Pillar Industry"]    [Text] Our province's food industry should serve the  domestic and international markets and be developed as a pillar  industry. Developing the food industry is an important measure  for guaranteeing the basic living demands of the urban people  and enabling peasants to become better-off with moderate  prosperity and an important component for developing the  export-oriented economy. This was repeatedly stressed by Cheng  Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, when he  listened to Shijiazhuang city's briefings on development of the  vegetable basket project today.    Today, the production line for producing 10,000 tonnes of  Guangbei Brand cook meat products under the Shijiazhuang city  meat packing plant, which is one of the key items of  Shijiazhuang city's vegetable basket project, was completed and  put into production. Provincial leaders, including Cheng Weigao,  Li Bingliang, Zhao Jinduo, Guo Hongqi, Gu Eerxiong, Song Shuhua,  and Zhang Runshen, and former provincial leaders, such as Xie  Feng and Hong Yi, travelled to the plant to extend  congratulations. After that, they listened to briefings given  by the Shiajiazhuang city government on the vegetable basket  project.    Cheng Weigao said: The CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have been concerned about this vegetable basket project.  Whether we can enrich the vegetable basket in the course of  deepening reform will affect economic and political stability.  Foodstuffs are an important aspect to the vegetable basket  project. Our province has rich resources for the development of  the food industry which should become a pillar industry along  with steel, iron, machinery, and textile industries. On the one  hand, we should do a good job in local market supply; and on the  other hand, we should make food industry serve the domestic and  international markets. At present, people have failed to fully  understand this point. The development of food industry may  lead the processing industry and aquaculture forward, make a  number of peasants rich, arrange jobs for a batch of labor  force, and enrich the vegetable basket and market supply. It is  necessary to regard this work as an important measure for  enabling peasants to become well-off and developing the  export-oriented economy.    Cheng Weigao said: To grasp the vegetable basket, first of  all, we must do a good job in production and supply; and second,  strengthen market management and price management, deal blows to  unlawful acts, such as manipulation of markets, mixing up good  and inferior products, selling fake products, forcing the prices  up, and giving short measurements, protect the interests of  consumers, and keep the prices at a rational level. He  expressed hope that Shijiazhuang city will pay attention to the  four matters in the course of carrying out the vegetable basket  project: First, Shijiazhuang city should attend to hog raising,  accelerate the development of the meat processing industry, and  exert efforts to raise the product quality and increase product  varieties; second, actively carry out the work of raising cattle  with straw; third, accelerate the development of vegetables  within plastic sheet coverings and select several vegetable  varieties for intensive processing or for sale within small  packages; and fourth, develop the intensive processing of grain  products.</p>

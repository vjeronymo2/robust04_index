			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Peat Marwick to cut up to 250 audit jobs KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest accountancy firm by fee income, is cutting up to 250 jobs across the country, it emerged yesterday. A total of 200-250 qualified accounting staff from the firm's audit division are to be told to leave later this week, although the figures do not include any partners. The losses will come from all regions, but the majority are concentrated in the south-east and the Midlands. They come on top of similar job losses at this time last year. There has been fierce competition for fees in all business sectors between the firms, including widespread reductions in audit bills. Senior staff within the firm said the action had been forced by the slowdown in the normal turnover of staff and the lower numbers required to carry out audit work. The recession has reduced the number of alternative financial sector jobs available which are traditionally taken by accountants after qualifying with the big firms. Mr Jim Butler, senior partner, said: 'This is not unexpected. We did it last year and we are doing it again this year. There is a continual problem of people not leaving.' He said KPMG had, like other accountancy firms, suffered from some clients going out of business, but that overall its volume of audit business remained stable. The lay-offs are taking place just as the peak period for auditing client companies' financial statements for the year is coming to an end. They follow some smaller lay-offs in recent weeks, including at least 20 in Scotland. Three months ago KPMG unveiled fee income at Pounds 484m up 12.3 per cent on the year to September 30 1991. The employees to be made redundant have already been identified by senior management but they have not yet been told. The firm had planned to notify them tomorrow. The decision on who will leave is in large part made outside London, because KPMG is structured as a regional partnership with considerable autonomy given to each district. Many accountancy firms have been suffering from the effects of the recession.</p>

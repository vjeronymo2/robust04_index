			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Alarm grows as Nigeria sacks top executives Nigeria's military regime yesterday dissolved the boards of all government-owned companies and federal agencies, with immediate effect. The move, which follows the dismissal of army and navy chiefs earlier this week, contributed to mounting international alarm at the turmoil in Nigeria. The European Union issued a statement saying it was 'gravely concerned' over developments in the country, and calling for the restoration of a civil democracy. A brief statement from the Nigerian presidency in Abuja, the capital, gave no explanation for the removal of hundreds of top executives and government officials. But sacked directors were told to turn in official property in their care. Among the organisations affected were the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, the Ports Authority and the National Electric Power Authority. Nigeria's main parastatals - in oil and gas, telecommunications, electricity, ports, airlines and heavy industry - are all regarded by the public as inefficient and corrupt and have been under investigation by special panels since early this year. Some of these panels have submitted reports alleging financial mismanagement and fraud, although making no specific recommendations. However, yesterday's move has been interpreted as part of President Sani Abacha's declared aim of taking a hard line against civil opposition, rather than as a move on corruption. The dissolution of the boards opens the way for a scramble for key government jobs in the face of stiff opposition to continued military rule. Gen Abacha is also widely expected to reshuffle his government soon. The military regime has been facing mounting criticism since the arrest of Mr Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's presidential election, and the sacking of leaders of the oil workers' unions, who have been on strike for eight weeks. About 90 per cent of the 100,000 oil workers defied the government's order to return to work on Thursday, according to oil companies. Labour Minister Samuel Ogbemudia reacted on Thursday night by sacking the strikers en masse. The oil unions are demanding the release and installation as Nigerian president of Mr Abiola, who is facing treason charges for proclaiming himself president.</p>

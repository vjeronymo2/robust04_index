			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received a report that Swedish Foreign  Minister Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas after her visit to Tuzla  also visited Sarajevo today where she held talks with  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup Ganic. Nedzad Leko  reports:    [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks with Dr. Ganic,  Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas stated to the journalists:    [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] I am very glad to be here because of the  changes that have taken place in Sarajevo and because of the end  of terrorist attacks on the town. I am also satisfied with the  talks that are currently under way between the Bosnian and the  Croatian Governments. Sweden supports the Washington agreement.  We believe that there are numerous constructive elements in this  agreement and I am pleased that Mr. Ganic sees it as a very  positive matter.    I would like to say that the international engagement on  Bosnia's behalf will continue. Once peace is restored, perhaps  we will no longer need the Nordic battalion. However, Sweden  will be here as a partner in the reconstruction of the country.  I have also told Mr. Ganic that Sweden would like very much to  help Sarajevo, which is alive and not a ghost town.    [Leko] The journalists were then addressed by Dr. Ejup  Ganic:    [Ganic, in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] [passage indistinct] blockade of Sarajevo.  Since there is no more shelling, we wish to secure the return of  citizens to their homes in all suburbs of Sarajevo. This is our  next step. We also informed the guest about our desire to  continue negotiations. We will call upon the Serbs to join the  talks to find a solution for Bosnia, as there is enough space  for everybody in the federation while the entire world wishes to  make use of this advantageous moment. It is very encouraging to  hear that our friends will stand by us in the future.    [Leko] Answering a journalist's question about the  impressions after yesterday's visit to Tuzla, Baroness  Margaretha Af Ugglas said:    [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] My impression is that there is still plenty of  work to be done. There is a blockade and the industry around  Tuzla cannot work because of it. However, I am encouraged with  public works that are being carried out in the town itself, for  example, the cleaning of the town. I believe that this is  important. I was also satisfied with the work of the Nordic  battalion. The situation in Tuzla is now more peaceful,  however, there are still unpleasant incidents which is  definitely something that we should combat, because I believe  that our battalion should carry out its work in peaceful  conditions.    What is very encouraging is that the airport has now been  taken over by the Nordic battalion and that it will soon be  opened for delivery of humanitarian aid. [end recording]</p>

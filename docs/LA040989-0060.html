JORDAN." ATLANTIC *  </P> <P> Sometimes he sounds like his dad, which is natural enough. Sometimes he affects  the deep-voiced theatricality of the post-punk legion ofDavid Bowie imitators.  But, most of all, Julian Lennon sounds here as if he hasn't an original thought  in his head, nor any expressive means that transcend cliche. Producer Patrick  Leonard tries to keep it interesting with a host of studio tricks and a small  army of supporting players, but all that isn't worth much if the key songwriter  doesn't dare to imagine. In the course of three albums, Lennon has gone from  winsome to forgettable to soporific. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

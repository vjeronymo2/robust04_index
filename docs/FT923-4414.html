			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Major pledges commitment to EC: Speech sets out scope for development if French reject Maastricht MR JOHN MAJOR will today emphasise the scope for further development within the European Community even if the result of the French referendum is a No to the Maastricht treaty on European union. The prime minister will restate his commitment to the agreement as the best way forward for the Community and his desire to see it ratified. He will also use a speech at a London conference on the future of the EC to highlight the other ways, such as inter-governmental co-operation, in which links between the 12 EC members can be strengthened. The speech is also likely to seek to underline commitment to the exchange rate mechanism. UK ministers are keen to ensure that the ERM survives in the long term as well as whatever disturbances in the markets would follow a No vote. Mr Major will spell out the tasks remaining on the EC agenda, irrespective of Maastricht. These include enlargement, changes to financing and decision-making arrangements, and completion of the single market. 'If the French vote No, the world would not come to an end,' one minister said yesterday. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president, warned both sides in the referendum campaign against playing on fears of German domination. That was 'a grave error' which 'can do us great harm', he said on television, urging a Yes vote in the September 20 referendum. Mr Giscard d'Estaing's appearance, following a television appeal last Thursday by President Francois Mitterrand, came as another poll showed a small advance in the proportion of voters - 56 per cent - in favour of monetary and political union. Yesterday's poll, by Ipsos for Journal du Dimanche, showed a 1 percentage point advance in the Yes vote on a CSA poll on Friday. The outcome is still in the balance because 24 per cent of the total polled by Ipsos did not know or did not indicate which way they would vote - a level in line with most polls taken since Mr Mitterrand announced the referendum in early June. The 56 per cent majority in yesterday's survey is a proportion of those who stated an opinion. Mr Giscard d'Estaing, president of the centre-right UDF opposition party, stressed that the treaty could not be renegotiated in the event of a No vote on September 20. It was a painstakingly fought compromise between the 12 EC governments and renegotiation was 'impossible'. Three quarters of people who say they would vote if the UK had a referendum on closer ties with Europe would oppose such links according to an opinion poll in today's Daily Star. The telephone survey carried out by ICM also found that two thirds of those questioned thought the UK should have a referendum, while only 30 per cent believed that parliament should decide.</p>

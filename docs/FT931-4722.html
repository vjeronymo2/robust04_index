			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / South-east in rail cuts frontline BRITISH RAIL'S Network SouthEast commuter operations are to bear the brunt of service cuts when the new national rail timetable comes into operation in May, it emerged yesterday. Mr Brian Wilson, opposition transport spokesman, said the government's plans for rail privatisation were to blame for the cuts. He said BR was being forced to create a railway slim enough for the private sector to inherit. Network SouthEast said its commuter traffic had declined by 7 per cent a year for the least two years and was expected to go on doing so next year. Examples of cuts include the loss of six return journeys a day on Sussex coast services and eight return journeys a day on the south London lines. There will be peak-hour reductions on the Kent Link, Hastings, Sheerness and Medway Valley lines. BR's InterCity division is also making cuts. Hull will lose one of the two direct trains which link it with London each weekday and the daily return train between Liverpool and Dover is to be axed. The 15-minute interval Gatwick Express service will be reduced to 30-minute intervals early in the morning. In contrast, Regional Railways, BR's provincial passenger operation, is increasing services. It will be opening a link to Manchester airport in May and plans a service between Birmingham Snow Hill and London Marylebone via Leamington Spa. British Rail's Trainload Freight division, recently criticised for pricing freight off the rails, yesterday said it had won a waste-disposal contract in Manchester that would take 10,000 lorries a year off the roads.</p>

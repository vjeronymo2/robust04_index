			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma Ata, April 26 (CNS) -- At the end of his visit  to four Central Asian countries, China's Premier Li Peng hosted  a forum here with the delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs  accompanying him on his visit, Mr. Li said that China would  never seek its own sphere of influence in the region and would  not hinder other countries from investing in the Central Asian  countries.    Premier Li said that special attention would be given to the  quality of commodities entering the Central Asian markets and  legitimate business should be protected and speculation cracked  down on. Border trade should continue to develop and its  operational level enhanced.    In reply to a question on the issue of dual nationality put  to him by a journalist today, the premier said that China did  not recognize dual nationality as was made clear in China's Law  on Nationality. There were now 50 million people in the world  of Chinese origin living outside China with most of them living  in Southeast Asian countries. The fact that such a large number  of people of Chinese origin were living overseas was a  historical result and China accepted this historical fact.  China had offered them the right to choose their nationality.  They could either choose Chinese nationality or that of the  country in which they lived. That option meant that they could  enjoy all the rights and fulfill the obligations of the country  which they choose.    This morning, a Sino-Kazakh border agreement was signed here  by Premier Li and the President of Kazakhstan, N. A. Nazarbayev.    The Sino-Kazakh border is over 1,700 kilometres in length  and  the two sides reached agreement on more than 1,600 kilometres of  its length. At their meeting, the Kazakh president said that  Kazakhstan adhered to the principle of non-interference in the  internal affairs of other countries and opposed national  splittism and hegemonism. Kazakhstan, he said, would not allow  "East Turkistan" to stage anti-China activities and undermine  Kazakh-Chinese relations in Kazakh territory.    President Nazarbayev also said that Kazakhstan considered  Taiwan an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and  Kazakhstan would not have any official contacts with Taiwan.</p>

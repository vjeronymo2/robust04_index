			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Securities industry acts to safeguard data transfers STANDARDS for trade data messages, aimed at reducing the risk of errors in cross-border transactions, are to be developed by 21 of the world's leading securities industry bodies. At a recent exploratory meeting in Brussels, organised by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the group agreed to set up by mid-year a neutral standards advisory board representative of and visible to the securities markets worldwide, as well as a framework to prevent duplicated or fragmented work on standards. Both bodies will be recognised by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) as being designated by it for the global development of securities message standards.</p>

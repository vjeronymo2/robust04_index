			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 50m tag for Crest Packaging A MARKET value in excess of Pounds 50m is expected when Crest Packaging's flotation is priced at the end of this month. The listing will be by way of an institutional placing and no new money is being raised by the company. Four directors and their families own all the shares at present, and will sell 25 per cent. Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, and his family currently hold 85 per cent of the shares, which will fall to 64 per cent after the float. The company was formed by a management buy-out from Bowater in 1985. It later acquired its 18 acre site and sold 8 acres to Tesco for Pounds 21.3m, a profit of Pounds 12.7m before tax. Part of the proceeds were paid to Bowater. The sale transformed the balance sheet, which now carries cash of Pounds 10m. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.89m on sales of Pounds 41.8m in the year to April 30. Pro-forma earnings per share were 8.04p. A dividend cover of about 2 times is expected, to give a yield of 3 or 4 per cent, in line with the sector. Crest has two broad product lines - flexible packaging which contributed 70 per cent of operating profits in 1993, and cartons which made the balance. Mr Webb said there had been capacity constraints holding back turnover growth which were being addressed by increasing capacity by 20 per cent over the next year. Pricing will be announced on October 28 and dealings are due to start on November 4.</p>

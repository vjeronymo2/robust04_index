			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Stability returning to German economy WEST GERMAN indicators suggest the economy is stabilising, the economics ministry said yesterday, as the growth of money supply edged closer to the Bundesbank's target range and money market interest rates fell slightly. Both events indicated a more stable environment for the central bank to continue its series of cautious reductions in short-term interest rates, economists suggested. Meanwhile, the ministry's monthly report pointed to a 'slightly less pessimistic' assessment by businesses of the current situation, for the first time in the past year. This coincided with a marginal improvement in demand in the manufacturing sector, and a stabilisation in industry as a whole. However, economists suggested that today's meeting of the Bundesbank's central council would not bring further cuts in the key discount rate, presently at 6.25 per cent. The M3 measure of money supply grew at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 7 per cent last month, compared with 7.2 per cent in August and the bank's upper target limit of 6.5 per cent. However, total money supply rose moderately during the month after weakening in August, the bank added, and bank lending had increased again after falling in the previous month. The rate of capital formation - the transfer of funds into long-term deposits, which are not included in the calculation of M3 - also slowed markedly last month. The Bundesbank yesterday resumed its fine-tuning of money market interest rates with a reduction from 6.7 per cent to 6.67 per cent in its securities repurchase rate, a move which had been widely discounted. But, the latest ministry report warns that structural adjustment by German companies is likely to mean that economic recovery will continue to be extremely hesitant. It suggests that wage agreements reached so far in the current pay round clearly reflect the precarious position. It also points to a further deterioration in unemployment. In east Germany, the monthly economic statistics continue to show big variations, reflecting in part the sporadic nature of orders for exports from former clients in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Both imports and exports for Germany as a whole have shown a sharp decline over the past year. In the first seven months of 1993, imports were down 17.2 per cent, and exports down 13.8 per cent. Germany's visible trade balance for the period increased to DM25.3bn (Pounds 10.2bn), from DM14.6bn for the same period of 1992. Its deficit on the invisible account rose from DM10.7bn to DM21.9bn.</p>

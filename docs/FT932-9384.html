			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Russia says nothing ruled out on Bosnia RUSSIA yesterday said the states trying to end the conflict in Bosnia had made no firm proposals on what should be done if the Bosnian Serbs reject an international peace plan in a referendum to be held this weekend. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister said in a newspaper interview that no measures, 'including severe ones,' had been either agreed or ruled out in advance. His statement echoed remarks by President Bill Clinton suggesting that Washington had become much less keen to go ahead with bombing raids or the selective lifting of the arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems, because of European opposition. Mr Kozyrev said talks on 'political, possibly military, and possibly binding measures' should resume after the Bosnian Serb referendum, in the UN Security Council and within the framework of the EC-sponsored London Conference on the former Yugoslavia. He praised the Serbian government for its support of the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, in the face of its rejection by the Bosnian Serbs. The more the Serbian government continued on this path, the more decisively Russia would support it, he said. This included actions in the UN Security Council 'with a view to a stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions and the return (of the rump Yugoslavia) to international organisations.' In Belgrade, officials said a pan-Serbian parliament meeting to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan would go ahead today in spite of being boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. The meeting was called by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and the leaders of Montenegro and the rump Yugoslav federation because peace in Bosnia was considered by them to be a matter for all the Serbs. In such a joint session, it was virtually certain that the Bosnian Serbs would have been heavily outvoted. Rather than fall into this trap, the Bosnian Serbs have preferred to go ahead with what can only be a travesty of democracy, given the war conditions prevailing in Bosnia. Not surprisingly, the Bosnian Serb parliamentary leaders are confident of popular approval for rejection of the Vance-Owen plan. Meanwhile, some 100 Spanish UN peacekeeping troops re-entered the Bosnian city of Mostar yesterday, after being forced to retreat under fire to its outskirts four days ago. They redeployed after a UN-mediated ceasefire was signed between Croat and Moslem forces. More than 1,300 Moslem civilians detained by the Croats were due to be released. A French UN helicopter was hit by gunfire and forced to make an emergency landing after evacuating wounded people from Zepa in eastern Bosnia, which has been besieged by Bosnian Serb troops. A UN spokesman said no-one had been injured.</p>

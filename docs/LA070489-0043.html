			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS: NEW FACES;  </P> <P> EXCEL IN SIMI VALLEY MAKES INROADS IN COMPETITIVE PROSTHETIC MARKET  </P> <P> Plenty of businesses have been started in garages -- some great ones such as  Apple Computer and some disasters such as Barry Minkow's ZZZZ Best.  </P> <P> It's still too early to tell about Excel, the company Kurt Tennyson and Maurice  Helland started six years ago in a Simi Valley garage. Excel makes  realistic-looking silicon or plastic noses, teeth and eyes used for cosmetic  purposes by cancer and accident victims.  </P> <P> Last year Excel broke even on total sales of $50,000, but the future has  promise. Excel has moved into a proper office and Tennyson and Helland have  quit their full-time jobs at UCLA in hopes of building their company into a  winner.  </P> <P> Although Excel's products are exotic, one problem the company must overcome is  common to many small businesses: how to compete against much larger companies  when you're short of cash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price of Nose Varies  </P> <P> Excel is the smallest of four or five firms that make prosthetic facial devices  in Southern California. And while Tennyson and Helland sell a silicon nose for  $500, their rivals typically charge $2,000 for essentially the same product.  </P> <P> Most of the difference can be traced to a type of insurance similar to  malpractice coverage that allows the prosthesis-maker to deal directly with  clients and thus charge more. Excel does not have such insurance.  </P> <P> "The only way to really make it is to deal directly with the public," said O.  Robert Levy, head of a Los Angeles firm that makes prosthetic eyes.  </P> <P> Levy's company has insurance so that he and his technicians can deal directly  with customers and charge retail prices. The optometrist said the company did  $500,000 in sales last year and turned a $125,000 profit. Levy said he founded  his company in 1946 and counts as one of his longtime customers Sammy Davis  Jr., who lost his left eye in an automobile accident in 1954.  </P> <P> Rivals said Excel's insurance bill might run $25,000 a year, and Tennyson said  "right now we don't have the money it would take to redo the office and pay the  insurance premiums."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money Problems  </P> <P> It's a classic small-business Catch-22. To grow, Excel must have more money.  But it can't easily borrow more money until the company is bigger.  </P> <P> So what do Tennyson and Helland do? Keep hustling for new business and hope  sales keep growing until they save what they need to expand.  </P> <P> In the meantime, it's not an easy life. Helland and Tennyson are Excel's only  employees; each works 60 hours a week. Last year they didn't take any salary,  instead using what spare cash the business generated to buy equipment. This  year they expect Excel to hit about $100,000 in sales, and the two hope to take  home about $15,000 to $20,000 apiece.  </P> <P> Helland, 56, has a Navy pension to augment his income, while Tennyson, 35, has  $23,000 in savings in case things get tight. Tennyson's wife works, earning  about $25,000 a year as a dental hygienist.  </P> <P> "She's holding down the fort this year for us and our two children," Tennyson  said. "We're not eating out or taking vacations this year."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Materials  </P> <P> The prosthetics industry began to grow in the 1950s, when materials such as  silicons and vinyl plastics began to be used widely. Every year in California  about 3,000 people require facial prosthetics as a result of cancers or  accidents, and nationwide the number is 60,000, said John Beumer, chairman of  the removable prosthodontics department at UCLA's School of Dentistry.  </P> <P> Dental technicians such as Helland and Tennyson, medical illustrators and  specially trained dentists and oculists -- who make artificial eyes -- work at  private companies and university laboratories, measuring patients and  custom-making cosmetic devices.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons we do this is because it's so rewarding to help people get  back into society again," Helland said.  </P> <P> "You have to have artistic ability to do this kind of work," said Carole  Peretti, a medical illustrator who opened the Center for Prosthetics and Makeup  in Hollywood in December and is an Excel rival.  </P> <P> A dentist mails clay-like impressions of the client's face to Excel, and the  two men use it and photographs to create a realistic facsimile of the missing  facial part. The process involves creating a wax mold and filling it with  silicon. The prosthetic is hardened in a special oven and hand-painted. The  whole process can take two days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spare Parts  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, it's a business with some unusual aspects. Tennyson said that  the fees for a nose include a spare, which is usually painted a shade darker to  mimic a summer tan.  </P> <P> Facial prostheses are attached with glues like rubber cement and are removed  daily, Tennyson said, by rinsing the plastic body part with soap and water or  applying something like paint thinner. A non-water-soluble glue was developed  for people in rainy climates or for those who sweat profusely and are afraid  their nose or ear will fall off.  </P> <P> Tennyson tells a story about a patient whose artificial ear became discolored a  few months after he received it. No one could figure out why -- usually it  takes about a year before yellowing. Then the man's wife came up with the  answer. The patient would read the newspaper and habitually touch his ear with  his ink-stained hand to make sure the ear was in place.  </P> <P> Helland and Tennyson met 12 years ago at UCLA, where both fit clients for  facial prostheses and also taught dentists how to make the devices. They earned  about $30,000 annually, Tennyson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broke Even  </P> <P> The two men started their company with $4,000 in 1983 in Helland's garage.  Working evenings and weekends, they broke even the first year. As the business  grew -- entirely by word of mouth -- they were able to purchase about $75,000  worth of used equipment, such as special lathes and ovens.  </P> <P> Helland retired from UCLA in the spring of 1988, and Tennyson quit in February  to work at Excel full time. "I could tell I was at a standstill at UCLA after I  didn't get a raise for six years," Tennyson said. "There's more potential  here."  </P> <P> Excel, which gets orders from about 40 dentists, has a far smaller customer  base than its rivals. Levy, for instance, said he makes about 800 eyes per year  for patients from around the world. The Peyton Massey Prosthetic Center of West  Los Angeles, which has been in business for 35 years, has about 175 clients and  did about $500,000 in sales last year, said spokesman Allen Feuerstein.  </P> <P> Making facial prosthetics is highly labor-intensive. Tennyson and Helland often  return to the lab after dinner and stay until midnight. Someday they may hire  additional technicians, although they said they are concerned the quality of  the lab's work would suffer.  </P> <P> "The biggest risk in this business is job burnout from the long hours,"  Tennyson said. "But we're not burned out yet."  </P></p>

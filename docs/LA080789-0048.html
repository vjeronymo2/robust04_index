			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PAIRINGS OF CONVENIENCE HELP SENIORS EASE PROBLEMS AT HOME  </P> <P> Mary Lew was a handicapped, elderly widow with extra space in her Beverlywood  home -- too much space, she said. She needed help with household chores, and  she ached for companionship.  </P> <P> Rusty Morgan was a 40-year-old divorcee, whose job-related disability left her  broke and unable to work regularly.  </P> <P> It was a perfect match.  </P> <P> The two women met in July through a nonprofit Los Angeles agency called  Alternative Living for the Aging, and they have shared Lew's home since.  </P> <P> "I like having someone to laugh with, to talk with after dinner," Lew said. "I  have that in Rusty."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles program, which has been operating for 10 years, is being  duplicated in the San Fernando Valley. Jewish Family Services has been awarded  a two-year, $50,000 state grant to begin a shared housing project for senior  citizens that will operate from the Valley Storefront on Victory Boulevard in  North Hollywood. The program, the first of its kind in the Valley, is open to  all senior citizens, regardless of religious affiliation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ease Financial Burden  </P> <P> It is an attempt to help the elderly remain independent, to soothe their  loneliness and ease the financial burden they often face when the cost of  housing rises faster than their Social Security payments, said Dori Gradwohl,  Valley Storefront's director.  </P> <P> It offers an alternative to living with children or moving into an institution,  Gradwohl said. Senior citizens, she said, can remain in control of their lives,  eat when they are hungry and not when meals are served, keep the pets they have  grown to love, live among the possessions they have collected over a lifetime.  </P> <P> The program, which officially started last month, has yet to make its first  match. The applicants, 60 so far, are still being interviewed, and the lengthy  questionnaires they have been asked to complete are being reviewed.  </P> <P> "One woman wants to share a place, but she wants her own kitchen," Gradwohl  said. "That's a little unreasonable. I'm not sure we'll be able to help her."  </P> <P> Anita Capper's application is among the stack of entries. Capper, 62, said she  recently left her husband and a comfortable house in Canoga Park after 36 years  of marriage. She got a part-time job as a receptionist in a dental office --  the first time she has worked for someone else since 1957 -- and she receives  half her husband's Social Security check.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buying Time  </P> <P> But her income totals less than $700 a month, not enough to pay her bills and  support a place of her own. She is not looking for fellowship, just buying time  until she can get back on her feet. In exchange for low rent, Capper is hoping  to care for someone else's home while they are away.  </P> <P> In an effort to pair the most compatible people, all applicants are queried  about their personal habits -- whether they awaken early or late, whether they  smoke, keep pets, watch television or entertain guests frequently.  </P> <P> And although the shared housing staff makes home visits and screens all  applications, the final decision rests with the senior citizens. They are  responsible for checking personal references and choosing a partner. Sometimes  they choose wrong and have to try again.  </P> <P> "We're certainly not the CIA, but we endeavor to do the best job we can to ward  off potential problems," Gradwohl said. "And after the match is made, we will  continue to be actively involved to make sure it's a good marriage."  </P> <P> But some matches, like some marriages, are ill-fated.  </P> <P> Edith Rieder, 76, has lived alone in her two-bedroom apartment since her  husband died in October. She desperately wanted company, and in May, called  Alternative Living in Los Angeles to inquire about a roommate.  </P> <P> She offered to lease a bedroom and bath in her ground-floor apartment for $200  a month, less than half her $500 monthly rent. "I made it very reasonable  because I wanted somebody to be with me," she said. "I'm afraid to live alone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needed a Home  </P> <P> Hara Berland, 62, needed a home. She was working and living at a retirement  hotel, but when her job was eliminated during a cutback, she landed at a  shelter for the homeless. She called Alternative Living and was given Rieder's  phone number.  </P> <P> The two women met, and a match was made. But Berland said it hasn't worked out.  She described Rieder as "a very lovely lady" but said she wants a place of her  own. "I am surrounded by pictures of her family," Berland said. "I am  surrounded by her things. . . . What she needs is a companion. She's very  lonely and needs company." Berland, on the other hand, said she yearns for  privacy.  </P> <P> But for every match with problems there are scores without them. Alternative  Living has placed more than 2,800 people in shared housing situations. Fifty  more make their homes in cooperative buildings, where up to 14 senior citizens  live communally.  </P> <P> Similar programs operate in Glendale, the harbor area and Pasadena. The  California Homesharing Assn. reports at least 51 such programs statewide. And  nationally, there are nearly 400 programs operating in 42 states, up from about  50 in 1980, according to the National Shared Housing Resource Center in  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funding Cuts  </P> <P> During the last year, several shared housing projects for senior citizens have  fallen victim to cuts in government funding. Four programs in Pennsylvania have  closed in recent months. And $500,000 for shared housing programs in California  was cut from the state budget this year, which could threaten about 20  programs.  </P> <P> "For $500,000, we could match thousands of seniors a year," said Janet Witkin,  founder and director of Alternative Living. "That's a lot of service for very  few dollars. You could not build many buildings for $500,000."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, more than 270,000 elderly people are on waiting lists for affordable  housing nationwide, a number that is expected to rise as the population ages  and the pool of affordable housing drops, said Deborah Cloud, a spokeswoman for  the American Assn. of Homes for the Aging, a Washington-based lobby for  nonprofit housing for the elderly.  </P> <P> "What we need are more brick and mortar dollars as well as housing and rent  subsidy dollars," Witkin said. "How many homeless old people do we want to see?  I don't think we want to see any. What a terrible thing to happen in the last  years of your life." Alternative living situations foster a feeling of family  in an age when privacy and personal possessions are held in high esteem, she  said.  </P> <P> "We're into having our own car, our own hot tub, our own VCR, and I'm afraid  we've created one of the loneliest peoples on the face of the earth," Witkin  said.  </P> <P> "We think it's a burden to live with people. We're not accustomed to it. We  live in couples, in singles or in a nuclear family. And old people, once their  spouse dies, live alone."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "In case violence escalates on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina either because of massive NATO air strikes or  combat activities of the sides directly involved in the conflict  and (in case of) a threat to the personnel of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force], it cannot be ruled out that the question of  the necessity of further stay of peace-keeping forces in Bosnia  will arise", Karasin said adding that Yasushi Akashi, the envoy  of the UN secretary general, had recently mentioned the  possibility.    He stressed that a number of states whose peace-keepers are  in the zone of conflict had several times noted that in case of  a real threat to the personnel of their peace-keeping forces the  question may arise about withdrawing them.    Russia will follow suit in this case, according to Karasin.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steadier ahead of FOMC rates decision - Market Report Selling pressure lifted somewhat in the UK stock market yesterday and, although investors remained cautious ahead of news from the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the FT-SE 100 Index managed to regain the 3,000 mark. Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for equities continued to restrain trading volume. A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours, helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets. However, the chances that yesterday's FOMC meeting could have led to a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy had continued to overshadow London trading. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3 earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with its recent performance. The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have lifted in any permanent sense. Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity holdings was further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6 per cent. The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5. Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London equity market. Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the shares. In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement in the share price. Recoveries in bank shares, in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind by the recent selling bout. These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market lower. Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting.</p>

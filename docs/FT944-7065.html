			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Hotels find room for optimism The confidence of hoteliers rose markedly in the third quarter, boosted by an increasingly optimistic outlook in Northern Ireland, according to BDO Hospitality Consulting. The proportion of hoteliers who were optimistic or very optimistic about the next three months rose to 80.5 per cent, compared with 73.8 per cent in the second quarter. The consulting group said the figures had been lifted by the ceasefire in Northern Ireland. All respondents to the survey in Northern Ireland said they were optimistic. More than three-quarters of UK hoteliers said they expected to increase their room rates in the next year. Most said their revenues were ahead of the same period last year, although 13.2 per cent said revenues had fallen. Business travel was the main reason for the revenue rise. Three-quarters of hoteliers said business travel revenues were higher than last year. Fewer than half reported a rise in revenues from leisure travellers. Staff numbers increased in 30.3 per cent of hotels in the third quarter but fell in 14.5 per cent. Although 31.2 per cent of hoteliers said they expected employee numbers to rise in the fourth quarter the proportion expecting to cut staff rose to 23.4 per cent. The consulting group said that while the high proportion of establishments planning to reduce staff numbers was partly seasonal, hoteliers were showing greater readiness to lay employees off during slack periods.</p>

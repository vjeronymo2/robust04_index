The purpose of  this plan is to promote industries' productivity by rebuilding  China's lagging production industries. Technologies considered  vital to China's economic prosperity and development for the  199Os and the next century are listed in priority order based on  the technologies needed for China's economic development, with a  special focus being put on industrial technology. The list  includes 35 projects in seven areas:    1) Agriculture: Two projects on crop breeding technology and  technology to manage low- and medium-crop production areas in  order to achieve high-quality, high-yield production.    2) Energy resources and environment: Five projects on  low-tempetature nuclear reactor district heating technology,  tertiary oil exploitation technology, and clean coal utilization  technology.    3) Transportation: Three projects on high-speed railway  transportation, high-grade highways and inland water transport  technologies.    4) Raw and Processed Materials and Natural Resources: Seven  projects on sheet-bar continuous roll milling and continuous  casting technology, oxygen-coal iron-smelting technology, heavy  oil processing technology, manufacturing technology for  important fine chemical engineering products, engineering  plastics and plastic alloy technology.    5) Information and Telecommunications: Nine projects on  integrated circuits, computers, softwares, power electronics,  automation, and fiber optics.    6) Manufacturing Technology: Eight projects on numerical  control technology, laser technology, and technology for  manufacturing complete set of large-scale thermal power plants.    7) Biotechnology: Six projects on animal and plant genetic  engineering, hybridoma-production technology, industrial  microbial technology, and protein engineering.</p>

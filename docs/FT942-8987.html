			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Management: Portuguese are Champs of 1994 - A business student competition Any consumer goods company whose branded product had a 40 per cent share of the European market would probably refuse to manufacture a private label version for one of its smaller national territories. The risks would be too high, the potential rewards too meagre. Yet a remarkably well-argued case for a big French pizza-maker to do precisely that has helped a team of four Portuguese students win Champ 94 - Challenge in Management Perspectives - a business undergraduate competition which attracted entries from 400 teams in 23 countries across Europe. Designed to test analytical, interpersonal and presentational skills, Champ 94 was one of the largest pan-European team events of its kind. It was sponsored by Unilever, with support from the London Business School, the European Commission and the Financial Times. After qualifying heats last month in Budapest, Hamburg, Milan, Paris, Rotterdam and Warsaw, the two-day final was held last weekend at the LBS, whose MBA students organised the competition in conjunction with two international student associations, AEGEE and AIESEC. The Portuguese victory, against teams from Germany, Hungary, Poland, Scotland and Switzerland, was greeted with whoops of joy worthy of a south European soccer match. Apart from one tied result, the team of 22-year-olds from the Catholic University in Lisbon won every phase of the final session. Last year, when Champ was started by two LBS students, 232 teams took part. That event was won by a team from the Stockholm School of Economics. This year's final consisted of two days of case study analysis and debate, and an interactive computerised management game in which students had to make a series of high-pressure decisions over a company's purchasing, production and inventory. Appropriately for young people about to enter the real world of business, the marking is weighted towards teamwork. Although it did not form part of the judges' official assessment, the students' fluency in business English was remarkable. Only two of this year's 24 finalists were native English speakers, and almost all are still in their early 20s. Yet their language skills were demonstrated not only in formal presentation but also in cut-and-thrust debate. The winning team shares a Ecu 2,000 (Pounds 1,540) purse and receives individual eight-week work experience scholarships with Unilever outside their home country. Champ.

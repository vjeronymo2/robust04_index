Butrus-Ghali  was speaking to members of Parliament and the Senate and later  addressed a packed Great Church in The Hague.    The offer to send a reinforced battalion in addition to the  1,840 Netherlands soldiers who are already deployed in the  former Yugoslavia was "highly valued" by the United Nations,  Butrus-Ghali said.    Dutch support to mine clearance operations in  Mozambique--the  Netherlands is to send some 10 mine clearance experts--was also  especially welcome.    The secretary general regretfully noted that some countries  were starting to show "symptoms of fatigue" where contributions  to UN peace operations were concerned. "I am not certain  whether I will obtain enough troops for peace operations," he  said. "Nor am I certain of financial contributions. Some  countries say that the costs and risks are too high."    In a confidential speech to members of Parliament and the  Senate, Butrus-Ghali said he could not impose peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina if the warring parties continued to refuse to  end the hostilities. The order to launch air attacks on Bosnian  Serb positions was a matter for the UN member states themselves.  <H5>  Borrow </H5>   Butrus-Ghali, who is on a three-day visit to the  Netherlands,  added that he could only "borrow" military resources from the UN  member states. The decision to launch air attacks was not his  first responsibility, he said. NATO has spoken in favor of air  attacks, but so far Butrus-Ghali has received no request to  carry them out.    Prince Willem-Alexander, virtually the entire cabinet, MP's,  the military top brass, and many prominent Dutch persons  attended the secretary general's speech in the Great Church.  Butrus-Ghali is a former international law professor in Egypt,  his country of birth. He called for breathing new life into  international law so that it would be possible to react  appropriately to the great challenges of the post-Cold War  period. He referred to the great role the Netherlands has long  played in this respect. It was not for nothing that The Hague  houses the UN International Court of Justice, the Permanent  Court of Arbitration, and the International War Crimes Tribunal.</p>

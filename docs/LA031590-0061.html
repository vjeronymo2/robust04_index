			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORTER RANCH PROJECT SENT BACK TO BRADLEY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council quietly voted Wednesday to send a key segment of  the Porter Ranch project back to Mayor Tom Bradley, a move that could ease the  way for final council approval of the 1,300-acre housing and commercial  development.  </P> <P> The council sent to Bradley proposed amendments to the Chatsworth-Porter Ranch  District Plan, designed to accommodate the $2-billion Porter Ranch project.  </P> <P> The project is a development proposed by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell,  a major Bradley campaign contributor, and Shapell's partners, Norman and Irving  Feintech.  </P> <P> Located on a Chatsworth mountain slope north of the Simi Valley Freeway, the  project would be one of the largest single developments in the history of Los  Angeles, with 3,395 residential units and a 6-million-square-foot commercial  complex.  </P> <P> Last December, Bradley vetoed the proposed district plan amendments, claiming  the project needed more lower-cost housing and public transit.  </P> <P> The veto brought on a flurry of negotiations between the mayor and the  project's major legislative supporter, Councilman Hal Bernson. A  Bradley-Bernson compromise package emerged a week later.  </P> <P> But Bradley's veto -- which remains in effect -- created a potential tactical  obstacle for the project's supporters, city officials said. To get final  council approval, the supporters would need 10 votes to override the veto.  </P> <P> General plan amendments, unlike most other legislative items at City Hall,  first go to the mayor and then to the council.  </P> <P> By sending the district plan amendments back to Bradley and getting his  approval of them, the amendments bypassed the veto and can be enacted with only  eight council votes, said Frank Fielding, a senior city planner.  </P></p>

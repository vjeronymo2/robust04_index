			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Industrial building orders fall in west THE west German construction industry this week reported its first fall in new orders since March last year. A 13 per cent slump in contracts for commercial and industrial building during May 'could indicate possible economic weakening,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, construction minister. An overall drop in construction orders of 0.4 per cent during the month contrasted with a 4.7 per cent increase in the first five months of the year. While industrial orders nose-dived in May, house builders reported a more comforting 4.3 per cent rise in demand and civil engineers claimed an 8 per cent increase, according to a ministry review. According to a separate study from the HDB industry association, total May orders fell a real 0.9 per cent - the first year-on-year decline since March 1991. The figures underline the loss of confidence throughout west German industry, most of which is still waiting for the forecast upturn in foreign demand. Unemployment among western construction workers is now around 9 per cent, compared with 6 per cent overall. Meanwhile, the building boom in the east continues. Total construction orders were up 77 per cent in May compared with a year earlier. The increase has slowed since the 89 per cent rise in March.</p>

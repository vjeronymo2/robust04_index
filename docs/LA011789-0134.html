			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BAKKER DENIES GUILT IN PTL CASE  </P> <P> Former PTL leader Jim Bakker pleaded innocent today to federal charges of  diverting millions of dollars in donations from his followers and using the  money to support his lavish life style.  </P> <P> "I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment," Bakker said  after the arraignment. He made no comment during the hearing, but defense  attorney George T. Davis asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor to impose a gag  order in the case after reading aloud parts of an interview with a bankruptcy  judge who called Bakker a "sawed-off little runt" and "a thief." Taylor took  the motion under advisement.  </P></p>

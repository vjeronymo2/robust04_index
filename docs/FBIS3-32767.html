			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated on 7 February  that if the United States applies trade sanctions against  Brazil, it will not be due to the Senate's delay in approving  Draft Law No. 115/93 that regulates industrial property in  Brazil.    According to the minister, the two countries are no longer  working on the basis that the law will be approved by 28  February, the date with which the United States is working to  decide whether it begins a policy of retaliation.    Amorim on 7 February met in Itamaraty with Science and  Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas; Industry, Commerce, and  Tourism Minister Elcio Alvares; and Culture Minister Luis  Roberto do Mascimento e Silva. Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao,  president of the Industrial Property National Institute (INPI  [Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial]); Paulo Tarso  Flecha, ambassador to Washington; and his colleague, Jose Arthur  Denot Madeiros, who last week headed a meeting with the U.S.  Government.    The meeting was held on 6 February in order to discuss  government ideas regarding the topics discussed in Washington.  The foreign minister's evaluation indicates that the meeting  with the North Americans was a failure. "There was progress in  the aspect of wanting to reach an agreement regarding the points  that merit a more profound study," he said. Amorim said it  would be "easy" to say that there is not a risk that sanctions  will be applied, but he considers as "reasonable" the  expectation that the United States will close the case on 28  February. The minister is still considering whether he will  travel to Washington to give the negotiations a political jolt.    According to one of the participants in yesterday's meeting,  it will be difficult to reach an agreement between the two  countries. The points of disagreement surpass the points on  which there is agreement. During a news conference on 7  February, the minister himself cited just one point that the two  countries have in common: The computer program software  [preceding word in English] must be protect by authorship rights  like literary works. The major disagreement lies in the fact  that the text concerning intellectual property contained in the  GATT's Uruguayan Round Accord, which closed in December, is  ambiguous" [no beginning quotation mark as published].    Thus, for example, Brazil understands that the GATT's text  considers that a patent can only be exploited when the product  is manufactured locally. But the United States feels the  opposite -- that the patent can be exploited through imports  without the obligation of manufacturing the product patented in  the country.    Another disagreement refers to parallel imports: The United  States wants the patent holder to have the right to block  parallel imports, in other words, those imports that are made  without the authorization of the patent holder. The Uruguay  Round Accord does not mention this point, but the amendment the  Brazilian Government intends to send to the Senate restricts the  scope of the type of patent protection the United States wants  because parallel imports would only be possible between member  countries of a common market or based on international  agreements such as Mercosur. This means, for example, that a  person in Argentina who has the license for a product with the  patent holder living in the United States could supply the  product in a parallel form to Brazil without the patent holder's  direct authorization.    There is also disagreement regarding the "pipeline"  [preceding word in English], or transitory protection. The  United States wants a "pipeline" [preceding word in English]  that protects products already patented in other countries and  already being commercialized for the same period of time for  which the products are patented in the country of origin. The  government is going to suggest an amendment to Draft Law No.  115/93 that will authorize the protection of the "pipeline"  [preceding word in English] only for those patents that have  been registered abroad, but not for products that already are  being commercialized.    The Uruguayan Round text does not clearly define the state  of  microorganisms and living beings, but the United States  considers that they should be patentable, giving as examples the  super tomato that has been developed in a laboratory and the  Harvard University rat that has been genetically altered [rato  transgenico de Harvard], which is used to test products against  mammary cancer.    The draft bill indicates that Brazil's position is that of  granting a patent only for microorganisms (not living beings)  that are used in industrial processes.    The Brazilian Government is trying to close the gap between  the two countries' positions. Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de  Lima will continue to be Brazil's contact with the U.S.  Government. He departed for Washington on 7 February.    Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PA [Brazilian Democratic  Movement  Party-Para State]) is the new rapporteur for the industrial  property draft bill. He will try to present his argument on 16  February to the Senate's Economic Affairs Committee.</p>

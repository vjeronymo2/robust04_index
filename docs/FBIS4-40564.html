			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia and Switzerland are  interested in seeing the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE) play a "central and increasingly important role  on the continent", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said  at a press conference today. He was summing up the results of  the talks held with Switzerland's head of federal department of  foreign affairs Flavio Cotti in Moscow today. The head of the  Russian Foreign Ministry and his Swiss counterpart signed a  protocol on cooperation between foreign policy departments of  the two countries.    Andrey Kozyrev called Bern's stand on international issues  "responsible and constructive". He noted that the Russian  foreign policy has been rid of "not only of the ideology  syndrome, but of the complex of gigantomania as well". Kozyrev  emphasised: In Moscow we have "learnt to value a partner, even  if it seems to be a small country." "Switzerland, which is  situated in the very centre of Europe, is our reliable friend  and partner", he said, ascertaining that bilateral relations are  quite intensively developing in all directions, including  economic". The Russian foreign minister also noted personal  friendly relations which he had established with Flavio Cotti  during the head of the Russian foreign department's first  official visit to Switzerland in 1992.    The Russian minister said that during today's talks they  discussed regional problems. Kozyrev highly praised activities  of Swiss diplomat and U.N. secretary-General's special envoy in  Georgia Edouard Brunner. He called the latter's peace efforts  an "example of concrete participation in settling the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict together with Russia."    Flavio Cotti thinks that Russia's peacemaking activities,  naturally within the framework of international decisions, are  in common interests". According to him, envoy Brunner also  shares this conviction. The Swiss head of department of foreign  affairs said that he agrees to Brunner's mission in Georgia  being extended to an additional period, and he had recently  spoken about it to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in  Geneva. Taking into consideration the situation in Georgia, we  are of the view that Brunner's mandate will be more directed  towards organizational, legal and institutional issues. Besides  this, in Cotti's opinion, it concerns the continuation of the  traditionally peculiar to Switzerland diplomatic activities of  mediation and rendering good services.</p>

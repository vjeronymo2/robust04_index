			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Doug Moe Jr., formerly a Denver Nuggets' assistant coach under his father, sued  the first black owners of a major sports franchise, claiming he was fired  because he is white.  </P> <P> The civil complaint against the Denver Nuggets Limited Partnership alleges the  "acts in terminating were without cause and were motivated, in part, by  consideration of race."  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed in Denver District Court alleges that the firing constituted  breach of contract because the younger Moe received oral assurances he would be  signed to a new one-year contract worth $80,000 for this season.  </P> <P> The Nuggets have since hired Paul Westhead as coach and Jim Boyle as an  assistant. Both are white.  </P></p>

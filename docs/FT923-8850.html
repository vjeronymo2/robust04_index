			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: The Germans who opposed Hitler - Zara Steiner reviews two books about internal resistance to the Nazis and why it came to nothing GERMAN RESISTANCE AGAINST HITLER by Klemens von Klemperer Oxford Pounds 40, 587 pages THE UNNECESSARY WAR by Patricia Meehan Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 18.99, 441 pages KLEMENS von Klemperer has produced a superbly-researched study of the attempts of the German resistance to find allies abroad before and during the Second World War. It is the product of prodigious work in the archives of many nations, and of interviews with the families and contacts of the main protagonists. The focus is very much on the conservative opposition to Hitler: men such as Goerdeler, von Moltke, von Trott, Bonhoeffer and other resistors in the army, foreign office and churches. Little is said about the workers' resistance or the 'resistance in exile' except where the paths of the conservatives crossed these other opponents of the regime. It is a book which fully deserves a place alongside Peter Hoffman's still-important The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945 (1979). As the respected historian of German pre-war conservatism, the author brings to his task a deep understanding of the courage and vision, but also the weaknesses and limitations, of the conservative Widerstand - a term that carries a very special meaning within the German context. Von Klemperer's feelings about the failure of the Allies to respond to the appeals of the resistance give this book its central thesis, but does so without compromising its historical purpose. There was no unified or mass resistance movement in Germany. The burden of opposition fell on individuals, men and women relying on their consciences, reinforced through friendships and contacts with other like-minded people. The patriotic rebels carried a difficult inheritance. Most, especially those of the older generation, were shaped by the ideas of their country's Bismarckian and imperial past. Few had been supporters of Weimar and many had shared Hitler's expansionist goals. No British government could have accepted the hegemonial claims of this older opposition generation, but even the younger activists took time to free themselves of older ideas and assumptions. It was only in 1943 that Adam von Trott - whose anti-Nazi role von Klemperer fully and convincingly vindicates in a most balanced assessment of this key figure's controversial wartime career - began to retreat on the question of Germany's territorial claims in the east. It is a tribute to the author's professionalism that he never waivers from his intention to explain what happened and not what should have happened. This is a study in failure. The resistors, many in positions of considerable influence, could not stiffen the British back before the war. Their attempts, during the 'phoney war,' to arrange the conditions for a coup and the terms of a post-Nazi territorial settlement came to naught. Their ceaseless efforts to press their case for Allied recognition of the 'other Germany' ended in the unsuccessful attempt on Hitler's life in 1944, a desperate move intended to show that the resistors could take decisive steps. One can praise this book highly without agreeing with its conclusions. Much of the writer's material shows why the British and Americans were chary about collaborating with representatives of the German opposition. The ambiguities in their positions, the absence of coherent plans and, above all, the lack of mass support would have precluded any deal even if the conspirators had found more persuasive Allied backers. This study does not prove that the resistors, with some exceptions, really grasped what had happened in Germany. Even Goerdeler's 1944 paper pointing to 'a union of all European national states' shows the degree to which the pre-war conditioning of the old elites persisted. The responsibility of the western powers for the war can hardly be compared, pace Alan Taylor, with the 'unscrupulous policies' of the German dictatorship. Von Klemperer feels that 'unconditional surrender' was a catastrophic war aim and that the Allies' policy of 'absolute silence' was not only a personal disaster for the resistors but a costly error of judgment that prolonged the conflict. Would stronger Allied support have facilitated a coup before July 1944 and shortened the war? Any answer must be based on conjecture, but the possibility of success was not high and the kind of Germany that might have emerged if the war had not been pursued raises uncomfortable questions. Patricia Meeham's account should have complemented von Klemperer's study. She has used UK cabinet and Foreign Office papers to condemn the indifference of the British authorities in the face of the efforts of the anti-Nazi opposition. Even allowing for the more general audience for which this book was written, it cannot compare with the von Klemperer volume, either in coverage or in depth of insight. Meeham pays little attention to the reasons why there might have been honest doubts in London about the German opposition. She repeatedly uses too broad a brush-stroke in painting the Whitehall scene, ignoring the divisions in the cabinet after Godesberg. Such qualifications do not apply to the last chapter of this book and the post-war Foreign Office attempt to bury the role of the German opposition. There is no defence for the individual and institutional attempt to discredit the few who should have been honoured. Even the usually magnanimous von Klemperer singles out Vansittart for the sharpest condemnation. What can be said to justify Wheeler-Bennett's comment on the consequences of the July plot: 'The Gestapo and the SS have done us an appreciable service in removing a selection of those who would undoubtedly have posed as 'good Germans' after the war . . ?' No one will doubt, after reading these two books, that the Foreign Office's effort to suppress the truth has failed totally.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / EC tightens cosmetic test rules: Mixed reception for compromise over animal trials COSMETICS manufacturers in the European Community will be banned from testing their products on animals from January 1, 1998, ministers agreed yesterday - but only if alternative testing methods have been developed. The accord was welcomed by the industry as a sensible compromise, but immediately attacked by European animal rights campaigners for not going far enough. Mr Chris Fisher of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection said: 'The council's decision is a cruel deception: it looks like a ban, but it is not.' The European parliament added proposals for a total ban to a more general directive on the free movement of cosmetics in June. Before yesterday's meeting of consumer affairs ministers, only Denmark and Germany supported the amendment. Other countries seemed worried that a ban might disadvantage companies competing against non-EC manufacturers not subject to a ban, or exporting to countries which insist on animal testing. But ministers yesterday rallied round the compromise proposed by Britain, which holds the EC presidency. Under this, the Commission would take the advice of a technical committee and could propose an extension of the deadline by at least two years if acceptable alternative testing methods had not been developed before January 1, 1997. The directive is quite narrowly drawn. It applies only to cosmetics, not to pharmaceuticals in general, and it would not restrict imports from non-EC countries of products tested on animals. But Mr Karel Van Miert, consumer affairs commissioner, hailed the compromise as the first step towards a wider ban on animal testing, which he hoped would be taken up beyond the Community. Mr Robert Vanhove, secretary general of Colipa, the European cosmetics industry federation, said he was sure that the industry would have developed alternatives to animal testing for eye and skin irritation by the 1998 deadline. Alternatives to less important tests could take 10 or 20 years to develop, he added. Alice Rawsthorn adds from Paris: An outright ban on animal testing would have little direct effect on the cosmetics industry, because most leading manufacturers have phased out such experimentation in recent years. This change of strategy was prompted partly by consumer concern and partly because the industry realised that legislative curbs were inevitable. The major manufacturers have also responded to the competitive pressure from such companies as the UK's Body Shop, which has won a significant market share because of environmentally-responsible policies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  (FMLN) stated that the time is not yet right to take El  Salvador's name off the list of countries under UN scrutiny with  regard to human rights violations. According to FMLN Deputy  Coordinator Marcos Jimenez, the report by independent UN  Observer Pedro Nikken is an indication that an evident decline  in respect for human life persists in the country. "The report  stresses activities by death squads" and calls attention to the  fact that details with respect to the investigations into the  murder of several FMLN activists including former commanders  Francisco Velis, Eleno Castro and Mario Lopez are still not  known.    According to Jimenez, the government is seeking, at any  cost,  to have the country's name taken off the list of countries under  UN scrutiny. However, Nikken's report has put the Alfredo  Cristiani administration on the spot. He added that that is why  they are attempting to downplay the content of Nikken's report  by saying that he did not come to the country. They also point  out that he based his report on affidavits by several local  organizations without on- site verification, "which is a  shameless lie since it was the government's officials themselves  who prevented Nikken from entering the country."    On the other hand, FMLN spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano  expressed confidence that the International Forum for Culture  and Peace, which is scheduled to start tomorrow, will contribute  to accelerating the peace process. He added that the event must  help overcome delays that are taking place now with respect to  issues such as land distribution, the reintegration program, the  National Civilian Police (PNC), and the justice system. He also  described the arrival of Brian Atwood, representative of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as "a way of prompting  the Salvadoran Government not to commit fraud during the March  elections." Finally, Medrano referred to a trip to New York by  an FMLN delegation that includes Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador  Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno, who are expected to meet with UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.</p>

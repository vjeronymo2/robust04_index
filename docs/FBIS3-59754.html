			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  A. Overview </H5>   As Japan's economy and society evolve and change,  agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and farming and fishing  villages face issues such as demonstrating highly productive  capabilities that can accurately answer diverse consumer needs;  securing local workers in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries;  regional activation; and the formation of attractive regional  societies.    On the other hand, the management of Japan's overall  finances  involves dealing with even more thorough expenditure estimates.    Given such a situation, the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry  and Fisheries (MAFF) re-examined its system and policies along  the lines of "Trends in Government Policies on New Foodstuffs,  Agriculture, and Farming Villages," which pointed out the trends  in policy developments geared toward the new age of the 21st  century, and formulated its FY93 budget from the viewpoint of  steadily implementing new policies in stages. General account  expenditures in FY93 for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries  amount to &yen;3.3855 trillion, including the agriculture,  forestry, and fishery budgets of the Prime Minister's Office and  the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Health and  Welfare.    In that the Expenses for Promotion of Agriculture, Forestry  and Fishery S&amp;T are &yen;73.0 billion, which is an increase  of  3.9&percnt; over that of FY92.    The following describes the MAFF budget in terms of the main  policies.  <H3>  B. Implementation of R&amp;D To Cope with Important Policy  Issues </H3>   In order to cope with important policy issues relating to  agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the MAFF will implement  research that deals with improvements in agricultural  productivity, diversification and sophistication of consumer  needs, and global environmental and tropical agriculture  problems.  <H5>  1. R&amp;D for Improvements in Agricultural Productivity </H5>   The MAFF will implement new types of regional research  involving "technology development for rationalizing regionally  managed agriculture." This research will entail the  comprehensive and systematic development of technology to cope  with the problems directly facing the regions. The objective is  to make practical the innovative technology needed for  large-scale, high-productivity agriculture.    The MAFF will also conduct surveys for building a research  strategy aimed at the development of future agricultural  machinery and the establishment of agricultural technology  adapted to that.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Development of Methods for Planning Agricultural Village  Activation by Utilizing Regional Resources </H3>   (1) Summary    Depopulation and the percentage of elderly people are  increasing in the regions between mountains because of the poor  living and crop production conditions. In these regions more and  more farms are being abandoned, and there is concern about the  collapse of the farming-village society. In order to activate  such regions, the regional resources of the villages must be  utilized to the fullest extent. To that end, this effort will  help clarify the special nature of regional resource utilization  processes and improve the methods of quantifying the economic  value of those resources. Furthermore, based on international  comparisons with regional activation in advanced countries, the  MAFF will formulate methods to plan the appropriate utilization  of regional resources and management subjects, develop limited  expense burden management methods, and contribute to formulating  farming-village activation plans in cities, towns, and villages.    (2) Contents of the Research    1) Clarify the special nature of regional resource  utilization processes and improve the methods of quantifying the  economic value of those resources    2) Investigate the applicability in Japan of advanced  countries' regional resource utilization methods and management  plans    3) Develop appropriate regional resource utilization  plans and management methods  <H3>  4. Elucidation of Crop Hardening Mechanisms in Severely Cold  Environments </H3>   (1) Summary    In the main crops of cold regions (pasture grasses, grains),  damage due to winter freezes and heavy snows becomes the  greatest hindrance to expanding planting and stable production,  and the development of techniques for improving those crops'  capacity for surviving the winter is desired. By elucidating at  the substance level the mechanisms by which plants acquire the  resistance to make it through the winter (hardening), this  effort will contribute to the development of techniques that  will be the basis for promoting agriculture in very cold  regions, e.g., techniques for improving crops' ability to  withstand freezing, the cultivation of varieties with a higher  ability to withstand freezing, and the introduction of new crops.

Elucidating the Causes of and Predicting Future  Fluctuations in Vegetable Supply and Demand </H3>   (1) Summary    In recent years the prices of vegetables have fluctuated  wildly because of the compound effects of the weakening of the  production base due to labor shortages and the aging of the  farming community, direct sales of produce from the producing  areas and other changes in the distribution structure, and  weather disasters. This effort is to clarify the ways that  producing areas should cope with the situation, based on  consumer needs, the changes in distribution and market  structures, and the planting trends in producing areas with  labor shortages. Furthermore, the MAFF will clarify the causes  of fluctuations in demand, including climate fluctuations;  develop models to predict fluctuations in the demand for main  vegetables; and contribute toward proposing new government  policies for stable supply and demand.    (2) Contents of the Research    1) Clarifying the changes in vegetable production and  distribution structures, and how producing regions should cope  with those changes    2) Development of methods for predicting fluctuations in  vegetable supply and demand  <H3>  6.

Nevertheless, because wooden  multiple dwellings have problems, such as a lack of  soundproofness, this research will involve developing hybrid  materials in which concrete, rubber, plastic, etc., are  incorporated into wood for the purposes of soundproofness  similar to that of concrete, heat storing characteristics for  energy conservation, and safety in housing geared toward elderly  people. Furthermore, the MAFF will formulate structural systems  and design guidelines for using those materials and will  establish the basic technology for next-generation  wooden-construction housing.    (2) Contents of the Research    1) Development of basic technology for hybridized  soundproof wooden materials    2) Development of hybridized heat-storing materials and  technology for improving housing safety    3) Development of hybrid structures by integrating the  techniques for heat storing, soundproofing, and improving the  safety of housing.  <H3>  7.

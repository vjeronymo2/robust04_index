			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Letters from Alistair Cooke - Sport Only two sorts of sports reporting really impress me. The first comes from the committed expert, steeped in the subject and communicating passion and depth of knowledge to his audience. The prose may be lumpy and the metaphor ugly, but almost every word contributes to the story behind the story. Read, say, Captain Mark Phillips' regular columns on eventing and you will quickly appreciate two things: that the six-time Badminton winner is more comfortable in a saddle than at a keyboard, and that what he doesn't know about horse trials isn't worth knowing. The second type of reporting is rarer. It flows from naturally gifted writers who have an intuitive affinity for the tides and eddies of specific sports. Glance at Norman Mailer's pieces on American boxing in the 1960s, or the work of the black Marxist historian C L R James on West Indian cricket, and the quality is obvious. Last week I inadvertently opened a Christmas present a day or two early and made a stunning discovery. It was a collection of sports pieces by Alistair Cooke, scarcely known in this field of endeavour. But its quality puts him up there with Mailer or James. For those who have been living on Mars, Cooke's weekly Letter from America has been broadcast by BBC radio since 1945. Its elegant phrases, honeyed delivery and folksy insights reach Britain and 51 other countries. I have no audience figures but suspect that, like the King James Bible, Letter from America is nowadays revered but seldom listened to. Perhaps Cooke should have stayed on the back pages. For 25 years he was also a newspaperman covering US sport, among other things, for The Times and then The Guardian. Here is Cooke describing the savagery of the 1951 fight at Madison Square Garden when Sugar Ray Robinson regained the world middleweight championship from Randolph Turpin. Reading it, one should remember that just 10 days earlier the young boxer George Flores had been killed fighting in the same ring. 'Last night Sugar Ray Robinson, tiring to the point of panic before the concrete insensibility of Turpin's massive flesh,' wrote Cooke, 'wrung everything he had from a brave heart, fought from his fingertips, and at last had Turpin helpless against the ropes, his arms by his thighs, his stubborn body reeling back and forth like a badly beaten bull when the flags go in. 'I have never seen a human being receive so much punishment with such dumb bravery. For almost a whole minute Robinson crashed and shot and pounded on him until his head sagged from one side to the other with the flopping rhythm of a broken pendulum.' It might be argued that violent melodrama is easy to describe. But Cooke also had the subtlest of touches, mocking the shamefully rigged fight in 1953 that gave Rocky Marciano a two-minute knockout over his lacklustre opponent. 'Jersey Joe Walcott sat down on the mat in Chicago last night, cocked his head to hear the referee call a count of 10, and then got up and went home, complaining he had been robbed. It was never quite clear in the confusion exactly who had been robbed .. 'There is no boo like the boo of a man who has paid Dollars 50 for two minutes of aimless shuffling. When the referee hoisted Marciano's arm and the bell rang, all the tired trans-continental aeroplane passengers, the preening celebrities, and the boys who had traded a week's baseball tickets for a seat against the skyline, bared their teeth and let loose like wounded hyenas.' In his introduction to the book, Cooke gives one to understand that, for him, sports reporting was a light-hearted diversion from the realities of the Cold War in the America of Eisenhower and Truman. Cooke's world was the White House and the minutiae of international politics. But his personal absorption in - first - fishing and then golf and tennis, provided a perceptive view of the big events. 'I have come to feel a deep, unspoken pity for people who have no attachment to a single sport, almost as sorry for them as I am for teetotallers,' he writes in his introduction. His own passion for golf has been known to creep into more than the odd radio epistle, but Cooke's reports from the frontline of the major tournaments were hitherto unknown to me. In 1965 he was at Bellerive Country Club, Missouri, covering Gary Player's play-off win over Kelvin Nagle to take the US Open. Cooke's report centred on the intensity with which Player scrutinised every lie 'like a laboratory technician with a blood sample'. As a hot afternoon under the mid-western sun ground on, Cooke described the breathless concentration shown by an extraordinarily focused Player: 'And so into the twilight he pondered his iron shots for minutes on end, climbed hills and knolls and stood on his head to gauge the break of the green, lined up a 2ft putt from the pin and the apron - and back again - and picked up every dewdrop or hint of fuzz in between. Never did hypochondria reap such a rich reward.' Just reading that made me hold my breath, as if I had been alongside Cooke on the parched fairways of Bellerive. His wry humour at the expense of his beloved golf is even more enjoyable. This is from Cooke's brief cod-history of the game, in a passage explaining why the king tried, in 1457, to ban it: 'James did not recognise what every other Scot knew in his bones: that golf was just what the Scottish character had been searching for, for centuries. Namely, a method of self-torture disguised as a game ..' The emblem on the necktie of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews - the Vatican of golf - shows St Andrew himself bearing the saltire cross, on which he was to be stretched before he was crucified. 'Only the Scots,' wrote Cooke, 'would have thought of celebrating a national game with the figure of a tortured saint.'

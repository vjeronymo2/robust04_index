			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Mogadishu's main water supply plant switched under UN deal Mogadishu's main water supply plant was switched on yesterday - after a three-month shutdown - under a United Nations deal that will give Somali gunmen who were guarding it on-the-job training as plumbers and mechanics, Reuter reports from Afgoi, Somalia. Supplies will start reaching the capital in about 48 hours, where priority will be given to hospitals, feeding centres for refugees and public standpipes until fuller service is restored, said Mr Peter Schumann, representative of the United Nations Development Programme. Mr Schumann spent eight weeks negotiating a deal to reopen the plant, which in essence involved convincing gunmen demanding a dollar ransom for not looting it to accept on-the-job training instead.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF WE REALLY WANT TO COME UP AS WINNERS, WE'D BEGIN TO CURB OUR LOTTERY FEVER  </P> <P> With the national media feeding the frenzy, people flew in from all over  America to gamble on Pennsylvania's $115-million record-setting jackpot, the  biggest since Illinois set its $69-million record 12 days earlier.  </P> <P> "I'll be rich tomorrow," a postal worker tells a reporter after standing in  line three hours to buy her tickets.  </P> <P> Whatever the long, snaking queues and 500 ticket-per-second sales have to say  about our national condition, it isn't good. Lotteries, once the peculiar  blight of impoverished Third World countries, are mushrooming across 28 states  -- even as the U.S. savings rate sinks to the lowest in the industrialized  world.  </P> <P> Why this lottery craze, now? Sheer materialism, fed by media hype? Lack of  individual or national purpose? Erosion of the work ethic? There's no one  answer. But players for the Pennsylvania jackpot did repeatedly tell  interviewers they'd use the loot, if they won, for a house. Until the 1970s,  the American dream -- and practice -- was to work hard, save weekly, then make  the down payment on your own home. Now peoples' hopes get boiled down to  million-to-one odds. Perhaps our national standard of living is plummeting  faster than we realize.  </P> <P> States used to treat gambling as a faintly tainted activity, at best. No  longer. Now it's the states' silver bullet, a substitute for politically  dangerous taxes. States are hooked, like their gambling citizens. A decade ago,  less than $2 billion worth of lottery tickets were sold nationwide; states  netted $730 million. But last year, Americans bought more than $15 billion  worth of lottery tickets. Net revenue soared to $5.8 billion. New Jersey and  California may soon net $1 billion each.  </P> <P> So the money is getting deadly serious. And the lottery rash keeps spreading. A  last bastion, the South, is now crumbling. Florida and Virginia recently  succumbed; Louisiana and Georgia are teetering.  </P> <P> Lotteries have become a huge, regressive, debilitating tax -- especially on  lower-income people. Statewide sales of more than $100 per adult per year are  commonplace, meaning that hundreds of thousands of individuals are spending  more than $1,000 on the tickets. A study in New Jersey found that more than  one-third of families that live in poverty at under $10,000 a year spend  one-fifth of their income on lotteries.  </P> <P> If lotteries were a harmless form of entertainment, who could oppose them? But  they can become an addiction. "We're building a nation of gamblers," says  Arnold Wexler, executive director of New Jersey's Council on Compulsive  Gambling. Buying a state lottery ticket is many people's first brush with  gambling -- a potentially "devastating illness that takes away your whole  life," says Wexler, a compulsive gambler who kicked the habit 21 years ago.  </P> <P> Lottery-driven gambling might indeed become the national addiction of the '90s,  as serious as alcohol, drug abuse and cigarette smoking.  </P> <P> So what do we do other than turn the wheel of history back to 1964 when New  Hampshire unleashed the first state lottery of the 20th Century?  </P> <P> A huge scandal, like the corruption that killed Louisiana's lottery in 1894,  might dampen, even kill off today's craze. Short of that, seven stopgap steps  come to mind:  </P> <P> First, curb the outrageous $400-million-a-year lottery ad campaigns that states  finance and countenance. A billboard in a Chicago ghetto reads: "This could be  your ticket out." A New York TV ad, cited by the Citizens League in Minnesota,  showed a mother telling her daughter that she should stop striving for a  scholarship because Mom's buying lottery tickets. An Illinois ad showed a man  scoffing at people investing in savings bonds, saying that he's investing in  the lottery and that it's the only way he'll be a millionaire.  </P> <P> Lottery ads should be banned. The media hypes the games enough -- for free.  Short of that, state-sponsored ads should conform to some minimal standards of  truth telling, noting the odds against winning, and warning that gambling can  become addictive.  </P> <P> Second, the states ought to print warnings about compulsive gambling directly  on the tickets (as we now insist for cigarette packaging).  </P> <P> Third, state lotteries should funnel more cash into treatment programs for the  addicts their own public gambling help create. Reserving a minimal 1% of New  Jersey's lottery and casino revenues, for example, would create a $8  million-a-year treatment fund, compared to the measly $275,000 the state spends  now.  </P> <P> Fourth, cap the size of jackpots. They have a spiraling effect, drawing more  and more people, siphoning off more and more cash needed for family budgets and  education and savings.  </P> <P> Fifth, limit the spread of lottery outlets. An example of today's abuse:  California has started putting mini-lottery terminals in checkout lines of some  supermarkets.  </P> <P> Sixth, stop pretending that education, old folks' programs or state  economic-development programs really benefit from lottery sales. Lottery  funding just supplants other necessary state appropriations. It encourages  people to think that in government, as in gambling itself, you can get what you  want for nothing.  </P> <P> Final suggestion: If you hear anyone seriously propose a national lottery, tell  him the facts.  </P></p>

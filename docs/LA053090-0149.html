			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GABONESE LEADER KIDNAPED DURING WALK NEAR HOME  </P> <P> The president of the Gabonese National Assembly was kidnaped while taking a  stroll around his neighborhood, his family said today.  </P> <P> The kidnaping Tuesday evening of Augustin Boumah, 63, a leading member of the  ruling Gabonese Democratic Party, came as the army consolidated its control of  the petroleum center of Port Gentil after a week of anti-government riots and  fighting in which two people were killed and 14 others seriously injured.  </P> <P> Boumah's family said he had gone for a walk in his Libreville neighborhood when  an unspecified number of armed men took him prisoner. No one has claimed  responsibility for the kidnaping and the government has made no comment on the  disappearance.  </P> <P> Opposition leader Joseph Redjambe's death in a Libreville hotel room last week  sparked riots across the Central African country and nearly halted oil  production. Redjambe was found with syringe marks on his abdomen and officials  said the Ivory Coast woman he met there has disappeared.  </P></p>

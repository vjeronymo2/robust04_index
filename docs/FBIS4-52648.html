			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["KCF Slams S. Korean Puppets' Nuclear Development" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean  puppets would face a stern judgement by history, if they persist  in the development of nuclear weapons, going against the  aspirations of the times and the nation, warned Kang Yong-sop,  chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Christians  Federation [KCF].    In a statement on Wednesday he denounced the despicable  criminal acts of the South Korean puppet clique in stepping up  nuclear development on a full scale while spreading a rumour of  "nuclear suspicion" against the North.    The statement says:    The Kim Yong-sam clique's groundless slanders on us over the  fictitious "nuclear problem" are nothing but a cunning and  brazen trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home  and abroad and step up the development of nuclear arms behind  the scene.    This is well illustrated by the fact that the traitor Kim  Yong-sam told a "press conference" some time ago that "the North  has no nukes", thus admitting of his own accord that his  clique's row hitherto over the "nuclear development" of the  North was a plot to do harm to the fellow countrymen and conceal  the truth behind their own development of nuclear arms.    It is because of the partiality of the International Atomic  Energy Agency that the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms  development has long been out of the world people's concern, the  statement notes, adding: The agency must draw a serious lesson  from such grave consequences of the double standard which it has  applied under the baton of the United States, losing  independence, and restore impartiality, though belatedly.    The South Korean puppets must ponder over catastrophic  consequences to be entailed by their criminal nuclear arms  development, eliminate at once the heavy water reactor and  multipurpose research reactor which have been confirmed to be  reactors for developing nuclear weapons, stop the development of  a fast breeder reactor and nuclear arms development, the  statement stresses.</p>

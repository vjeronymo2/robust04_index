			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREPARATIONS FOR QUAKES  </P> <P> One of the lingering questions that arose out of the rubble in San Francisco is  how much preparation is enough. The thornier question, being asked in Orange  County and throughout the state, is how much should be spent to prepare for a  disaster that is predictable only in that -- some day -- it will happen.  </P> <P> The county's Board of Supervisors must weigh earthquake preparedness against  serious obligations for health care, roads and other vital services. When the  earth is quiet, or only issues an occasional palm-shaking tremor, it is easy to  put earthquake preparedness behind daily pressing needs. The Bay Area  earthquake should serve as a timely reminder that the county needs to put a  high priority on readiness for the major quake that seismologists tell us will  hit Southern California. Whether that will be a time of finger-pointing for  things not done, or a time to thank planners for thinking ahead, is up to  today's board.  </P> <P> Several years ago, the board, to its credit, ordered a study that detailed a  $12-million preparedness plan. It voted in 1987 to go ahead with $3 million  worth of the plan, but it did not follow through with adequate funding or even  check to see the progress. As a result, less than half of the measures have  been carried out by county departments. Still unfunded is $1.6 million for  emergency generators for county buildings that would enable vitally needed  services to be carried out in the event of a power outage.  </P> <P> County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said last week he assumed the  supervisors knew there wasn't enough money for implementation of the $3-million  plan so he did not bother to include it in budget discussions two years ago.  </P> <P> Parrish was right when he said that it is "not realistic" to spend "all of your  resources getting ready for Judgment Day." And he even was right when he said  that it would be unfair to suggest that Orange County would be ready for such a  quake even if it spent the full $12 million for preparedness. Earthquakes have  a way of humbling even the most ambitious preparedness plans.  </P> <P> But, as the San Francisco quake clearly illustrates, much can be done to be  ready.  </P> <P> Parrish was wrong to let up on the pressure on the supervisors. He should have  kept reminding them of their commitment to finance those things they said were  needed.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the board will re-evaluate the county's preparedness. Now, before  complacency sets in once again, is the time to move forward with the plan  already approved by the board.  </P></p>

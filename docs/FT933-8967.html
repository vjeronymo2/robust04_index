			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: SKF doubles losses but sees improvement SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, said yesterday that losses more than doubled in the first six months, but it noted that its performance had started to improve following rationalisation. The group's loss after financial items for the period was SKr469m (Dollars 58.66m), which was smaller than expected, compared with a SKr194m deficit in the first half of 1992. Sales rose to SKr14.53bn from SKr14.04bn, but adjusted for currency movements and disposals they were down 8 per cent. The group said its second-quarter loss fell to SKr114m from SKr355m in the first quarter due to the drive to cut costs which it launched in 1990. For the same reason, it expects its second-half results to be better than in the first half - providing there is no further deterioration in its markets. The first-half operating loss of SKr66m was aggravated by financial costs of SKr403m, due to the depreciation of the krona and a SKr55m currency exchange loss. In the same 1992 period, the operating loss was SKr46m and financial expenses SKr148m. The group's main bearings and seals business, which depends on the health of the car and engineering industries, recorded a loss of SKr251m, after a first-half 1992 profit of SKr156m. SKF fears the market may not have bottomed in this sector, even though volumes have remained unchanged for the last three quarters. 'The situation is still fragile,' said a spokesman, who highlighted the group's exposure to the recession-hit German market. Weak industrial output in both Germany and France meant SKF recorded a loss of SKr440m in these markets in the first half. The outlook in other markets is brighter, however. In North America, earnings and volumes picked up during the second quarter, while sales in central and South America and Asia Pacific also develop-ed. The company's other main business, Ovako Steel, managed to cut losses to SKr224m from SKr319m amid signs that the demand for special steel products was bottoming out and prices stabilising at low levels. As part of its rationalisation programme, SKF has cut staff by 12,400 since 1990, reduced production by 20 to 25 per cent in response to lower demand, and cut inventory levels by SKr2bn. The payroll has been reduced by 2,000 to 43,000 so far this year. The company's shares rose SKr3 to close at SKr115 yesterday. Lex, Page 14</p>

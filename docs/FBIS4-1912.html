			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that the Chinese Government and people  attach great importance to their relationship with Eritrea.    They also desire to continuously develop friendly bilateral  ties and cooperation together with Eritrea, said Jiang during  talks with visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki here this  afternoon.    Jiang said the time since China and Eritrea established  diplomatic ties has been short, but the relationship has  developed rapidly, adding: "We are satisfied with the smooth  growth of such ties."    He expressed the belief that Isayas' current visit to China  will lay a solid foundation for the enhancement of bilateral  friendship and cooperation and the promotion of such ties to a  new level.    Jiang expressed his appreciation of the "one-China" policy  that the Eritrean Government has pursued and its principled  stand not to establish official relations with Taiwan.    Isayas said though Eritrea and China are far apart  geographically, their friendly ties bring them closer together.    He thanked the Chinese Government and people for their  recognition of Eritrea's independence and the results of its  referendum.    Isayas said that, in the long struggle for independence, the  Eritrean Government and people have always regarded China as  their reliable partner.    Referring to bilateral economic cooperation, Jiang said  China  and Eritrea established diplomatic ties less than one year ago,  but their mutually beneficial cooperation has gradually grown  and shows great potential.    China is willing to become actively involved in Eritrea's  economic reconstruction, he said.    Jiang noted that China is a developing country whose  governmental assistance extended to Eritrea is limited.  However, he said, the offer of assistance is a demonstration of  friendship.    "We place greater importance on conducting diverse non-  governmental and economic cooperations with Eritrea on the basis  of equality, mutual benefit and common development," he said.    Isayas thanked the Chinese Government for its assistance to  Eritrea, adding that his country experienced sufferings from an  extended war. "It is badly needed to rebuild our country," he  said.    He described China's assistance as sincere and being full of  kindness, saying: "We regard this kind of assistance as an  important factor for Eritrea's reconstruction."    Isayas said Eritrea agrees with China's point of view on  actively conducting non-governmental economic cooperation.    Eritrea will concentrate its efforts on cooperation with  Chinese enterprises in every field, he added.    On international issues, Jiang said that the new world  political order should be established on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful co-existence. The core of these  principles is non- interference in other countries' internal  affairs and respecting their peoples' choices of social systems  and the modes for development in accordance with their own  national conditions.    He said that there are no unified political and economic  modes suitable to all countries in the world. One country's  specific political system and means for economic growth can only  be established according to its actual national conditions, he  added.    Jiang stressed that the Chinese experience has shown that  only by taking the development of its economy as its key work  can a newly established country strengthen its political  independence and get rid of its poverty and backwardness.    Isayas said that he agreed with Jiang's view on the  principles of non-interference in other countries' internal  affairs, and that every country's cultural tradition should be  respected.    He said Eritrea attaches great importance to China's  experience and is closely following its tremendous changes,  which he said have inspired the whole continent of Africa,  including Eritrea.    During the talks, the two leaders briefed each other on  their  respective countries' domestic situations.    They agreed that the two sides share identical or similar  views on many major international or regional issues and the  issues on democracy and human rights as well.    After the talks, two agreements between the two governments  were signed. One regards the Chinese Government's providing the  Eritrean Government with loans. The other is a cultural  agreement.    The two presidents attended the signing ceremony.    Prior to the talks, Jiang hosted a solemn ceremony welcoming  Isayas and his party.    This evening, Jiang gave a banquet in honor of Isayas and  his  entourage including Minister of National Defense Mesfin Hagos  and Minister of Trade and Industry Ogbe Abraha.    Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister,  attended the banquet.</p>

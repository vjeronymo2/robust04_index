			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Out of step Sir, With particular reference to the letter from Harold Hughes (January 8/9), could it be that British travellers in European Union states experience frontier crossing difficulties because, unlike all other EU states, Britain has no proper personal identity card system? In the absence of such sensible documents British citizenship or legal status cannot be readily known without constant reference to our passports. It is not the EU at fault; it is Britain that is behind the times, out of step and out of order. Greville Warwick, MCS, Leycester House, 46 Leam Terrace, Leamington Spa CV31 1BQ</p>

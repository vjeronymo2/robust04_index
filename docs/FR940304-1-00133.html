			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 6. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 3.06 quads of energy. This level produces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life-cycle cost savings compared to the base case of $43, with a payback of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.3 years, which is slightly more than one third of the average product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifetime. However, this level causes payback as high as 9.1 years for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes (over 60 percent of product life) and reduces manufacturer short-run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return on equity from 8.6 percent to 5.2 percent, a reduction of almost 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. Also, at this standard level, some classes are assumed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate variable-speed compressors, for which there is not a DOE test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure. The Department believes that the development of such a test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure would be a lengthy process which would probably delay the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the standard for room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners with standard level 5 for room air conditioners. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that standard level 5 for room air conditioners saves a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.22 quads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 353,000 tons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 394,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.18 percent each by the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 181 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons, or as much as 0.18 percent, over the forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years for the representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class and no more than 7.0 years for any class. This standard is at or near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $53 for the representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class. Additionally, the standard is expected to have essentially no impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Water Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of standard levels for water heaters. Table 4&hyph;3 presents the efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels selected for analysis for the four classes of water heaters. Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas storage water heaters each have five efficiency levels that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed, but were paired together to yield the eight combinations shown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. Level 8 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in the engineering analysis for each class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The Queen and tax I seem to recollect that when the Queen agreed voluntarily to pay capital gains tax on her investments, the base values were to be calculated from April 6 1993. Is this correct and, if so, why was a different date chosen from that which applies to her subjects: viz, March 31 1982, plus indexation. April 6 1993 is simply the date from which the voluntary income tax and CGT payments are to be made under the Queen's offer. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke clashes with Lamont over EU cash Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, clashed with his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont in the Commons last night. The exchange came as the government reaffirmed that approval for the bill authorising increased payments to the European Union was a confidence issue. The chancellor's claim that the undoubted benefits flowing from membership, including the single market, justified a bigger British contribution to the European budget was challenged by Mr Lamont. While making it clear that he would not join any rebellion against the bill, Mr Lamont argued that the continuing divisions among Conservative MPs over Europe warranted a policy reassessment. He again contended that this should include 'even withdrawal' from the EU, but reaffirmed his support for the deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, at the Edinburgh European Community summit in 1992. Mr Clarke, who opened the debate on the bill authorising the additional expenditure, told Tory critics and opposition MPs that by voting against it after welcoming the Edinburgh agreement they would be following 'a totally dishonourable course'. He insisted that the cabinet had not resorted to a political 'ploy' in deciding to make approval of the bill a confidence issue. Mr Lamont said it was obvious that any government which entered into undertakings in an international agreement and required money to support it had to seek the authority of the Commons for the additional expenditure. If the House did not vote the money the government would have 'lost the confidence of parliament'. Mr Clarke recalled that only Mrs Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for Billericay, one of the leading Eurosceptics, had criticised the Edinburgh agreement when it was announced. He stressed that it was a British initiative which had resulted in the European Court of Auditors being given increased powers to curb fraud in the EU. Mr Clarke bluntly rejected demands by Tory critics of the bill that no additional funds should be provided to the EU until the government was satisfied about the effectiveness of new procedures for dealing with fraud. He told Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for Tayside North, who highlighted Tory concern over fraud: 'That really will not do.' Mr Clarke said it was normal procedure for the government to seek parliamentary approval for increased expenditure, and for Conservative MPs to support the prime minister whom they had congratulated when the commitment was announced. Britain had joined the EU to increase its influence in the world and add clout to its worldwide policy. He said: 'The Edinburgh deal paid a fair price for those benefits.' He reminded MPs that they had been made aware that Britain's net contribution to the EU budget would eventually exceed Pounds 3bn a year. Mr Lamont maintained that it was the gross and not the net cost which provided the true measure of the cost of Britain's EU membership. He calculated that the gross contribution, minus the rebate negotiated by Baroness Thatcher when prime minister, was Pounds 6bn a year, rising to Pounds 8bn in 1996-97. Mr Lamont said the vast majority of EU expenditure was devoted to projects which would not be chosen by the UK government. He believed Britain needed to redefine its relationship with the EU. If it was not possible to negotiate effective safeguards against further moves towards federalism, the option of withdrawal should be considered. Mr Lamont warned that by making the bill an issue of confidence the impression might be given that the government expected MPs to 'rubber stamp' whatever was agreed at the intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, taunted Mr Major over his failure to open the debate. He said: 'It's rather as if the grand old Duke of York had marched his men up to the top of the hill, made his excuses and then left.' Mr Brown accused the government of seeking a vote of confidence on the eve of the Budget not because the national interest required it but to satisfy the 'imperatives exercised by the bitter feuding inside the Conservative party'.</p>

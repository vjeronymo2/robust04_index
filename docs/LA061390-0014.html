			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: AFTER FOUR YEARS OF WORK, SHE'S THE  ULTIMATE QUIRK IN THE LAW, BAR NONE  </P> <P> Warning: The following item could be harmful to the psychological health of law  school graduates who are burdened by student loans but still cannot pass the  California Bar exam.  </P> <P> The item: Suzanne M. Quirk, 31, just learned that she passed the three-day exam  given this spring.  </P> <P> She passed on her first try. Without ever attending law school.  </P> <P> In mid-1985, Quirk decided to study law with her husband, Charles E. Quirk, a  lawyer who does criminal defense, family matters and personal injury cases.  </P> <P> California is one of only seven states that still allow people to become  lawyers without going to law school.  </P> <P> There are rules, however: The would-be lawyer must study for four years with a  lawyer or judge, submit periodic progress reports and take the "baby bar" after  one year.  </P> <P> Quirk did these things and a few more, too.  </P> <P> Like working full time in her husband's Pacific Beach office and also giving  birth to their first child, Seamus, now 2 1/2.  </P> <P> Within a week of giving birth, Quirk was back at work, answering phones and  doing research. A playpen was set up in the office.  </P> <P> "It got tough sometimes," said Quirk. "Seamus would crawl all over me, and tell  me to put down my book. But I had to keep studying."  </P> <P> Quirk got a degree in speech pathology/audiology from San Diego State  University in 1980. She and her husband will now be law partners.  </P> <P> How rare is Quirk's feat? Very rare.  </P> <P> Even with law school, the bar exam can be a bone crusher. The failure rate  often hovers near 50%.  </P> <P> The 1990 breakdown is not yet available, but only 10 of the 12,117 people who  passed in 1988 and '89 had not gone to law school. Of those 10, only 3 were  first-timers.  </P> <P> Charles Quirk says that near the end of their fourth year of study, his wife  started to argue with him over points of law. Argue and win.  </P> <P> "I knew she was ready," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Trim, a Grin, a Little Chagrin  </P> <P> Name it and claim it.  </P> <P> * Defense attorney James Brosnahan complains bitterly to the judge that  saturation news coverage makes it difficult for Richard T. Silberman to get  justice.  </P> <P> As proof, Brosnahan recalls going to a barber for a trim and instead getting a  lecture on the Silberman case.  </P> <P> Also, as Brosnahan and Silberman were walking downtown, a sassy transient  announced loudly, "Here Comes the Medellin Conspiracy."  </P> <P> * Political consultant Jack Orr has a modest proposal in this month's San Diego  Mensan, the magazine for the high-IQ set.  </P> <P> He suggests that Mensa start rating political candidates in four categories:  Intellectually Qualified, Moderately Intelligent, Intellectually Impaired or  Dumber Than Dirt.  </P> <P> * Professor, heal thyself.  </P> <P> UC San Diego Professor Donald Norman wrote the hardback "The Psychology of  Everyday Things," which discusses why things like VCRs, single-knob shower  fixtures and nuclear plants don't work right.  </P> <P> Norman soon discovered something else that doesn't work right: his book title.  Too academic sounding, maybe.  </P> <P> Now the paperback has been issued with something more salable: "The Design of  Everyday Things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> And Another Thing . . .  </P> <P> Be careful. 2 Live Columnist at work.  </P> <P> * San Diego's water conservation committee meets today to discuss low-flush  toilets.  </P> <P> It's called the "brick-in-the-head" plan.  </P> <P> * The Padres lead the league in an important category: most catchers wearing  earrings.  </P> <P> Both Benito Santiago and backup Mark Parent like jewelry on their lobes. (So  does outfielder Shawn Abner.)  </P> <P> * Channel 8 runs a public service announcement hectoring people to save water.  </P> <P> Then shows a commercial for Mountain Dew with frolickers using thousands of  gallons from high-velocity fire hoses to push an oversize beach ball.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: I've Never Felt This Good or Had This Much.  </P> <P> All this and modesty, too?  </P></p>

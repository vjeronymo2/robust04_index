			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY, CATHEDRAL STILL SPLIT OVER ENTERTAINMENT TAX  </P> <P> The city of Garden Grove and the Crystal Cathedral remain at odds over whether  the city can tax large-scale stage productions such as "The Glory of Christmas"  and "The Glory of Easter" to help finance the arts.  </P> <P> A 15-member Blue Ribbon Committee on the Arts, appointed by the City Council,  is recommending that the council consider a tax on live, commercial  entertainment in halls with more than 500 seats. The two religious pageants,  held in the 3,000-seat Crystal Cathedral, are not mentioned by name in the  report, but according to one panel member they were among the events under  discussion.  </P> <P> Charles Todd, attorney for the Crystal Cathedral, said the State Board of  Equalization has ruled that the "Glories"' have religious significance. Because  "religious significance constitutes a form of worship, the state board held it  was appropriate for the Crystal Cathedral to conduct the pageants on its  property and remain tax exempt," he said.  </P> <P> The question for both the arts committee and the City Council, according to  John Bushman, spokesman for the city, is whether the pageants -- which charge  between $14 and $25 per seat -- are commercial.  </P> <P> "I think that's exactly what they're going to look into," Bushman said,  "whether they would meet our criteria for a commercial enterprise for purposes  of entertainment."  </P> <P> Even if the city decides that the pageants are commercial, Bush said, taxation  is only "a possibility. That doesn't mean we would tax them. . . . We're  looking at step one in an involved process. . . . If they jump to the  conclusion that this is a tax on the Crystal Cathedral, they're off base."  </P> <P> The committee's report is expected to be presented to the City Council early  next month.  </P></p>

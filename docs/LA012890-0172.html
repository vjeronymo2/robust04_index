			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MALONE ELOQUENTLY STATES HIS CASE, SCORING 61 POINTS IN JAZZ VICTORY  </P> <P> He was snubbed by the fans in voting for the NBA All-Star game, and Saturday  night in Salt Lake City, Karl Malone sent a message on the court that he,  rather than the Lakers' A. C. Green, deserved to be in the starting lineup Feb.  11 at Miami.  </P> <P> Malone scored 61 points as the Jazz handed the Milwaukee Bucks their worst  defeat ever, 144-96.  </P> <P> Malone was 21 of 26 from the field and 19 of 23 from the free-throw line in  leading the Jazz to their ninth consecutive victory. He had 18 rebounds, three  steals and two assists in just 33 minutes.  </P> <P> Malone, the NBA's second-leading scorer and fifth-leading rebounder, was not  voted as a starter for the Western Conference in the All-Star game. He  threatened to boycott the game but said later that he would play if he is named  as a reserve.  </P> <P> "Everyone has a sense of pride, but I've had time to think about it and I think  I will go if I'm asked," he said.  </P> <P> And if he is not?  </P> <P> "I can go to Miami, or I can go fishing in Louisiana. Right now, fishing in  Louisiana sounds pretty good to me," he said.  </P> <P> The 61 points was the highest NBA total since Michael Jordan of the Chicago  Bulls scored 61 against the Atlanta Hawks on April 16, 1987. Malone's previous  high was 52 this season against the Charlotte Hornets. He is the 13th player in  NBA history to score 60 or more points in a game.  </P> <P> The 48-point loss surpassed the Bucks' 136-92 loss at Philadelphia on Nov. 16,  1968 for futility.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 125, Washington 101 -- Charles Barkley had 29 points and 18  rebounds and Hersey Hawkins added 28 points at Philadelphia as the 76ers won  their eighth consecutive game.  </P> <P> Washington has lost 17 of its last 18 on the road.  </P> <P> Jeff Malone had 22 points and Bernard King 20 for Washington.  </P> <P> Chicago 110, New Jersey 107 -- Michael Jordan scored 39 points and the Bulls  held off a rally to win at Chicago.  </P> <P> The Nets got 29 points from Chris Morris and 20 from Purvis Short.  </P> <P> New Jersey trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter but chipped away and tied  the game, 101-101, with 2:03 left.  </P> <P> A three-point shot by Scottie Pippen 19 seconds later put Chicago ahead for  good.  </P> <P> New York 110, Denver 96 -- Patrick Ewing scored 12 of his 26 points in the  fourth quarter and Charles Oakley had 25 points as the Knicks broke a five-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> New York, winning at Denver for the first time since 1984, never trailed and  stayed a game in front of Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division.  </P> <P> Detroit 85, Minnesota 83 -- Joe Dumars made his first basket of the second half  with 1:40 to play, snapping a tie and lifting the Pistons over the Timberwolves  at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The expansion Timberwolves have lost nine consecutive games.  </P> <P> Seattle 109, San Antonio 98 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 34 points at Seattle as  the SuperSonics snapped a five-game losing streak with a victory at Seattle.  </P> <P> Seattle guard Sedale Threatt suffered a broken bone in his right hand and will  be out four to six weeks.  </P> <P> Dallas 99, Houston 92 -- Derek Harper scored 21 points and the bench made a  strong contribution at Houston as the Mavericks won their fifth in a row.  </P> <P> Rolando Blackman and Roy Tarpley each scored 18 points for the Mavericks, who  snapped Houston's 10-game home winning streak. Sam Perkins finished with 14  points, including three in the final 38 seconds.  </P> <P> The Dallas bench outscored the Houston reserves, 36-6.  </P> <P> Akeem Olajuwon had 32 points and 20 rebounds for the Rockets.  </P> <P> Atlanta 114, Orlando 96 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 25 points at Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> Moses Malone and Spud Webb each added 20 points for the Hawks, 4-0 against the  Magic.  </P> <P> Reggie Theus had 28 points for Orlando.  </P> <P> Cleveland 91, Indiana 84 -- John Williams scored 22 points, including nine in a  fourth-quarter comeback, as the Cavaliers rallied at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Reggie Miller made two three-point shots to help the Pacers to a 68-63 lead  with 9:41 left, but Cleveland outscored Indiana, 14-2, over the next five  minutes to go ahead, 77-70.  </P> <P> Miller led all scorers with 28 points.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> MORE ROADBLOCKS PLANNED BY POLICE  </P> <P> In the wake of a collision that injured three members of a family, police  announced that sobriety checkpoints will be established every three or four  months.  </P> <P> Sgt. Joe Milazzo said the first roadblock was set up this month on Imperial  Highway east of Beach Boulevard, near the scene of the Oct. 29 accident.  </P> <P> Police said a driver suspected of being under the influence turned left in  front of an oncoming car carrying Edward Gonzalez, 31, his wife, Nina, 26, and  their child, Amoz, 2 1/2.  </P> <P> Gonzales suffered broken ribs and serious injuries to a knee, while his wife  suffered head injuries that have resulted in a continuing paralysis in her  face.  </P> <P> "When she smiles, part of her face doesn't move," Gonzales said. "The doctors  want to do an operation, but we decided not to because there are too many risks  involved."  </P> <P> The two adults were wearing seat belts. The child was strapped into a car seat  and suffered minor scratches. The family was taken to UCI Medical Center by  helicopter.  </P> <P> The other driver was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.  </P> <P> On Nov. 11, a sobriety checkpoint on Imperial Highway resulted in 10 arrests.  For four hours, officers stopped every fourth vehicle, a total of 502 cars.  </P> <P> Milazzo said that two of those arrested were under the influence of both  alcohol and other drugs. A total of 19 people were given field sobriety tests,  he said.  </P> <P> Milazzo said drivers did not object to the roadblock. DAVID F. BURKE  </P></p>

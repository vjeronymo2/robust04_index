			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Peru and Sri Lanka join the IFC stable Peru and Sri Lanka take their places in the IFC's emerging markets investable indices for the first time this week, raising the number of markets covered to 20. The IFC also announced that it intends to issue data on Zimbabwe and China in the new year. Peru's equity market has been one of Latin America's strong performers this year, although some profit-taking in September pulled prices lower. However, the local IBVL index reacted impressively at the start of this week, reaching an historic record high, on improved political prospects. Baring Securities notes that news that the guerrilla group, Shining Path, was willing to negotiate a peace accord with the government of President Alberto Fujimori has lifted sentiment this week. Baring's Latin American research team also report that September inflation data, revealing the lowest monthly rate in 17 years, suggests that the government's target of a ceiling of 40 per cent for the year now seems feasible. Trading in Peru is expected to remain choppy ahead of the referendum on a new constitution later this month. Sri Lanka has shown a healthy 30 per cent gain in dollar terms since the start of the year, indicating, says the IFC, a preference for blue chip stocks. In practice, the index contains only five tradeable stocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                    No. of       Sep 17    % Change      % Change Market             stocks         1993    over week    on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina            (11)       750.10         +5.3         +29.3 Brazil               (44)       221.52         -3.8         +77.2 Chile                (20)       447.28         +1.3          +6.9 Colombia1             (8)       447.73         +1.3         +12.4 Mexico               (58)       700.24         -0.9          +3.6 Peru                  (7)       109.81         +5.8          +9.8 Venezuela2            (8)       505.68         -5.6          -2.7 East Asia South Korea3        (130)        98.20         +2.3          +0.0 Philippines          (11)       191.16         -0.8         +43.2 Taiwan, China4       (76)        78.60         -2.0          +6.5 South Asia India5               (61)        90.68         -1.7          -3.2 Indonesia6           (31)        93.69         -0.3         +59.6 Malaysia             (61)       246.09         +3.7         +50.5 Pakistan7             (8)       229.70         +2.5         +14.7 Sri Lanka             (5)       131.53         -0.3         +31.5 Thailand             (52)       227.15         +1.9         +20.3 Euro/Mid East Greece               (17)       226.21         +3.3         +15.8 Jordan                (5)       165.58         +0.4         +41.7 Portugal             (16)       104.22         -1.6         +35.1 Turkey8              (31)       192.22         +8.3        +187.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Local currency terms                    Sep 17    % Change      % Change Market               1993    over week    on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina      460,278.95         +5.3         +29.6 Brazil      39,250,884.12         +3.7      +1,782.1 Chile              736.48         +1.9         +14.8 Colombia1          686.06         +1.4         +12.2 Mexico             940.98         -0.6          +3.6 Peru               142.93         +6.6         +42.9 Venezuela2       1,120.99         -4.9         +20.1 East Asia South Korea3       104.39         +2.3          +2.6 Philippines        260.89         +0.7         +61.4 Taiwan, China4      78.41         -2.3         +12.4 South Asia India5             100.28         -1.7          +5.0 Indonesia6         107.03         -0.3         +62.7 Malaysia           231.32         +3.6         +46.6 Pakistan7          310.65         +2.5         +34.0 Sri Lanka          140.65         -0.3         +40.7 Thailand           277.75         +2.2         +19.1 Euro/Mid East Greece             359.71         +3.3         +26.3 Jordan             236.40         +0.8         +42.6 Portugal           120.37         -1.4         +54.4 Turkey8          1,093.57         +9.1        +307.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

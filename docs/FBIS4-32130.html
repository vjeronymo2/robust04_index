			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mircea Podina from Washington] </F>   [Excerpts] The visit paid to Washington by National  Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca at the invitation of his U.S.  counterpart, Defense Secretary William Perry, concluded today.  This morning, according to schedule, the Romanian delegation  flew by helicopter to the Quantico Marine Corps base in  Virginia. [passage omitted]    Before leaving Washington, I asked him to draw up a balance  of his visit in the U.S. capital. This is what he said:    [Begin Tinca recording] I leave with the feeling that the  majority of the things I proposed to achieve during this visit  have been accomplished.    First, I managed to convey the messages that had to be  transmitted to the U.S. party regarding the military ties  between Romania and the United States, between the Romanian  Armed Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces, principally regarding  our cooperation within the Partnership for Peace initiative and  regarding security.    Second, I leave with the conclusion that there is certain  readiness of the U.S. party, especially at the Pentagon, to  further relations with Romania on a number of levels. Now, in  the beginning, our cooperation actions might not be too  impressive or spectacular, but their evolution is an undoubted  and serious one, and this will certainly allow us to attain the  goals we set for us.    I also leave with another conclusion, about which I am not  very pleased, namely that Romania is far too little known in the  United States, in Washington, and, especially among the  political and security analysis circles, among the political  analysis circles in the U.S. Congress. For this, I am not  blaming the U.S. party, heaven forbid, and I am not blaming  ourselves either. This is rather meant as an encouragement for  us to do more and in a more organized way to make known our way  of thinking in our relations, because as I have found, there is  certain interest for such relations, so they have to be  disseminated among the U.S. political media and among the  analysis circles there.    The brightest aspect of my visit was the pleasure of handing  over an invitation letter to Defense Secretary William Perry to  visit us in Bucharest. In July, he will make a tour of certain  Eastern European countries, and it is my conviction that  sometime in July he will also come to Bucharest. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Navy's Military Council resolutely  condemns provocations threatening stability in Crimea says a  statement released by the Ukrainian Navy's press service on  Wednesday [11 May].    The document notes that "regrettably, some forces used the  celebrations of the 49th anniversary of the victory in the Great  Patriotic War and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of  Sevastopol for provocations and extremist statements against  Ukraine and its Navy."    "Some admirals and officers of the Black Sea Fleet ever more  loudly voice their readiness to violate the integrity of the  current borders, and the position of the Black Sea Fleet  Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin, who recently said unequivocally  that `the fleet is a power and should not be touched,' makes  them confident of their full impunity," the statement points  out.    The Military Council of the Ukrainian Navy regrets that  "such  a position prevails today in the power structures of Sevastopol  and Crimea."</p>

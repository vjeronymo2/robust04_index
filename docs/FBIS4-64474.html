			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Franz Schoenhuber: "The Media and Political </F> Dogs Are Barking -- The Republikaner Caravan Is Moving On"]    [Text] We know what our position ise. We know that the  old parties need a bogeyman to divert attention from their own  failures. We are convinced that the German people are being  subjected to foreign dictates. There is a historical reason for  this. Never before in history has a nation twice suffered  crushing defeat and humiliation in such a short period of time.  The Old Testament principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a  tooth still applies to Germany.    German politicians have become toothless over the years.  Fear of the media, especially directed from the U.S. East  Coast, has equipped them with an early warning system that  triggers an appropriate response in the event of danger.  Exercises in repentance are the order of the day. If there is  any doubt, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker leads the  prayers. Whoever does not want to follow the "American way of  life" is afraid of being ostracized for considering it corrupt.  We have a damned duty and responsibility to fall into the arms  of those who want to turn us into the 51st U.S. state. We are  also opposed to the kind of double standard that in as short a  time as possible mobilized half the world against Iraq just  because oil interests were endangered, but watches passively as  a people bleed to death on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia.    We do not want such far-reaching liberalization that we are  confronted with pornography and violence on television every  evening. We do not want Germany to become a Harlem. We do not  want the kind of security that only rich people can afford, with  watch towers, barbed wire, and private armies. We do not want  the Mafia, which has been reexported from the United States to  Italy, to destroy our children with drugs.    Mammon is not our god. We believe that the strong should  help the weak. What we value does not lie in a safe, but in our  hearts!    It was worth struggling for these ideas. We do not want  Gottfried Benn's merciless statement to become reality: "The  Occident is not heading for destruction because of totalitarian  systems or because of spiritual poverty, but because of the  servility of intelligence vis-a-vis political expediency."</p>

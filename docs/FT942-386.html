			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W in partnership talks with Belarus Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, has signed a deal with the government of Belarus giving it exclusive negotiating rights for nine months to become a strategic partner in the privatisation of the state telecommunications company of the former Soviet republic. If successful, the deal could lead to C&amp;W taking a large minority stake in the state company, in return for upgrading Belarus's antiquated telecoms network. C&amp;W has significant interests in the Baltic region, including minority stakes in the Latvian state telecommunications company and in Tele2, the main competitor to the Swedish state telecommunications operator.</p>

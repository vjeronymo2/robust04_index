			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: Prepared for the worst - Planning for a crisis What happens when a briefcase containing company secrets goes missing, a blackmailer laces the company's top-selling food product with poison, or toxic factory waste escapes threatening an environmental disaster? For most companies a crisis like this will never happen. But when disaster strikes, the consequences can be so dire, that managers are starting to lay contingency plans, just in case. Crisis Planning has only recently emerged as a management issue, in response to the headline-grabbing disasters in the past decade. Among those judged to have been well handled were the lacing of Johnson and Johnson's Tylenol capsules with cyanide in the US, and the British Midland air disaster at Kegworth in Leicestershire. In contrast, the Bhopal toxic gas disaster involving a Union Carbide plant in India, and the King's Cross underground fire are often cited as examples of poor crisis planning and management. Few businesses are immune from crisis, but research suggests even fewer have a strategy for dealing with disasters. A recent survey conducted by Alexander Stenhouse, the insurance brokers and risk management experts, found that only one in four UK companies had a strategy for dealing with a product-tampering crisis and only one in three had developed a plan for minimising the risk resulting from an environmental crisis. There is an understandable reluctance to confront an issue which may never happen. However, there is evidence that the worst time to learn how to manage a crisis is during a crisis itself. For this reason a number of consultants have begun to sell crisis management services. One such, dubbed Total Crisis Management (TCM), is offered by a group of four firms comprising Alexander Stenhouse, the London law firm, Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warren, Ogilvy Adams &amp; Rinehart, the public relations consultants, and Touche Ross, the management consultants. The four firms promise a full crisis planning and management service, which begins with an internal risk review and includes a 24-hour crisis telephone hot line. The TCM group says a simple problem can become a crisis if the company is unprepared. Although the TCM partners acknowledge a crisis cannot always be avoided, they insist the best way to survive is to plan ahead. But they also caution against rigid responses. 'Simply having a crisis manual may be worse than useless,' the experts say. 'No-one will have read it. The crisis you are handling won't be in it and you won't have time to wade through it when instant decisions are needed.' So how can you prepare for a crisis? The first step is to bring together the expertise - internally or from outside - to define possible crises and to explore the risks. Then planning, communications and training packages can be put in place as 'insurance' for the future. There are three main stages: Crisis preparation: Undertake an audit of the relevant risks, including environmental dangers, legal and security threats, and political or other external pressures. Then review risk control policies and prepare a crisis manual as a basis for training and simulation exercises. It should describe the authority, the aim and the staffing of a crisis management team. It should contain relevant telephone numbers of experts, and make clear who is supposed to be doing what. Crisis handling: The team must be assembled, and the situation assessed coolly and professionally. Communication is the most important item. Companies must be ready to give and to receive information from a wide variety of sources. A recent study by Alexander &amp; Associates, management consultants, shows that most companies communicate poorly with their regulatory bodies, concentrate on the shareholder at the expense of the customer, and have feeble systems for internal communication. Companies should ensure all the media's questions are answered and should liaise with investigatory bodies to protect and minimise exposure to criminal or civil liabilities. Crisis after-care: When the dust settles, do not relax and lose the initiative. There will be many lessons to learn and opportunities to take after a crisis. The review should begin as soon as the crisis is over. Staff should be reassured that the point of the review is not to find culprits, but to improve the working of the plan.</p>

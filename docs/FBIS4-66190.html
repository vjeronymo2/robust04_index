			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Collection of essays: "An Investigative Report on China's </F> Surplus Rural Labor Force; Exploring the Sources, Part V -- Torn  Between Coming and Going"]    [Text] The Ambivalent "Amphibians"--by reporter Mao  Hao [3029 3185]    Ou Cunyu [2962 1407 3254] is acknowledged to be Guozi  village's most able man. Unfortunately, when I visited the  village, he was away on a buying trip. His family members said  he goes on these trips for two to three months every year. In  Guoji village, there are already several of these "amphibians"  who have one foot in the city and the other in the village.    Ou was in the army, and after his discharged, he became  village cadre (company commander of the village militia). In  the 1980's, he was among the first to leave the village to work  on the outside. Lately he has accumulated substantial amount of  money and experience and has forged personal ties at work which  prompted him to turn around and head back to the village to take  up the pig-feed additive business. Usually he stays home to tend  to his farm, and when farm work is slow, he goes on his business  trips. Some of his business is all the way out in Guangdong.  Today, his is the best house in the village (repaired once when  he was still working for others and repaired again when he got  into business for himself). Many in Guozi village who have  dreams of becoming well-off are envious of him.    Yang Shicheng [2789 0013 7022] is another of such  "amphibians." His business is a mixed-bag -- he picks up  whatever there is to do. When the reporter visited him at his  house, he was just buying up the local oranges to ship them  out-of-town. "This is but my odd job. My main business out there  is in lumber. There is money to be made out there everyday, and  coming home, I find it uncomfortable to be idle all day long.  Everybody wants to make money." Perhaps having been out and  about in the world has given him a better sense and better  judgment about commodities; Yang is clearly ahead of everybody  else.    Even though most people who have retired and gone back to  the  villages are those who had left early and had reaped substantial  profit, the material and cultural differences between town and  country and their anxiety about future competition still make  them ambivalent about returning to their ancestral homes like  fallen leaves returning to their roots. Like "amphibians," they  don't know where they really belong.    Shao Yuanshou [6730 0337 1108] and Liu Yanlin left the  village at about the same time. He has gone through 14 provinces  and municipalities. Today, he is home taking care of some  sideline business. Because he is very skillful, he can make  300-400 yuan a month weaving bamboo. In talking to the reporter,  he sighed and said, "I have never wanted to live in the city  permanently. I was not born for that kind of life. But having  been out there to see the sights and experience the fun, I am  not satisfied with being back here again. Life is hard out  there. There is always someone looking over your shoulders, and  even when the wind is blowing and the snow is falling, you still  have to go to work. But there is one good thing about it:  Usually, the harder you work, the more money you make. You can  figure it out for yourself. Moreover, it makes a difference if  you are skilled, and so it forces one to learn. At the  beginning, I could not adapt to city life. People are yelling at  you and ordering you around all day long, and everything is so  rigid. But now that I am back home, I can't get used to things  here either. You may be free here, but you have nothing to do  all day, and you have no steady income. Here in the village,  besides watching TV, there is no other form of entertainment. If  you have never experienced life on the outside, you will never  think about it, but once you had a taste of it but can't get it  anymore, it is hard to take. Is this ironic or what?"  <H5>  A Step Ahead of the Others--by reporter Da Yuanzhi [2071 </H5> 5913 2388]    Let us return to Chen Liang's home and listen to his story.    Those who know Chen Liang know that he failed to get a job  in  Suzhou's Wuxian County and Shanghai's Chongming one year. When  he returned to the village, mentally he went through a very  difficult period.    The closer he got to his home, the more he worried about  running into people he knew, and the more he worried, the more  people he ran into.    On the boat to the village, he ran into a relative.    "How come you are back?" He detested that question the most.    "Coming home to visit the family."    Those who left always come home "in their silken robes" -- a  sign of success -- clutching gift packages of all sizes, but  Chen had lost his job and was kind of ashamed to come home to  face the village elders and worried even more about others  suspecting that he had done something wrong and that was why he  was fired.    Later, whenever he left the village, he would put on a pair  of sunglasses.    He and his father wanted to contract or buy the village's  plastic factory which had shut down earlier, but the deal fell  through because the price was not right. The factories in the  township were beyond their reach, and some were not that  profitable.    His father recalled that back then, whenever they had time,  they would search for a newspaper to read.    People always look down on young people who are still living  at home.    "One must get ahead, just like knives must be sharpened. You  should go out to see the world." Chen Liang said, "When you are  out there, even in your dreams, you dream about working  alongside your father and washing clothes beside your mother."  Even if the food is plain and the tea coarse, they are still  sweet. "There is an inexplicable tenderness about them." But he  still wants to get away.    "You know, my parents have kept me for more than 20 years.  It  just doesn't feel right to spend another cent of my father's  money. To earn more money and find more business is the best  way to repay my parents. That was why I left when I had a  chance."    Of course people look for work away from home in order to  make money. But "city life has its attractions too. Sitting at  home makes one feel as if one is looking at the sky from the  bottom of a well."    "Listening to tapes at home is no longer fun. Life in the  village is too monotonous. One has to go 4 li just to catch a  movie; there are no karaoke, no books, no song and dance shows  that one likes. Before, I would watch other people dance on TV,  but I didn't know how. Today, even I can dance a little--not  that I think about dancing all the time or dance away all my  free time."    "There is no room for me in the village." Upon saying that,  Chen felt that he had mis-spoken himself. He thought for a while  and corrected himself, saying, "There is no future here."    Chen Liang left several times and came back several times.  His father said, "If he hadn't leave, his sister couldn't leave."    It turned out that when Chen Liang sister failed to find a  job in Kunshan, it was Chen Liang who found a place for her at  the Wuxi Textile Goods Research Institute's Zhongshi Factory not  far from his own work place."    "What young people would want to remain at home?" Chen  Liang's younger sister who had just graduated from middle school  interjected.    Her grandmother chided her, "You wish your brother would  come  home tomorrow and leave on the next day. How terrible."    "Water drains down; people heads up. People absolutely want  that work permit."    Usually after one person leaves a village, others will  follow. Dagang's villagers told me that none of those who have  left have returned.  <H5>  Secretly Giving Him the Thumbs-Up--by reporter Liu Jian </H5> [0491 1696]    Liujiaguanfang's peasants are not satisfied with making some  money on the outside to feed the family. They want to get the  "green card" to the "new world." People here are very keen about  "emigrating."    The reason the peasants from the Liujiaguanfang area often  go  out to the northeast, besides the fact that they are familiar  with the place and have friends and relatives there, is that  household registration is less strict and outsiders are usually  allowed to settle there.    One's highest ideal of course is to get an official post.  Two  li away from Liujiaguanfnag is Zhangjiaguanfang. In 1963, Ji  Qingren [4764 1987 0088] left the village for Heilongjiang's  Qitaihe. Today, Ji is the head of Qitaihe's City mines as well  as its party committee secretary. Everybody in Qitaihe City  knows his nickname "Ji Dahu--Tiger Ji." When he arrived in the  coal pits, he truly "worked hard and sweated hard," and soon  became a model production trooper. In 1973, he was promoted to  deputy head of the mine; it took him only 10 years. Today he is  in charge of more than 3,800 workers; he is a county-level cadre  and is Qitaihe's number one enterpreneur. Most of  Liujiaguanfang's peasants who venture out to the northeast are  trying to follow in Ji's example; they just don't want to admit  it.    If one can't make it as a cadre, a lesser goal is to become  an official employee in a state-owned enterprise and live on the  "state's payroll." Dozens in Liujiaguanfang have succeeded with  this approach. In fact, in the more than 40 years since the  founding of the PRC, most of those in Liujiaguanfang village who  have managed to get on the state's payroll had started on in the  northeast. Liu Huitian [0491 2585 3944], a young trooper who  ventured out to Qitaihe alongside Ji Qingren in 1963 and engaged  in the same death-defying struggles in the same pit with him,  has now settled in Qitaihe with his family, all legal and  proper. Last year, having been away from the village for 30  years, he took his wife and children back home to visit his  ancestors' graves. They set off enough firecrackers to litter  the whole street. Though not the grandest by comparison, his was  nevertheless a glorious homecoming, sufficient to make his  ancestors proud.    Only a handful can triumphantly land in the "new world."  Most  return home to Liujiaguanfang village after three to five months  or even three to five years, upon making some money here and  there. Eighty percent of Liujiaguanfang's male between the ages  of 30 and 60 fall into this category. They either had little  luck or had just missed the opportunities, or they have simply  lost the patience to "wait a little while longer" after waiting  and waiting for a long time. Like those workers who go overseas  to work, they make some hard-earned money and head home. They  are neither success stories nor are they failures.    No matter where the Liujiaguanfang villagers go, and no  matter how far they travel, their standard for success or  failure is still Liujiaguanfang's standard and not the "new  world's" standard. They seem to have eyes on their backs.  <H5>  Books Make People Ambitious--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] </H5>   When I arrived at Huang Xiaomin's [7806 2556 2404] house,  they had just finished cleaning house and had just started a  large frying pan to heat some honey. They told me that they were  getting ready to make some local yellow wine to celebrate an  important occasion.    Twenty-four-year-old Huang was getting married in a few  days,  but he looked rather sad. Huang joined a construction brigade  two years ago upon graduating from high school. Today, he has  traveled a long way home for his wedding.    He said, "After graduating from high school, I didn't make  it  to college, but I still felt good about myself. I still believed  that I could accomplish something. I have always loved to write,  and I figured that with my education, I could always make some  money. But once out there, I realized how naive I was."    In the construction bridgade, he was an unskilled labor just  like any other civilian worker. He worked more than 10 hours a  day. He has been to Xinjiang and Qinghai. During the day, he set  tiles, and at night, when the others laid in bed chatting with  one another, he would play the flute or read a book about  tile-setting, and only at that time would it become apparant  that he was an educated man. He also admitted that because he  was educated, the team leaders and others always looked up to  him.    He said, "Actually I would still like to go back to school.  If my family had money, I would like to get another year of  schooling. But having worked out there for a couple of years has  its merits. At least I am more mature. When I first went out  there, I was vain. I never ventured out of the construction site  and was too embarrassed to meet people. Now I am a changed man."    At one time, Huang Xiaomin submitted some articles to the  newspapers and magazines. He did not even get a letter of  rejection. He also tried getting into business for himself but  was too shy to talk to people. So he ended up becoming an  unskilled laborer.    Today, after having wandered around for two years, marriage  has brought him back to the village. The outside world is  illusive, and the air in the village is oppressive. His worries  about the future keeps bearing down on him.    He said, "After the wedding, I am sure I will have to stay  home for a while, and I am sure I will not be able to accomplish  much at home. So I am sure I will leave again."    He said, "I have to get out there and do something for my  father and mother and everybody to see, to make society  acknowledge my worth. One day, if I manage to accomplish  something big, I will return and change the face of this  village."  <H5>  Torn Between Coming and Going--by reporter Lu Yuegang [4151 </H5> 6460 0474]    Two things bothered me incessantly while I was staying in  Huxia village. The first was insomnia, because of the rats, and  the other was the language problem.    Huxia village's grain silos used to be built out of reed or  wood. No one knows when the rats began to run amuck. What is  interesting is that instead of working together to rid the  village of rats, every family began to build cement silos. Even  if the rats had steel fangs, they couldn't chew through the  cement walls. Starving rats are everywhere, and they gnaw at  anything that they can sink their teeth into. Sometimes, a  foot-long rat would crawl along the bed-rail. They would look  straight into your eyes, showing no fear at all. What can you do?    People speak the Hu native dialect here. Outsiders simply  can't understand them. Fortunately, I had Zou Binzi [6760 2430  1311] to interpret for me.    Actually, Zou is around because of this piece of  poverty-stricken land. He was in the military police army for 3  years and joined the Party while serving. After he returned  home, he wanted to do something big, but every time he returned  home full of hope he was forced to leave full of despair. It was  as if there was no room for him on that piece of land. He worked  as a hired hand everywhere. He worked hard. He went all over the  country, but he always felt that he had an unfulfilled dream. In  July 1993, he drummed up enough courage to write Wu Guanzheng  [0702 1351 2973], governor of Jiangxi Province, a letter in  which he said, "Upon returning to the village, I wanted to  embark on the road to riches along with my fellow villagers. But  alas there was 'no room for a hero to display his prowess'  there." He went on to make some good suggestions about many  rural projects.    His letter was forwarded from the province to Yichuan  Prefecture and from the prefecture to Zhangshu City and then to  Huangtugang Town, from level to level, and eventually the town's  leader met with him. This kind of sensationalism only invited  the villagers' criticism.    Another failure. He was forced to go to work in Guangdong:  First, he could avoid further criticisms, and second, he could  make some money to support himself.    He told me that as far as Huxia village is concerned, there  are only two kinds of resources: the land and the surplus labor.  In particular, he said that the land has not been properly  utilized. He showed me his plan. He pointed to a field at the  foothill and said, "There are more than 40 mu of red-loam,  low-yield farms. Planting rice will yield only several hundred  jin. If we do some excavating, it will be a perfect place for  ecology-based breeding [SHENGTAI YANGZHI]."    Ecology-based breeding techniques can be brought in from the  outside, but who will put up the 40 to 50,000 yuan in initial  investments? It will be harder to get the money than to get into  heaven.    In early February, I received a letter from Zou. He said  that  upon parting with me in Nanchang, he thought about starting an  all-purpose agricultural development company, but his family was  dead against it. The reason was quite simple: they did not have  the means to support him.    He is already 26 years old. In the village, the pressure is  already unbearable if one is still not married at that age. Even  worse is, what is he going to do with himself? He plays mahjong  during the day, and at night, there is no electricity, so he  goes to bed early. Is this the way to fritter one's life away?    Should he go out to work again? Once Spring Festival is  over,  he will have to make a decision. He must be torn between coming  and going at this point.  <H5>  Appendix </H5>   Item/Village       Shandong:         Gansu:       Jiangsi:    Sichuan:     Jiangsu:                     Liujiaguanfang    Xinzhuang    Huxia       Guozi        Dagang                     village           village      village     village      village   Number of mobile   210               more than    35          310          200  workers                              300   Workers who have   0 (excluding      0            0           16  returned (never    those who  to leave again)    returned before                     1992)   (Returned          employment mix    0            0           3 in  workers) in        of people who                              business,  nonagricultural    returned before                            2 others  sector             1992 is the                     same as those                     who never left   Number of people   same as above     0            0           11  returning to  agriculture</p>

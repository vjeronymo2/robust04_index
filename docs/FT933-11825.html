			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Bosnian leaders discuss carve-up SERB, Croat and Moslem leaders will hold further talks on a Bosnia settlement today, after they were reported to have made progress yesterday in their first face-to-face negotiations for more than six months. Details of the talks remained wrapped in secrecy as all sides appeared determined to keep the peace process going. Mr John Mills, the Geneva conference spokesman, said the 90-minute meeting had 'a good and constructive atmosphere'. As the negotiators met, French troops at a United Nations base in Sarajevo came under artillery fire for the second time in two days. Participants in the talks agreed to discuss this attack when they reconvene this afternoon. The talks, which could lead to a carve-up of Bosnia, involve leaders of the three main ethnic groups along with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state. The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have called for creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war. The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well as the US. The mediators have pledged, in the event of division, that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava.</p>

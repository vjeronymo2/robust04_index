			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Dialogue between ZAVTRA Editor in Chief Aleksandr Prokhanov </F> and Aleksandr Barkashov; place and date not given: "Aleksandr  Barkashov: 'Heil Russia!'"]    [Text] [Prokhanov] I see the past two years as an integral,  complete period: political, spiritual, perhaps even  spiritual-religious. One could see this especially clearly when  that period was brought to an end--over there on the Moscow  River embankment, by this blaze, this massacre...    As a writer, a novelist, I felt that Russian history itself  was writing a novel. Amazing people came through my editorial  offices; their characters and internal relations developed.  These relations turned into friendships, conflicts, enmity, and  then people would come back together again. And the entire  sequence of events entwined into some sort of knot, some plot,  some suspenseful, frightening, mystical novel, which had to have  a focus and a resolution. I was waiting for this, I repeat, not  as a politician, but as an intuitivist. I expected this novel to  end in tragedy: blood, grief, stoicism, some explosion of  light-bearing energy.    And during those days in September-October, when I was tied  up in the newspaper process and in politics, meetings,  intrigues, struggle, I was not able to grasp to the end or  understand these events in the House of Soviets. Our meeting  there, fleeting as if in a fog, when I walked into the room and  you were sitting there, tired after a sleepless night; fleeting  meetings with Achalov, Rutskoy, with our politician-friends,  Sterligov, spies and saboteurs--all of this for me is still some  mysterious, tangled web.    It is very important for me to learn from you how you acted,  how you lived, how you felt in the White House labyrinths--both  your movement and you personally. What have you learned from  this; what was your understanding of this process?    [Barkashov] The events that are happening in our country are  undoubtedly of a metaphysical nature. It is almost meaningless  to try them on, appraise them from the standpoint of political  gain. Unfortunately, many still have not understood this and are  attempting to make political calculations and forecasts--all for  the purpose of jumping to one side or the other in time and not  ending up a loser. Time has already shown that those who were  guided by this political reckoning lost in the long run. While  those, I think, who were guided by intuitive feeling gained  politically, although perhaps this was not their goal. And this  knot, as you said, was being entwined not out of political  expediency. I also was in contact with many people then. I  worked rather closely with Sterligov and others...    The search for political alliances brought satisfaction.  There was this inner feeling--not only mine but also of my  comrades--that some historic mystery was taking place in Russia,  and we need to look for friends, strategic allies in exactly  this, mystical spirit that permeated this event.    Of course, we came to the White House not out of political  considerations. It is just that there were concrete people, with  whom we were friends, who saw the situation more or less the  same way we did and tried to participate in it in order to move  events in the direction they wanted. I remember your words: You  were sitting at the table, visiting Achalov, and you said: "This  is not our celebration yet, not our battle." Yes, it was not yet  our battle; for instance, it would not have brought us a final  political victory. But we had to try to influence events in such  a way that sooner or later would make it our hour, our time. We  had our view of it, our intentions, which perhaps were different  from the intentions of others. But we could not stand back and  not participate, and that is why we came to the White House. In  principle, we could have left, acted differently even at the  last moment, but we stayed there to the end knowing that a  mystical event was taking place. Speaking of political  underpinnings, however, we also anticipated the outcome. But, on  the one hand, it is the outcome of the preceding stage, and on  the other--the beginning of a new one. Is it not?    Back in March, when all those Moscow brain-grinders were  interviewing me: "How will you feel about it?...," "Whose side  will you be on?" we said then that we will be on the side of  those who raise the issue of the integrity of the state, defense  of national interests, the issue of Russian people. Since it was  the Supreme Soviet that did so, specifically Khasbulatov, who  openly raised the issue of the problems of the Russian people,  and also Rutskoy, we took their side, of course. We said that we  will provide a full range of support--from moral to physical.  Then also, I personally have great respect for General Achalov;  we are rather close friends; I respect him as a Russian, a  general, and a man of principle.    [Prokhanov] What affected you most from the emotional  standpoint during all these events?    [Barkashov] You know, there were two moments.    The first one was on 3 October, when people broke through to  the White House. During the time of this whole stand-off since  21 September, when the parliament declared itself a defender of  interests of the people and statehood and the enemy of those  destroying it, they naturally wanted to attract to their side  large numbers of people. The public mind in principle was  already receptive to the idea of statehood and national  interests. So on 3 October these people came. I estimated their  number at 100,000. Later, talking to foreign journalists who  have a better eye for this, I learned that 500,000 people came.  You saw it for yourself: They were not lumpen, as we were told;  they were the cream of Moscow, mainly young people between 17  and 25 and mature men, 35 and older. Clear, pure  faces--distorted, of course, somewhat by emotions and the heat  of battle, but, I repeat, this was the cream of Moscow. Workers,  officers--whose who make up the foundation of the state.    So they came, this half a million people, and the  parliament,  which wanted them there, and the leaders of this stand-off did  not succeed in organizing the actions of those who came to their  aid. On the one hand, they wanted it; on the other--they were  caught unprepared. On 3 October, when all this happened in such  a disorganized and chaotic manner, one could see that there were  some with a lot of personal ambition, their own calculations; at  the same time, the people who came to their aid were united by a  common sense of support. And this, so to say, disparity between  those who had urged them to come and those who came was  especially noticeable. In principle, the situation was  controllable and much could be directed differently. This is  when I experienced--not even disappointment, but a very strong  emotion that it happened this way.    The second moment was on 4 October, when at about noon we  realized that we would not get out of there alive. I was very  concerned for my people. They were doomed just like everyone  else who was at the Supreme Soviet, but it was I who had brought  them there, and therefore they were my responsibility. And of  course, I was also concerned about the family. But then I  thought that war is war, and there always are losses.    These were the two most emotional moments of that period.    [Prokhanov] After that physical defeat--because I believe  that spiritually and morally we did not lose but win--you were  stronger, stood taller, nobler; and heroes were among us, not  among the "knights," OMON [Special Designation Militia  Detachments], and beytars... after that the next 10 days were  terrible. I felt as if Moscow was black, sticky; that it had  been surrendered to rapists. And all of this was done by the  most cruel laws of a torture chamber. The nation was being  raped; the people were being raped for the entire subsequent  period, that is, the worst there is in a human being was being  brought out: fear, animal fear, social fear.    I remember how terrible it was to learn that Anpilov had  been  arrested--he was not able to disappear despite the fact that he  represented one of the most secret organizations. Which means  there is no secrecy, no organization, and what is there is  defenselessness and helplessness...    Konstantinov was arrested, although one would think that all  he had to do was sit tight in a safe place and not venture  anywhere. But some force--whether infantilism, madness, or  anxiety and helplessness--compelled him to get out on the  street, where he was immediately arrested.    And I remember how everybody asked: "What about Barkashov?  What about Barkashov?" No, Barkashov has not been arrested, he  is hiding in the woods, he has survived. That Barkashov remained  at large all those days inspired joy, hope that he would indeed  get through this period of persecution and remain at the helm of  his movement. And then this terrible news that there was an  assassination attempt on you, you were shot and wounded, and  ended up in the hands of oppressors. What can be more horrible  than a wounded, helpless man finding himself in the hands of  executioners, enemies? My heart was bleeding for you.    Tell us about this incident; there are so many legends  surrounding it, all sorts of versions, First, how did it all  happen?    [Barkashov] Everything happened more or less as described in  the newspapers. I was walking at night on business of my  own--there are such instances when you have to go alone--and I  was shot at from a passing car. How many times--I cannot tell:  three, two, one... I did not hear the shots. Simply felt a dull  blow in the leg and several seconds later realized that I was  wounded. The car disappeared without slowing down. This happened  near Krasnogorskiy military hospital, and a passing car took me  there, Since my condition was grave, I was immediately accepted.  There I found myself among honest people, who conscientiously  did what needed to be done.    I ended up in the hands of enemies about 10 days later, when  the information somehow leaked out. They were already looking  for me. It appears that they knew more or less where to look,  because there is no other explanation--I was under deep cover in  this hospital: a different name, different papers...    The time I spent in the hospital was hard only from the  physical standpoint, because I was treated very well there.  Later, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] and then in  Sailor's Rest prison, it was also hard morally, but I came to  the conclusion that there are people who share our views  everywhere, and there are many more normal, good people than bad  ones, even there.    [Prokhanov] What is your own guess regarding that shot; what  could it be? Beytars on a hunt, the MVD? An accident, a strange  incident?    [Barkashov] It is hard to tell. Usually armies, upon  capturing a city, were given three days for looting; here they  had three times three, since Moscow was let up for 10 days. At  the time we received through our channels information from the  MVD that there was a secret directive with respect to certain  people on the wanted list. Do not take prisoners: stage  resistance to arrest and an escape attempt. Therefore we were  very cautious during that time; afterwards, we boosted our  activities and perhaps relaxed; perhaps I personally relaxed.    I believe that I myself made it easier: I had not been home  for quite a while and decided to stop by. This is where they  picked me up: They had external surveillance in place. Who was  there--whether it was the MVD, militia, or beytars--they do not  display signs on their cars. Until then I was out of their  reach. Why they acted precisely this way, I do not know. Why  they shot at me instead of arresting me. Maybe they wanted to  kill me, or maybe to wound me first so that it would be easier  to take me later--I cannot tell. Neither do I know who it was.  But I had the impression somehow that is was a special MVD unit.    [Prokhanov] Over the past three years since 1991 I have had  a  constant feeling that besides a contest of ideas, intrigues, and  political potentials, a struggle of two principles is also going  on. And perhaps we called ourselves a "newspaper of spiritual  opposition" not so much because we do not have tank armies and  airborne units, do not have our own spetsnaz, as because we  clearly understood that victory, if we achieve it, must be won  in the realm of the spirit, as if in heaven. And heaven can  exist anywhere--in your soul and in your heart. And which spirit  will turn out stronger: the spirit of darkness, the spirit of  hell, the spirit of universal cunning, or the spirit of  stoicism, the spirit of light, the spirit of eternal salutary  goodwill goals and states.    And we remember how during those terrible days of  despondency, darkness, resistance, when it looked as if even  unbending people were getting cold feet, people who had lived  through wars, Afghanistan, suddenly disappeared, others turned  into shrinking violets, when people were getting hysterical,  there came your word, this expression of yours: "field of  honor"--the message you addressed to the public.    When I read it, it gave me many noble and bright moments. My  friend Nevzorov told me the same thing. Aleksandr Glebovich also  admired your message. It came as if from the rack, from a cross,  operating table, torture chamber--a time when a person is  expected to be silent, to moan, to groan. It was a spiritual  phenomenon; it was a ray of light cutting through the walls of  Sailor's Rest, and many perceived it precisely as proof of  spiritual victory.    I think that in prison you did not just suffer physically,  not only were concerned about your family and comrades, but you  definitely experienced a mystical state. I want to say once  again: What came through to me in the brief words of your  message was mystical, holy energy. Did you experience this  state, or am I mistaken?    [Barkashov] No, you are not mistaken. It was precisely in  Sailor's Rest that I suddenly became convinced that this  spiritual victory in heaven, as you have described it, had  already been won. What contributed to it perhaps was my  psychological state of mind and certain asceticism, cleansing of  the spirit and body, because I practically did not eat and was  exhausted. In such a condition, the spirit takes over the flesh;  mystical horizons open for you. I prayed a lot then--very hard,  with all my heart, and got a feeling of certainty that we had  won. It became especially strong in the middle of February--that  we had already won in spirit, and all that was left to do was  implement it in a physical sense. It will be difficult, I think,  but not as difficult as before.    What is happening today in the camp of our enemies can be  analyzed and presented this way and that way, of course. In  truth, however, they also sense intuitively, with animal  instinct, that they have lost the spiritual battle.  So they are scattering like rats.    I completely agree with you: There is always a struggle  between good and evil, but in 1991-1993 it spilled onto the  political level. This is the only way to look at the situation.  And since it is this way, we are on the side of good, not evil,  good in its ultimate manifestation. Time removes all pretenses,  and no matter what our opponents say, no matter what values they  use as a cover, one can see that they are demons. And we must  defeat them. By political or any other means, but we must.    [Prokhanov] In the final analysis all that drives us is  concern for the state of our own soul, repentance for some  sin--perhaps the original sin, perhaps the sin of a life lived  iniquitously, and at the same time, concern and caring for the  people. And thoughts about the people, a part of which each of  us feels himself, and thoughts of one's own essence, spiritual  nature, merge together, and frequently are inseparable. Today  some say of the people: "they are asleep;" others say: "they are  drinking themselves to death;" still others: "they have betrayed  their mission, turned into a nation of money-grabbers, a nation  of money changers. In reality, by their inner self--their  mystery, their tenderness, their naivete, their virtue--they  resemble a sleeping knight, who has covered himself with a  shroud of Christ, a cloak. This cover may look like a horrible,  disgusting rag or a garment made of foreign fabric in a foreign  manner, but underneath it breathes the same eternal, mysterious,  kindred and dear chest of a huge being sleeping--our people. He  is having a dream in his sleep. And this is my dream, too; I  also see this dream.    [Barkashov] We all see this dream.    [Prokhanov] Yes, we all do. It is a dream of some great  memory, where there are many beautiful mysterious states coming  from clean rivers, sorcerers making their way along these  rivers, the first wondrous orthodox temples, snow-white on green  hills, amazingly wise and kind old men--perhaps half-wizards,  but also half-first Christians. This is one part of the dream,  associated with the past, mystical and mysterious, which you do  not even read about in fairy tales.    The other part of the dream is the future. I see the same  brilliant, light-giving, beautiful future. And it consists of  shapes that are no longer archaic but symbolic--a huge building,  cathedral, temple, land covered with flourishing cities and  roads, where the people you love, brides, children, relatives,  righteous men live. The country has been turned into a wondrous  palace built by our labors. This is my vision of our future  truth and our incarnation--perhaps very personal and subjective.    Do you ever get such visions? If you see what I mean, what  do  you feel?    [Barkashov] I understand you perfectly. It is common today  among many Russians to look back into the past. It is the memory  of the soul, the awakening of the archetype, which happens to  the people at some stage, at the right moment. The dream of the  future is linked with it, because they will have to break  through to the future across everything that surrounds them now.  This awakening happens at a time when it seems that there is no  place to go, that everything is bound by artificial rules,  marked by circumstances. It is at this point that man gets a  vision of the past and the future. Many people are experiencing  it today.    Our people are at a borderline from which they are to break  through, discarding all circumstances, all conventions imposed  on them. And this future great endeavor is the reason the people  have remained silent until now. Look, even democratic  politicians are amazed: "How long can one keep the Russian  beast, and keep humiliating it! Somewhere in Salvador they would  have rioted a long time ago, and more than once, but Russians  take everything." But this is all because the social factor will  not be the dominant one in this accomplishment. It may provide  momentum, start the movement, but the breakthrough will be  achieved in the mystical, spiritual sphere.    Our people are like no other people. A great future awaits  them, as great as their past. And therefore at a certain stage  politicians will no longer be able to influence the general  course no matter how much they want to; they will not be able to  speculate on the issues of the day, direct the movement--it will  not longer be in their hands. It will be an explosion of popular  mysticism, which will provide the energy for building the state.  And it will be a breakthrough into the future.    It is wonderful that many have already developed this  feeling. This means we have already approached this borderline,  we are already close to it. By the way, speaking about  mysticism, this year Orthodox Easter coincides with Walpurgis  night, when the most powerful occult magic operations take  place. This is further evidence that this year is especially  mystical in the sense of the struggle between good and evil and  will be a decisive one...    [Prokhanov] Nevertheless, you and I are not only Orthodox  mystics, not only monks who have taken the vows of schema or  zealots--we are politicians, and we know what a political  organization is; we are concerned with the problem of creating  powerful patriotic movements. I remember the siege of the  Writers House in 1991. You were there, too... Since then, rather  energetic attempts have been made to create a large patriotic  nationalist party, a right-wing party, a party of the white  idea. These efforts have not succeeded to this day. There are  numerous small movements, initiatives, and groups that are very  attractive by their membership and ideology--not only in Moscow  but also in the provinces; there have been attempts to unite all  these forces--first in the Pamyat, then in the Slavic Assembly,  then in the Russian National Assembly, the National Salvation  Front [NSF], the Congress... But we still have not pulled  ourselves together into a right-wing healthy conservative party  encompassing the nation.    What, in your opinion, stands in the way of creating such a  party? Is it the result of the social factor, meaning that it is  very difficult to build a stable political organism in a  disintegrating socium; or is it the result of some psychological  confusion of the nation as a whole? Or perhaps our people simply  are not prone to uniting into a traditional type party? Is it  that the people have different forms of self-organization,  different forms of collective self-rule?    [Barkashov] First, I would like to point out that such a  party must have a powerful base in the most socially organized  groups of society. It should not be, for instance, a group of  intellectuals and "politicians" who get together and decide what  to do, vote, elect a leadership--and go no further than that.  The main factor in realizing the idea proclaimed by the Congress  of Patriotic Forces, the Russian Assembly, or the NSF are the  Russian people, who are part of different social groups and live  in different conditions of existence.    In order for a party to become a mass organization, popular,  and capable, we need to first and foremost create an ideology,  then a grass-roots organizational structure through which to  promote this ideology, and then finally build on this an  organization in politically promising social groups. At this  stage it is, of course, numerous groups, with little money,  going through difficulties because of the current processes, and  united by a social attribute. In my opinion, it is first and  foremost the military, workers, and the youth. This is where we  should look for support.    The failure of all attempts to unite into a single party can  be explained perhaps by the fact that objectively these groups  were not yet ready to accept the ideas offered to them. While  sympathizing with the ideas, they had not yet been brought to  such a state as to truly accept them, absorb them, and then  reinforce them in the form of creating organizations. I think  that now they are ready for this.    I have participated in many congresses and know the standard  fare: get them together; proclaim. And personal ambitions: Who  sits in the presidium, who will be in charge of this or that.  Everything is parceled out, and in two weeks all work already  dies down. For some reason secondary things always get confused  with priorities. A priority is to prepare the soil, to implant  the program, ideology, create a social base, and only then a  congress--as a final stage, as a result of what has been  achieved.    We did it in reverse order: first a congress--as soon as we  proclaim, state, advertise ourselves, everybody will learn about  us and run to us--and right away we will have an organization. I  have always tried to explain that a congress, a conference is  the final stage of work. But everything was done the other way  around.    Many of those who participated in the congresses did not  sincerely trust the leadership. Hence all these conflicts and  ambitions. Because to start serious business with people who  have different motives, who are cunning, for instance, does not  make any sense--it dooms us all to defeat before we even start.    Now perhaps the time has come for a national movement. We  have seen each other--those who truly are sincere, able, who  resonate with us in spirit... At the time this was not the case.  At the time, we could not sort it all out without trials and  errors...    [Prokhanov] I am labeled a fascist--as are you. And my  friends, my newspaper are in a way demonized by this label. By  itself, the term is neither good nor bad. Actually, I still do  not know what fascism is. There are several varieties of  political regimes, political trends that are classified as such.  Some remained theoretical constructions--such as, for instance,  the Kharbin version of Russian fascism; others, such as the  Italian version, remained in the shadow of the more powerful  European national-socialist movement, with which all negative  aspects of fascism are associated. For instance, Latin American  variants, which also are called fascism, are completely exotic  and absolutely unsuitable for Russian soil...    [Barkashov] If we look at it closer, you will see that the  negative points are being over-emphasized, while positive  fascism--such as, for instance, in Argentina--nobody mentions...    [Prokhanov] Nobody mentions Argentina, or Brazil for that  matter. Neither is anyone talking about the American postwar  period, which provided stability, some features of which were  close to components of fascism...    After the September-October events Yeltsin established what  seems to be a "new Russian order." He thinks that he has  established it, and he is now the master of the next period in  Russian history. In reality, Yeltsin belongs with the  post-Soviet period and is already finished, even though he may  rule for another two or three years. As a political figure,  Yeltsin is done; he has gone to rot; he is not there, and those  who want to take power after him are now surfacing.    For me, such a dark figure personifying very gloomy, cruel  parts of our history is Luzhkov with his Moscow group, his  banks, where 70 percent of all capital in Russia is concentrated  and which he controls through commercial and economic  structures. MOST [BRIDGE] is the main one among them. A bridge  to where--to hell or to Manhattan? Everything associated with  MOST is shrouded in mystery and apparently criminal secrecy.    Luzhkov is gang formations, extremely well equipped--many of  them shot at us on the 3 and 4 October--ruthless and cruel, well  set-up, billeted in Moscow. Luzhkov is an instant party, a party  of the "majority," which is ensuring for itself a political  infrastructure. Luzhkov is influence on the highest echelons of  the military, to a large extent corrupt and incensed and also  representing semi-mafiosi organisms that have merged with  similar civilian structures. Luzhkov--and this is the most  dangerous part--is a gentleman standing in a temple, standing in  front of an icon holding a candle. Luzhkov is a gentleman who  contributes billions to the Russian zemstvo movement, who  supports and saves impoverished provincial writers and artists...    For me, these groups, which are thirsting to take a dominant  place in Russia, are a synonym for everything most negative,  cruel, ruthless, colored, strange as it may sound, by the ethnic  national idea. This is fascism; this is the real evil and  trouble...    As to your movement, along with other small nationalist,  well  organized movements, I see it more as a kind of an order,  semi-military--semi-monk perhaps; an order of Orthodox  secularity; in your actions there is an equal share of the  political as of the religious and spiritual. How would you  yourself describe your movement and the stage it is currently  going through?    [Barkashov] Speaking of Luzhkov's criminal formations, they  do represent a certain danger. But Luzhkov himself, who, like  Yeltsin, belongs to the post-Soviet, Gorbachev period, also is  spoiled meat. It is another matter that they may promote someone  less stained, because they will be playing along with trends  that are promising from the point of view of mass psychology.  They do it deliberately, without that inner state that exists  within the masses, and the latter will not accept them. If they  attempt, however, to hook up to powerful collective energies,  they will simply burn up. It is the same as plugging a telephone  into a 220V outlet. So far, good technical equipment is giving  them a tactical advantage. But when these energies mature, I  think, they will be powerless.    They can fool once again the already fooled people, give  them  more promises. But when that particular archetype that we have  discussed awakens in the people; when people become aware of  themselves; when a community of individual energies develops,  which turns into a collective one, they can no longer deceive,  win, or rule. They will be doomed, no matter how much they cling  to power. Yes, it is annoying to part with stolen millions,  Mercedes, and dachas. It is annoying to face trials. And  frightening. But it is inevitable. Looking at events through a  mystical prism, we are not afraid of them, although politically  and technically we are still facing a tough battle against them.    Right now, speaking of the current state of our  organization,  we are going through a period where its solid nucleus is turning  into a broad political movement. We have felt that social groups  are ready to accept our ideology. We already have the  organizational skills, the needed number of organizers to enable  us to quickly become a mass movement. But we do not want this  movement to be a mere backdrop for one-time use--we want it to  be politically mobile, well organized, and with good enough  discipline...    [Prokhanov] And in conclusion--about your health. How is  your  leg? I can see how unaccustomed you are to holding these  crutches. When will you be physically rehabilitated?    [Barkashov] Aleksandr Andreyevich, with your prayers... And  ours, too. Anyway, everything is fine...</p>

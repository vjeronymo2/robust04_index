			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn in Amman -- live] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  Prayers and peace be upon His faithful Arab Hashemite Prophet  and all his companions.    Dear brothers, Arabs and Muslims everywhere:    God's peace, compassion and blessings be upon all of you.    Praise be to Allah, the Almighty, who sustains the glory of  Islam and who, verily, makes the future belong to those who take  heed for themselves and follow the straight path. I bear  witness that there is no god but Allah, who has no compeers, and  that Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the votary and messenger of  Allah, who took him on a night journey from the al-Haram Mosque  to the al-Aqsa Mosque from where he ascended to the Lotus tree  in the Seventh Heaven.    Also, I praise God for all His kindness to me, especially  since he blessed me with a special favor to be associated with  the first qiblah [direction of Muslim prayer] and the third  sacred mosque. This association goes back to the early days of  the first great message and the day when God brought the light  of Islam to Jerusalem. Ever since then, the holy city thrived  in glory, piety and tolerance. It also goes back to the day  when the body of the great revolutionary al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, was  finally laid to rest in the sacred grounds of al-Aqsa. It was  he who had set an example for historical leaders of how to  choose between attaining glory of the transient moment and  immortality in the life hereafter. It was the very same  association that was consolidated when I witnessed 'Abdallah  Bin-al-Husayn as he fell a martyr on the sacred grounds of  al-Aqsa Mosque as he stood upright in dignity, like all  Hashemites who pass away while still firmly adhering to  time-honored principles [applause] and determined to attain  their goals against all odds. Little wonder that they have been  immortalized in the annals of history.    Islam was in point of fact the message of all God's prophets  and messengers whose missions had been sealed by that of  Muhammad, peace be upon him. Over and above that, my  relationship with Jerusalem is similar to that of any Muslim who  believes in God, His angels, holy books, messengers, and the Day  of Judgment, and who strives, along with the patient tiny  minority of the faithful, to defend his nation, inspired by what  the holy koran says: Remember when you were few and powerless  in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But  then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for  you good things that you may perhaps be grateful. [Koranic verse]    Dear brethren,    The accomplishment we celebrate today is one of my dearest  achievements, namely, the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation  of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. It was by  God's grace that I was able to fulfill my obligations seeking  only the reward of the exalted Lord.    As I take special pride in, and feel happy about, this  blessing conferred upon me and all Jordanians by the Lord, I  must admit that this joyous occasion is soured by the current  state of affairs of this nation and the suffering of its  peoples, especially the people of Jerusalem and Palestine. At  this moment, my memory takes me back to the morning of Thursday,  the 28th of Rabi' al-'Awwal, 1384 Hegira, corresponding to 6  August, 1964, when we celebrated in the city of Jerusalem the  completion of the first phase of the renovation of al-Aqsa  Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. May I recall the very  same words I addressed to the nation 30 years ago. The appeal I  made on that morning in the distant past was quite timely then  as it is now, for it was intended to alert the entire nation to  the dangers of fragmentation.    My exact words then were as follows:    As we celebrate today, we look beyond our immediate scope of  vision towards the millions of Arab and Muslims in Asia and  Africa who, at this moment, collectively set their eyes on  Palestine. Let me emphasize that the actual renovation of the  Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock assumes significance far  beyond the physical repair work on their actual site to include,  in addition to the salvation of the rock, the preservation of  its mosque and the maintenance of its dome, the complete  restoration of our full rights in our usurped land, the dear  Arab land [of Palestine]. [applause] I also said that this  country, my dear brethren, has for years been pursuing  development efforts at the same time when we were also defending  our homeland and nation. Palestine has always been the essence  of Jordan's pan-Arab message, figured prominently in our  national construction and defense efforts because Jordan lives  for Palestine and for its sake stands ready to sacrifice itself.    This was our plea then which was inspired by the eternal and  historic positions of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali on Palestine and its  holy shrines, positions which settled deep in our hearts and  came forth on our lips. They were later reinforced by Faysal  Bin-al-Husayn's battle cry, "Let us embrace death, brethren  Arabs." [applause] It was also impressively demonstrated by the  sincerity of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn in defending the holy  places and his comprehension of the dynamics of our age. It was  indeed his sense of duty which prompted him to accept the  supervision of the renovation work at al- Haram al-Sharif under  the patronage of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, as clearly documented in  the letter addressed to him in 1924 by the late Hajj Amin  al-Husayni, the then head of the supreme Islamic council, may  his soul rest in peace. It was 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn himself  who personally ascended to the roof of the Church of the Holy  Sepulcher to direct efforts to fight a fire that threatened the  structure of the church in 1949. Later, he offered the funds  needed for complete repair of damage to the church. Our  position toward all the sons of the nation today is no  different. It is the same position demonstrated by our soldiers  as they put up legendary resistance in defending the walls,  alleys and streets of Jerusalem in the June 1967 war. They were  the same brave servicemen who kept faith as they fought the  al-Karamah Battle as a perpetuation of their struggle for  Jerusalem. They were the ones who neither compromised Arab  rights nor did they waver in their determination to defend those  rights or face up to the oppression of the usurpers. The rights  I have in mind are the inalienable rights of the people of  Palestine, including the restoration of peace to al-Aqsa Mosque  and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque so that no worshiper there would ever  be terrorized by a murderer; so that Salah-al-Din's pulpit would  never be set ablaze by a bigot; so that children would never be  sprayed at point blank with gunfire by a usurper.    Brothers and Sisters of the noble nation: Thanks to our  firm belief in Almighty God and by virtue of faith and  determination of the righteous people, we have been able to  maintain our resolve. Our martyrs' blood was the light guiding  us to Jerusalem, the dear and precious city, the symbol of  steadfastness and the gem of peace. To us, the Hashemites,  Jerusalem has been an eternal trust of religious tolerance we  cherish in accordance with Caliph 'Umar's Covenant, consecrated  by Jordanian blood and a symbol of Arab and Muslim struggle.  Thus, our association with Jerusalem stands above the fray of  political ploys and earthly greed [applause] since it has been  anchored in the faith, prophethood, history, and martyrdom. We  will keep our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's  rights in it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city  [applause] in accordance with the international legitimacy and  so that sovereignty over its holy sites will only be for God. In  the name of God, the Almighty, the nation will be entitled to  religious jurisdiction in a manner that will be determined by  consensus. In this fashion, a link between the past and the  present will be maintained and [Caliph] 'Umar's Covenant will  continue to be a beacon lighting the road of relationship with  Jerusalem--the symbol, history, and holy shrines. What trust  could be dearer and more precious than our holy places in it!    Hence, in the name of the martyrs of Al al-Bayt [the House  of  the Prophet] and all the nation's martyrs, headed by the martyrs  of this dear Arab homeland, we appeal to the nation to rise in  order to rescue Jerusalem [applause] and to be able to confront  all forms of blockade, oppression, and estrangement. This  nation is worthy of freedom, glory, and life. Our grandfathers  chose to leave Hejaz earlier in this century in order to  spearhead its revolution. They carried the banners of freedom,  unity, and tolerance and shouldered the trust of the revolution  together--Muslims and Christians, Arabs and non-Arabs--united by  the banner of the Great Arab Revolt and the noble goals of  defending human rights and dignity. [applause]    For the sake of securing the peoples' right to  self-determination, al-Husayn Bin-'Ali said no to all forms of  colonization and usurpation. 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, too, said  no to all forms of division and loss. And today, we say no to  any solution that does not restore Arab sovereignty to Arab  Jerusalem [applause] so that the whole city would eventually  become a token and symbol of peace for all the faithful children  of Abraham, peace be upon him. In the same breath, we say no to  any solution that does not secure the historical and legitimate  rights of the people of Palestine on their sacred national soil  [applause]. And we say no to any peace the next generations do  not accept, safeguard, or defend because it does not represent  right, justice, and human dignity. [applause]    Dear brothers, distinguished guests:    Today, we celebrate the completion of renovation work at the  Dome of the Rock and our brethren in Jerusalem are observing the  same occasion. We are one and the same family. This event is  just another reminder of a long history of common heritage  marked by patience, cherished memories, and satisfaction. I pray  God to enable us to fulfill our obligation to the cause of  Islam. To this end, we have started construction work in this  country on the mausoleums of the Prophet's companions, may God  be pleased with them, since they were the first Muslims to set  foot on this land and elsewhere in the Muslim world. More so,  because they were either from the House of the Prophet or his  associates. This honor will include the other mujahidin who  followed in their steps. These mausoleums should be designed  and constructed as architectural masterpieces that display to  the generations to come the splendor of their achievements as  well as to serve as a source of inspiration to them. For this  land was the gate to the Islamic conquest through Mu'tah and  al-Yarmuk, and the passage to Muslim cavalier battalions to  Hittin and 'Ayn Jalut.    In the name of upright Islam, we also initiated work to  establish the 'Al al-Bayt [The House of the Prophet] University  which will be the gift of all members of the House of the  Prophet, peace be upon him, to the entire Islamic nation. The  institution is conceived to be an Islamic forum that encompasses  the glorious past history while it seeks to cope with the  challenges of the present and the future. Our ultimate goal is  to meet the Lord's wish that this nation will remain the most  favored among communities raised on this earth.    In the same vein, we have reached out to our brethren in the  newly independent Islamic republics. A team of our experts is  engaged now in providing assistance to those republics in a  number of areas, including education, construction, and culture.  We intended to help in the restoration of the Mausoleum of  al-Qutham Ibn-al-'Abbass in Samarkand to its original  magnificence, splendor, and beauty. We have also commissioned  the restoration of the splendid pulpit of Salah-al-Din at its  original site in the al-Aqsa Mosque. If anything, this is our  response to the malicious bigots who set it ablaze [in 1968].  We have engaged ourselves in this exercise secure in our  knowledge that history will ultimately do justice to this  nation. It was Nur-al-Din Zinki, the renowned Muslim martyr,  who ordered the artisans of Aleppo to perfect its manufacture,  and it was Salah-al-Din himself who moved it to Jerusalem 20  years after it had been built. It is my fervent hope now to see  it back in place one day and to attend a sermon there in which a  preacher would congratulate the nation on restoring Jerusalem to  the nation, free, dignified, and proud.    Dear brothers and sisters, the current plight of our nation  is a very severe one and the prognosis is grim indeed. I can  see no salvation except by ensuring genuine freedoms and making  sacrifices, in addition to enlightenment and clear vision. Only  then can we comprehend the evolution of history with a fresh  outlook which would enable us to instill into the younger  generation a sense of new hope to attain rejuvenation, revival,  scientific know-how and strength. This would also help us in  shaking ourselves loose from the sins of the current epoch of  weakness, the colonial designs, the oil curse, and oppressive  practices. Down this road, we would perhaps see an end to our  senseless hostilities and to the meaningless loss of our  resources and blood which are given away in the service of  foreign interests. Then, the whole nation would emerge free of  ethnic intolerance, religious extremism, or cultural  introversion.    To Jerusalem, the omnipresent city in our minds and hearts,  we send our greetings.    Without Jerusalem, our lives will always be lacking in  harmony. For Jerusalem represents our collective memory and  common faith. It stands for our epicenter of knowledge, vision,  and religious tolerance as exemplified in the Covenant of 'Umar  [Ibn-al-Khattab, the second caliph in early Islam]. It is the  focal point of our cherished freedom and dignified peace.    We will continue to warn against and then resist all  attempts at tampering with our Islamic holy shrines, at the  first of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim addresses  his prayers] and the third holiest mosque, in particular, and  throughout the Islamic world. We shall oppose any change in the  physical features of these shrines that might be effected under  false pretexts or repair, expansion, or renovation, or under any  other slogan. For such attempts might strip the nation of its  historical legacy to safeguard and maintain them. These  endeavors of ours will be mounted on behalf of and in  coordination with the entire Islamic nation with a view to  ensuring the preservation of its sacred common heritage.    Here, we must emphasize that the means to repair our holy  places in Jerusalem are known. They are the committees in  charge of this. I mean the Jordanian Awqaf Ministry and the  Commission on the Renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome  of the Holy Rock, which have been assuming their  responsibilities for decades. Palestine is determined to restore  its right to freedom. It enjoys an enlightened awareness that  it will triumph, God willing. We beseech God to have mercy on  the souls of its martyrs, from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam to the  worshipers at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque, [applause] and to make  us to always remember them and to be faithful to them.    O beloved ones who maintain their steadfastness on the land  of Palestine and those in fraternal Iraq who are courageously,  patiently facing the blockade. O those who are defending the  unity of your land, people, and spirit in beloved Yemen. O  Arabs and Muslims everywhere. Let me seize this moment to renew  the pledge initially undertaken by our forefathers that they  will bow their heads in submission to no one except to God, the  Almighty. They committed themselves to combating injustice and  oppression in a manner that behooves their lineage to Hamzah of  'Uhud, Ja'afar of Mu'ta, and al-Husayn of Karbala'.    Many a Hashemite martyr uttered in soliloquy: O Lord, I have  control over none but myself, which I offer in duty to their  cause. And many of them swore an oath to each other that they  would fight till death rather than retreat, surrender or  disgrace themselves. No wonder that their tombs are still  recognized throughout the larger homeland and their names are  held in high esteem by the nation. Their memories are  associated with holy events and places that are subject to no  authority other than that of the one united nation. Their souls  seek no permission for prayer at this mosque or that. After  all, they were the ones who in their deeds demonstrated to the  world the real difference between freedom and bondage, between  justice and oppression, between dignity and submission. In the  face of a sever crisis, their reaction has always been:  overwhelming stress demands overwhelming determination. That is  because their consuming dream was to see one united nation  living in justice and dignity; a nation that draws its strength  from its glorious past, despite all obstacles on the road,  severe limitations and dim prospects. And since our spirit of  challenge will never wane, we shall remain loyal to their  mission until the nation gains victory or we meet our Lord, the  Creator, as martyrs, for martyrdom would make up for victory in  the life hereafter if we failed to achieve it in our life.    If the response of the nation to the challenge on hand  appeared sometimes to be weak or limited, or if destruction,  fragmentation, poverty and hunger seemed to be spreading out of  control, then we should not feel despondent. Rather, we should  respond with resolve and determination to rise to the challenge  in order to develop a modern Islamic discourse and an integrated  model for civilized communal life which revives hope that the  whole nation could indeed be rebuilt from within in terms of its  thinking, orientation, vision and way of life, bearing always in  mind the need to safeguard freedoms, the purist of knowledge,  tolerance, and justice.    Dear brothers and sisters,    From this platform in Amman, which stands for the Arab  cause,  freedom and steadfastness, I say: Peace be upon Jerusalem and  greetings of peace from Jordanians to their kinsfolk there.  These are the Jordanians who never failed to respond to the  call of duty dictated by blood ties and their sense of morality.  These are the Jordanians who never lost vision of al-Aqsa  Mosque with all the sentiments of worship, martyrdom, and pride  it evokes in their souls.    Peace be upon Jerusalem of al-Faruk [Caliph 'Umar], of  Salah-al-Din, and of al-Husayn bin-'Ali.    Peace be upon its rock, and the First Qiblah, the site of  the  Prophet's night journey and his ascension therefrom to heavens.    Peace be upon the church of the Holy Sepulcher.    Peace goes from Jordan, who takes pride as its mantle, the  nation as its beloved one, and freedom as its wish. [applause]    Peace from the Jordanians whose spirit cannot be broken  during the time of apostasy, whose heads are not bound during  the siege, and whose steps do not go astray in times of darkness.    We send greetings of peace to the jewel of all the cities of  the nation. We pray for the rest of souls of all martyrs who  fell on its soil, of all worshipers who said their prayers in  its mosque and churches, of all scholars who went through its  schools. We salute all its inhabitants who are enduring the  oppression of the occupier while struggling for its freedom and  glory.    My dear brothers and sisters,    In closing, let me salute all of you and welcome once again  our guests who came from several places in the large homeland of  our nation. I should also like to pay tribute to all those who  contributed to the renovation effort, especially the  supervisors, designers, builders and artisans. I pray to Allah,  the Almighty, to guide us all along the right path to win His  satisfaction.    May God bring upon you one and all peace, compassion, and  blessings.</p>

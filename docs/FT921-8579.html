			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Watchdog again postpones Hyundai fundraising issues SOUTH Korea's Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) has decided to postpone for the sixth time applications by two subsidiaries of Hyundai, one of the country's leading conglomerates, to raise funds on the Seoul stock market, Reuter reports from Seoul. Hyundai Precision Industries and Hyundai Wood Industries have since July and August, respectively, sought approval to raise a total of Won68.7bn (Dollars 90m) through rights issues on the local stock market. The SSB said it delayed approval because the group had violated government advisory rules on financial management. Last year, the government instructed big shareholders not to sell large amounts of stock so as to help the ailing market. However, Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and ex-honorary chairman of Hyundai, had subsequently sold large stakes in the two companies, the SSB said. The companies would have to wait another month for an approval, it added. Stockbrokers said the news sparked heavy selling of Hyundai's shares. A letter of appeal to the SSB also depressed investors, reflecting concern over a possible credit crunch for Hyundai.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Mandela sets out moderate path for ANC MR Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday set a moderate tone for the deliberations of its policy conference when he said the organisation was challenged 'to avoid unrealistic expectations and to define a sober set of priorities'. Opening the conference in Johannesburg, Mr Mandela said members of the ANC were increasingly aware of the resource constraints that would face a future government, and that there would therefore be 'no quick fix to decades of apartheid destruction'. Mr Mandela said the Third World was littered with relics of liberation movements which had failed at the polls because of unfulfilled promises, lack of openness in policymaking and through adopting policies which their countries could not sustain. He said these were valuable lessons for the ANC to learn. Mr Mandela also gave notice, however, that the constitutional negotiation process in South Africa could be entering a difficult phase. The ANC and its allies were contemplating mass civil protests, possibly including a general strike, to place pressure on the government. He gave July as a deadline by which progress should be made in constitutional talks, and said the conference would consider activities 'to break the intransigence of the regime'. The four-day policy conference, being attended by 700 delegates, is the first such ANC conference since the drafting of the Freedom Charter at Kliptown in 1955. The charter, a romantic and aspirational document, has since taken on a totemic importance within ANC ranks. Ms Cheryl Carolus, a senior ANC official, said the task of the conference was 'to take that magnificent vision of ours, enshrined in the Freedom Charter, and make it tangible'. Mr Mandela also took time to reply to the provisional findings of the Goldstone Commission, a judicial inquiry into the causes of violence in the country. Judge Goldstone yesterday delivered a report in which he said the main cause of violence was the political struggle between the ANC and the mainly Zulu Inkatha organisation. Mr Mandela said the findings were superficial in two respects: attributing blame to the ANC and Inkatha was to ignore the role of the government and security forces in fostering this rivalry; and suggesting that the ANC and Inkatha were in the best position to stop the violence was to 'ignore the reality that it is the National party regime who wields state power'.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Israel defiant over territories' closure: Cabinet approves permits for 18,000 foreigners Israel prepared for a prolonged closure of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday, in spite of warnings from some of its ministers that it would impoverish Palestinians, harm Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and fuel violence in the territories. The cabinet agreed to grant new work permits for 18,000 foreign workers to be substitutes for Palestinian labourers banned from crossing into Israel, suggesting that the government is preparing for a extended closure of the occupied territories. The closure, to be reviewed by the cabinet next week, has serious implications for the already low standards of living of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who are dependent on income from jobs in Israel. By increasing Israel's trend towards independence and separation from the territories, the measure could also have negative implications for the long-term prospects of the Palestinian economy and for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which resumed in Cairo yesterday. Gen Matan Vilnai, army chief of the southern command, said the maintenance of a rigid closure policy, which has barred up to 70,000 Palestinians from travelling to their jobs in Israel, would provoke an upsurge in violence in the West Bank and Gaza. The territories were sealed on Thursday after extremist Islamic guerrillas killed eight Israelis. Cabinet ministers said the government was determined to maintain a lengthy closure to prevent Palestinians from making further attacks against Israelis. Although the cabinet agreed to review the closure at next Sunday's meeting, Mr Yacov Tzur, minister of agriculture, said a full closure would last until the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana in September 'to free ourselves from the dependence of Palestinians which endangers our security'. Left-wing cabinet ministers warned that a lengthy closure would impose tremendous suffering on the Palestinians and called for the immediate injection of increased aid into the territories to alleviate poverty. Mr Yair Tsaban, minister of absorption, feared the closure could harm peace talks and make it impossible for Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, to take over the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho under the Palestinian self-rule agreement currently being hammered out in Cairo. The cabinet move came hours before Israel and the PLO resumed talks in Cairo amid increasing Palestinian frustration and signs that it is now almost impossible for the two sides to reach final agreement before the April 13 deadline.</p>

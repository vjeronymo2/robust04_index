			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATA, Delta Airlines, North American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said that the proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements should not apply to military flights, e.g., Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and Military Airlift Command (MAC). ATA and Southwest Airlines also said that special charters for sports teams should be excluded from duty period limitations and rest requirements. Commenters stated that because of the short notification associated with military and special charters it would not be possible to obtain a waiver from the regulation to conduct them. North American Airlines stated that the proposed requirements should not apply to flights flown to remote destinations on a weekly or ad hoc basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company believe that the proposed requirements should not apply to operations that do not require a flight attendant. AMR Combs stated that many unscheduled operators do not employ full-time flight attendants and that a flight attendant may serve more than one certificate holder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to commenters who stated that the proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements should not apply to military flights and special charters, this final rule does not except military or special charter operations from duty period limitations and rest requirements. If a certificate holder chooses to apply the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest time limitations option to flight attendants when conducting military and special charter flights to retain operational flexibility by scheduling the flight attendants with the flight crewmembers, &sect;&sect;121.467(c) and 135.272(c) require that the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements option be applied to all flight operations conducted by the certificate holder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company, the FAA agrees with these commenters. The final rule will not apply to those operations where flight attendants are not required. However, all flight attendants who are assigned to duties in an aircraft for operations that require a flight attendant, including flight attendants in excess of the minimum flight attendant crew complement, are subject to duty limitations and rest requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an operator conducting operations on an aircraft with 19 passenger seats or less, which does not require a flight attendant under &sect;135.107, will not be required to meet flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements for flights conducted on that aircraft. However, if the operator's operations specifications state that the operator will provide a flight attendant for flights on that aircraft, then the operation does require a flight attendant. Therefore, for any flight attendant assigned to flight duties on that aircraft the certificate holder is required to meet the duty period limitations and rest requirements of &sect;135.273. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Duty Period Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed limiting flight attendant duty periods. Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(a) and 135.273(a) defined a duty period as the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by the certificate holder. The NPRM proposed that the time be calculated using either Coordinated Universal Time or the local time of the flight attendant's home base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven commenters submitted comments supporting or recommending revisions to this proposed definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Air Lines, Southwest Air Lines, and TWU Local 556 agreed with the FAA's proposed definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ALPA, APA, and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that duty periods should include non-flight duties. ALPA noted that ground duties can be as fatiguing as flight duties. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended that the definition of a duty period be replaced with: ``Any continuous period during which a flight attendant is required to carry out any task associated with the business of an aircraft operator.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the definition of duty period explicitly excludes reserve status, ATA recommended that the following phrase be added to the definition of duty period: ```Duty period' does not include time when a flight attendant is on reserve status assignment, free of any specifically assigned duties other than to report for a flight assignment within a specified period of time, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or company work rules.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to receiving comments on the definition of a duty period, the FAA also received comments on the duty period limitations proposed in the NPRM. The NPRM proposed to limit flight attendant duty periods based on the length of the duty period, the number of flight attendants assigned to a crew, and the amount of rest following the duty period. The proposed rule contained provisions (proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(b) and 135.273(b)) to prohibit an operator from assigning a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours unless certain conditions are met. An operator would be allowed to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period up to 20 hours, if the operator: (1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement; and (2) schedules an extended rest period following the duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thirteen commenters submitted comments on issues pertaining to flight attendant duty period limits. The comments addressed the use of ``scheduled'' versus ``actual'' duty periods, addressed the effect of the proposed duty limits on unscheduled operators, made recommendations to the proposals, and provided proposed duty period limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, and TWU Local 556 addressed the use of ``scheduled'' duty periods as opposed to ``actual'' duty periods. Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 agreed that the proposed duty period limitations should be ``scheduled,'' not ``actual.'' TWU Local 556 stated that, if this flexibility is not retained, the following would occur: (1) Flight attendants would be replaced after 14 hours of actual duty, which inconveniences passengers and causes delays because of the need to locate crew replacements; (2) reserves would be placed at out stations; (3) crews would be rerouted to cover flights that the original crews cannot perform; (4) flight attendants would lose days off and have their schedules disrupted; (5) additional costs for crews and stranded passengers would be incurred; and (6) aircraft repositioning would be required. However, the Coalition stated that there is no justification for having no limit on actual hours and added that the actual number of flight attendant duty hours per day needs to be limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMR Combs stated that scheduled duty period limitations should apply only to scheduled operations with more than 19 passenger seats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters, including NAA, recommended revisions to the proposed duty period limitations. NAA recommended that a layover of 4 to 5 hours during which a hotel room is provided should not count as duty time. Other comments recommended limiting duty to: (1) 16 hours in 24 hours with 11 hours of flight time in domestic operations; (2) 30 hours in 5 days; (3) 16 hours with no more than 10 hours of flight time; or (4) 12 hours for flights with multiple stops. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions submitted an alternative proposal to the NPRM that included duty period limitations. This alternative divided duty period limitations according to domestic, international, and long-range flights. The Coalition's alternative proposed to limit: (1) Scheduled duty periods on domestic flights to no more than 14 hours and actual duty periods to 15 hours; (2) scheduled duty periods on international flights to no more than 16 hours and actual duty periods to 17 hours; and (3) actual duty periods on long-range flights to no more than 4 hours greater than the scheduled duty time, not to exceed 20 hours. The Coalition distinguished between domestic and international duty periods and stated that it reluctantly includes a 20-hour duty period for long range international flights to accommodate new generation aircraft, but only if additional rest is provided. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

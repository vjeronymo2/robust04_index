			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BT shrugs off profits decline FULL-YEAR results from BT were generally well received in spite of showing the company's first-ever drop in profits. The figures came in just below most market forecasts but the maintained dividend and better than expected news on restructuring costs helped the shares rebound from an initial fall. The fully-paid closed 8 up at 360p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 ahead at 138 1/2 p, in turnover of 12m and 31m respectively. Few fresh details of BT's business emerged from the analysts' meeting, which one described as 'thoroughly ordinary'. However, there were firm hints that the management was confident of strong dividend growth. Lower than expected redundancy provisions were also welcomed. Analysts remained divided over the group's prospects. Regulatory worries head the list of concerns, although most agree that the shares are relatively cheap and are likely to attract attention in the short-term. County NatWest reiterated its positive stance, while James Capel, which had been a seller, declared itself more positive. Most brokers shaved their forecasts back to around Pounds 2.95bn for the current year and Pounds 3.3bn for next year. Lasmo retreats Oil exploration company Lasmo once again suffered the biggest percentage fall among the 100 FT-SE index constituents as analysts continued to remind investors of the question marks hanging over the group's earnings. The shares closed 7 off at 192p after 4.1m traded, having been 11 down at one stage. The effect of SG Warburg Securities' hefty forecast dividend cut on Tuesday was still overhanging the stock and County NatWest told clients yesterday: 'The only real support for the shares comes from the net asset value of 192p and the recurrent bid speculation.' Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull also reiterated its sell recommendation on Lasmo in its general monthly review of the oil sector. Talk in the market that Lloyds Bank might bid for Prudential if it fails in its approach for Midland Bank was said to be behind the strength in the life insurer. Prudential was up 7 at 268p against the market with 3.5m traded. Analysts were wary of the story, pointing out that Lloyds already had two life companies and did not need another. However, Prudential also benefited from encouraging new business figures released yesterday. Lloyds fell 9 to 430p in reaction to news that the Office of Fair Trading had referred its possible bid for Midland Bank to the Department of Trade and Industry. Meanwhile, the European Commission approved Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's bid for Midland, which held firm at 399p on good turnover of more than 8.1m shares. A Pounds 50m provision by Standard Chartered against possible illegal transactions in its Bombay branch prompted analysts to sharply downgrade 1992 profits forecasts and the shares lost 5 to 511p. Smith New Court lowered its estimate to Pounds 230m from Pounds 265m and Robert Fleming Securities came down to Pounds 205m from Pounds 255m, while BZW is considering a similar reduction from its Pounds 250m forecast. Discount house and financial services group Gerrard &amp; National gained 18 to 320p on announcing pleasing results and a higher final dividend. The foods sectors stayed under a cloud, with the unfounded threat that a price war in the retail area was imminent depressing many of the leading stocks. J. Sainsbury, which had been the rumoured instigator as the story surfaced late on Wednesday, was said to have denied the talk. Among food manufacturers, Hillsdown slipped 6 to 180p, Tate &amp; Lyle 5 to 400p, Unigate 7 to 360p and United Biscuits 4 1/2 to 400 1/2 p. In the retailing sector, Argyll Group shed 6 to 351p, Kwik Save 9 to 616p, Sainsbury 7 to 458p and Tesco 6 to 274p. Financial worries continued to overhang Eurotunnel, which ended 11 lower at 370p in thin trade. A sizeable retreat was also recorded in Paris. Transport Development Group lost 7 to 298p after the resignation of the chief executive of the group's French subsidiary. Profit-taking after the recent run sent NFC down 3 to 279p. Forth Ports added 7 at 166p, with Smith New Court said to be positive on the stock. Demand for P &amp; O continued, the shares firming a penny to 545p. William Cook dropped 47 to 283p after reporting full-year profits of Pounds 4.7m, sharply down from last year's Pounds 12.2m. Cookson Group moved up 3 to 160p ahead of today's annual meeting. Fisons was volatile in an otherwise lifeless pharmaceuticals sector as a spate of highly dubious rumours circulated. The shares were up 9 in the morning as speculation of takeover bids from ICI or Hanson, and of approval for its Opticrom and Tilade drugs, did the rounds. However, the rumours were eventually discounted and the stock fell to close a net 7 down at 359p. After a weak spell over the past couple of days, Wellcome recovered 10 to 977p as the shares were marked up on very little turnover. There was no relief for ICI shares, however, which receded 13 to 1347p. SmithKline Beecham firmed 3 to 870p after announcing that its new Relafen drug had taken 5.6 per cent of US anti-arthritic prescription sales in its first two months on the market. Packaging group Bunzl put on 3 to 117p following a cautious annual statement. Dolphin Packaging lost 15 to 134p after a profits warning, while Ferry Pickering dipped 5 to 115p, reflecting halved interim profits. Full-year results from Storehouse came in at the top end of expectations, which together with an upbeat presentation, saw the shares climb 3 to 140p on 5.8m traded. County NatWest is looking for Pounds 26m in the current year, and Pounds 40m in 1993 - although analyst Ms Kimlan Cooke warned of 'a very long haul' for the BhS and Habitat group. A big buyer in search of First Leisure stock forced the price up 7 to 336p. A Pounds 150m disposal by Automated Security lifted the shares 18 to 144p and prompted a buy note from BZW. Textiles and electronics group S. Jerome forged ahead 14 to 69p after the chairman announced at the annual meeting that demand was above the previous year's level. Parkland, which covers a similar area of business, basked in the optimism, advancing 7 to 180p. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Christopher Price, Joel Kibazo. Other market statistics, Page 28.

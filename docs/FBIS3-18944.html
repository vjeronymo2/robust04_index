			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "BDI: Business Location Far From </F> Secured"]    [Text] According to Tyll Necker, president of the  Federation of German Industries (BDI), efforts to improve  business location in Germany have shown a substantial increase  lately, but "the number still has to be increased considerably."    The "massive trend" to transfer production to cheaper  locations continues in German industry. At the same time,  foreign companies have only a limited interest in investing in  Germany. Due to high labor costs, Germany has lost 10 percent  in world markets over the past few years. Necker welcomed the  fact that the costs of the latest wage round in the metal  industry are "practically zero." What is worrying, however, is  that it was not possible to increase working hours.    Necker said that "an incredible amount of legal work  disappears in the shadow economy." Therefore, the deductions  from wages that are far too high, with taxes and social  contributions currently amounting to 46 percent of the gross  wages, must be reduced together with the surcharge on companies'  labor costs. This is the only way to reduce the "wedge" between  legal and illicit work and to increase the opportunities for  legal work that exist in many fields.    Necker cautioned against considering his meeting with Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politicians as spectacular.  "We have not switched to the other camp"; industry has always  been open-minded and has always discussed technical problems  with all democratic forces. Thus, Kohl, Rexrodt, and Scharping  will be speaking at the BDI annual conference on 31 May. In  fact, the SPD is still thinking "too much in terms of  redistribution." It is not a matter of adding a burden here and  reducing one there, but significant cuts must be made in the  public sector. The public share must be reduced to the 45.6  percent it was before reunification.    Necker expects the economy to show an "upward trend without  momentum" in the course of this year. Orders, particularly from  overseas, are increasing considerably. Engineering is one  sector where the export situation has clearly improved, while  domestic demand has further declined from a basis that was low  anyhow.    In the new laender, there are "clear positive developments  in  certain fields." These include the construction industry and  related sectors, in particular. The development of east German  industry producing for local markets is "basically positive."  Meanwhile, there are the first positive signs in the  "transfrontier sector." The situation is, however, critical in  the chemical industry and in large parts of the electrical and  engineering industries.</p>

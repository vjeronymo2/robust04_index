			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER VOICES SPEAK ON BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> A major problem in the U.S. today is that so few people are willing to suffer  anything painful, so we tolerate taking drugs, "dumbing down" our education,  and, in general, making ourselves weaker and weaker.  </P> <P> Although Leticia Quezada suffered pain having to learn English in our schools,  the fact is that it made her a stronger, more successful person.  </P> <P> What is her complaint about the way she turned out? If she really cared about  immigrant children and their future in this country, she'd say to them, "Sure,  I know it's painful, but you can do it, and in the long run, you'll be better  off."  </P> <P> CALLIE WEISS, Los Angeles  </P></p>

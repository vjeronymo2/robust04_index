			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: IMF to fund Russia on performance, not promises Sir, Jeffrey Sachs asserts ('IMF 'is missing its big chance' ', November 11) that the International Monetary Fund 'was told this year to spend USDollars 13bn on Russian reform'. As an adviser to the Russian government, Sachs should know that the IMF was not 'told' to do anything of the sort. The main industrial countries said publicly this year that if economic reform and stabilisation in Russia proceeded in line with agreed targets, the IMF could make available Dollars 13bn to Russia. But Russia did not implement its stabilisation plans - for example, inflation continues to run at an annual rate of more than 1,000 per cent. The disbursement of IMF funds must be linked to actual performance and not merely, as Sachs seems to imply, to hopes and promises. Sachs complains that the IMF is not 'now negotiating with the Russians'. In fact, the IMF staff have been, and continue to be, in close contact with senior Russian officials in Moscow, and are discussing in detail the measures needed to achieve financial stabilisation and reform. As in the past, we stand ready to agree on the further use of IMF resources as soon as the Russian authorities as a whole are in a position to commit themselves to and implement, on a sustained basis, a strong adjustment programme.

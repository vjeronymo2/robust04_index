			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Southeastern Turkey is once again facing  turbulent times as migration from the region to neighboring  north Iraq continues.    Twelve thousand people have fled from villages in Sirnak and  Hakkari in the past two months, causing the Iraqis to take tight  security measures at the border with Turkey.    The refugees, who first started to move into Iraq in  February, claim that their villages were burned down by  Government security forces and that they had been put under  intense pressure to leave.    Observers from various organizations formed a delegation,  under the auspices of the privately run Turkish Human rights  Association, to visit and talk with the refugees who are in  seven different camps, 15 kilometers inside the Iraqi border.  The observer's report will be sent to the United Nations  Commission of Human Rights, the Red Cross and other  international groups.    After examining the camps, delegation chairman Akin Birdal  said "the picture I saw hurt my conscience" and added that six  more villages had been evacuated and burned by Government  security forces.    He also told reporters that the villagers who wanted to  leave  the Turkish side were hindered by the security forces.    Chairman Birdal called for help with the refugee problem  which he also discussed with the UN Zakho representative Ayman  Garibeh and the governor of Dahuk, 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Tayyib. "The  condition of the refugees is not very good, our medical teams  visit the camps twice a week and we give them food provided by  the World Food Fund. We have solved the refugees' water and  sanitation problems. During our health inspections we found 20  cases of malaria and treated them," declared UN Zakho  representative Ayman Garibeh in a statement.    Ayman answered a question regarding the granting of  political  status to the refugees and said.    "We are only concerned with providing humanitarian aid, our  centers in Ankara and Geneva are currently busy with this issue  and they will decide on this but anyone who crosses the border  is considered a refugee and they are not forced to return," and  added that the UN is trying to solve this problem.    The governor of Dahuk said that the refugees fleeing from  the  Turkish side are causing them problems since the United Nations  had demanded that the camps should be established on government  land and that refugees should be provided with pasture areas for  their animals.    He continued, ``the refugees have put us in a difficult  situation. The migration started one year ago with a trickle of  people and it was very easy for us to find them a place to  settle but lately the numbers have increased dramatically and  with our limited resources we are not able provide adequate help.    ``Housing in the cities is a big problem since four thousand  villages were destroyed in the Gulf war and we settled them into  cities.'' He also said that they were sharing the food aid they  received with the refugees.    The Human Rights delegation reported that 12 thousand  refugees lived in Hizava, Tilkabar, Dorka, Foraq, Zakho, Buhery  and Sharanish camps. [place names as published]    According to the report living conditions in the camps are  not good.    After the three day visit to the camps, Akin Birdal gave a  statement to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbakir and said  "The aid given to the refugees is not adequate and every one of  us is responsible. We call on everyone to help. These people  cannot survive the winter and most of them want to return to  their home country but democratic regulations are necessary."</p>

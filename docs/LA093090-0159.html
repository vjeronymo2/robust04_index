			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCILVAINE INTERVIEWS FOR PADRES' GM SLOT  </P> <P> Joe McIlvaine, New York Mets vice president/baseball operations, said Saturday  night that he recently interviewed for the Padre general manager opening, but  refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> Reached at his Tuckahoe, N.Y., home, McIlvaine said in a telephone interview  that he was in California a week ago to interview for the job, but declined to  say whether he'd accept, if offered.  </P> <P> "I've been out there, I've talked with them," McIlvaine said, "but that's all I  can tell you. I'm sorry, I'm just not going to comment any further."  </P> <P> However, Newsday reported in today's editions that McIlvaine will go to the  Padres, and the announcement could come as soon as today.  </P> <P> Newsday reported that its source said the announcement might be put off until  the Mets are officially eliminated from contention for the National League East  title. One victory by the Pittsburgh Pirates or a loss by the Mets would  accomplish that.  </P> <P> Tom Werner, Padre chairman, who has been conducting the interviews, declined to  comment, as he has throughout the search process.  </P> <P> McIlvaine, 42, is one of six candidates that the Padres are known to have  interviewed for the position. However, he is the highest ranking of any of the  candidates interviewed, and is the only one of the group who directly is  involved in the trading of players.  </P> <P> Although the Padres are keeping mum, McIlvaine would appear to be the leading  candidate of the group because of his qualifications. He joined the Mets in  November 1980 as the director of scouting, subsequently became assistant vice  president/director of player personnel, and in November 1985 was promoted to  his present position. Previously, he had spent five years in the Detroit Tiger  organization as a minor-league pitcher, and was a scout with the Orioles,  Angels and Brewers.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest question to the Padre ownership is whether McIlvaine would  accept an offer. The New York Times, attributing their information to sources  close to McIlvaine, reported that McIlvaine is willing to leave.  </P> <P> The other candidates who have been interviewed for the vacancy, and who still  are interested, are: Bob Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of the  Minnesota Twins; Walt Jocketty, director of baseball administration of the  Oakland Athletics; Dan Duquette, assistant general manager of the Montreal  Expos; Gordon Ash, assistant general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays; and  Roger Jongewaard, vice president/scouting and player development of the Seattle  Mariners.  </P> <P> McIlvaine's name has popped up in the past for general manager vacancies, but  he discouraged interest, expressing his desire to stay with the Mets and become  their general manager when Frank Cashen retires.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported that McIlvaine's thinking has changed, primarily  because Cashen still isn't ready for retirement. Also, McIlvaine reportedly is  weary of being heavily criticized for his recent trades, such as sending  outfielder Lenny Dykstra and reliever Roger McDowell to the Philadelphia  Phillies in exchange for outfielder Juan Samuel.  </P></p>

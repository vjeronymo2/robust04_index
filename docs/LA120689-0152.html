			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NEW YORK PASSES TOUGH VDT LAW  </P> <P> The City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and safety of  more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals.  </P> <P> The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in  a major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition  of labor unions and occupational safety and health groups.  </P> <P> The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city agencies be  given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to work at a terminal for  more than two consecutive hours.  </P> <P> Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including  pregnancy -- would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some studies have suggested  prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of miscarriage.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Calm has not returned to Cuanza Norte Province  yet. Fierce clashes are continuing in the area of  Dange-ia-Menha. After realizing that their militarist adventure  against the area is a dream that will never come true, the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party forces  are now desperately looking for ways to get back to Dondo. They  are under siege, however, and it is getting tighter all the  time. [passage omitted] In clashes at 1500 GMT yesterday, as  the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA,  were trying to make their way back to Dondo, they left on the  ground 10 dead soldiers, hundreds of wounded soldiers, two burnt  out T-55 and T-66 tanks [words indistinct] and 20 cargo  vehicles, also burnt out. Our forces also captured one 130-mm  cannon. The other FAPLA forces are last in the jungle at this  stage.</p>

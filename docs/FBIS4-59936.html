			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 18, INA--News of New York mentioned  that the UN Security Council last evening held a session to  review what had been implemented of the Resolution 687 and the  measures required for lifting the embargo.    Majority of the members of the Council save the United  States  and Britain expressed their confirmation that nothing negative  to be issued against Iraq.    Following the discussions the Russian permanent delegate to  the UN expressed strong hope that the Security Council would  acknowledge next July what Iraq had achieved of positive steps  in implementing provisions of the Resolution 687.    The Russian delegate told journalists following the  Council's  deliberations that the Russian stance toward the blockade  against Iraq was a practical one and simple depending on the  fact that Iraq had made good steps and the Security Council had  to admit that and "we have proposed that on the council."    The French ambassador to the United Nations expressed his  belief that the general feeling at the Council was that Iraq had  accomplished a progress in the area of cooperation with the  special commission. He said the French stance was still the  same since the previous reviewal, i.e. there was a progress in  the field of weapons and monitoring and that "we are with the  legal reading of the Resolution 687 which means that soon after  Ekeus and the director general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency informed the Council that the monitoring was  working safely the council would give the green light to lift  the embargo on exporting the Iraqi oil."</p>

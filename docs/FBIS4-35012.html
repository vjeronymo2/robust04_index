			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 26 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Panamanian  President Guillermo Endara today pardoned former Colonel Roberto  Diaz Herrera, who precipitated the Panamanian crisis of 1987  that culminated with the 1989 U.S. invasion. Endara issued a  decree stating that the charges against Diaz Herrera were for  acts of subversion and opposition to the military dictatorship  of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, acts which, "far from  being dishonorable under the current democracy," should be  described as "meritorious."    Diaz Herrera, who was pardoned along with seven other  persons, including his nephew Zoroel, had been sentenced by a  Panamanian court on 22 December 1987 to five years in prison.  The former chief of staff of the defunct Defense Forces left  for Venezuela following a pardon issued on 24 December 1987 by  former President Eric Arturo Delvalle. After living in Caracas  for a time, Diaz Herrera moved to Argentina, where he currently  resides.</p>

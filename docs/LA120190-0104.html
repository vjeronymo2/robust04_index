			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> FUTURE NOT AN ISSUE FOR BROWNS' COACH  </P> <P> Interim Coach Jim Shofner, who will lead the Browns against the Rams in  Cleveland Sunday, said he hasn't really concerned himself with whether he will  be back next season.  </P> <P> "I haven't even thought otherwise, really," Shofner said.  </P> <P> "You start doing the job, you just assume you're going to do it from now on,  and that's the way I'm thinking. And how it'll work out, I don't know. But no  one has said 'This is your job' by any means."  </P> <P> Quarterback Bernie Kosar, who worked closely with Shofner when Shofner was  former coach Bud Carson's offensive coordinator, made it clear where he stands.  </P> <P> "I think the players are looking for some stability and respect Jim Shofner,"  Kosar said.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson said there is no reason to fear the chilly weather in  Cleveland Stadium.  </P> <P> "Supposed to be in the 40s," Robinson said. "I think when it's bad is when it  gets down to the 20s. Thirties are not bad. Forties aren't bad. I don't think  we anticipate problems there with the weather." TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

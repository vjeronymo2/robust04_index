			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UN, EC push for autonomy solution: Krajina Serbs urged to drop calls for independence from Croatia UNITED NATIONS and European Community mediators have advised representatives of the Krajina Serbs to drop demands for independence from Croatia if they want to reach a durable peace settlement with Croatia at talks which began at the UN yesterday. Instead, the mediators are pushing for a solution under which the Krajina Serbs, like the Albanian majority in Kosovo, would be given a large measure of autonomy within Croatia, in the first case, and Serbia in the second. There could be no question of a change in national borders unless they were agreed by all parties involved, a conference spokesman said. Krajina Serbs, represented by Mr Goran Hadzic and Mr Mile Paspalj, respectively self-styled president of the assembly and foreign minister, began the presentation of their case to Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen yesterday before Croatian representatives join the negotiations tonight or on Thursday. The international mediators, already heavily involved in the search for a solution of the Bosnian conflict, have been asked by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, also to broker an agreement between the Croats and the Krajina Serbs as a basis for a long-term renewal of the UN protection force's mandate in Croatia. Pending such an agreement, Mr Boutros Ghali has proposed an interim extension of the Unprofor mandate, due to expire on February 21, until March 31. Last week Mr Boutros Ghali indicated that the failure to implement the original UN peacekeeping plan of January 2, 1992, and to negotiate a settlement of the conflict between Croatia and the Serb populations living in UN protected areas and Serb-controlled so-called 'pink zones,' were at the root of the problem. They were among the main causes of the recent Croat offensive in Krajina. Reuter adds: Mr Vance is expected to quit the peace talks once the New York stage of negotiations is completed, diplomats said last night.</p>

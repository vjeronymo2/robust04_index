RESULTS DUE Pilkington, the glass maker, reports interim results on Thursday and is expected to see profits fall once more, and cut the dividend after a reduction in the year-end dividend in June. There is a wide range of estimates, with the pessimists expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m or less, against Pounds 50.6m, after more exceptional costs. Interim results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle today should reflect tougher trading conditions in the beer market and two disappointing summer months for its UK holiday operations. A 5 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 110m is forecast. Siebe, the engineering systems and controls group, looks set to continue its solid performance since its Pounds 357m acquisition in 1990 of US group Foxboro. Analysts forecast a modest improvement in pre-tax profit to Pounds 76.5m (Pounds 75.2m) for the six months to September, when results are published tomorrow. The interim dividend is likely to be increased marginally, to 3.3p. - last year's payout was 6.05p, but there was a one-for-one capitalisation issue in September. Airtours, the UK's third largest package holiday company, should report today pre-tax profits of between Pounds 34m and Pounds 36m for the year to September, against Pounds 27.5m last time. It is thought the group will have net cash of more than Pounds 100m, having bought for Pounds 16m the Pickfords travel agency chain from NFC in September. The full-year dividend is likely to be 6.5p (5.75p). Also reporting today is Westland, the helicopter group. Profits should edge up from last time's Pounds 23.7m to about Pounds 24m, or Pounds 24.5m at the most. The group's order gap could continue until after 1994, when it is possible there will be no helicopter deliveries. So profits could stay at the current level for the next couple of years, until the EH101 reaches completion. Exceptional charges for redundancies are likely to be down but then so are operating profits. The final dividend will probably be held at 2.75p for an unchanged 4p total. Carlton Communications, the television and video group, is likely to report tomorrow a rise of some 15 per cent in pre-tax profits for the year ended September to around Pounds 102m. Expectations are that Thursday's pre-tax profit at Great Universal Stores - the mail-order, financial services and property group - will increase in line with the prediction by Lord Wolfson, chairman, at the annual meeting in October that profits would be 'somewhat ahead'. The market sees an improvement to Pounds 193m (Pounds 187m) in the half-year to September, with a relatively small increase on the 12.75p dividend recommended last time. Compass Group, the catering and hospitals concern that recently bought the Travellers Fare snack shops business, is expected to report a rise of about Pounds 3m in annual pre-tax profit to Pounds 35m. While both sides of the business have proved robust, questions at Thursday's meeting will focus on the impact of unemployment on staff canteens and the squeeze at private hospitals. Looking ahead, Compass's penetration of the huge catering market in state hospitals and schools will be one of the issues, as will its plans for expansion overseas now that it seems unlikely to buy any part of its rival Gardner Merchant.</p>

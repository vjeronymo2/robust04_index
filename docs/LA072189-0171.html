			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUSH'S CLEAN-AIR BILL UNDER FIRE  </P> <P> President Bush's clean-air bill, which was formally presented to Congress  today, drew criticism from a key senator and environmentalists because it would  ease an early draft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution and  provide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns.  </P> <P> Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chief Senate sponsor of clean-air legislation, said  the final language of Bush's bill "will significantly tarnish his image to be  the environmental President." Baucus said the bill would increase motor vehicle  emissions, allow cities too much time to clean air and give too much weight to  cost in toxic chemical cleanup.  </P> <P> The latest version of the proposal would push back new vehicle emissions  standards and would give the EPA administrator discretion to delay new  regulations even further.  </P></p>

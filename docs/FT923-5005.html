			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Templeton Galbraith surges to Dollars 45m Templeton Galbraith &amp; Hansberger, the Bermuda-based fund manager which agreed recently to merge with California's Franklin Resources, saw pre-tax profits surge from Dollars 33.6m to Dollars 45.2m (Pounds 22.7m) in the half-year to June 30. The rise reflected increased funds under management, aided by sharply lower US interest rates which encouraged American investors to switch out of low-yielding cash funds into equity-based mutual fund products.</p>

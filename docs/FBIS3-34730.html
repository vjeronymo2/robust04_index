The court  describes the uprising against the ISA as a rebellion and its  perpetrators as rebels. According to a report by Bakhtar  Information Agency, the leadership and officials of the Supreme  Court of the ISA held a session at the headquarters of the  Supreme Court yesterday. In the meeting they insisted that  because the president of the ISA has been elected by the  Resolution and Settlement Council, and later this election was  approved under different agreements by leaders and jihadi  parties or their representatives, obedience to him is the  Islamic duty of all citizens of the country. As a high judicial  source of the country, the Supreme Court supports the order of  the president for jihad against the infamous triangle of  Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin, and it asks our all faithful people to  take part in this holy jihad.</p>

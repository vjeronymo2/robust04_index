			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Few rally to Bhutto cause Pakistan's opposition leader, Ms Benazir Bhutto yesterday failed to attract big crowds to support a 'long march' aimed at massing popular backing to oust Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, Reuter reports from Arifwala. Her campaign began on November 18 when she and her supporters tried to march from Rawalpindi to nearby Islamabad. Police broke up that march and arrested hundreds of people. She accuses Mr Sharif's Islamic Democratic Alliance of rigging the 1990 elections.</p>

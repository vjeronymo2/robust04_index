			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 3 May, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima (parliament)  Legal Committee passed for the second reading in plenary session  a draft law on storage and disposal of Soviet security service  archives.    The committee wants the bill to be considered on Thursday [5  May], said its head Aivars Endzins.    After the third reading, the law could take effect 27 or 28  May, Endzins prognosticated.    The law would be used to test the alleged KGB collaboration  of five MPs, among them Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs and  Minister for Special Tasks Edvins Inkens.    The committee supplemented the bill with rights for defense  lawyer and the order of appeal.    If the court finds that the deputies were KGB operatives,  their mandates will be nullified and the ruling can be regarded  as basis to break work or service relations.    The fact that the deputies were mentioned in KGB files alone  does not testify about their collaboration because information  on results of cooperation is lacking.</p>

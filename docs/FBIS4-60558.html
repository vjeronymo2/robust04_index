The brother president and supreme commander called on the  rest of the brothers who were misled by the gang of secession  and rebellion to join their brothers and colleagues in the Armed  Forces, and the ranks of unity and legitimacy, to benefit from  the general amnesty declaration, and to seize this opportunity  in order to prove their sincere nationalism, love for their  homeland, and their concern for its higher interests. He noted  that they will get every care and will enjoy the same rights and  duties of their brothers in the Armed Forces.    The president beseeched God to have mercy on the souls of  the  righteous martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of  unity and the homeland. He said the successes achieved by our  Armed Forces against the forces of apostasy and secession were  the result of support from God and the masses of our people in  the battle of right against falsehood, good against evil, and  the battle of triumphing for unity, because it is the banner of  pride, dignity, and prosperous future [words indistinct].</p>

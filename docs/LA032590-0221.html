			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOO BUSY FOR WORDS  </P> <P> In regard to the March 8 edition of "48 Hours," I was depressed, maddened and  confused to see those various episodes of people so busy, busy, busy.  </P> <P> Get it done! Let's move in the fast lane! Gotta stay on the go-that's the name  of the game in this day and age! All very efficient.  </P> <P> So much so that their children are ignored. "Well, the kids have a busy  schedule too."  </P> <P> OK. But where and when does all this busy efficiency filter down to the common  folk? Every time I call someone, I get a recording saying they're busy, "but  we'll get right back to you" -- rarely is that the case. A letter mailed with  an enclosed self-addressed, stamped envelope is seldom returned. I have an  automobile accident (not my fault), and it takes weeks just for an insurance  man to look at it.  </P> <P> Just what is being done by these movers and shakers?  </P> <P> William W. Campbell, Glendale  </P></p>

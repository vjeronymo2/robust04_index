			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE FREES 3 IN EL SALVADOR RIGHT-WING KIDNAP PROBE  </P> <P> A judge, citing a lack of evidence, has freed two former Salvadoran military  officers and an industrialist jailed three years ago in a highly publicized  probe into right-wing kidnapings.  </P> <P> Judge Juan Hector Larios on Friday ordered the release of former Lt. Rodolfo  Lopez Sibrian, former Maj. Jose Alfredo Jimenez Moreno and industrialist  Orlando Llovera Ballete.  </P> <P> Larios also canceled arrest warrants for five other people, including a former  army colonel.  </P> <P> The government alleged that Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian posed as  guerrillas to capture five businessmen in exchange for about $5 million between  1980 and 1985.  </P> <P> The two were reported to be close friends of Roberto d'Aubuisson, founder of  the ultra-conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena. The party's  candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, won the March 16 presidential election and was  officially named president-elect on Saturday.  </P> <P> The judge declared null the acts of a military judge who in 1986 started the  proceedings.  </P> <P> Larios said that statements from witnesses on the kidnapings were not reliable  and that there is insufficient evidence to hold the men.  </P> <P> When police captured Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian in March, 1986, it was  widely viewed as the start of a case that would pit the administration of  Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte against the conservative  sectors of the military.  </P> <P> Lopez Sibrian also was implicated in the 1981 murders of two American land  advisers -- Mark David Pearlman of Seattle and Michael P. Hammer of Potomac,  Md. -- and a Salvadoran agrarian reform official.  </P> <P> The charges against Lopez Sibrian, who was later dismissed from the army, were  dropped because of lack of evidence.  </P> <P> Pearlman and Hammer were advising the government on a land reform program that  took thousands of acres from wealthy families for peasant use.  </P> <P> Five years later, two former army corporals were convicted in the case. The  U.S. government later maintained that the "intellectual authors" of the crime  had not been brought to justice.  </P></p>

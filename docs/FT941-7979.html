			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: 'I marvel at how real the experience of flying is' 'I'm in an unfamiliar living room with a large glass sliding door looking out on to a garden. l notice a brilliant flash of light and I'm struck by the thought that it is the flash of a nuclear explosion. I quickly run behind a large sofa to protect myself from the coming shock wave of the blast. 'l suddenly realise that the flash of light may be from the DreamLight mask and so this must be a dream] I walk outside into the garden and try to fly. It's a little awkward at first, but then I slowly rise. I marvel at how real this experience of flying is. It's an exhilarating feeling flying over the roof tops of surrounding houses. l fly into a forest and notice the deep yellow sunlight filtering through the dark green foliage of the trees. I begin to lose the dream and wake up.' This was a lucid dream this writer had using the DreamLight system. While the DreamLight helps to achieve lucid dream states, some preparation is required. First, dream recall must be increased. Some people claim never to dream, but this is not true. Everyone has about four to seven dreams per night, but not everyone remembers their dreams. It is possible to have lucid dreams and to be unaware of the experience because dream recall is poor or non-existent. Improving dream recall is achieved by keeping a journal of dreams. Upon waking, the dream should be be written down, even if it is just a momentary fragment. Waiting even just a few minutes to record a dream often results in forgetting its details completely. LaBerge discovered that since dream reality is so convincing, a reality check must be made to answer the question: 'Is this a dream?'. Thus when DreamLight users notice ordinary flashing lights during the day, they should ask themselves this question. 'A reality check involves finding some writing, like on a banknote or a book page. You read a couple of words, then look away. In a dream, the words will have changed when you look at them again,' says LaBerge. 'For some reason, while the dreaming human brain can model reality so convincingly, it cannot maintain consistency with printed or written words.' The DreamLight functions must also be adjusted for each user. Some DreamLight users report that it is uncomfortable to wear the sleep mask and that the flashing light wakes them. Other users say that they sleep through the flashing lights and fail to see the signal. But overall, experiments have shown that the DreamLight, when used with supporting mental exercises, helps increase the number of lucid dreams by as much as 500 per cent.</p>

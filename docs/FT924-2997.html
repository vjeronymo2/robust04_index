			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Japan's small manufacturers find themselves facing a shake-out POINTING to a colourful 'bargain sale' catalogue for a local clothing store, Mr Mitsunobu Nonaka recited a few of the heavily discounted prices and then calmly concluded that 'we can't compete'. Mr Nonaka runs a small sewing company, KM Clothing, in the southern island of Kyushu, where he has four factories and 170 employees. KM will cut back to 100 staff over the next year or so, and must undergo a character change to support even that number. The difficulties faced by KM Clothing and the bleak future confronting many of its staff are signs of a shake-out of small manufacturers and the changing nature of Japan's labour market. A Labour Ministry survey of larger manufacturers released yesterday found 45 per cent carried out 'employment adjustment' during the July to September quarter, through cuts in working hours, job transfers or cuts in planned recruitment. The situation is far more serious at small manufacturers such as KM, particularly in the textile industry, which withstood the oil shocks of the 1970s and rapid yen appreciation in the 1980s, but cannot cope with a rush of cheap imports from Chinese factories, many of them Japanese-funded ventures. To illustrate this, Mr Nonaka returned to the clothing catalogue and selected a men's zippered jacket, fully lined with a woollen collar and a price tag of Y1,900, down from Y3,900: 'How can we compete with that kind of price? It would cost us Y3,500 just to do the sewing work on that jacket.' Mr Nonaka has yet to come to terms with laying off his staff, most of them women. He has just coached his workers to victory in a volleyball tournament and the trophy stands just inside the largest of his factories, in Kumamoto Prefecture. 'Until this year, we had struggled to find staff. That has all changed this year. From September we started to get a lot of calls from people who had lost jobs at other factories. We can't help them.' Japan's ratio of jobs to applicants fell to 0.96:1 last month, meaning there are more job seekers than vacancies for the first time since April 1988. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 2.2 per cent in November, but the turnround in the labour market is likely to be reflected in coming months. Mr Nonaka says only 30 per cent of the region's small textile producers will survive in the longer term, as an increasing number of joint ventures come on line in Shanghai, flooding the country with cheaper products. 'Three or four years ago, there was no real threat from China, because their products were cheap but of much lower quality. Now they are using Japanese technology, their workers are more skilled and the quality is high, but the labour cost is about an eighth of ours.' Another problem for smaller manufacturers is that they must pay higher interest on loans than larger companies. A car or electronics maker is able to borrow from Japanese banks at about 4.5 per cent, but KM Clothing must pay 6 per cent. KM is trying to secure its future by taking a share in a Shanghai-based venture. Most of these have been established through an industry association in central Japan. The Seki Sewing China Friendship Association has organised about 30 projects, all exporting clothes to Japan and most coming on line over the past year. Two more overseas ventures were announced yesterday, both reflecting a similar investment pattern. Mizuno, the sporting goods company, is to import baseball gloves from a Vietnamese sewing venture established by KSK, a Japanese maker based not far from KM Clothing. Itochu, the trading house, will open a Shanghai ski-wear factory in partnership with two Chinese and Japanese clothing makers. Japanese manufacturing investment in China is expected to double this year. Companies which delayed a cost-cutting move offshore during the heady days of domestic growth in the late 1980s cannot afford to manufacture in Japan, particularly in the face of intensifying competition from companies which did make the move three years ago. Mr Nonaka explained that his company can longer expect large orders from Japanese designer labels, which are his main clients. In future, it will be small-lot production at short notice, with some high-quality work for labels insisting that their product be 'Made in Japan'.</p>

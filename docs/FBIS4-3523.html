			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 21 (XINHUA) -- North China's  Hebei Province has earmarked more money for major projects this  year, according to a local official.    Gong Huanwen, director of the provincial planning  commission,  said that a large proportion of the province's budget has gone  to basic industries and infrastructure, including the spheres of  agriculture, water-control, energy, transportation,  telecommunications and key raw materials.    He said that most of the 158 major projects planned for this  year are ones that have already been started, and 42 of them are  expected to be completed and go into operation within the year.    As a result, he said, the province's generating capacity  will  increase by 840,000 kw, coal production will rise by 900,000  tons, and the output of cement is expected to reach 820,000 tons.    In addition, the province will add over 900,000 tons of port  handling capacity and 450,000 computer-programmed telephone  lines. The output of refined oil and gas will hit 800,000 tons  and 1.03 million cu m daily, respectively.    Gong said the province would keep its economic focus on  optimizing the investment climate.    The construction of five new highways leading to other  provinces and cities will start this year, he noted, and the  pace of port expansion in Qinghuangdao on Bohai Bay will be  accelerated.    To ensure sufficient funds for building major projects, the  official said, the province will also introduce the stock system.    It has been decided to use more overseas funds to upgrade  some 14 old industrial enterprises and to develop more than 150  new products this year, Gong said.</p>

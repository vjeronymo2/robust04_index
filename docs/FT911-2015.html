			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland declines 31% - Bad debts provisions knock large dents in pre-tax figures north of the border THE BANK of Scotland's results, accompanying news of a rights issue, bore the marks of the UK recession. Pre-tax profits in the year ending February 28 were Pounds 134.1m, down 31 per cent from Pounds 193.5m the year before. The main culprit was provisions for bad debts which rose sharply to Pounds 202.3m (Pounds 90.4m). However, Mr Bruce Pattullo, group chief executive, stressed that the group's operating profit before provisions continued to increase, from Pounds 305.4m to Pounds 339.4m, pointing to the underlying momentum of the business. The proposed final dividend is unchanged at 3.1p. But following a sharp rise in the interim dividend to create a better balance between the two payments, the dividend for the year is up 12 per cent at 5.1p. The operating profit of the clearing bank within the group rose to Pounds 224.9m (Pounds 218.6m) before bad debt provisions despite what it called 'extremely difficult economic conditions'. Average sterling lending grew by 23 per cent as the bank continued to increase its share of the market. Margins also widened, particularly among blue-chip borrowers. There was also a 32 per cent rise to Pounds 3.7bn in mortgage lending, which is now the largest single component of the loan portfolio. The greatest loan difficulties were experienced in the English market, into which the Bank of Scotland has been expanding in recent years from its Edinburgh base. Mr Pattullo acknowledged the irony in this, but he still believed the strategy to be correct. Among the subsidiaries, NWS Bank, the finance house, raised profits sharply to Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 38m), thanks mainly to its policy of insulating itself against interest rate changes. The British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm, saw profits fall from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 6m in a difficult market. Bank of Wales saw profits more than halved to Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 1.2m). The Bank of Scotland is proposing to buy out the minority shareholders who own 25 per cent of the bank. Yesterday it made an offer, recommended by the independent directors of the Bank of Wales, at 70p cash per share, which values the minority at Pounds 5.48m. The Bank of Scotland group's operating expenses rose a sharp 19 per cent, mainly because of higher salaries and an enlarged staff, as well as reduced income from non-performing loans. This helped push the bank's cost:income ratio up from 53 to 55 per cent. Mr Pattullo believes the ratio can be reduced to below 50 per cent within three years.</p>

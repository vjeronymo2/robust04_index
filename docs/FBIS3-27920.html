			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Opposition Democratic Party [DP] leader Yi Ki-taek  said yesterday that he is opposed to any international sanctions  against Pyongyang to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    "I expect the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula to be  settled in a peaceful way within this year," Yi said in a news  conference with the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club held at  the Press Center, downtown Seoul.    Commenting on the declaration by the Seoul and Pyongyang  governments on denuclearization of the peninsula in 1992, Yi  said peaceful use of the nuclear energy should not be hindered.    "For the same reason, I object to turning the declaration  into an international treaty," Yi said. Yi reaffirmed his  position on his plan to meet with North Korean President Kim  Il-song in Pyongyang.    "As soon as the special National Assembly session winds up  in  early March, I will file an application with the government to  visit North Korea," said Yi.    "I will discuss with Kim Il-song various pending  inter-Korean  issues such as the easing of tensions on the peninsula,  resumption of talks, economic cooperation, and reunion of  separated families," he added.    Yi said a recent poll by the DP found 55 percent of the  people in favor of his planned visit to Pyongyang, while just 22  percent responded negatively.    The opposition leader also urged the administration to show  more independent attitude toward the negotiations to solve the  North Korean nuclear problem.    "The absence of Seoul negotiators in the talks to settle the  nuclear issue can be serious obstacle to the national  unification," Yi said.    "The government should break away from the practice of  depending too much on the United States," he said.    Yi made clear again that the main opposition party will veto  the Uruguay Round trade deal at the Assembly, saying that  domestic rice market liberalization is certain to "destroy" the  farming community.</p>

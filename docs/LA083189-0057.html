			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A Las Vegas hotel executive has accused the musicians' union of lying in its  current battle with management over the issue of taped music and guaranteed  work. Musicians Local 369 is striking five Las Vegas resorts, charging that the  hotels want to eliminate live music in the city by switching to taped music.  John Giovenco, president of Hilton Nevada Corp., said Wednesday, "We don't have  any intention of eliminating live entertainment in Las Vegas. The musicians'  statements to that effect are just lies." Giovenco charged that "the union  wants us to pay 14 to 25 musicians full salary to stand by and do nothing." He  pointed out that most entertainers now appearing at the Las Vegas Hilton travel  with their own orchestras and complex musical systems. "We end up paying the  acts and their musicians," Giovenco said. "They don't require a house orchestra  and they don't need backups." He said the Hilton was losing about $3 million a  year in its showrooms to bring live entertainment to Las Vegas. Representatives  of the five struck hotels are scheduled to meet this morning with officials of  the musicians' union, and another meeting is to take place today between  Southern Nevada labor leaders and Gov. Bob Miller's chief of staff, Scott  Craigie, in an effort to find a solution to the strike. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

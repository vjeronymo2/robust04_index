			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Fresh Remarks on </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, addressing a press  conference yesterday, said: We should force the Serbs to pay a  high price for spilling blood and continuing their violence in  Gorazde city. He said: The United States has asked NATO to use  air power for returning peace and safety to other Bosnian  regions declared as safehavens, including Gorazde, as had been  done in the case of Sarajevo.    Clinton's fresh remarks have come at time when the United  Nations and the Western governments have come under fire and  criticism by the international community for the indifference  vis-a-vis the Serbs' criminal attacks which led to the fall of  Gorazde. The United Nations and NATO, which have carried out a  belated and small-scale attack on two Serbian tanks around  Gorazde during their so-called military operation involving one  U.S. F-15 fighter plane after the Serb attacks and before the  fall of Gorazde, actually gave a green light to the Serbs for  escalating their attacks and capturing Gorazde. The same  belated attack gave way to softness toward the Serbs in silence,  coupled with satisfaction, following the protest lodged by the  Russian Government which contained a clear threat.    Now that the international community is questioning the  United Nations and the Western governments for their deceitful  and betraying role in the fall of the 65,000-population city of  Gorazde, the U.S. President, Bill Clinton, by expressing such  remarks is trying to bring down the wrath and indignation of the  world community. This is at time when certain pro-Serb elements  in the U.S. Administration, such as Senator Joseph Biden, cannot  hide the happiness they derive from the Serb victory.    Joseph Biden, the second influential man in the U.S.  Democrat  Party, speaking in the Foreign Relations Committee, had called  for the whole withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping forces from the  so-called safehavens, saying that let the Serbs and Muslims  fight each other since war is the only way to reach a solution.  In his yesterday's press conference, Clinton also said that the  United States will step up its efforts for imposing sharper  sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the supporter of  Bosnian Serbs. This is at a time when all the signs and  evidence speak of the fact that Moscow and Washington have  launched wide-scale efforts to relax international sanction  against the confederation of Serbia and Montenegro, seeking the  consents of some of the Western governments in this regard.    It should, therefore, be said that Clinton's new remarks  stand in contradiction with the performance of his  administration and that the White House tricks cannot lessen the  degree of the crime of the United States, which culminated into  the fall of Gorazde and the perpetuation of the genocide of  Muslims by the Serbs in Bosnia.</p>

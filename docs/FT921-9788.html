			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names may step up legal action the individuals whose assets back underwriting at insurance market - and the agents who handle their affairs, are set to take a new twist in the next few days. With the ink barely dry on the out-of-court settlement ending the long-running Warrilow dispute - and a similar outcome possible in the mammoth action between 987 Names on Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 and more than 80 agents - further litigation is on the cards. A report - commissioned by Names and prepared by Rodney-Smith &amp; Partners, the accountancy firm, will be published in the next 10 days - is likely to provide new ammunition for Names on loss-stricken catastrophe reinsurance syndicates. The report could lead the Names to seek injunctions to prevent agents from drawing cash from their deposits. These are placed with the agents when Names join Lloyd's and are drawn upon when Names fail to meet cash calls from their other financial resources. Such a move would spark confrontation with the authorities governing the insurance market. Agents announced in January that just more than Pounds 100m is needed from syndicates managed by Gooda Walker within the next few weeks. Names on other catastrophe syndicates could face similar calls. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names action group, said last week that his members were becoming 'neurotic' about the threat to call in bank guarantees. The Rodney-Smith report, commissioned by the Gooda Walker and Rose Thompson Young action groups, examines the 'spiral' reinsurance arrangements - in which Lloyd's syndicates reinsure and retroinsure (the reinsurance of reinsurance) each other's exposures to catastrophe risks. This formed the bulk of business written by both groups. According to Mr Martin Rodney-Smith the report lends 'strong support' to the legal opinion obtained last October by Withers, the solicitors acting for Gooda Walker Names, from Mr Gavin Lightman QC. Mr Lightman said that if it were shown that the contracts were not in the interests of Names they could be 'voidable'. This means that the contracts contain flaws which enable Names to apply to have them set aside. In his opinion Mr Lightman also stressed the importance of other parties to the con-tract - who are other reinsurers - knowing that the contracts were not in Names' interests. Mr Rodney-Smith says that the report shows that the close-knit character of the catastrophe reinsurance market means 'participants would have been aware not only of the nature of each other's book of business but also, in all probability if not certainty, of each other's reinsurance programme,' 'It was regular practice for syndicates to reinsure business in and reinsure it out with the same syndicates,' he added. If Mr Lightman agrees that the report does prove the case for 'voidability', Names are likely to be advised to seek an injunction.</p>

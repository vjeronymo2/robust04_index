			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Rebuilding of the Reichstag - Architecture There is a special poignancy about the choice of a British architect to rebuild the home of German democracy in a Berlin that is united but still scarred by the wounds of division and war. And it is was a remarkable achievement of Sir Norman Foster and Partners to win the contract for rebuilding the Reichstag in the face of fierce international competition. A small, but scarcely adequate, tribute has been mounted by the Royal Fine Art Commission, where an exhibition of his Reichstag designs can be seen for one week (until October 22) in the basement of No. 7 St. James's Square, London. German patrons of architecture are used to the competition system and in recent years it has been very successful in providing some good, and a few excellent, contemporary buildings. The new museums in the former West Germany offer the most varied series of examples of international patronage. This is going to continue, with the competition for the Museum Island in Berlin offering an extraordinary opportunity for architects to build next to the great Altes Museum by Schinkel. Who can ever forget the sight, even if only seen on film, of the blazing dome of the Reichstag in 1933? Hitler was on the rise and blamed the communists, but no one was fooled and the fire was later seen as a Nazi deed  -the first flames of the European terror. The Reichstag was completed in 1894 to the designs of Paul Wallot. It was opened by the Emperor and had taken 10 years to build. With its four pylon-like corner towers and giant portico, it had a high level of florid pomposity about it. Inscribed with the words 'Dem Deutschen Volke', the Reichstag has always been a powerful national symbol. Sir Norman Foster and Partners had to cope with the highest level of international competition and the little London exhibition shows their winning scheme alongside the two other entries that won the first stage, the Dutch architects, Pi de Bruijn and the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The competition was held in two stages. The first stage was open to all German architects and an invited list of some 14 internationally distinguished practices. Three schemes were then shortlisted and the brief was substantially revised. The winner was then chosen. Architects of the quality of Hans Hollein, Helmut Jahn, Fumihiko Maki, Jose Rafael Moneo and Aldo Rossi all entered impressive schemes. German competitions also involve much public consultation and discussion. A major colloquium was held to discuss all aspects of the competition. The public was divided about the retention of the old Reichstag buildings. Parliament itself only voted by a very small majority to retain the major surviving elements of the old building. Sir Norman Foster's first stage winning scheme was very different from the more modest scheme that finally won. The huge and marvellous roof that was originally planned to cover the whole old building (and a great deal more public space) has been abandoned; the present scheme encloses all the new uses within the framework of the old walls. Courtyards are reinstated and the formal nature of the old building is respected. The seating arrangement of the main parliament hall is circular, based upon the recently completed parliament in Bonn. A great deal of work is done in committee rooms and these active areas all have to be visible and accessible to the public. (Much of the brief for the new parliament had to do with the need for democracy to be seen to be at work and for the whole parliamentary area to be public and accessible.) In Foster's scheme, the central plenary hall is a grand but naturally lit space. Glass lifts and glass floors in light wells will ensure sparkle and light throughout the building. Symbolism is very important in a public building of this standing, but current contemporary architecture does not provide a very poetic or symbolic language. The new design which discards the giant umbrella roof will be a measured response to the powerful presence of the retained building. His great roof for the Reichstag did imply that there there was more to democracy in the newly united Germany that could be encompassed by the walls of the old Reichstag. I expect the external profile to change as the plans grow and that he will create a wonderful and beautiful building in Berlin .</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> BATES GETS 2ND TERM, WILSON PRO TEM POST  </P> <P> Almost a year after Laguna Niguel's incorporation, the City Council shifted  leadership roles just slightly Tuesday night, reelecting Mayor Patricia C.  Bates to a second one-year term and selecting a new mayor pro tem.  </P> <P> Bates was elected the city's first mayor by her colleagues last December, when  she outdistanced 23 competitors as Laguna Niguel became Orange County's 29th  city.  </P> <P> The council also voted Tuesday to install Councilman Thomas W. Wilson as mayor  pro tem, replacing James F. Krembas.  </P> <P> Krembas has been the focus of public criticism for his role in signing a deed  which relinquished the public's right to 96 acres of open space. A criminal  investigation is ongoing regarding that transaction, but Krembas is not  considered a target of the investigation.  </P> <P> All Laguna Niguel council members are targeted for recall as a result of the  positions they have taken on a controversial ordinance to protect the city's  ridgelines. One recall proponent has lodged a separate complaint against Bates  with the state Fair Political Practices Commission for allegedly violating a  conflict of interest law when she continued to chair a meeting while abstaining  from the vote.

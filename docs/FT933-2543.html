			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain posts sharp downturn SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday announced 1993 first-half net profits of FFr452m (Dollars 81m), a sharp fall from the FFr1.4bn recorded in the same period last year. The decline in profits was blamed on 'the scale of the economic crisis in Europe', which the company said affected virtually all of its product markets. The company said that all of its principal customers in the building, vehicle and packaging sectors had sharply reduced demand, resulting in weaker volumes and prices. The downturn was reflected in the sales figures for the half, which declined to FFr35.74bn from FFr38.77bn in the 1992 period. In spite of the problems in its European markets, the company said there were some bright spots in the first-half performance. The US and Latin American markets benefited from stronger general economic conditions, which Saint-Gobain described as 'encouraging'. All of the company's divisions suffered a fall in profits with the exception of building materials, which receives about 90 per cent of its sales in the US. Glass operations suffered from the sharp contraction in the European car market, while the fibres division suffered from a fall in prices. At the end of the first half, the group's net debt stood at FFr18.1bn, about the same level as the beginning of the year, and about FFr2.2bn less than at the end of June 1992.</p>

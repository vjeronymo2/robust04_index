			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sixth of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F> State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the State General  Administration of Taxation chaired by Wei Dong, deputy director  of SETC Enterprises Department: "Answers to Questions Regarding  Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System" -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Wei] Today's talk is about enterprises' income  taxes. This is one issue in which all enterprises are  interested. Director Zhao [Zhao Huaitan, director of the State  General Administration of Taxation Department of Income Taxes],  would you please comment on the differences between the new and  former systems on enterprises' consolidated taxes?    [Zhao] Generally speaking, the two systems are different in  five respects. First, the new system has consolidated the tax  rate at 33 percent, replacing the former three tax rates.  Second, the new system has standardized the tax base. The tax  law has standardized the pre-tax deductibles. [passage omitted]  Third, under the new system, state enterprises do not have to  pay regulatory taxes and the two types of funds, namely the fund  for key energy and communications development projects and the  fund for budgetary regulation. Fourth, after the tax base has  been consolidated, a new system governing enterprises' loan  repayment will be established. [passage omitted] While an  enterprise may consider loan interests as a production cost  after the new system has been instituted, it must use its  disposable capital to pay the loan itself. Fifth, under the new  system, state enterprises will no longer have to deliver  contractual income taxes to the state. [passage omitted]    [Chen Shuqi, chief of the Beijing No. 4 Pharmaceutical  Factory Financial Section] Director Zhao, according to the new  tax law, which became effective on 1 January this year, the  categories of deductible income taxes are different from those  of the past. What are the major differences?    [Zhao] The new tax system is different from the Interim  Regulations Governing Enterprises' Income Tax in the following  areas: The first difference is about enterprises' loan  interests. If an enterprise borrows money from a financial  institution, the interest it pays to the institution is  deductible; and if it borrows money from a nonbanking financial  institution, the interest is deductible provided the interest  rate does not exceed that for the same kind of loan borrowed  from a banking institution during the same period. [passage  omitted] Second, a worker may deduct his wages if the wages he  receives from an enterprise does not exceed the standards set  for taxable wages [ji shui gong zi]. [passage omitted] This  measure is adopted to control the excessive growth of  consumption funds when enterprises have yet to establish all  their self-restraint mechanisms. [passage omitted] Third, the  basic amounts of money that an enterprise retains for workers'  welfare services, trade union budgets, and workers' education  budgets should be calculated the same way as taxable wages. The  fourth difference is about donations. [passage omitted]  According to the new tax law, donations should be governed by  several conditions. 1) They should be made through  intermediaries, such as youth foundations, Hope Projects, [word  indistinct] committees, and other nonprofit social and  nongovernment groups. 2) They should be used for education,  public welfare services, disaster- or poverty-stricken areas.  3) As commonly practiced in foreign countries, there are limits  for deductions. [passage omitted]    [Yun Qinghua, director of Beijing No. 1 General Machinery  Plant] Director Zhao, enterprises are now very interested in tax  deductions and exemptions. Before tax reform, enterprises could  enjoy certain preferential treatment in terms of tax deductions  and exemptions. What preferential measures will continue and  what will be removed following the establishment of the new tax  system?    [Zhao] Enterprises today enjoy too many tax deductions and  exemptions and preferential tax treatment. [passage omitted]  After enterprises' income taxes have been consolidated, the  current tax deductions and exemptions have been screened. Most  of the deductions and exemptions will be removed. This is  because tax rates have been reduced under the new tax system.  [passage omitted] But certain reasonable deductions and  exemptions with a fairly great impact will be retained. After  study, we consider continuing giving preferential tax treatment  for high-tech enterprises in high-tech industrial development  zones, newly established tertiary industries, school-operated  enterprises, nongovernment welfare enterprises, enterprises  providing employment services, enterprises engaged in  controlling industrial wastes and protecting the environment,  and enterprises in need of assistance after being hit hard by  natural disasters. [passage omitted]    [Yun] Director Zhao, comrades of local economic commissions  have asked whether local governments still can authorize tax  deductions and exemptions after the new tax system has been  implemented.    [Zhao] Enterprises' income tax is a tax that came into being  through national legislation. This means that the same tax law  and tax collection policy should be applied nationwide. After  the system of separating central and local taxes has been  established, income taxes paid by local enterprises are  considered part of the local authorities' regular incomes, and  local authorities can handle certain issues according to actual  local situations with the authority prescribed in the tax law  and other relevant regulations. Local authorities may not exceed  the bounds of this authority and do what they want in deducting  or exempting taxes. [passage omitted]</p>

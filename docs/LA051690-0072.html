			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON WAY TO VOLLEYBALL TITLE GAME  </P> <P> It is not uncommon for team members to let their hair grow until they win a  championship. But at Chatsworth High, the boys' volleyball team is starting a  new tradition: haircuts.  </P> <P> Weird haircuts -- with numbers, arrows and squiggly lines shaved into some of  the players' hair. Others have close trims.  </P> <P> "For inspiration," said middle blocker Gene Urcan, who sports a vertical arrow  with the tip pointed down on the back of his head. "We're getting into the  spirit."  </P> <P> Top-seeded Chatsworth (14-2) certainly played with spirit Tuesday, defeating  visiting Palisades in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals, 15-10, 12-15,  15-4, 15-13.  </P> <P> Chatsworth, the defending City 4-A champion, will play third-seeded Taft (13-1)  in the final at Pepperdine on Friday night. Taft's only loss came against  Chatsworth, which won in five games.  </P> <P> "More than anything, we wanted this match," Chatsworth's Ryan Labovitch said.  "It was the most emotional match we've ever played."  </P> <P> Senior outside hitter Mike Nash led the way with 17 kills and six blocks.  Labovitch had 15 kills.  </P> <P> "They are team leaders both emotionally and physically," Chatsworth Coach Steve  West said. "They definitely have a boosting effect."  </P> <P> After taking a 12-6 lead in the second game, however, the Chancellors  temporarily lost momentum, allowing fourth-seeded Palisades to score nine  unanswered points to even the match.  </P> <P> Leading, 14-13, in the fourth game, Chatsworth wasted three chances to earn the  final point. Twelve minutes later, Palisades returned a shot out of bounds,  giving the Chancellors their first win over Palisades in three meetings this  season.  </P> <P> "They hit the ball much harder and quicker than they did earlier this season,"  Palisades Coach Howard Enstedt said.  </P> <P> Palisades played a strong passing game. Sophomore John Lee had 26 digs and  senior Brady Nathan added 18 digs. But the Dolphins had problems hitting over  the Chancellors' blocking wall.  </P> <P> Chatsworth's Craig Hewitt had 12 blocks and eight kills and Urcan had nine  blocks and nine kills.  </P> <P> "It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance that you go to (the finals)," said Urcan.  "We're going to Pepperdine and we're going to win the City (championship)."  </P></p>

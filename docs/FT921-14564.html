			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / US retailers suffer worst year in decades THE US economy sagged at the end of last year, giving US retailers one of their worst years in at least two decades, sales figures showed yesterday. Retail sales fell 0.4 per cent last month, before allowing for inflation, a bigger decline than financial markets had expected. Figures for November were revised down sharply to show a fall of 0.5 per cent rather than a rise of 0.3 per cent. Further evidence of economic weakness was provided yesterday by a sharp drop in US car sales to an annual rate of 5.3m in the first 10 days of January compared with 7.1m at the end of December and 5.7m in the same period last year. Excluding cars, retail sales have fallen for five months running. Share prices, however, rose on Wall Street as investors looked beyond current economic troubles to an expected economic upturn in the second half of this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 60.6 points at a record high of 3,246.2. Yesterday's figures indicate retail sales fell at an annual rate of about 3 per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter, raising the prospect that gross domestic product fell modestly after two quarters of weak growth during the summer. For 1991 as a whole, retail sales rose only 0.7 per cent in cash terms, well below the underlying rate of inflation of about 3 per cent. Officials said the retail figures were the worst for at least two decades. Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, said the figures showed the consumer was 'dead in the water' in December. The economy was likely to decline both in the fourth quarter of last year and in the current quarter. 'The heat is still on the president to propose some kind of economic rescue package in the State of the Union address later this month,' he said. Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, another New York broker, said the economy's weakness indicated the Federal Reserve would have to ease monetary policy again. The poor retail sales figures follow a series of weak economic indicators. On Friday, the Labour Department reported a rise in unemployment to 7.1 per cent, the highest level in 5 years. Previous releases showed a sharp fall in the Purchasing Managers' Index  - a sign of renewed contraction in manufacturing, weak car sales, a drop in consumer confidence and a sharp decline in the index of leading indicators. Sentiment in financial markets, however, has been buoyed by the Fed's unexpected 1 point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent shortly before Christmas.</p>

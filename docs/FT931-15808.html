			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Management: On the wrong track in Italy IT WAS the sort of tragi-comedy which other Europeans tend to associate with Italy. In 1987 Berghaus decided that the fragmented Italian market required a domestic staging post to hold stock and turn round orders quickly. They would be exported in bulk, then repacked in Italy for individual delivery. But the plan failed. Berghaus had chosen what seemed an ideal location just south of the Swiss border. But a promised motorway to the town was never finished, leaving only twisting local roads. There were no computer links - a side-effect of its UK computer problems. With a staff of five, 'the warehouse became a very, very expensive addendum to our Italian operations', says Mark Held, export director. To reach it, Berghaus had to have bulk consignments from Newcastle transferred on to smaller lorries nearby. From the warehouse, individual cartons destined for shops were put on to a third set of trucks. In mid-1989 Berghaus decided to pull out, and instead subcontract the physical distribution - and fixed overheads - to an Italian company which carries out a similar service for Benetton, the clothing chain.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by Faustin Twagiramungu, prime </F> minister-designate and president of the Republican Democratic  Movement on 13 April; place not given]    [Excerpts] Members of Republican Democratic Movement [MDR]  and Rwandans. Peace be with you and continue to trust God, as  the truth will finally win out. Rwandans, the death of His  Excellency President Juvenal Habyarimana has not yet been  explained. Some continue to say, without evidence, that he was  killed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], while others are  saying that enemies of the country were responsible. Let us  hope that the truth will finally be known. [passage omitted]    How can we hold talks with the people who killed Prime  Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was the president of the MDR  in Butare, who was the people's mother, an intellectual, a  nationalist? How can we hold talks with these killers? How can  we hold talks with the murderers of Frederic Nzamurambaho, the  minister of agriculture and livestock and the national president  of the Social Democratic Party, a father of all who was a  peace-loving person. How can we hold talks with those who  killed Felicien Ngango, the first vice president of Christian  Democratic Party [PDC] at the national level, an intellectual,  and a Rwandan who knew the law. [passage omitted]    We shall never hold talks with those who killed Faustin  Nucogoza, who was the minister of information and president of  the MDR in Byumba. He was a fearless man who loved democracy.  All those who were killed joined others who were killed earlier  by those murderers. They took the lives of Mayuya, Gapyisi,  Gatabazi and others. The killings show and identify who is  Rwanda's enemy.    The ethnic war that the killers wanted to launch in the  country is not acceptable to us. Were all the above-mentioned  people who died killed by Tutsis? One cannot say that the RPF  waged a war because of the killings. We should understand and  explain to the people that the RPF did not attack, but came to  the rescue of the people to stop the killers from shedding blood.</p>

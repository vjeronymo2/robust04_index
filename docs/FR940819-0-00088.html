			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In establishing duty period limitations, the FAA has considered a variety of alternatives submitted by commenters, including the proposals to set different limits for different types of operations. In an effort to establish requirements that are conducive to safety and compatible with air carrier operations, the FAA also has reviewed current industry practices used to schedule flight attendants. To provide the least complicated method of establishing effective limitations for scheduling duty periods for flight attendants, the FAA has decided to adopt the scheduled duty period limitations as proposed, with a slight modification that distinguishes cosmetic and international scheduled duty periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised the definition of a duty period in this final rule to state that the time is calculated using Coordinated Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time. The phrase ``or the local time of the flight attendants's home base'' was replaced with ``or local time'' to be consistent with the definition of a calendar day. The FAA has determined that any time zone can be used, as long as the operator is consistent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Duty period limitations are established to enhance the safety of the flying public by ensuring that flight attendants do not become overly fatigued during flight assignments. In addition, the duty period limitations are designed to suit all operations that require flight attendants without imposing a significant burden on operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, the final rule does not provide actual duty period limitations because such provisions may unreasonably reduce operational flexibility. However, the final rule requires that a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period between scheduled duty periods, i.e., rest periods must be provided. Because duty periods are scheduled in combination with actual rest periods, the objective of ensuring the flight attendants are provided an opportunity to be rested will be met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After further review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty periods of operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to exceed 18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18 hours. However, duty periods that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia may extend up to 20 hours, provided that an extended rest period is scheduled following the duty period and that additional flight attendants are assigned to each flight segment in the duty period. This provision will allow air carriers to conduct extended long-range operations with new generation aircraft. Moreover, sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) will allow a flight attendant for a domestic air carrier to continue on duty beyond the time when duty would normally terminate, if circumstances exist that are unanticipated and beyond the control of the air carrier such as adverse whether conditions). This same exception will apply to flag and supplemental operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A duty period as defined in this final rule means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment. In response to ATA's recommendation that the definition of a duty period should state that a duty period does not include the time when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status, the FAA refers to the definition of a duty period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates that a duty period does not begin until a flight attendant reports for an assignment involving flight time. Reserve status is discussed in further detail under the heading ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to NAA, all duty period assignments, including those assignments with a 4- to 5-hour break in duty at a hotel, must be assigned within duty period limitations and must meet minimum rest requirements. The FAA would not consider this to be a break in, or cessation of, the duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

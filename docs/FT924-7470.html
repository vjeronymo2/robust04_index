			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese steel trader reverses SUMIKIN Bussan Kaisha, a Japanese steel product trader due to merge with heavily-indebted Itoman Corp, yesterday unveiled parent net losses of Y75m (Dollars 605,000) for the six months to September 30, compared with profits of Y425m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The losses were due to slow demand for steel products stemming from the overall economic slump. Sumikin Bussan, which is 59.5 per cent owned by Sumitomo Metal Industries, forecasts full-year net profits of Y50m. It posted half-year parent pre-tax profits of Y107m, down from Y852m, while sales fell to Y328.42bn from Y358.55bn. It expects full-year taxable profits of Y600m on sales of Y690bn. Sumitomo Metal Industries yesterday declined to comment on how the expected falls in Sumikin Bussan's earnings would affect its profits for the year to March. Unlisted Sumikin Bussan will merge with listed textile trader Itoman on April 1 next year. After the merger, the company will be not be listed on any exchange. However, it aims to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by 1996. Itoman carries a large amount of debt because of its investment in properties and art but this will not directly affect the planned listing. The debt will not be passed to the merged firm but will be cleared by Itoman. For the six months to September 30 1992, Itoman sees parent taxable losses of Y8bn and net losses of Y43bn. For the year to March it sees taxable losses of Y17bn and net losses of Y90bn.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINTER SALADS;  </P> <P> RECIPES REINFORCE L. A.'S CROSS-CULTURAL APPROACH TO CUISINE  </P> <P> Think America is the melting pot of the world? Then Los Angeles must be its  salad bowl.  </P> <P> Latinos, Asians and Europeans, Easterners, Southerners and other Americans from  every direction are tossed together into a show of colors that is reflected in  the way we have learned to cook and eat.  </P> <P> And as comfortable as we have become with crossing cultures in the kitchen, we  as easily amalgamate our seasons. Between our climate and the availability of  produce from all over the world, we are as able to eat red-ripe strawberries,  golden peaches, peppers and potatoes of unimaginable colors and crisp green  salads in January as we are in June.  </P> <P> A few cross-cultural, multiseasonal salads in point are illustrated here. One  mixes Japanese with French, in another Thai mingles with Mexican. A New York  steak sandwich is turned into a salad with an Italian influence and Waldorf  salad becomes well-traveled with the addition of smoked turkey,  California-grown Asian pears and Roquefort cheese. Any of them would make a  fine main dish for a simple holiday meal that will celebrate our complexion,  climate and crossroads.  </P> <P> STEAK SANDWICH SALAD  </P> <P> 1 pound New York or sirloin steak, cut 3/4- to 1-inch thick  </P> <P> 12 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick diagonally cut baguette slices  </P> <P> Olive oil  </P> <P> Arugula or romaine leaves  </P> <P> Mustard Mayonnaise  </P> <P> Onion Marmalade  </P> <P> Coarse salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 small wedge Parmesan cheese, optional  </P> <P> Broil or grill steak to desired doneness. Cool, then wrap in plastic and chill.  </P> <P> Brush baguette slices with olive oil on both sides. Arrange in single layer on  baking sheet. Toast in oven at 350 degrees 3 to 5 minutes per side or just  until golden. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead and stored in paper bag.)  </P> <P> When ready to assemble salads, carve steak into slices about 1/4-inch thick. On  each of 4 dinner plates, arrange few arugula leaves, steak slices, 3 baguette  slices, about 2 tablespoons Mustard Mayonnaise (reserve remaining mayonnaise  for another use) and 1/4 of Onion Marmalade. Season steak to taste with salt  and pepper.  </P> <P> With vegetable peeler, shave off curls of Parmesan cheese and scatter over  steak. To eat, spread some of Mustard Mayonnaise on baguette slice. Top with  some of arugula, steak slices, cheese and onion marmalade. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Mustard Mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder  </P> <P> 1 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> In blender, combine egg, mustard and 1/4 cup oil.

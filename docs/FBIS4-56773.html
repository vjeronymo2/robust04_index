			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 3 May (PL) -- Today, U.S. President  William Clinton cited world security, economic reactivation, and  favoring democracy among the priorities of U.S. foreign policy.  Appearing on a televised conference organized by CNN at the  network's Atlanta headquarters, Clinton referred to the current  areas of tension, specifically in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and  the South African elections, among other topics.    He said the possibility of military intervention in Haiti  must not be ruled out, although, according to him, the United  States is doing everything possible to avoid having to resort to  that option.    Obviously justifying a possible decision of that sort,  Clinton said Washington will not meddle in the affairs of other  countries, but Haiti is a "case by itself," he explained. He  said U.S. policy consists of doing everything possible to stop  the killings and to restore democracy in Haiti, noting that that  position will be rigorously upheld.    Regarding events in Bosnia, the U.S. President said Atlantic  Alliance aircraft will intervene if the Serbs resume aggressions  against the UN-protected territory, in an action seeking to halt  the war and promote negotiations, he said. He came out against  lifting the sanctions imposed on Serbia until such time the  efforts for a peaceful solution begin.    He hailed the negotiation process between Israel and the  PLO,  which secured an agreement on Palestinian autonomy over Gaza and  Jericho. He said that assistance to the tune of $2 million,  which he considered a good figure to start off with, will be  sent to Jericho.    Asked about the results of the South African elections, the  number one resident of the White House assessed the possibility  of aiding the economic development of that country, which  because of its capabilities hold a key role on the African  Continent.    He formally announced that $5 million will be sent to  Rwanda,  but did not say if the measures applied to Somalia will be  feasible for Rwanda.    Regarding the Middle East, today, Clinton said there are  more  possibilities of peace to guarantee the territorial integrity of  Lebanon and to rid it of terrorism.    Asked about North Korea, Clinton stressed that "we want to  have open and friendly relations with Pyongyang and want it to  have a constructive relationship with South Korea." He  reiterated that Washington hopes North Korea will respect its  commitments in matters of nuclear proliferation and noted that  the solution is now "in the hands of Pyongyang."    After making a brief analysis of ties between China and the  United States over the past two decades, he said that this  coming month, Washington will work arduously to smooth out  differences between the two nations. In this sense, he  mentioned the human rights situation in China, a topic of  dispute between the two countries. He hailed the UN Security  Council statement on making peacekeeping operations more  effective and less costly.</p>

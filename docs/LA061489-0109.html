			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. NAMES 5 FIRMS TO RECEIVE GRANTS FOR HIGH-DEFINITION TV  </P> <P> In the first move by the federal government to support U.S. firms trying to  catch up with the Japanese and Europeans in high-definition television, a  Pentagon agency Tuesday picked five firms to receive government funds to  develop better display technologies.  </P> <P> The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is planning to  spend a total of $30 million over the next three years on HDTV, named two  Silicon Valley firms -- Newco of San Jose and Menlo Park-based Raychem. It also  named Texas Instruments in Dallas, Projectavision of New York and Photonics  Technology of Northwood, Ohio. The amounts of the awards will be subject to  negotiation.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said it could not predict how many other contractors might receive  federal grants as well.  </P> <P> But DARPA, which has long played a role in funding U.S. industrial research  projects, did not name the best-known proposal from a joint venture between  Zenith, the last remaining U.S.-based television manufacturer, and AT&amp;T.  </P> <P> Zenith and AT&amp;T said they would continue their work even if they did not  receive government funds.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, responding to intense interest in HDTV  from members of Congress, has promised to present a federal plan to support  U.S. development of the industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Resolution Screen Is Key  </P> <P> Advocates for HDTV said the choices highlight the need for Congress to boost  Pentagon funding for HDTV to $100 million a year to provide help for a larger  number of projects. DARPA received 87 applications for its high-definition  television program, which was announced last December, and said earlier this  year that 49 proposals were worthy of support.  </P> <P> The Pentagon's primary goal is developing a high-resolution screen that can  display text, characters or video signals with great clarity to be used inside  new helicopters and airplanes, training simulators, computer-aided design and  on other military applications.  </P> <P> The department also hopes that by providing money for new research, it can help  U.S. electronic and semiconductor companies forge ahead in developing the next  generation of TV sets for commercial use.  </P> <P> High-definition television, which is expected to hit the market sometime in the  next decade, offers the promise of bringing movie-quality images and  crystal-clear sound to the home.  </P> <P> A Raychem official, in a telephone interview, said the DARPA selections appear  aimed at those firms working on newer display technologies rather than at ones  focusing on improving the traditional cathode ray tubes used in today's TV  sets.  </P> <P> "The Japanese have the lead in CRTs," said Paul Cook, a Raychem executive.  "We're trying to leap past them."  </P> <P> Raychem is working with Xerox Corp. on a process to combine its liquid crystal  technology with thin film transistors developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research  Center on a flat panel display, company officials said.  </P> <P> Newco has told the Pentagon that it is working with Spectra Physics as a  subcontractor. Newco officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Texas Instruments, which is by far the largest of the firms selected, plans to  combine its efforts with the David Sarnoff Research Center, which is run by SRI  International and has developed a number of HDTV projects.  </P> <P> Projectavision and Photonics Technology did not identify any partners.  </P></p>

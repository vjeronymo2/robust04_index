			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Part-time not second rate (2) Sir, Valerie Amos implies that part-time work is a second-rate option forced upon women. Of course, some women who work part-time would prefer full-time employment. However, survey evidence indicates that the enormous unmet demand is for flexible part-time arrangements - and as a positive preference, not second-best. The experience of Victoria Franklin (Letters, January 23), offered full-time or nothing by her boss, is, distressingly, not unusual. Most revealing, however, is Ms Amos's disparaging comparison between part-time 'work' and a proper full-time 'career'. The latter is an option only for the affluent middle-class minority: yet it is their demands and experiences that dominate the whole debate about child-care. Surely one should expect a broader vision from the chief executive of a government organisation funded to promote the interests of all women.

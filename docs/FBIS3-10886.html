			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The URNG and Its Response to the Human Rights </F> Issue"]    [Text] The round of negotiations between the government and  the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] concluded  Tuesday without the parties signing the human rights agreement,  although progress was made on the topic of the timetable. As  happened during the time of Jorge Serrano's Official Commission,  the URNG General Command did not fully cooperate to enable the  signing of the agreements.    When one wishes to analyze the causes of the new failure to  advance in bringing peace to the country, it stands out that the  hard line represented by Commanders Rolando Moran of the EGP  [Poor People's Guerrilla Army] and Pablo Monsanto of the FAR  [Rebel Armed Forces] is not in tune with "politicians" Carlos  Gonzalez (PGT) [Guatemala Labor Party] and Gaspar Ilom [Rodrigo  Asturias Amado] (ORPA) [Revolutionary Organization of the People  in Arms], whose public statements are different.    The URNG leadership failed to realize that at the bargaining  table they are being gratuitously offered more than they have  been able to achieve militarily in the past three decades of  armed struggle. At the very least, they had and have within  their grasp the signing of a human rights agreement which would  benefit all the people who are ultimately the ones bearing the  cost of the war.    It is as if the Guatemalan insurgents were not taking into  consideration that with these talks they are assured a greater  active role, similar to one they would have attained had they  reached a tie with the Guatemalan Army, as happened in El  Salvador. It would seem the Guatemalan insurgents fail to  realize that at this point in the 1990's internal strife is  totally trivial and that our country could continue adrift or  with a well-defined course with its dramas and tragedies,  triumphs, joys, and comedies, even if the rebels continue their  activities.    The guerrilla leaders should also keep in mind that a unique  characteristic of Guatemala's social structure is that  approximately 70 percent of the population is less than 30 years  old and that most of the people live immersed in their daily  problems influenced by the dizzying evolution of the world and  are far from caring about knowing the roots of the ideological  conflict that emerged in the 1960's. More important than that  is to realize that although the government is giving the URNG a  deal similar to the one the Salvadoran Government accorded the  FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the conditions  prevailing in each case are radically different. For example,  El Salvador had a war economy. The U.S. subsidy that maintained  the conflict between the Army and the rebels was large;  infrastructure was 90 percent destroyed; the need for financial  resources for reconstruction following the war was and is more  than enormous; elections were sabotaged by over 80 percent; the  correlation of forces between the Army and rebels was evident;  over 90 percent of local governments in the strife-torn areas  were dissolved; a military balance existed; the rebels  controlled liberated zones; the rebels had a force comparable in  many cases with the Army; they had sophisticated weaponry with a  large-scale capacity for offensive operations that they took to  San Salvador, even to [Salvadoran President] Cristiani's home;  and among other things they had the clear support and acceptance  of the people.    In making a comparative analysis and drawing parallels  between the neighboring country's situation and ours, it is easy  to see the differences are marked and substantial.    To conclude, the shortsighted guerrillas and the government  give the impression that they have forgotten that more important  than signing a peace accord and the absence of an armed  confrontation, it is essential to hasten a solution to the  problems of poverty that hurt over eight out of every 10  Guatemalans. As this century draws to an end, it is basic to  create an equal opportunity framework for all Guatemalans that  ensures each citizen has the same starting point when he begins  his dramatic struggle for a more dignified life.</p>

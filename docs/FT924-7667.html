			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Sport: The prodigy returns to say his farewell - Rugby Union / John Hopkins recalls the young Botha and anticipates seeing him play again ONE afternoon a dozen years ago, a photographer and I drove in a pick-up truck to an appointment in Pretoria, South Africa. The truck was the only vehicle we could rent in the dorp, or two-horse town, of Potchefstroom where we were staying while accompanying the 1980 British Lions on their tour of the Republic. Our rendezvous was with one of the most important men in South Africa. His name was Botha, a normal-enough surname in the capital city and the seat of government. It was not PW, the prime minister, nor Piet, the foreign minister. It was Hendrik Egnatius Botha, otherwise known as Naas, South Africa's new find at stand-off. Naas Botha was a prodigy in 1980, the great white hope of South African rugby. He had first played for his country a few months earlier in a Test series against the Argentinians and made his name with some prodigious kicking. Though he was under 6 ft and weighed less than 11 stone, he could punt, drop and place-kick a ball ten or 15 yards further than anyone else. Distances of 65 yards were commonplace, 70 yards not exceptional, 75 yards not unheard of. Even in the rarified atmosphere of the veldt, this was big kicking, as beefy as, and even more accurate than, the New Zealander, Don Clarke, 30 years earlier. But it was not just that Botha was extraordinarily long and uncannily accurate. Starting in that Test series against the Argentinians and refining it against the 1980 British Lions, Botha re-invented the drop goal as a scoring ploy. He dropped three goals in one Test against the Argentinians, a world record. It did not matter that he could kick only with his right foot. He was so quick on his feet that he was capable of dropping a goal from anywhere in the opposition's half. Twelve years ago Botha's voice was firm, his handshake soft, his manner confident, his English mangled. Sitting in his parents' house he spoke of his two greatest heroes, Frik du Preez, the Springbok second row forward, and Welshman Phil Bennett: 'Frik were a character in South African rugby and Phil is the best fly half I have ever saw,' he said before scooping up half a dozen balls and going out to practise. Then he was beginning his career as a Springbok. He was just 22. Now he is at the end of it, captaining the Springboks against England at Twickenham this afternoon. In between, Botha spent ten years out of international rugby. That 1980 tour was the last visit by the British Lions before South Africa was cast into the wilderness by the UN ban on sporting links. For a decade Botha's only appearances for his country were half a dozen games against artificial, sanction-breaking teams. He flirted with American football as a specialist kicker, played five seasons for Rovigo in Italian rugby and, all the while, remained the pin-up boy for Northern Transvaal, the heartland of the Afrikaaner's laager. He has scored 306 points in international rugby, including 18 dropped goals. Now his face is fuller, his manner more defensive. His kicking remains prodigiously long but criticism of his reluctance to tackle, to do anything but kick, has taken a toll. This afternoon's game will almost certainly be the last Botha plays for his country. The career that began in Pretoria early in 1980 will end on the most famous rugby ground in the world at tea-time today. Form points to victory by England yet the speed with which the South Africans have recovered from their ten years of sporting isolation suggests the match will be close. 'For a side that has been out of action for ten years, they have done remarkably well,' says Don Rutherford, the Rugby Football Union's technical adviser. 'Had we (England) been out of international rugby for that length of time we would not have become so good so quick.' Roger Uttley, formerly the England coach, spent a month in the republic last summer coaching rugby at Stellenbosch University. 'What I thought then was that though they had some talented footballers, they lacked a sense of purpose. Their isolation had led to rivalries and they had to learn to play cohesively again. They were very set-piece oriented. There wasn't a lot of system. They applied pressure, won the ball and gave it to Botha to kick the leather off it. 'Physically they are big and strong but they lack the modern techniques for recycling the ball and they do not have the levels of fitness that are necessary to play today's dynamic rugby.' When South Africa were well-beaten in the second Test by France last month, it seemed as though they still had a lot to learn. But since arriving in England, the Springboks have improved beyond measure. They are happier because they can speak the language. The French quartered them in noisy hotels and gave them liaison officers who spoke little English. By contrast, the RFU have made their visitors feel welcome. In this improved atmosphere the South Africans have worked on their weaknesses. The result was convincing victories over the Midlands and North divisions without a try being scored against them and a thrilling, though not emphatic, victory over England B at Bristol a week ago. 'If we (in Britain) are as strong as we think we are then the Midlands should have been able to take care of the Springboks,' said Uttley. 'That victory was comprehensive even allowing for the new points structure. What we saw then was that if you allow the Springboks to move the ball wide, they can wreak havoc. Give them space and they will knock holes in any defence. They are very competitive and very strong.' Twelve years ago Botha explained how important it was to adopt a routine for kicking and to stick to it. He always put the ball down the same way with the seam pointing at the target, he said, and he was very precise in his movements. He kept his head down, swung his right foot back slowly and then followed through smoothly. It worked then as it works now. Watch him this afternoon. He is a master of this particular art and you will not see many better.</p>

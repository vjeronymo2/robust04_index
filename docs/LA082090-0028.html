			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT PLANES COLLIDE; FALL INTO OCEAN  </P> <P> Four people were killed when two single-engine planes collided in midair and  crashed Sunday afternoon in the waters off the Long Beach breakwater, about a  mile south of the Queen Mary, authorities said.  </P> <P> The 3:26 p.m. collision between a four-seat Cessna 172 and a Piper Turbo Arrow,  also a four-seater, was witnessed by people aboard at least two vessels in the  area, including a U.S. Coast Guard craft on routine maneuvers, Long Beach Fire  Department spokesman Bob Caldon said.  </P> <P> One of the boats was able to drop a buoy near the Cessna crash site. That  marker guided rescue crafts, which were dispatched by the Long Beach marine and  fire departments, to the site about 400 yards west of the Long Beach  lighthouse, Caldon said.  </P> <P> The bodies of two men -- ages 21 and 50 -- were pulled from the Piper that had  crashed inside the Long Beach Harbor breakwater, Caldon said. The 50-year-old  was believed to be the pilot, authorities said. The victims were not  identified, pending notification of relatives.  </P> <P> Frank Gennaro, a Downey plumber, and his son Franco, 17, were fishing aboard  their 21-foot cabin cruiser just outside the breakwater when they saw the two  planes in the air.  </P> <P> "They looked like they were doing stunts," said Gennaro, 44. "I thought they  must have been from the Queen Mary or something. All of a sudden the prop from  one plane chopped the wing off the other one. There was no explosion, no fire."  </P> <P> Gennaro said the Cessna, with only one wing left, "just sank -- rapidly. Other  debris fell into the water. We rushed over hoping to God there might be  survivors. Nothing."  </P> <P> Waning light and poor underwater visibility forced divers to call off their  efforts late Sunday to recover two bodies from the Cessna that fell outside the  breakwater, Caldon said. The search is to resume at dawn today. The National  Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident.  </P> <P> "Visibility has been the biggest problem," Caldon said. "Divers can't see three  feet in front of themselves because of red-tide conditions. They're just  groping down there."  </P> <P> Caldon said the Piper went down south of Pier J, and "the water there is about  60 feet deep," he said. "We sent several rescue boats to the scene and put  divers into the water."  </P> <P> Caldon said there was very little debris visible, except "an oil slick and some  paper floating on the surface."  </P> <P> At least a dozen divers, from Los Angeles and Long Beach rescue agencies,  searched the waters for wreckage and victims, he said. The effort was "like  finding a needle in a haystack for them, since they could only see the length  of their arm," Caldon said.  </P> <P> Divers also found some landing gear, including two tires, said Kristine  Johnson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard.  </P> <P> Gennaro said that an armrest, a steering wheel, papers, maps and other debris  floated to the surface.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ed Boyer contributed to this story.  </P></p>

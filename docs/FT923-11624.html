			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Efim will pay retroactive interest on debt EFIM, the Italian state holding group which is being put into voluntary liquidation, will retroactively pay interest on debts frozen after last week's decision to wind up the concern. The news, given in a clarification by the treasury, countered the impression created at the weekend that no interest payments would accrue for the next two years. That understanding caused widespread concern in the international banking community, unused to the idea of a unilateral rescheduling attempt by a leading industrialised country. While the announcement removes one of the many uncertainties facing creditors of Efim, which has total debts of L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn), bankers remain highly critical of the way information about the closure's consequences for creditors has been handled by the Italian authorities. Under the terms of the liquidation, repayments of interest and principal on Efim's debts are being suspended for a maximum of two years while the group is wound up and assets sold. The Treasury is to issue up to L4,000bn in government securities from next January to cover the principal of Efim's bank borrowings, provided creditor banks agree to renounce all guarantees and interest payments on existing loans. The rate of interest paid to creditors will be equivalent to that on the government securities being issued. However, bankers have still to be told what that rate will be. The decision to set a uniform interest rate also raises an issue of fairness among Efim's creditors as banks have lent to Efim at varying interest rates. The prospect of interest being paid was confirmed by Mr Anrea Monorchio, the head of Italy's state auditing office. He told a senate committee in Rome he believed the payments would continue to be made to prevent Italy losing credibility as a borrower. The country has recently faced a loss of confidence among bankers and investors, especially abroad.</p>

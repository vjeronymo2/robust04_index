			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering down sharply to Pounds 2.01m Hall Engineering (Holdings), the automotive engineering, steel products and stockholding group, suffered a sharp fall in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.01m but expects a better performance in the second half of the year. Turnover was up 10 per cent from Pounds 65m to Pounds 72.1m. The interim dividend is reduced from 6.48p a share to 5p, but for the second year running the Shrewsbury-based company is offering an 'enhanced' scrip alternative. Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 3.78p. Shareholders are to be given the option of taking up new shares based on a 50 per cent enhancement to the cash dividend. For Hall, which derives its profits principally from abroad, the offer will reduce the amount of Advance Corporation Tax which it has to write off, and save about Pounds 2m of cash in a full year. If the scrip dividend is approved a final dividend at least equal to the 3.02p final payout last year is expected, making a total of at least 8.02p for 1994 (9.5p). Otherwise, the interim dividend would be 3.3p. Once again, the half-year results underline the importance for Hall of its associated companies, especially in the Pacific Basin. Even so, its share of profits from associated companies was Pounds 2.64m, down from Pounds 3.2m a year earlier, partly owing to increasing competitive pressure for BRC in Singapore. Elsewhere, operating profit for the three core businesses, stockholding, steel reinforcement and engineering, dropped from Pounds 1.54m in the first half of 1993 to Pounds 493,000. The stockholding business had a small loss of Pounds 46,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 366,000 a year ago, while reinforcement slipped from a Pounds 117,000 profit to a Pounds 339,000 loss. The engineering business saw profits fall from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 878,000. However, Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said stockholding was likely to make a 'very significant' profit in the second half, due to improved margins, and the reinforcement business was now looking much healthier. The greatest uncertainty remained at Stadco in the engineering division, which has already been hit by postponement of part of a big production equipment contract for Audi. Stadco may have to declare 60 redundancies in the second half, costing as much as Pounds 500,000, if it fails to win two further big contracts from Volkswagen, worth Pounds 10m each. Even so, Mr Hall said he would be disappointed if the group's profits fell below Pounds 4.5m this year.</p>

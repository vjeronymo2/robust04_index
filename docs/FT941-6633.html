			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Technology: The century's last take-off - Paul Betts reports on next month's introduction of the world's biggest twin-engine airliner There is a Guinness Book of Records quality about the 777, the world's biggest twin-engine airliner which Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, will roll out for the first time on April 9. The first 300-400 seat airliners are being assembled outside Seattle in the US in a 1,000-acre site with about 98 acres of buildings under one roof. The aircraft will be the last all-new airliner programme developed this century, at a cost of more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn). The three leading aero-engine manufacturers - Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK - are scrambling to develop the world's most powerful commercial jet engines to power the 777 and future, even larger, derivatives of the new Boeing widebody airliner. Since launching the 777 programme four years ago, it has again been 'bet-the-company time' for Boeing, say senior executives. The development costs and lead times are so significant that an aircraft manufacturer risks the health of the entire company every time it launches a big new programme, they explain. 'It's certainly a gamble, but the 777 is not as big a gamble as our decision to launch the 747 programme 25 years ago,' says Philip Condit, Boeing's president. Part of the reason for Boeing's greater confidence this time is the way the company has changed its approach to developing an aircraft. Boeing describes the 777 as a 'market-driven' airliner. In the past, the manufacturer felt it knew what was best for its airline customers. 'Market planning for a new airliner was often based on the requirements of a launch customer, combined with some rough expectations about future markets,' explains Jeff Peace, chief project engineer of Boeing's 777 division. 'The manufacturer would come up with a general idea for a new aircraft, convince an airline to buy it, then design it pretty much around the capabilities and features described by the launch airline,' he adds. With the 777, Boeing adopted from the start a more open stance towards the outside world, encouraging airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to participate actively in the design and planning of the new airliner. 'Not that we did not listen to our customers in the past, but the biggest lesson we learnt was that we often listened to them late in a programme,' says Alan Mulally, the 777's general programme manager. 'Now, we are listening to them much earlier.' At all costs, the company wanted to avoid the mistakes made five years ago on the development of the 747-400, the newest version of its 747 jumbo. After failing to listen properly to its customers, Boeing was forced to delay delivery for several months to initial customers because of teething problems and design changes demanded by airlines. Boeing's new attitude to customers, subcontractors and suppliers also reflected two important changes in the market. The first was the general slump in the civil aircraft business with airlines forced by heavy losses to cancel or postpone millions of dollars worth of new aircraft orders. The second and perhaps even more important factor was the emergence of Airbus Industrie as Boeing's principal long-term challenger. The European aircraft manufacturing consortium, which has steadily built market share during the past 20 years by launching advanced new aircraft programmes, has been making serious inroads into some of Boeing's traditional customers in the US. With nearly 30 per cent of the western market, Airbus has sought to leapfrog its bigger US rival by introducing new technological concepts to commercial jets including fly-by-wire electronic controls. It also pre-empted Boeing by launching a new widebody family of aircraft with the A330 twin-engine airliner and its sister aircraft, the four-engine A340, increasingly challenging Boeing's dominance of the large airliner market. Boeing's response was to go out to the airlines to find out what exactly they wanted for their future fleet requirements. It initially consulted eight (Delta, American and United in the US, British Airways in Europe, Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific and Qantas in the Asia-Pacific region) to define the 777's configuration and purpose. It formed specialist task forces to analyse its most important operational aspects, including everything from cargo loading to flight deck layout. It then set up special design-build teams with the 777's three launch customers: BA, All Nippon and United. BA sent a four-man team to Seattle where they were given access to all Boeing design staff and became deeply involved in the design process. Boeing introduced a similar working relationship with the engine manufacturers and other suppliers. It also formed 235 design-build teams inside the company to enable employees from all company divisions to work together as well as with airlines and outside suppliers. These teams have been sharing a common database to help them communicate quickly. Barry Gosnold, the head of BA's engineering activities in Seattle, says the Boeing-BA team has led to more than 100 changes to the basic specification of the aircraft. Changes have also been made to improve the maintainability of the aircraft and to ensure that the airliner is 'service ready' from the first day it enters into service with BA in the second half of next year. BA says that among the most significant changes it has made was to persuade Boeing to adopt radial tyres, a device to store all the aircraft's loadable software, and a space-saving galley allowing an additional four passenger seats to be fitted to the cabin. Another benefit of the intensive customer dialogue was the decision to make about 80 different items traditionally offered as optional features on other aircraft as standard equipment on the 777. This included satellite and global positioning systems, increasingly important aircraft safety and navigational tools which are basic to the 777. Boeing admits that the way it has designed and developed the 777 is tantamount to a cultural and technical revolution for the traditionally 'do it alone' manufacturer. In many respects, it is also a return to the past. As Condit puts it: 'We are attempting to recapture the team spirit from the company's early days. In a sense, we're looking back to create the future.' Collaboration is now set to intensify on future aircraft programmes. The two biggest challenges for the industry in the next century will be the development of a superjumbo airliner capable of seating 600 to 800 passengers and a second-generation supersonic aircraft to replace Concorde with a longer range and about three times Concorde's 100 passenger seating capacity. On both these longer term projects, Boeing is already involved in joint studies with other leading manufacturers, including the four European Airbus partner companies, and with potential airline customers. Ultimately, however, the driving force behind Boeing's new, more open attitude to collaboration is to maintain its 60 per cent share of the commercial aircraft market. 'We will be focusing more than ever on our customers' requirements because we don't want to be left behind to allow someone else in,' Condit says.</p>

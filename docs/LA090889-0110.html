			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lloyd's of London Had a Strong 1986: The Lloyd's insurance market, which  reports results three years in arrears because of long delays in settling  claims, said profits rebounded in 1986. It put pretax profit for the year at $1  billion, more than three times its 1985 profit. Lloyd's Chairman Murray  Lawrence said although prospects for 1987 were encouraging, results for the  next three years would be less spectacular, with marine and aviation markets in  particular unlikely to produce satisfactory profits in 1988 and 1989.  </P></p>

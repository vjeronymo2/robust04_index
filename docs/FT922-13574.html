			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Whitehall prepared for change BRITAIN's civil servants are ready today to welcome a new government and ensure a seamless transition between administrations. Their preparations have been more complex this year, with the serious prospect of a change of government for the first time since 1979. As the likelihood of a hung parliament grew in the run-up to the election, the Civil Service also drafted guidelines on its role if there were no outright winner. For one party with an overall majority, the aim is to help the new government hit the ground running, with the main cabinet appointments able to be announced by the end of today. A hung parliament, could make progress much slower. It could be days or even weeks before an administration is formed which can win a parliamentary vote on its Queen's Speech. Throughout the negotiations, civil servants will be on hand to assist. Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, will be expected to act as an intermediary between the parties. He will keep the information channels open between the party leaders and Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's private secretary who will advise the monarch. Civil servants will be available to draft documents required for discussions between the parties. But while they can help in turning an indecisive result into a government, civil servants cannot become involved in politicians' negotiations. Throughout the election campaign, each government department has been working on briefs for the incoming government. At least two sets will have been prepared: a red one to brief an incoming Labour government, a blue one for a re-elected Conservative administration. The most prescient will have prepared a third set for the Liberal Democrats - not because they are expected to form the government, but to prepare for a government in which they play a role. These briefs will be in two sections. The first will offer incoming ministers background information on the state of their policy area: 'opening up the books', as one senior mandarin describes it. Decisions which need to be taken quickly will be listed, ranging from government appointments to main policy decisions - such as whether to send British troops to join the UN peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia. The second section will help the new minister plan the implementation of the party manifesto. The brightest and best in the department will have spent the election campaign combing the party manifestos and policy statements and monitoring announcements by spokesmen. The briefs will list the party's promises and offer advice on how they can be implemented - inviting the minister to indicate priorities and preferences. With less than a month to the Queen's Speech on May 6, civil servants have already produced drafts for ministers to consider at an early meeting of the cabinet sub-committee which will supervise the speech. For the first time since 1979, civil servants have had the opportunity to discuss the opposition's plans with members of the shadow cabinet. Under rules drawn up in the 1960s, permanent secretaries are allowed to meet the relevant shadow ministers to learn of their plans during the last six months of a parliament. This procedure could not be adopted in 1983 or 1987 as the elections were called before this final six-month period. With both the main parties planning a Whitehall shake-up, the new prime minister will have to agree the changes in the machinery of government before ministers can be appointed. Already a government building has been earmarked for the super ministry for arts, broadcasting, sport and tourism promised by Conservatives and Labour. Buildings have also been identified for the ministries for women, children and overseas development planned by Labour. All that remains is the rapid filling of ministers' diaries.</p>

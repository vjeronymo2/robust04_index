			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rising Asian demand lifts Scholl to Pounds 16.7m Despite a downturn in some of its core European markets, Scholl, the healthcare products group, increased pre-tax profits by 3.8 per cent in 1993. Rising demand in Asia and growth in its licensing and distribution business underpinned an advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 16.1m) in the year to December 31. Together with contributions from new acquisitions, increased sales in south-east Asia helped to offset flat or falling European turnover, especially in Italy where sales declined by Pounds 4m to Pounds 20.5m. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said new subsidiaries - dominated by Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical group acquired for Pounds 16.8m in June last year - pushed group turnover ahead by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 171.9m. They also offset a decline in profits on continuing operations with an Pounds 869,000 contribution - lifting total operating profits to Pounds 16m (Pounds 15.2m). Mr Franchino blamed the flat performance of its underlying business on the loss of its Coppertone licence in Italy, tighter operating margins on its retail business and increased marketing costs. The group was however, well placed to expand its core healthcare business. Earnings per share rose to 12.7p (12.1p) and the final dividend is increased to 3.8p (3.7p), making 6.4p (6.3p) for the year. COMMENT Scholl has seen fatigue set into its traditional markets, none more so than in the UK where sales of its famous shoes have declined sharply. But it has acted fast to counter the problems by bringing new management into the retail business, while also distributing and licensing new products at home and overseas. That has paid off dramatically in Asia, which the group expects to be the group's largest profit centre by 1995. Further gains in the region have persuaded analysts to upgrade profit forecasts this year to Pounds 18.1m on a forward multiple of 13. With European markets unlikely to decline further and growth seemingly assured elsewhere, that makes the shares an attractive option.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Divergent views emerge on the outlook for equities Equity markets adopted a more sanguine mood yesterday after last week's declines, which stemmed from Wall Street and spilled over to Europe and Asia, resulting in a 2.3 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries World Index. Europe, France and Germany were among those hardest hit over the week, while Italy, the biggest loser, had the additional burden of political worries and their potential for disrupting the passage of the budget and the timetable for elections next year. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities expects that markets will end this week marginally lower. He notes that European bourses have had a 'supremely' good run and says that it was natural for investors to want to book some profits. He believes that prices will need to drift lower still before buyers would be enticed back into the market once again. Mr Sushil Wadwhani at Goldman Sachs International views last week's weakness as temporary turbulence, believing that the global bull market in equities is intact. He concedes, however, that there could be short-term risks as a result of continued profit-taking, with an increase in investor nervousness precipitating further price falls. But his optimism for the medium term stems from an expectation that inflation should remain subdued. At the same time, he says that equities remain significantly undervalued relative to interest rates. 'The equity weakness that has so far been caused by higher interest rates should, therefore, be a relatively temporary affair.' Mr Wadhwani adds that typically in periods of optimism about economic growth, equities outperform bonds. Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson is more bearish about the outlook. He began recommending investors to raise cash last Wednesday, warning that a rise in US short term rates was close. He sees no reason this week for investors to be returning to equities on a global front. He notes that US rates were cut sharply in mid-1992 to kick-start the economy and breathe life into an ailing banking sector. However, with the US recovery from recession now 32 months old and the banking sector back at record profits, he believes that an increase in the Federal funds rate is close. 'The risk is that the markets do not view a  1/4 point increase in isolation but as the first in a series of tightenings, which it will be. Equity markets such as Hong Kong and Germany are especially vulnerable to fears of a reversal of the US mutual fund finance.' Conversely, the economics team at James Capel doubts that the fall in the US bond market in recent days marks the end of a rally which had taken 30-year yields down from around 9 per cent in 1990 to below 6 per cent this October. 'The correction which has taken place so far is relatively small compared with previous sell-offs and is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely,' the team notes. 'We remain of the view that bonds will continue to rally through to the second quarter of next year, with 30-year yields dropping to just 5.2 per cent.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change                  % change in local currency ??   sterling ??  in US                                                             dollars ??             ------------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                          1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        -2.64    +2.90   +30.01   +30.16    +25.55     +23.27 Belgium        -0.22    +2.80   +23.92   +23.78    +15.96     +13.85 Denmark        -0.10    +4.59   +43.53   +37.83    +30.64     +28.27 Finland        -0.72    +5.18  +102.32   +97.66    +82.06     +78.75 France         -3.95    -2.53   +19.68   +16.74    +11.72      +9.68 Germany        -2.26    +1.24   +35.32   +30.65    +27.40     +25.09 Ireland        +0.71    +5.55   +63.86   +49.03    +31.40     +29.02 Italy          -5.47    -8.17   +40.10   +31.42    +20.04     +17.86 Netherlands    +0.21    +6.54   +37.53   +33.83    +30.73     +28.36 Norway         -2.80    +3.04   +53.56   +37.77    +31.62     +29.23 Spain          -3.02    +2.02   +52.79   +40.22    +20.20     +18.03 Sweden         -2.64    +2.18   +74.19   +37.89    +22.36     +20.13 Switzerland    -1.72    +5.08   +38.93   +29.40    +29.46     +27.10 UK             -2.62    -0.81   +16.42   +10.03    +10.03      +8.03 EUROPE         -2.49    +0.36   +27.58   +20.98    +17.59     +15.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      -1.68    +2.67   +40.74   +29.20    +29.19     +26.84 Hong Kong      -3.26   +13.69   +40.16   +62.53    +65.85     +62.83 Japan          -2.84    -3.29   +23.61   +21.53    +42.91     +40.30 Malaysia       -1.30    +6.97   +69.75   +75.97    +83.47     +80.13 New Zealand    +0.16    +7.29   +67.18   +45.75    +60.93 +58.01 Singapore      -4.28    +1.60   +52.66   +40.24    +46.90     +44.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada         -1.55    +4.64   +17.42   +18.09    +18.18      +6.04 USA            -1.89    -0.53    +9.40    +5.03     +6.97      +5.03 Mexico         +1.59   +10.90   +28.43   +12.44    +13.54     +11.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa   +2.47    +4.46   +38.95   +28.72    +46.40     +43.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX    -2.27    -0.57   +19.51   +15.39    +21.14     +18.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Dutch tax burden criticised THE DUTCH central bank yesterday praised the government for having cut the budget deficit, but criticised the way the reduction was achieved. Mr Wim Duisenberg, the bank's president, said the government was relying too heavily on raising tax revenues through such indirect levies as increased taxes on petrol and natural gas. Another factor behind the decline in the financing deficit was an accelerated programme of tax collection. 'There is but one road towards the restoration of a fundamentally sound state of public finance: bringing down the share of public expenditure in national product,' he told a news conference. In 1991, the budget deficit eased to 3.75 per cent of gross national product, below the government's target of 4.25 per cent, and is expected to drop to 3.25 per cent this year. However, by the end of its four-year tenure in office in late 1993, the centre-left coalition government of Mr Ruud Lubbers would have exceeded its original projections for tax revenue in the period by Fl 10bn (Pounds 3.05bn), Mr Duisenberg said. In the same period, social insurance premiums would have generated Fl 3.5bn more than planned in 1989. This trend reduced the purchasing power of consumers and the profitability of Dutch companies and ultimately exerted negative pressure on economic growth, he added. On Friday, Mr Lubbers, who leads the Christian Democrats, said he accepted that the budget would lead to a 1 per cent decline in the purchasing power of the lowest-paid in 1993, while medium- and higher-income households would gain by 1.5 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.</p>

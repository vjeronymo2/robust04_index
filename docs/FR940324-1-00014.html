			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. At the outset of each month, the Department would notify pre-qualified exporters of how much oil was available for export pursuant to the quota for the month. (It could provide notice by having firms telephone a special number and/or talk with a licensing officer.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. When nominating export volumes, the licensee would be required to provide the Department with documentation establishing: (a) Title to the oil or a contract to purchase the oil subject to approval of the export transaction; (b) a contract or contingent contract to export the oil subject to approval of the export transaction. The Department would also have to approve the intermediate and ultimate foreign consignees for the oil, and;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The licensee would have 30 days to complete the export. If the export did not occur during the 30 day license term, the Department would return the volume to the quota. If the licensee shipped part of the volume, the Department would return unshipped volumes to the quota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other key provisions include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Department would allow the export of up to a total of 2,281,000 barrels during any 30 day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Department would limit individual company exports to 1,000,000 barrels of oil during any 30 day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Department would process only one nomination per firm per 30 day period as long as there are outstanding nominations from non-affiliated firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department would implement the following provision in the event the volume of crude oil nominated for export exceeds the amount allowed during a 30 day period: 1. It would allocate to each applicant an equal share of the authorized volume. For example, if five licensees nominated a total over the authorized volume of exports, the Department would allocate each party 20 percent of the volume available for export (i.e., 456,000 barrels out the total of 2,281,000 barrels available), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Licensees would be allowed to combine volumes to achieve economic-sized cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the positive side, this option would be responsive to the spot-market nature of the market. The pre-qualifying process may ensure that many firms had the opportunity to participate in the export program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the negative side, the Department considers the two-step review process unnecessarily bureaucratic. This approach would require the Department to actively manage licenses and keep running accounts on the amounts available for licensing at any one time. In addition, exporters would have to contact the Department on an ongoing basis to determine what volume was available for export during a given month. Exporters would have to constantly report on whether they conducted exports and whether they exceeded their authorized export level. The Department would also have to establish a procedure to screen and pre-qualify new entrants on a continuous basis to ensure that they would receive an opportunity to participate in the export program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department invites written comments from interested parties that may assist it in implementing the President's decision. Specifically, we solicit information concerning the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) What are the pros and cons of each of the licensing options presented, and which, if any, do you prefer?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are there other licensing approaches that would better allow U.S. exporters to take advantage of this opportunity? If you have a specific licensing scheme in mind, please explain it, discuss the pros and cons of the selected option, and explain how the Department should implement your approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Should the Department review export license applications monthly, or more or less frequently (e.g., quarterly, semiannually, annually, continuously)? Are exports of up to 2.28 million barrels per license sufficient to make licenses available to more than one company while retaining the commercial viability of the exports? If not, what is the optimal cargo size (barrels) for economically viable export shipments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Should an exporter have more or less than a 90-day license to export California crude oil in a spot market trading environment? What would be the optimal time to allow an exporter to pursue business activities while not denying opportunities to other exporters?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Should the Department carry over export volumes not shipped in one calendar year to the next year? What is the optimal time that the Department should carry over volumes not shipped during one calendar year?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Merseyside's Klondikers given a shake: Businesses have been warned oil profits will not fall into their laps A 'Klondike mentality' on Merseyside is preventing some companies in the region from seizing the opportunities offered by big investments in oil and gas fields off Liverpool. This is the conclusion of Mr Alan Kennedy, an adviser to Sefton Borough Council, which covers Bootle, Crosby and Southport. Mr Kennedy, a recently retired Shell executive with more than 20 years' experience of the offshore industry, says local companies will have to fight hard to win business arising from the oil finds. He claims some are not ambitious enough and expect orders to come to them simply because they are on the spot. 'The oil industry doesn't need Liverpool and Merseyside,' he warns. 'It is self-contained and can import everything it needs.' His attitude is echoed by Mr John Carne, operations director of US-owned Cooper Energy Services in Bootle. 'I discourage the belief that this will be another Klondike,' he says. 'You have to take a more measured approach. One should not predict success on the back of a few oil and gas fields - we have to be cautious.' Those 'few' fields could be significant. They are in Liverpool Bay, the stretch of Irish Sea in the right-angle formed by Lancashire and north Wales. There are 200m barrels of oil, mainly in Douglas, a field 15 miles north of Point of Ayr on the Welsh side of the Dee estuary. The rest is in a field called Lennox, five miles west of Southport. Lennox also contains gas - part of 1,000bn cu ft found there and in two other fields by Hamilton Oil, a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel, minerals and energy group. Gas has also been found in nearby fields called Hamilton and Hamilton North. Field life is estimated at 17 years, but the Hamilton consortium - its partners in the exploration are Lasmo and Monument - expects to find more. Sixteen companies have obtained exploration licences for the area. Hamilton chose the unused docks at Bootle as the onshore supply base for the project, against bids from several other areas, including Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, Heysham in Lancashire and Point of Ayr. The activity has raised local expectations, which political and business leaders are trying to curb so local people will not be disappointed when they discover there may not be a bonanza. Ms Rita Darwin, head of economic development for the Merseyside borough of Sefton, says: 'At the most superficial level, people have watched Dallas on television and think this is what happens when oil is discovered on your doorstep. 'They look at the growth of Aberdeen 20 years ago and hope for something similar. But Aberdeen became a boom town with an oil price of Dollars 30 a barrel. Something similar is not going to happen here with the price down to Dollars 18.' As margins have tightened, oil companies have become increasingly cost-conscious. 'We don't expect Hamilton to employ a lot of people,' Ms Darwin says. 'Meeting technical specifications locally may also require a lot of investment as well as a new understanding of what is meant by service in an industry that expects it instantly, 24 hours a day. 'But we also know they will want wires, slings, furniture, taxis, painting, security, hotels, food, videos and day-to-day consumables. This is where we are already beginning to see immediate benefits to the local economy.' These may be merely the crumbs of Hamilton's total Pounds 350m budget for all onshore and offshore spending on the Liverpool Bay project - but they can sustain a lot of small companies. Mr Mike Swift, director of Sefton Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says: 'To get any of this new money into the local economy, we have had to learn how the oil and gas industry buys its goods and services. We have also had to understand it's not another Klondike where fortunes will be made easily.' Others have shown that cautious optimism is not misplaced. Mr Tony Cafferkey, owner-manager of Southport's Scarisbrick Hotel, has spent Pounds 1.2m on upgrading it in the past three years. The result has been to push a seasonal seaside holiday hotel into the business-traveller market, achieving an 85 per cent year-round occupancy rate. 'People think it's all high-tech,' says Mr Swift. 'It isn't. The supply of paper clips will be a significant piece of business. We need it locally.'</p>

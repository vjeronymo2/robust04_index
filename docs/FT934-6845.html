			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fibre losers in Uruguay Round Sir, The contention that 'Clinton got his (Nafta) backing at a bargain price' (November 19) ignores massive potential costs for developing countries. Clinton's vow to extend the phase-out of textile quotas must put in question the US's willingness to submit to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade disciplines and to share some of the gains from the Uruguay Round with the Third World. Textiles and clothing account for about a quarter of the total manufactured exports of developing countries. For nearly 20 years the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) has discriminated against this vital sector. Almost all developing countries' gains from the Uruguay Round come from the ending of the MFA. Without a good textile agreement, much of the Third World is likely to face net losses. The current Uruguay Round text is already problematic. The MFA phase-out happens over 10 years, with most of the benefits coming at the end, and northern countries will be allowed to apply 'safeguards' for another eight years. To extend this time period still further is unacceptable. To give way to protectionist lobbies now puts in question the willingness of the US to reduce protectionism in 10 years' time. Without a fast timetable for MFA reform the Uruguay Round package does not look attractive to developing countries. Peter Madden, policy adviser, Christian Aid, PO Box 100, London SE1 7RT</p>

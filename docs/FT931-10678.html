			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Game, set, match FOR TWO hours on Thursday I banged balls with my tennis coach, Jasper Strong. I haven't mentioned my tennis coach before. The reason I haven't mentioned him is that I resent the hand he was dealt by the gods and goddesses that presided at his birth. Jasper Strong is 6ft 5in to my 6ft 2in. He has long blond hair and the physique of a discus-hero-at-Olympia. He is 23 years of age and has never been told, as Joan Didion once put it, that golden lads and girls all must as chimney sweepers come to dust. Result: he lives in a fantasy world where everything - especially the future - looks 'brilliant.' On Thursday we worked on my backhand volley. Eventually (we have a machine that measures this), Jasper was hitting forehand drives at 273mph at my left eyeball. At those sorts of speeds, one slip and you're dead; the ball would splatter your brain. Afterwards, we sat on the clubhouse steps and Jasper ribbed me about John Major's recent upbeat speech at a Tory fund-raising dinner. According to the prime minister, the British have a genius for running themselves down. 'It's time to start selling Britain abroad,' he said, 'and stop selling Britain short.' There were sound reasons for optimism about Britain's prospects. 'I suppose,' said Jasper pleasantly, 'that John Major was taking a swing at all you whingeing Wilhelminas in the media. You're doomsters and pessimists. You trade in misfortunes. Major must be sick of you. Life is really quite enjoyable, you know.' 'Jasper,' I said. 'It wasn't until I read John Major's catatonically chirpy speech that I realised how far down the slippery slope we really are. We are gonners, Jasper. The show is over. Game, set and match. Or virtually.' 'That's not what catatonic means.' 'Never mind. Until that speech I had the whimsical notion that we might just pull through. Now I'm certain we are doomed. The trouble with mankind is its optimism. At present, a few John Bull characters are telling us there is nothing to fear but fear itself; that the recession is a hiccup; that Man's ascent from the primeval soup to mastery of the galaxy will shortly recommence. Do not believe a word of it.' Jasper stirred uneasily. He is not used to hearing things spelt out. Apart from me, all his clients are rich women who live in the vicinity of London's Kensington Church Street: fantasyland, daisyworld. 'The biggest problem of all,' I said, 'is unchecked population growth, but no politicians are grappling with it. John Major doesn't know whether sterling should go up or down, so how can he envisage the prospects implicit in runaway population growth? The UN reckons that world population will plateau, by 2100, at around 11.5bn, more than twice 1990's 5.3bn. 'But an environmental crisis caused by pollution and consumption is already strangling us. Deforestation. Land degradation. Red tides. The ozone hole. Possible global warming. Mass extinction of species and attrition of biological diversity. Ahead of us lie what Paul Harrison, a population expert, calls 'four decades of the fastest growth in human numbers in all history.' 'You should read Harrison's book, The Third Revolution. He says that the population battlefield has been stamped into a morass. On one side are the Cassandras, the more extreme of whom blame overpopulation for almost every ill that human flesh is heir to. 'Attacking the Cassandras from the left are the socialists. For them, inequality in all its forms is the disease, and population growth only a symptom. On the right, conservatives see interference in free markets as the only obstacle to everlasting prosperity. They welcome population growth and can see no reason why it should not continue until we have colonised the entire galaxy. 'I, Jasper, am a Cassandra. Unless the Cassandras are heeded, it is all over bar the shooting.' 'What is your solution?' I said: 'I think I have run out of words. I'll tell you next week.' Just then, Jasper's mobile phone rang. It was Priscilla Humpington-Kooning, one of his Kensington clients, asking him to visit her. Her day had been brilliant. Wasn't life just wonderful. She had been to Harvey Nicks. Had only spent Pounds 12,000. Said the place was deserted. The Third Revolution, by Paul Harrison. I B Tauris &amp; Co, Pounds 18.95.</p>

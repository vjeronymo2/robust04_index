			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> BAT Hearings Set for Next Week: Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said  it will hold a hearing next week to decide whether Sir James Goldsmith's  Hoylake Investments Ltd. can extend its $21.4-billion hostile bid for BAT  Industries PLC beyond the normal 60-day deadline. A ruling on an extension  would be pivotal to the outcome of the 13.4 billion-pound hostile offer for the  British conglomerate, analysts said. In a related development, AXA-MIDI  Assurances of France said it filed applications in nine states, including  California, to acquire Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Inc. Last week, AXA said  that it would purchase Farmers for $4.5 billion upon conditions being  satisfied, including Hoylake's bid for BAT being successful and the approval of  insurance regulators.  </P></p>

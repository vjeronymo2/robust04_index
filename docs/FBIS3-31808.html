He said that the acceptance of new  Eastern and Central European countries as NATO members would  create new political barriers and would put Russia in the  position of having to counteract the process, which would result  in its isolation.    According to Kozyrev, Pan-European partnership should be  based on cooperation within the CSCE, which has been taking  place until now, and the CSCE should be transformed into an  effective organization. The Russian foreign minister said that  European military and political cooperation should be  concentrated in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which  should coordinate efforts by NATO, the European Union, the  Council of Europe, the Western European Union, and the CIS.    Kozyrev emphasized the need to consolidate cooperation  within  the North Atlantic Council and pointed out the need to implement  the Partnership for Peace program based on the principle of  equality. According to the Russian minister, a network of  bilateral agreements between states that are not NATO members  should also be established as part of the Partnership program.  In Kozyrev's opinion, this could initiate closer relations  between the CIS and NATO.    The Russian foreign minister stressed that the Pan-European  partnership plan would also incorporate security guarantees to  be given to Eastern and Central European states by Russia and  its Western European partners. He added that the acceptance of  new Eastern and Central European states as NATO members could  create new political barriers, which would put Russia in the  position of having to counteract them and which would result in  Russia's isolation.    Kozyrev added that closer economic cooperation should be  established as part of the partnership program. He also pointed  out the need to open Western markets to East European goods.</p>

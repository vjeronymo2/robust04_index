			<p>BFN  <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "The Third </F> `Foreign' Tide--Roundup of Current Developments in Use of  Foreign Funds in China"]    [Text]Upsurge in "Foreign" Tide    In late 1993, a government spokesman announced loudly to  Chinese and foreign reporters that China that year had become  the second largest foreign funds recipient in the world. The  amount of funds drawn in that year was equal to the total amount  for the 14 previous years. In the same year, more than 83,000  foreign-funded projects were approved, involving $111.4 billion,  of which $27.5 billion was actually used to run the projects.  The increases in these three figures over the previous year  were 70.6, 91.7, and 150 percent respectively. Meanwhile, in  Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as the supply of office floor  space to consumers related to foreign business firms fell short  of the demand, many potential renters were looking for leases.  Some high-ranking officials said jokingly that this was the  third "foreign" tide since 1979, characterized by the influx of  foreign funds!    The years 1984 and 1988 saw two peaks of foreign investment  in China. Now, after ups and downs, this upsurge in the great  tide has finally gained enough momentum to bring forward the  third peak. So far, the actual amount of foreign funds drawn in  has reached $61.8 billion and the number of foreign-invested  enterprises exceeds 100,000, employing a labor force of nearly  10 million and accounting for nearly 8 percent of the country's  gross industrial output value and about one-third of the  country's import-export volume. Beijing Jeep, Xian Jansen [2799  2773], Shenzhen Kangjia [1660 0163], Tianjin Shike [0670 0344],  and Shanghai Volkswagen... all these brand names and the  products bearing these brands have long been regarded by the  Chinese public with great relish.    At present, a new, multilevel, omnidirectional opening-up  pattern is taking shape in China, integrating coastal areas,  areas along rivers and borders, and hinterland provinces and  regions. Amid this process, investments by foreign businessmen  are showing the following new characteristics:    --The sources of investments are diversified and investments  are imported from more than 120 countries and areas, of which  Hong Kong (including Macao), Taiwan, the United States, and  Japanese interests are the largest investors.    --Investment targets are extended from coastal areas to the  hinterland because the proportion of foreign investments in the  hinterland in the total foreign investments in the country has  increased by more than 10 percent.    --Investment forms tend to be diversified. Since 1992,  nearly 30 Sino-foreign joint ventures and a few stockholding  companies aiming at investment in productive projects have  received approval for their establishment and more than 50  enterprises have issued category B and category H stocks abroad.  By issuing stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Maanshan  Iron and Steel Corporation managed to raise capital of nearly 4  billion Hong Kong dollars on a single occasion. Efforts are  being made to explore other investment instruments, such as  funds, bonds, and trusts.    The formation of this new pattern has been followed by a  great shift in the focus of investment:    --The investment structure has been further optimized in the  wake of the shift from short-cycle, appropriate technology and  quick- return medium and small projects to capital- and  technology-intensive medium- and long-term large projects. The  average investment value per project, which used to be less than  $900,000 before 1991, increased to nearly $1.35 million last  year, with a number of investment projects of rather great size  beginning in infrastructure and basic industries. Of the  FORTUNE 500 largest enterprises, 52 companies have entered China  to make investments in 26 trades, involving nearly $4 billion.  This accounts for about 50 percent of all U.S. investments in  China. Technological cooperative projects run by IBM, Dupont,  Bell, Siemens, Philips, Mitsubishi, and Matsushita have been  launched in China in turn and all these investors are very  eagerly expanding their investment scale.    --The field of investment is expanding daily. In the past,  over 90 percent of foreign-funded investments were in productive  type projects. According to last year's incomplete statistics,  however, at least 20 percent of the projects and 30 percent of  the investment funds have now gone to real estate, development  of large tracts of land, tourist facilities, and other branches  of tertiary industry, such as transport, banking, insurance,  consultative services, and commercial retail sales. After the  Japanese Yaohan International Marketing Group's arrival in  Pudong, some open cities have now begun to allow foreign  businessmen to invest in large commercial building projects and  some information and consultative service companies and  accountant firms, run using Chinese and foreign capital, have  also been allowed to start business. Foreign businessmen are  even encouraged to run newly opened sea transport routes and  invest in oil fields in North China, including the Tarim Basin  oil field.    --In addition to this, we have also seen a shift of focus  from separate, single investment projects to joint investment or  combined regional development projects.    The introduction of foreign funds has, to a certain extent,  made up for the shortages in funds to run construction projects  in China. At the same time, the import of foreign advanced  technology, equipment, and management know-how has filled gaps  in some industries and foreign-funded enterprises have become  the mainstays in such industries as auto manufacturing,  elevator, color TV tubes, and microelectronics.    The introduction of foreign capital into China has given an  impetus to the transformation of the operational mechanism in  Chinese enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises have set a good  example to local ones and many old Chinese enterprises have been  reinvigorated through joint projects with foreign firms.  China's number one leading clock and watch manufacturer, the  Polaris Group, which faced an impasse before introducing foreign  capital, is once again thriving and the Harbin "Suibao Thermal  Flask" has also made its might felt once again after introducing  overseas capital.    The introduction of foreign capital has also helped expand  export trade producing foreign exchange earnings and increasing  financial revenue. According to customs statistics, the  import-export volume of foreign-funded enterprises alone totaled  $43.75 billion in 1992, equal to the country's total  import-export volume 10 years ago. Last year, China's tax  revenue contributed by taxpayers related to foreign capital  totaled 20.5 billion yuan, an increase of 80 percent over the  previous year.    So we may say that the third "foreign" tide signifies the  most exciting and influential development in China's  accelerating marketization and internationalization process.  <H5>  Only the Fittest Will Survive </H5>   However, one cannot be sure that no negative factors arise  as  the "foreign" tide surges ahead. There is no doubt that we have  faced some problems when introducing foreign funds. The  following are some of the prominent problems:    The distribution of foreign funds is still irrational.  Medium and small projects in general processing industries  still make up rather too big a proportion of all the  investments, whereas relatively few key investment projects have  been launched to develop economic sectors which badly need to be  developed. What is more, investments are dispersed and  investment projects which have been initiated blindly are quite  common. For example, in 1992, a great influx of foreign funds  went into the real estate industry. This was because some  localities which were very eager to draw in foreign funds laid  undue stress on "quantity" rather than on "quality," and they  did not know enough about the distribution of foreign funds, the  technology involved in foreign-funded projects, their scale, and  the market conditions.    Control over importing foreign funds has yet to be  intensified. Some foreign businessmen do not keep their promise  to provide the funds to finance investment projects, or the  funds are recalled soon after they were laid out, whereas the  enterprises concerned continue to enjoy the preferential  treatment which has already been granted. Some foreign-funded  enterprises claim to be suffering losses but many of them are  actually making profits, claiming to be suffering losses only to  avoid tax payment. Such practices lead to a remarkable drain on  state-owned assets. Some foreign-funded enterprises do not  export their products according to the ratio as prescribed in  the contracts signed, trying instead to enlarge their share of  the domestic market and thus reducing the state's foreign  exchange earnings. In 1992 alone, the gap between import and  export value by foreign-funded enterprises was as wide as $1  billion and management-labor disputes and industrial accidents  happen from time to time. In the final analysis, these can be  attributed to some other main causes beside the unsound system  of laws and regulations. Certain localities have arbitrarily  formulated their preferential policies, contract examination and  approval procedures are not strict enough, and in some cases the  procedures are so loose that whatever is submitted will be  approved without exception. In addition, the undue stress laid  on preferential treatment in terms of policy has landed some  state-owned enterprises, as well as township and town  enterprises, in an unfavorable position in the market.    The investment environment in some localities does not seem  to be good enough as transport, energy, and telecommunications  facilities are still underdeveloped; regulations and laws  governing the use of foreign funds are not sound enough; and the  market mechanism has not been established. This hinders the  normal operation of foreign- funded enterprises and the inflow  of foreign capital and, as a result, some big consortia with  intentions of investing in China are still hesitating to really  make a move.    Many foreign businessmen said they are very eagerly looking  forward to a healthy and orderly environment investment which  encourages fair competition, since a few "preferential" measures  alone can never substitute for a long-term policy. State  Statistical Bureau recently conducted a sample survey of more  than 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and these selected  enterprises called strongly for action as soon as possible to  step up the establishment of a system of laws concerning foreign  investors and increase the transparency in the process of  importing foreign funds.  <H5>  Let the "Foreign" Tide Surge Still Higher </H5>   Some time ago some people were doubtful as to whether or not  "the amount of foreign capital imported into this country is too  much or not enough." In this regard, an authoritative source of  the foreign capital administration department of the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted that China must be  one of the few developing countries that have imported the  largest amount of foreign capital in absolute value. But, while  other countries started importing foreign capital in the 1960's,  China did not make a move until the early 1980's, not to mention  the fact that we lost the golden opportunity around 1989 for  various reasons. In terms of the per capita amount of imported  foreign capital, China ranks far behind Southeast Asian  countries and the actual amount of investment made by foreign  businessmen accounts for only about 10 percent of the total  value of the country's fixed assets. Therefore, objectively  speaking, the amount of foreign capital imported into the  country is not too much but, instead, is not enough.    The survey concerned reveals that China enjoys the  following major advantages in attracting foreign investors: An  ample supply of labor force, a fast growing economy, and an  incomparably vast market. A newly founded small development  zone, with an area of only 0.5 aquare km, in Wuhu City, Anhui  Province, which perviously was little known to foreign  investors, has attracted investors from 10 countries and areas,  not to mention the special economic zones along the coast and  the large municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. A  city in Zhejiang Province nicknamed "the pocket-sized entry  port" attracted a host of foreign businessmen as soon as it  declared its intention to invite foreign investment. The Hong  Kong Wharf (Holdings) Group owned by the late world-class  shipping magnate Y.K. Pao, and other big companies, such as  General Motors, Chengta [2973 1129], and Mitsui, have invested  $10 to $100 million U.S. dollars in that city. This has fully  proved foreign investors' great interest in China as well as our  country's appeal to foreign investors.    The problem is how are we going to ensure better quality of  foreign investment projects while trying to attract more foreign  capital.    The shift of focus from quantity to quality is a gradual  process. Our people used to be afraid that importing foreign  capital would result in the occupation of our market by foreign  interests, that foreign-funded enterprises would squeeze out  state-owned enterprises or, in brief, that foreign investors  would take away all the benefits. Views like these have been on  some people's minds all the time during the opening-up process.  A city in Jiangsu Province prepared a list of enterprises, with  extremely low economic returns, which were about to close down,  and they were recommended as partners for joint ventures with  foreign investors. Meanwhile, those enterprises with good  economic returns and great potential for development were  "protected" by being excluded from the joint venture candidate  list. As a result, over a long period, foreign- funded  enterprises in that city have had no chance to thrive. Some  joint ventures which were running big projects and had already  had large factory buildings built could not start operation  simply because the government department concerned hesitated to  give them the green light.    In fact, it is fair for us to pay some price to attract  foreign businessmen to make investments in our country. The  purpose of investment is to make money, and only if you are  willing to give away some "benefits" will you be able to dispel  others' doubts and misgivings, will investors be willing to  invest in large-scale and high-tech projects, and will we thus  enjoy domestic prosperity. Now that Coca-Cola and McDonald's  have come, the beverage and fast food industries are thriving on  an unprecedented scale. Motorola's huge investments have  enabled hundreds of thousands of Chinese to use the wonderful  telephone pagers. If the Shanghai Volkswagen had not been  transformed into a Sino-German joint venture, this plant, we are  afraid, would not have been able to produce Santana-brand cars  so soon. What is our greatest advantage? It is the enormous  market with a 1.1-billion population. So "market in exchange  for capital" and "market in exchange for technology" are the  only natural choices before us when we are to capitalize on  foreign funds.</p>

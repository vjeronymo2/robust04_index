			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-BASKETBALL PLAYER SUES UNIVERSITY OVER ILLITERACY  </P> <P> A former Creighton University basketball player who claimed that he was  functionally illiterate when he left the school in 1982 has filed a lawsuit  alleging that educators there failed to adequately teach him.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed by Kevin Ross also accuses the Omaha, Neb., university of  breach of contract and seeks an unspecified amount of damages.  </P> <P> Ross, whose problems gained national attention, contends in the lawsuit that  Creighton recruited him when it knew or should have known that he was  "ill-equipped and unable to successfully participate" in the school's  curriculum.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was processed in Cook County Circuit Court on Monday.  </P> <P> Ross, 30, also alleges that Creighton enrolled him in Chicago's Westside  Preparatory School, a noted private elementary and high school, but failed to  monitor his progress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second-Grade Level  </P> <P> Ross read at a second-grade level when he entered Westside in 1982 but after  eight months under the tutelage of educator Marva Collins, his reading level  increased to that of a high school senior.  </P> <P> A television movie was made documenting his efforts at Westside, but according  to the lawsuit, Creighton was negligent by not placing Ross in a proper adult  education program.  </P> <P> It further alleges that Creighton's negligence led Ross to suffer severe  depression, illustrated by a July 23, 1987, incident in which he barricaded  himself in a Chicago motel room and tossed furniture and other items out the  window.  </P> <P> The incident was "a manifestation of this depression," the lawsuit alleges.  </P> <P> Creighton officials could not be reached for comment early today. In February,  the Rev. Michael Morrison, university president, said he was still haunted by  Ross's plight.  </P> <P> "When will Kevin go away?" Morrison asked a student who had mentioned seeing an  article about Ross. "Oh, my God, I wish I knew."  </P></p>

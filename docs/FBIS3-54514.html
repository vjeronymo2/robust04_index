			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Higher State Council Chairman Ali Kafi by </F> Hasan Zaytuni in Algiers; date not given; from the  "Face-to-Face" program]    [Text] [Zaytuni] Mr. Chairman Ali Kafi, welcome to the MBC  television center. We thank you for agreeing to give this  interview which, as you know, coincides with Algeria's and the  Algerians' preparations for the national conference on dialogue  to find a way out of Algeria's crisis. Mr. Chairman, can you  talk about the hopes that the Algerian leadership is pinning on  this conference?    [Kafi] Thank you. First, I in my turn thank the MBC for this  interest in Algeria and its problems. Thank you. Regarding  your question, I and everyone who follows up on the developments  in Algeria believe that a qualitative change could have happened  had this crisis not taken place. Viewers and all those who  watch your programs should be given the full picture of Algeria  before the present stage, that is, from 1962 until 1988 when a  popular uprising took place that filled the streets all over  Algeria. The leadership at the time came to the conclusion that  it was necessary to review the Constitution. Political  pluralism was approved because it was one party rule. From that  time on, Algeria began to deal with this new concept of  organizing the political and social life of the country.  Parties began to be established very quickly and 62 or 63  parties were set up. Between 1989 and December 1991,  legislative elections were organized. I believe that this was  not enough time. That's one point. Second, the parties did not  organize themselves. The administration was still fragile and  could not act as it should in organizing the elections and we  saw what happened following the 26 December elections.    When the results of the elections were announced, they were  contested and were met with strong rejection. So there was a  need for change. The Parliament had ended its term and the  president of the Republic resigned. There was a vacuum.  Naturally, we decided that the state should continue. So we  formed the Higher State Council under the late brother Mohamed  Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul. We drew up a plan to  extricate the country from its crisis as quickly as possible.  The task entrusted to the Higher State Council was to carry out  the duties for the remaining two years of the five-year term of  the president. The Higher State Council was formed under  Boudiaf, who, after six months in power, was assassinated, as  you know. I was chosen to replace him. I assumed power and we  began our work to address the situation because we found out  that the three pillars on which the state was built were in a  state of collapse. We found that the state was in a shambles,  the economy was collapsing, and that Algerian society was in  total disarray from lack of confidence resulting from the  accumulation of previous mistakes.    [Zaytuni] Mr. President, regarding the idea of dialogue,  certain parties, particularly the National Liberation Front  [FLN] and the Socialist Forces Front, have boycotted the  National Conference. Will this boycott affect the results of  the conference or will it continue, even if these parties and  others fail to participate?    [Kafi] Before answering this question directly, I would like  to say that in September 1992 we endorsed the policy of dialogue  with all political parties, economic and social partners, and  other confederal committees concerned with these tasks, such as  the Mojahedin Organization, the Martyrs' Sons Organization, and  the Farmers Union, etc. These are large, important pillars in  the country.    We adopted the policy of dialogue and embarked on a first  round, a second, and a third round from which we emerged with  the document in June 1993, a document called the basis for  national dialogue. All the parties responded. We prepared a  complete file on what took place at these stages of dialogue and  based on these replies and this basis. Then we heard and sensed  from some statements by various parties that we should negotiate  or have a dialogue with the army, and so on. We decided in the  end that we should give another stimulus to the dialogue. Thus,  we formed a national committee to be in charge of completing the  dialogue in light of what took place in the previous rounds, and  of the parties' replies. This began in September 1993 and has  continued to this day, until after tomorrow, that is, Tuesday 25  January and 26 January, when the conference is slated to be held.    Regarding the second part of the question about the fronts,  or the so-called three fronts, that is, the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front], the FLN, and the Socialist Front of Ayet  Ahmed. Before going into this, we have to mention that on 23  November 1993, the Higher Council decided that there must be a  dialogue with Islamic figures [al-hasasiyat al-islamiyah] and  the dialogue committee did in fact began contacts with the  Islamic figures, both those outside and inside the detention  camps. That is premature now [sentence as heard]. But with  regard to the FLN and the Socialist Front, it appears that these  fronts had concluded a power-sharing agreement before the  December elections. Therefore, we see now that they do not want  to participate in the dialogue, in the national conference,  because they appear to already have an agreement and want to put  the authority in a tight situation.    As chairman of the Higher State Council, I personally wish  and hope that they return to reason because the issue is not one  of maneuvers at present. It is the issue of crisis. We did not  hide this fact and said that it is a political crisis that has  to be dealt with politically, that political solutions must be  found for it, and that it is our hope to save the country from  this crisis once and for all so that it will not recur after  two, five, or 10 years. Therefore, when we opted for dialogue  with all the partners, it was not a [word indistinct] but a  strategic one. The objective is: first, to end the crisis in  the country; second, to get the parties used to discussing with  each other the country's affairs through dialogue and not  through violence. Somebody might say that if these fronts do  not attend the conference, then the dialogue would not have the  desired importance. I reply that public opinion will be the  judge. Are these fronts present in the field and do they  control it or not? I say that Algerian society comprises a  large number of parties and organizations and it is watching  these parties' conduct and these parties' losses will be great  because public opinion and history will judge them. That is why  I hope that they will not place themselves before the court of  history.    [Zaytuni] Let us turn to the expression political families,  which you mentioned in your speech yesterday. I very much liked  the phrase because it reflects the nature of Algerian society,  whose ethics reject violence and unethical practices, whether  those carried out by some quarters in the Algerian streets such  as political assassinations or by the authority's official stand  vis-a-vis these quarters, such as the arrests at the detention  camps in the desert. All these acts, be they torture or  assassinations, do not conform to the ethics of Algerian  society. The phrase political families reflects your position  regarding party plurality in Algeria. You welcome pluralism,  provided it serves the country.    [Kafi] This is a many-sided question. I mentioned the phrase  political families at a meeting with strugglers yesterday. We  said let us meet with all parties that have similar views so  that we can seek real solutions for getting the country out of  the crisis. Thus, we extended....[sentence incomplete as  heard]. I talked about this yesterday. Before we started the  dialogue, the parties themselves were alienated from each other  and were not in the habit of sitting down together to discuss  national issues in a rational, calm, and methodical manner. So  we got them used to sitting down together, and this is what I  referred to yesterday as a major gain, because such alienation  does not allow us to reach the desired solutions. So, when the  parties got together, talked together, and exchanged opinions  and counter opinions, this is the essence of democracy. We must  sit down together and exchange views. Before, people used to  hear about each other's views and each party refused the other's  views. But when we meet, we may find something in common,  particularly if your goal and mine regarding the national cause  is sincere. This is what is talked about. As for the  phenomenon of violence, it is true that it is alien to us. It  does not belong to the Algerian society, nor does it belong to  the Arab Maghreb community, as you know. This phenomenon is  alien to our society, as I have previously mentioned in several  speeches and even in my dialogue with the partners. This in  fact is what is described as the Afghan phenomenon. In brief,  in the 1948 war the Algerians went on foot to Palestine, where  they saw the war there. When they heard about the Afghan people  and watched the Jamal al-Din al-Afghani [19 Century political  struggler in Egypt of Afghan origin] series on television -- as  you know Algerians follow the news of great men in the Arab and  Islamic worlds -- they went and volunteered. They [not further  specified] picked them up from several areas -- some went to  London and several other areas. After that, they all met in  Peshawar, where they received advanced military training and  joined the battle alongside the Afghan mojahedin against  communism, at that time. When the communist bloc and the Soviet  Union collapsed and the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan,  the people who were supervising these groups let them go. Each  one went his own way and started wreaking havoc in the world.  Some of these groups are present here in Algeria. [Words  indistinct] in Afghanistan and took part in the war in  Afghanistan. Now, it is wreaking havoc here in Algeria,  something which is truly alien to our society, our traditions,  our upbringing, and the makeup of Algerian society. Thus, we  believe that is an alien phenomenon.    [Zaytuni] There is one point, Mr. Chairman. The people who  have practiced and have chosen violence justify this by  referring to the suspension of what is termed the election  process and say that they had won the elections but the  authorities prevented them from taking over. They have an  argument with which to justify their actions. How do you view  this argument?    [Kafi] I do not talk about arguments. A person involved in  politics has to behave politically. Violence must be rejected.  They can attain power but not through violence. It is wrong  for anyone to use violence because the election process was  halted. It is wrong because, as I said before, one can contest  the results. The elections were neither honest nor clean and  the administration was weak and could not manage the elections  and their process. But this cannot be used as an excuse to  carry weapons against the society to which one belongs.  Therefore, those who want to attain power -- and every party  has this ambition to attain power.... [changes thought] But  does one attain power with a program or with a gun? If with a  program, then all the people and public opinion will be the  judge. But with a gun, the people and public opinion could go  along with you out of fear and not out of conviction. This  argument is wrong. The dialogue within Algerian society, within  the political family, must be political and calm.    [Zaytuni] Mr. Chairman, let us leave the Algerian crisis  after this superb analysis and touch on Algeria's foreign  relations. Algeria will take over the chairmanship of the Arab  Maghreb Union [AMU] at the beginning of next month. What issues  or aspects will Algeria focus on achieving as chairman of this  union, which appears to be suffering from some sort of  stagnation?    [Kafi] To say that the AMU is suffering from stagnation is  correct. We wanted to deal with this situation and activate the  member countries' dealings, both collectively and bilaterally,  at the summit held in Nouakchott, Mauritania. But the number of  those who attended it was insufficient. Morocco was represented  by the prime minister and Libya by an ambassador. That was a  summit. If we want to give substance to this union, then  attendance must be at the required level. There are also some  problems that could at present be an obstacle to progress and to  what our peoples want from this union.    The AMU must be moved to the position it deserves because  all  the other partners are waiting for this. When we draw a clearly  defined strategy, then we would most certainly find a response  and a desire for cooperation from others on an equal footing.  But if each one continues to act unilaterally and uses the AMU  just as a cover or an excuse but refrains from moving forward  with it, then we would most certainly not attain the desired  objective. Algeria is convinced of the collective action of the  Arab Maghreb. The Algerian people, government, and  establishments are convinced of this. We believe that the AMU  is needed to strengthen the domestic situation in each country  and to strengthen this union with these immense human,  scientific, cultural, and economic strengths. There must be  serious planning for this process. We cannot tolerate such a  situation because of transient conditions that shake it and  render it stagnant.    Algeria believes in this union and we hope that when it  takes  over the chairmanship it will work seriously with all the  comrades to ensure the success of the union.    [Zaytuni] As a result of the rift in inter-Arab relations  following the Gulf war, there are attempts to achieve inter-Arab  reconciliation. What is Algeria's position on this issue?    [Kafi] Although my meetings with Arab officials are few,  because of the circumstances in Algeria and the fact that I do  not leave the country much, I did meet with many Arab brothers  at various levels, such as the Tunisian president and Egyptian  President Brother Husni Mubarak in June and we touched on this  issue. I even discussed this matter very frankly with Egyptian  intellectuals during a seminar. We believe that the Gulf war  happened and we should not say now who was wrong and who was  right. It is something that happened in the past and caused a  deep and wide rift among the Arab peoples and countries. We  should go beyond this. Inter-Arab reconciliation is necessary  if we are to place supreme Arab interests before other  considerations. This is because the purpose of reconciliation  is to close ranks, strengthen the negotiating power with the  others, and bolster and deepen respect for the Arab world by  others, particularly since we are going through a qualitative  and unipolar world transitional period. All these factors make  it incumbent upon us to get together and reconcile, because our  interest lies in getting together. For us in Algeria, the Arab  and Islamic world provides depth for us, and Algeria provides  depth for the Arab and Islamic world. The same is true for us  and Africa. All this should make us draft a well-defined  strategy for reconciliation. Each of the parties concerned  could make a concession so long as the ultimate objective is to  serve the supreme interests of the Arab nation.    [Zaytuni] Another issue in which Algeria has always played a  pioneering role concerns Arab-Israeli peace as well as the  Arab-Israeli conflict, which still exists. There are  initiatives toward achieving some kind of peace between Israel  and the Arab countries. How does Algeria view these current  initiatives as well as the peace process in general?    [Kafi] Algeria has a clear-cut policy regarding this issue.  This issue has two dimensions. The first concerns the land  occupied by Israel during the 1967 war which is claimed by its  owners. Egypt regained its land. Syria is now negotiating to  regain its land. Our position on this is that we always side  with our brothers. We took part in the 1967 and 1973 wars  alongside our brothers in Egypt. The second dimension concerns  the Palestinians. Algeria has made its opinion clear to the PLO  and to Palestinian President Brother Yasir 'Arafat when he  talked to us before going to Washington to sign the agreement.  He came here (?25) days before the agreement and told us. We  do not want to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians. We  support the Palestinians in whatever they chooses for  themselves. However, we gave them our opinion, which is the  essence of our experience from the liberation war. Thus,  Algeria is involved in current Arab issues, whether through the  Arab League or bilateral contacts, and is also concerned with  regard to the Palestinians. However, it cannot help but back  the opinion of the Palestinian officials as far as these issues  are concerned.    [Zaytuni] The last question, Mr. President, concerns you as  president of the Republic. You assumed power under difficult  security circumstances following the assassination of late  President Mohamed Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul.  Would you tell us about the most important decision you have  made or position you have adopted during your term in office in  the past two years?    [Kafi] In fact, There are a number of actions and,  occasionally, decisions that I made. I believe that settling  the border issue between Algeria and Tunisia once and for all is  one of the most important achievements. This is an example for  any country that has border disputes. In addition, as you know,  the Algerian economy was in a shambles. We made decisions to  address it. We decided to adopt a market economy. We replaced  a guided economy with a free economy. However, this system is  being implemented step by step because we had grown accustomed  to a certain course of action and now we have moved to another.  We expected reactions or shakeups and were prepared to address  them, particularly social upheavals that concern us very much.  Dialogue was not part of our behavior and so we decided to  pursue a policy of continuing dialogue in Algerian society.  This is a civilized landmark which, if we continue and meet  with success, God willing, it will be a pioneering experiment.    [Zaytuni] Thank you very much, Mr. President. We wish you  and Algeria success.</p>

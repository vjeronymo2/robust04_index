			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Man in the News: Jumping flash Jacques - Jacques Attali / The complicated boss of the EBRD Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, enjoys a reputation spanning several continents for grandeur in intellect and lifestyle. But, even as the storm clouds gather above him, he can also demonstrate phlegmatic humour. At a news conference at the bank's London headquarters on Thursday, the man in the middle of the controversy about EBRD overspending perched on the edge of a vast podium. It was as if a well-attired Sorbonne professor was doing his best to approach a bevy of slightly unsavoury students. Mr Attali, who describes himself first as a writer, and only second as the president of an international bank, acknowledged it was not the first time - and it would not be the last - that he faced criticism. The expectant crowd of journalists were tossed some finely-packaged understatements. 'It's nice to see you all here today. But I would have preferred to find other ways of doing our advertising.' Two years ago, after serving for 10 years as special adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Attali was catapulted into the top job at the French-inspired bank, set up to channel western resources to the former Soviet bloc. To weather the international rumpus which has surfaced over allegations of EBRD mismanagement, Mr Attali will need reserves of both humour and stoicism. He will also have to draw on resources which, in a mercurial career on the international governmental circuit, he has so far displayed in abundance: a well-honed capacity for rapid thinking, and friends in high places. The panache demonstrated at Thursday's press conference shows the quick-footedness is still intact. But, as irritation grows with Mr Attali's conduct among important EBRD shareholder governments, the friends are becoming a great deal thinner on the ground. Described by his friends as a polymath visionary, by his adversaries as a jealous gadfly who plagiarises other people's ideas, Mr Attali attracts a welter of emotions. 'Jacques is a genius,' one European ambassador said yesterday. He then described his government's annoyance about the bank's high spending at a time of recession in east and west. 'All that marble and glitter is the wrong signal,' he said. Indicating the problems sometimes touched off by Mr Attali's high-handedness, the diplomat added that he and others had been irritated by being kept waiting by Mr Attali at the ceremony inaugurating the bank's expensive new headquarters last month. One important EBRD director, who in the past has strongly defended Mr Attali, pointedly said yesterday that Mr Attali lacked the 'experience of running international and national bureacracies' to do his job properly. Mr Attali, of febrile energy and bubbling mind, is a complex personality caught in a maze of contradictions. 'He is a man of intelligence, culture and general aptitude,' Mr Pierre Mauroy, President Mitterrand's first Socialist prime minister, said yesterday. 'But he's more of a theoretician than a practical man.' 'He's a man who provides ideas, but the problem is putting them into effect,' said Mr Horst Teltschik, the former foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who developed a good working relationship with Mr Attali during the 1980s - including during the helter-skelter negotiations on German reunification. Mr Teltschik, now a board member at BMW, the Munich-based car company, recalls Mr Attali's proposals for the Group of Seven industrial countries to aid Bangladesh with a massive irrigation project. The proposals foundered on the complexities of rechannelling the country's rivers on the borders. Mr Attali's capabilities as a writer of books and film scripts are legendary, while his speeches simmer with proposals for curbing the dangers facing the world. In view of the threat that eastern instability could spill westwards, he says a post-cold war 'cultural change' in Europe is in the west's best interests: 'We need a consensus for action - to make people dream and be frightened of what could happen in the 21st century.' The contradictions surrounding Mr Attali focus on the nature of the bank's lending role in a difficult economic environment, as well as on the diverse expectations vested in it by its 56 shareholder governments. But, most of all, they concern the character of Mr Attali himself. For long regarded as a power-broker who has used his closeness to Mr Mitterrand to further his own career, Mr Attali is starting to resemble a Machiavelli entangled in his own network of intrigue. One of the more fascinating complexities concerns his own country. One banker in Paris yesterday said Mr Attali - born 49 years ago in Algeria into a French Jewish commercial family - remains an outsider on the French banking scene. 'People believe he has come on too fast, that he's not a real banker.' The French capital is abuzz with 'conspiracy theories', the banker added, that the allegations of the EBRD's budgetary misdemeanours have been leaked by the British authorities. In view of the recent accession of a right-wing government in Paris, which has left Mr Mitterrand as Mr Attali's sole important protector, the revelations are hitting Mr Attali at a time of maximum vulnerability, the banker added. Another Paris banking functionary says Paris financiers are displeased that the British government won the location of the EBRD in exchange for acceptance of Mr Attali as its first president. 'The bank site is durable, but Mr Attali may not be.' Before he won the EBRD job, Mr Attali's ambition was to return to his previous university career. The varying nature of Mr Attali's talents was reflected in his biography written in 1985 of Sir Siegmund Warburg, the founder of the London bank which bears his name. Mr Attali's description of the financier as 'a man of influence . . . vigilant of the dangers in the world, a councillor of princes' throws considerable light on his own personality. The book has been criticised by some reviewers. But Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, yesterday described the book as 'a generous impression of Sir Siegmund'. Sir David added: 'The book showed a lot about Attali's fascination with the role of Jewish banking families over the centuries in the state finances and state affairs of Europe.' In at least one case, however, Mr Attali's writing zeal has lengthened his list of enemies. He upset President George Bush with a book a few years ago predicting the US would decline under a mountain of debt, drugs and decay. Within the bank itself, Mr Attali has a large number of supporters. Mr Ron Freeman, first vice-president in charge of merchant banking, who functions as joint number two to Mr Attali in the bank's hierarchy, says, 'If I didn't approve of him, I wouldn't be working here. It's hard to imagine that anyone else taking over from day one could have got us so far, so quickly.' Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher also had 'a sneaking admiration' for Mr Attali, according to Sir Charles Powell, now a director of London-based financial services company Matheson. 'Mrs Thatcher is not dissimilar - she can also sometimes trample over people's feelings,' he said. Sir Charles, who as the former British prime minister's private secretary from 1974 to 1981 forged ties with both Mr Attali and Mr Teltschik, says of Mr Attali: 'I like him very much. He's very exhilarating, stimulating, infuriating, volatile and difficult to pin down.' Sir Charles highlights the cultural differences which, allied to Mr Attali's impetuousness and lack of experience of running organisations, have provided a principal cause of the EBRD furore. Reflecting on Mr Attali's well-publicised liking for executive jet travel, Sir Charles says: 'He's a free spirit - he loves that sort of thing.' In bilateral Anglo-French negotiations, 'I would trundle over to Paris in British Airways tourist class, while Jacques would arrive in a presidential jet in Northolt aerodrome.' The same clash of national styles, says Sir Charles, has led to the acrimony over the lavish fitting out of the EBRD building. 'Attali is a man for the glory of France . . . He's entrenched in the tradition of the Versailles summit, extravagant public works on the back of national prosperity. And now he's come to a place with a different tradition.' Mr Attali's elevation to the helm of the EBRD two years ago seemed to catch the international mood. By appearing to ignore the shift to a less forgiving economic climate, Mr Attali may find, however, that the spirit of the times is moving against him. Practicalities, rather than vision, seem likely in future to provide the EBRD's guiding force. Additional reporting by Peter Norman</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Rule 232 governs after-hours trading (crossing session) of GTX orders. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  At this time, the Phlx is proposing to add to that rule a PPS on the equity trading floor from 4:00 to 4:15 p.m. each trading day. Rather than assigning PPS a new rule number, the applicable PPS provision is being added to Rule 232 in order to group into a single rule the three Exchange provisions relating to trading on the Phlx during periods when the primary market is not open for free trading. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the Exchange is amending Rule 232 to encompass two situations in addition to GTX orders: (1) The PPS; and (2) opening for trading on the Phlx before the primary market is open for trading. The GTX provisions would be renumbered as paragraph (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``GTX'' order is an order that is good until cancelled and that is eligible for primary market protection based on volume that prints on the New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange after-hours trading session.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Phlx Rule 232. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to equities, ``free'' trading is that which occurs after the initial opening of a security, but not during a trading halt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the Phlx proposes to implement a PPS for extended trading on the equity floor of the Exchange. During the PPS, pursuant to proposed Rule 232(b), orders designated PPS would be eligible for execution during the 4:00&hyph;4:15 p.m. trading session. PACE would not provide automatic executions during the PPS, but could be available as a routing system only if permitted by the Floor Procedure Committee. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Unlike the GTX session, the PPS is an extension of the auction market, whereby bids and offers are dynamically updated for trading under normal auction market principles. As such, Exchange rules applicable to floor trading during the Exchange's regular session, as established by Rule 101, would continue to apply. Orders must be designated PPS in order to be eligible for the PPS. Market, limit and contingent order types currently acceptable under Exchange rules would be accepted for PPS if so designated. For example, pursuant to Rule 207, a ``GTC PPS'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  order would be eligible for PPS execution, and, if not executed, would be eligible for execution during ensuing days because of the GTC designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``PACE'' is the acronym for the Phlx Automated Communication and Execution System. It provides a system for the automatic execution of orders on the Exchange equity floor under predetermined conditions. Orders accepted under the system may be executed on a fully automated or manual basis in accordance with the provisions of Rule 229.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Phlx Rule 229. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Such an order differs from a GTX order in that the later is eligible for execution after the close of the Exchange.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the situation where the Phlx is open for trading before the primary market is open, or during a non-regulatory halt in trading on the primary market, is proposed to be codified into Rule 232(a). Currently, these provisions appear in Equity Floor Procedure Advice EF&hyph;1, Designating Orders for Execution in Instances Where the Primary Market Is Not Open in an Issue for Which the Phlx is Open for Free Trading. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The Phlx now proposes to codify this Advice into Phlx rules. In addition, the use of the yellow ticket, to designate orders eligible for execution when the Phlx is open for trading in an issue not open on the primary market, would be replaced with the use of the designator ``EXP,'' meaning ex-primary, to parallel the designators ``PPS'' and ``GTX'' in Rule 232. The Exchange is also proposing a corresponding amendment to the Advice to incorporate the ``EXP'' designator, reword the three-year cycle for imposing fines, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  and explain that the primary market may not be open for free trading due to a delay or a halt in trading. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Advice EF&hyph;1, as well as the accompanying fine, which is proposed to be amended to incorporate these changes, is administered pursuant to the exchange's minor rule violation enforcement and reporting plan.

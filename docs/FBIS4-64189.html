			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attack Covered Up?"] </F>   [Text] At the end of 1993, Republikaner boss Franz  Schoenhuber is supposed to have found out that a leading member  of the party was involved in an attack on a home for  asylum-seekers in Bergheim near Cologne without having reported  it to the police. The incident was, according to a protocol,  raised at a meeting of the Republikaner executive committee for  Mittlelrhein. Some party members were concerned that the  Republikaner involvement in the attack might be covered up, so  they sent a protocol of the meeting with a personal explanation  to Schoenhuber and the chairman of the party's federal  arbitration court, Munich Judge Johann Muehlberger. During the  course of a search of the federal arbitration court last Friday  [22 April] in Munich, the documents were found, according to the  state prosecution service. Schoenhuber's office could not be  searched, because as a member of the European Parliament, the  Republikaner boss enjoys parliamentary immunity. The Cologne  prosecution service is now considering having his immunity  lifted.</p>

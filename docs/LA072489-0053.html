			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIX PHASES DESCRIBED IN BOOK  </P> <P> Clifford Grobstein's book "Science &amp; the Unborn" suggests that life in the  womb can be separated into six fairly distinct phases:  </P> <P> * Genetic. The two-week "pre-embryo" phase, which begins at conception. The  unborn develops its "hereditary uniqueness," according to Grobstein. "It is  essential to keep in mind how much is yet missing at this early stage."  </P> <P> * Developmental. After about two weeks, the rapidly growing pre-embryo attaches  to the uterine wall. From this point on, "it becomes committed to the  production of a single individual."  </P> <P> * Functional. After about two months, the embryo -- now identified as a fetus  -- has developed certain abilities essential to survival. As the fetus  develops, "it sets the stage for increasing functional individuality, including  behavior."  </P> <P> * Behavioral. This stage is difficult to describe because the unborn at  different times exhibit various types of behavior, according to Grobstein.  However, after about six or seven weeks, the development of  </P> <P> nerve and muscle tissue allows basic reflex responses. "Muscles and nervous  system . . . (are) sufficiently mature . . . (as are) the interactions between  them," Grobstein says.  </P> <P> * Psychic. While this stage is open to debate, scientists believe that a "sense  of self" probably doesn't exist until about the 30th week, according to  Grobstein. He defines psychic as an "inner subjective experience, such as each  adult is directly aware of."  </P> <P> * Social. "Social individuality" is not a biological phase, according to  Grobstein. It is instead "conferred through recognition by others. . . . No  matter how strong the experience of inner self may be, it has no social content  unless it is recognized by another."

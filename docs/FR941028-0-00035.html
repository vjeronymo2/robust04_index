			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If conditional permits were allowed during the pendency of a prolonged appellate process challenging an ownership or control link, the agency's ability to enforce the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and the ownership and control rules would be severely compromised. Rather than abate the violations of their owned or controlled operations, it is possible that some applicants would routinely appeal ownership or control links without regard to the strength of the link as demonstrated by a full proceeding on the merits. Such applicants would appeal merely for the purpose of gaining conditional permits. Depending upon how long the appeals process ran, an operator with a conditional permit could extract a significant portion of the coal in a permitted mine and would have no incentive to abate the violations of the surface coal mining operation to which he had been linked. The Act does not contemplate such a result; nor does the Constitution require it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, such a result would provide an unfair competitive advantage to an unscrupulous operator to the detriment of the interests of the other members of the coal industry, the majority of whom take responsibility for environmental reclamation and are responsible corporate citizens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, industry commenters have asserted that there is little likelihood of operators making frivolous or bad faith ownership or control appeals because they have significant investments in their surface coal mining operations. While OSM recognizes that this is probably true for the majority of operators, including those who have provided comments on the proposed rules, experience has shown that a small minority of irresponsible operators can create harm disproportionate to their numbers. In the process, such irresponsible operators do harm not just to OSM's effective implementation of the Act, but also to the reputation of the industry as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For instance, a marginal operator's significant investment in coal extraction equipment may mask his/her plan to avoid spending resources on reclamation. Indeed, there could be a serious economic temptation for such an operator to protect a significant investment by appealing, if such appeal would support the continuation of operations. Accordingly, OSM considers the extent of an applicant's investment in a surface coal mining operation to be an unreliable indicator of an applicant's motive in initiating an appeal. Thus, OSM declines to develop a process requiring the evaluation of operators' good faith based upon their comparative investments in surface coal mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM does recognize, however, that a permittee has an interest in his permit deserving of a higher level of protection than that of an applicant with respect to an application. A valid permit represents more than the mere expectancy represented by an application. A current, valid permit represents legal authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations in accordance with the terms of such permit. See section 506 of the Act. Further, a permit carries with it the right of successive renewal. See section 506(d)(1) of the Act; 30 CFR 774.15. Thus, a detailed process governing improvidently issued permits has been established which recognizes this interest. See 30 CFR 773.20; 773.21. In response to concerns asserted by industry with respect to due process, OSM has amended the regulations governing improvident permit issuance to provide that a permittee can challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited as part of the improvidently issued permit process. See 773.20(b)(2). OSM has done this in recognition of the more substantial interest that a permit represents in contrast to the limited interest represented by a permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters have further asserted that an owner or controller must be afforded the opportunity to challenge the validity of the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited as a condition precedent to the recommendation of a denial of a permit application for an owner or controller of the violation. These commenters argued that owners or controllers may not have had the opportunity to challenge the validity of the violation which forms the basis of the permit denial at the time it was cited. They argued that only the actual violators were cited at that time and that the owners or controllers would not have received notice in a timely manner to enable them to challenge the violation then. They further asserted that a right to contest the merits of a violation after permit denial is not sufficient to redress the harm caused by permit denial. Rather than face permit denial, they asserted that coal operators will be forced to pay the disputed fees or to reclaim land. Accordingly, they asserted that they should be allowed to challenge the violation prior to any permit denial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with those views. The rights of an owner or controller are well protected by the ability to challenge the link to the violation. If the ownership or control link is not well taken, then the violation is irrelevant as a basis for permit block. If the link is meritorious, the owner or controller would have been well-positioned to have had knowledge in fact of the citations, if he or she desired such knowledge, see, e.g., 30 CFR 843.15(d), and to have compelled the controlled surface coal mining operation to abate the violation or to challenge the violation in a timely manner. See, e.g., 30 CFR 843.16(a). Accordingly, if an ownership or control link is well taken, the owner or controller has already had an opportunity to challenge the violation or to abate the violation through the controlled entity. Under these circumstances, OSM does not believe that an owner or controller is entitled to an additional opportunity to challenge the existence of a violation before the regulatory authority can deny issuance of a permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even so, the final rules promulgated today would not prohibit the challenge of the existence of the violation. Such a challenge, however, must be made at the time of permit denial, rather than before, by persons who are not bound by prior administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the existence of the violation or who have not had a prior opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation. This is entirely consistent with OSM's position as expressed in the preamble to the ownership and control rules published in 1988. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October 3, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shrugs off IBM but down in late selling Wall Street ALTHOUGH US stock markets shrugged off news of a big fourth quarter loss at IBM, a burst of late selling left share prices lower across the board, despite a rally in bond prices and strong bank earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18.92 at 3,255.99, near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.70 at 435.14, while the Amex composite ended 0.05 firmer at 403.84, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.32 at 696.81. Trading volume on the New York SE was 285m shares. In the absence of fresh economic statistics, the attention of investors was focussed on corporate earnings and the crisis in the Middle East. News of US air attacks on Iraqi defence installationsagain cast a cloud over the market, which remains fearful that the conflict in the Gulf could escalate, pushing up oil prices, depressing consumer confidence and dampening optimism about the arrival in office of President Clinton. On the corporate front, IBM stole the headlines, reporting a loss in the fourth quarter of Dollars 5.5bn, or Dollars 9.57 a share. Although the figures were within market expectations, a growing number of analysts at the start of the week had been hoping that IBM would pleasantly surprise the market with a smaller-than-expected loss. The market's initial reaction to the figures was to sell IBM heavily, pushing the stock down more than Dollars 2 to a low of Dollars 47 1/4 , before a few buyers moved in to bring the price back to Dollars 48 3/8 , showing a net decline of Dollars 1 1/8 . Just over 4m shares changed hands during the session. Bank stocks were also in the limelight, rising on a succession of earnings reports which confirmed that the sector's recovery from recent problems is continuing apace. Wells Fargo led the way, jumping Dollars 13 to Dollars 99 on the news that the West Coast banking group had rebounded from a loss a year ago to post an 83 cents-a-share profit in the latest quarter. Also firmer were Citicorp, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 24 1/2 and aided by a ratings upgrade from Standard &amp; Poors, Chemical, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 41 5/8 , Banc One, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 52 1/2 , and BankAmerica, Dollars 3 7/8 higher at Dollars 53 3/8 . Motor stocks rose on ratings upgrade from broking house Bear Stearns. Chrysler put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 38 1/2 , Ford added Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 47 3/8 and General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 . PaineWebber fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 after the Wall Street securities house disappointed those investors who had expected the company to surprise the market with even stronger earnings than the Dollars 41.4m reported in the fourth quarter. Eastman Kodak rallied from recent weakness, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 1/2 in volume of 5.1m shares after the company said it would cut 2,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting effort. Canada TORONTO stock prices slipped for the second straight session in heavy trading. The 300-stock composite index retreated 7.51 points, or 0.23 per cent , to end the session at 3,288.08, with declining issues leading advances 339 to 277. Volume climbed to 55.46m shares valued at CDollars 544m compared with Monday's 36.04m shares valued at CDollars 305m. Bank stocks and mining stocks showed the largest declines among the subgroups, both losing 0.6 per cent. Alcan reported increased fourth-quarter losses, largely due to higher non-recurring charges. The stock was off  3/8 to 22 3/8 .</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: ClubMed posts 4.8% increase in turnover CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday village group, reported a 4.8 per cent rise in turnover to FFr8.22bn (Dollars 1.48bn) in the year to last October, despite the gloom in the travel industry. The group released its turnover figures yesterday, a month after publishing a return to profits of FFr160m in the year under review, from a FFr17m loss in 1991. However, Club Mediterranee's recovery appears far from complete, given that the group recorded a 4.6 per cent decline in sales to FFr2.33bn in the final three months to October.</p>

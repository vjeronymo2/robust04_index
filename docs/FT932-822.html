			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring at Rothmans ROTHMANS International and its subsidiary Dunhill Holdings resumed trading yesterday after their parent, the Swiss-based Richemont, announced details of its planned group restructuring. Richemont proposed that its tobacco and luxury goods businesses be reorganised into a pure tobacco company, Rothmans International, and a new company, Vendome, to hold all its luxury brands. That would be achieved through the merging into Vendome of Rothman's luxury goods interests, held through Dunhill Holdings, and the ending of Dunhill's separate stock market listing. Under a complex restructuring, which needs approval from shareholders and the Inland Revenue, the new companies will have dual holding company structures and shareholders will own units of twinned shares in a UK and non-UK company. This structure will shield overseas shareholders like Richemont from UK advance corporation tax. According to the terms of the deal, shareholders with 1,000 Rothmans B shares would receive 1,000 new Rothmans units, 500 Vendome units and Pounds 757 cash. Holders of 1,000 Dunhill shares would receive 133 new Rothmans units, 749 Vendome units and Pounds 443 cash. The company intends to list the Rothmans units in London and the Netherlands while the Vendome units would be listed in London and Luxembourg. The cash element totalled Pounds 525m, of which Richemont will receive Pounds 300m. Following the restructuring, it will own 61 per cent of Rothmans and 70 per cent of Vendome. The terms of the restructuring assumed a value for Cartier, Richemont's most valuable division, of Pounds 2.1bn, valued on the basis of 18 times earnings. Rothmans and Dunhill were given fully diluted market values of Pounds 4.62bn and Pounds 661m respectively. Shares in both companies fell because of profit taking and a suggestion that some Dunhill shareholders might oppose the plan. Rothmans shares fell 28p to 692p while Dunhill dropped 23p to 383p. Separately, Rothmans announced an 8.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 614m for the year to March 31. Earnings increased 10.7 per cent to 47.4p and a final dividend of 7.5p was recommended to make a total of 11.5p, a 12.2 per cent increase. Richemont announced a 5.1 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 651.9m during the same period. Earnings per unit increased 5 per cent to Pounds 35.98 while a dividend of 588.75p is proposed.</p>

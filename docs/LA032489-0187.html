Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> EPA ORDERS REVIEW OF DAM PLAN  </P> <P> The head of the Environmental Protection Agency ordered a review today of a  controversial, $500-million dam project in Colorado, saying he is concerned  that the dam "could result in very serious adverse environmental impact."  </P> <P> The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of Denver has  been approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the EPA can veto it if it  determines that the dam would be environmentally harmful.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Charged up over contamination A new technology to eliminate soil pollution by applying low-voltage electric currents promises to shave millions of dollars off the cost of large-scale contamination clean-ups. The new technique, being developed by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has attracted the attention of groups in the chemical, mining and utility sectors, which are now facing large bills from soil decontamination. 'It's essential for us to examine new technologies which would do the same job at a lower cost,' says Vincent Mirabella, a consulting engineer at Southern California Edison, which is helping to finance the project. The new technology, which should be ready for on-site trials by the end of the year, uses low-voltage electrodes inserted in the soil to pull out pollutants by magnetic force. Two different methods can be used. The first, known as electro-osmosis, takes advantage of the water contained in the soil to flush out the contaminants. All soil contains some water, and many ground pollutants are dissolved in that water. Water gives the soil a charge, commonly known as the soil pH. If an electrode with a negative charge is inserted into the ground, the water, bearing a positive charge, will gravitate towards it, bringing many of the soil's pollutants along. The rest of the soil, which typically carries a negative charge, would remain behind. The electrode could consist of a charged wire running through a permeable pipe which is inserted into the ground. The second method, known as electro-migration, complements electro-osmosis. The method is especially suitable for arid soil containing little water, and soil holding large amounts of toxic metals. This technique pulls out the pollutants at a slower pace, ion by ion. When the pollutants reach the electrode, once again water is used to flush the contaminants out. 'With use of both methods, we can remove about 95 per cent of contaminants from the soil,' says Ronald Probstein, who heads the project at MIT. The electric charge process offers some important advantages. First, the technology would carry a relatively low cost, about Dollars 20 to Dollars 30 per tonne, compared with an average Dollars 150 per tonne for current methods such as excavation and pumping. 'If we used current methods to clean up all the contaminant soil in America, we'd bankrupt the country,' says Richard Magee, executive director of environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 'Either we find a cheaper technology, or we resign ourselves to living with contaminated soil.' The MIT technology also promises to be kinder to the environment than current clean-up methods. Under the excavation and incineration technique, for instance, soil is dug out of the ground and placed in an incinerator to burn off the pollutants. Critics complain that this method turns a ground pollution problem into an air pollution problem. And by using traditional pumping and draining techniques, soil ruptures are likely to occur. Neither electro-osmosis nor electro-migration will be miracle cures for soil pollution. Both, for instance, are painstakingly slow. Depending on how many electrodes are used, a large field of polluted soil could take from a few months to a year to clean up. However, the process's supporters believe a year is not too long to wait considering the scale of the problem. With the new technique's promising cost and efficiency advantages, its successful development could go a long way towards solving the daunting problem of ground-pollution clean-up.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) has described as good the  chances of the Bonn coalition parties reaching agreement on a  common overall policy for the Bundeswehr. After the first  meeting of the coalition working group examining broad outlines  for the future of the Bundeswehr, Ruehe said in Bonn on Thursday  [19 May] that they agreed to meet again in June. He did not  give any details.    The working group was set up by top coalition members after  the differences of opinion between the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party [FDP]  came to light regarding future overall policy for the  Bundeswehr. Given the current financial situation, Ruehe is  aiming for a reduction of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to  340,000. Basic military service is to be shortened from 12 to  10 months. Military service for the crisis reaction forces will  be 12 months. The FDP has voiced its criticism over this.  [passage omitted]</p>

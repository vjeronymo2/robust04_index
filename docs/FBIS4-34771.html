			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Recent rains in Guanatanamo Province were not  entirely detrimental because Guantanamo's reservoirs were filled  almost to capacity and will be able to guarantee water necessary  for irrigation beyond this year. Dams, minidams, and other  hydraulic works in the territory have accumulated 328 million  cubic meters. Their users were assigned 150 million cubic meters  for this year, and have used 30 percent. An official said  precipitation in May left lots of moisture in the soil, so it  does not matter if there is no rain in the near future.    [Begin unidentified official recording] We can state that  the  first semester of 1995 has its water guaranteed in the dams.  [end recording]    This is a relief for a province where heavy rainfall is  followed by long dry periods. For example, following the deluge  in May, there is hardly any precipitation in June; registered  rainfall does not even reach the 3-mm mark. Nevertheless, a  gradual increase in rain is expected by mid-September.    [Begin unidentified official recording] That would  practically fill the reservoirs to capacity by year end. [end  recording]    It is true that the capricious weather had harsh results in  Guantanamo Province, but every cloud has its silver lining. No  one will be able to justify his failure to fulfill goals due to  the lack of water. There is enough water in the reservoirs. It  is only a matter of using it efficiently.</p>

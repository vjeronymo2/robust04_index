We are changing the heading of paragraph (a) to read, ``When penalty begins to accrue.'' This phrase is more appropriate in the context of a civil money penalty since this penalty cannot be collected until the provider has an opportunity for a hearing if one is requested; however, it can begin to accrue before the hearing. Also, this revision includes the accrual of the civil money penalty for past days of noncompliance since the last standard survey which are corrected by the time of the current survey as provided in the Act at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h). Revised paragraph (a) now provides that the civil money penalty may start accruing as early as the date that the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State. To stay the accrual of the penalty if a hearing is requested, to start the accrual when a hearing decision is made, or to begin the accrual on the date of the notice, as the commenters suggest, would allow noncompliance to continue without a remedy being imposed and would not be implementing the remedy as the Congress intended. This intent is clearly stated in the Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* the Committee amendment would expressly allow a State to impose civil money penalties for each day in which a facility was found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements of participation, even if the facility subsequently corrected its deficiencies and brought itself into full compliance. This, in the Committee's view, is essential to creating a financial incentive for facilities to maintain compliance with the requirements for participation. The Committee amendment would set no upper limit on the amount of these penalties and would allow States to increase the amounts in cases of repeated noncompliance. States could impose civil money penalties prior to a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* the Committee amendment would create an incentive for facilities to maintain compliance with all of the requirements of participation by authorizing the Secretary to impose and collect civil money penalties for each day a facility is out of compliance even though the facility may subsequently bring itself back into full compliance. (H.R. Report No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 473&hyph;6 (1987)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moving the date when the penalty can accrue to be as early as the date of the noncompliance permits noncompliance to be sanctioned promptly and addresses the concerns of the commenters who said that the effective date in the proposed rule implied a ``grace period'' for providers to correct deficiencies before a civil money penalty was imposed and undermined the States' abilities to use this remedy. We expect that in virtually all cases, the civil money penalty would start accruing from the date of the noncompliance. The only exception could be those cases in which the survey identifies the noncompliance but there is undue delay before HCFA or the State notifies the provider of the imposition of the penalty. However, the provider would receive a second notice before the collection of the civil money penalty, as explained in &sect;488.440.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter recommended deleting proposed &sect;488.230(i)(6) (redesignated as &sect;488.440(g)), which provides that, in the case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, HCFA will or the State must terminate the provider agreement on the 23rd day after the appointment of temporary management if the threat remains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not accept the suggestion to delete this provision because we believe it is important to specify the situations that affect the accrual of civil money penalties. However, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.440(g) to specify that termination occurs within 23 days after the last day of the survey if immediate jeopardy remains, and the daily accrual of civil money penalties stops on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the regulation incorporate a provision assuring prompt revisits by HCFA or the States to evaluate compliance based upon a facility's allegation of compliance, because several commenters stated that survey teams often are not prompt in the follow-up process. Others asked if civil money penalties accrue when a revisit is not timely. Several commenters asked that we clarify if there must be on-site revisits by the State to verify reports by facilities. One commenter requested revisits be within a specified timeframe and another specified a 10 day timeframe in which revisits must be conducted. One commenter recommended that civil money penalties be suspended immediately (until the survey team can revisit) when authorities receive notification through certified mail that deficiencies have been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

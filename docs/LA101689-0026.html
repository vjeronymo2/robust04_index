			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Comedian Roseanne Barr may have bared it all at the opening game of the World  Series in Oakland, but her publicist doesn't know anything about it. With her  team, the Giants, trailing 5-0 under a moonlit sky, Barr and her fiance Tom  Arnold reportedly pulled down their pants to express their feelings -- Barr  revealing a tattoo declaring "Tom" and Arnold baring a tattoo saying "Rosie."  "I have no idea whether she did or not," Barr's personal manager Arlene  Rothberg said when asked about the reported crowd "mooning" incident. Other  more subdued notable fans at the game included Huey Lewis, Tom Brokaw, Peter  Ueberroth, John Travolta, Michael Keaton, Reggie Jackson and John Fogarty.  Shauna Snow  </P></p>

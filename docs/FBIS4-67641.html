			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Erlichman, consumer affairs correspondent: </F> "Ministry `Halting Cattle AIDS Tests'"]    [Text] Cheshire dairy farmers whose cattle herd appears to  have the bovine form of AIDS yesterday accused the Ministry of  Agriculture of blocking wider tests begun by government  scientists.    A new but limited study has confirmed that four out of 10  animals tested positively to the bovine immunodeficiency virus,  BIV.    A ministry scientist, Dr Joe Brownlie, took blood samples  from all 115 surviving animals in the herd of Linda and Tim  Blything, who farm at Kelsall. But Mrs Blything said: "The  ministry is so far refusing to put up the money to have all the  samples tested for the virus."    The Milk Marketing Board has stopped taking milk from the  herd although some of the cows are still going for slaughter,  mainly to be used in mince, sausages and pies.    The Blythings say some of their herd has had to be destroyed  and that most of the survivors are visibly sick, with mucous  clogging their nostrils and ulcers in their noses and mouths.    A ministry spokesman said: "We are considering a request  from  Dr Brownlie at our Institute for Animal Health for more money to  test all the animals for BIV. A decision will be taken in due  course. But we continue to believe that BIV is a mild and  transient condition in cattle from which they normally respond  spontaneously."    According to Dr Brownlie's report last week to the  Blythings'  vet samples from 10 animals were analysed and four tested  positively on all three tests for the virus. Three more tested  positively to two of the tests, leaving their health in doubt.    "This is a very much higher level than would be expected in  a  healthy herd where no more than 4 per cent would normally be  positive on all three tests," Dr Brownlie said. "We really ought  to find out more."</p>

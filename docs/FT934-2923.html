			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Trebruk takes 51% stake in paper group Trebruk, the Swedish paper group, has completed a Dollars 56m limited recourse financing operation for Kostryzynskie Zaklady Papiernicze (KZP) which leaves it with a 51 per cent stake in the former loss-making, state-owned Polish paper company. Trebruk acquired control of KZP for a nominal sum in October. The new financing will provide working capital, pay off creditors, fund a Dollars 40m capital investment programme to raise production of fine papers to 250,000 tons annually and pay for a Dollars 5m environmental clean-up. Funds have been provided by a group of Swedish investors and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Of the Dollars 56m total, Dollars 25m will be provided by Trebruk and a group of Swedish investors. These include the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation and Swedfund International AB, which will each take 16 per cent of the increased equity, and Rottneros Bruk AB, a Swedish producer of chlorine-free pulp and a group of trade investors. The EBRD is committing Dollars 32m but is still finalising syndication among a group of Polish and West European banks. Samuel Montagu acted as adviser to Trebruk in a deal which will guarantee 1,000 jobs in Kostryn whose proximity to the German border and low production and distribution costs was one of the determining factors in the Swedish company's decision to take over the Polish company.</p>

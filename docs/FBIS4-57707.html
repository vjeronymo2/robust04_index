			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma has invited the  Army to cooperate in building a national defense state policy.    He extended this invitation during a ceremony at which  President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle decorated four high-ranking  Army officers.    The chief of state awarded the President of the Republic  medal to Brigadier Generals Rofolfo Sanchez, Juan Cheyre, Hernan  Reyes, and Manuel Vitis.    The defense minister then addressed the event. He stated  that  nobody in the past few years has the moral superiority to judge  the various governments of the past three decades. He said that  the time has come to positively fill the gap that separates  politicians from military men by building a state national  defense policy.    [Begin Perez recording] The times of impositions are long  gone. We do not believe in a formal subordination based on the  authority of whoever signs a decree. We believe the  subordination of military men to the political authority is the  way a democratic society keeps a legitimate space to implement a  military policy with full respect for the Constitution. [end  recording]    President Frei earlier opened a seminar which dealt with  emerging enterprises and the society of the future. He said the  strategy of his government's productive modernization plan is to  improve national enterprises, enhancing their international  competitiveness.    Today President Frei met with Army Commander General Augusto  Pinochet Ugarte who informed him of a trip abroad he will make  soon.</p>

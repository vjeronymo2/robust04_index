			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Savimbi to accept poll results UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, whose refusal to accept the outcome of last September's elections has threatened Angola with renewed civil war, has agreed to accept the first-round results, a UN official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Luanda. In the first hopeful sign in weeks of a peaceful settlement, Mr Savimbi sent a letter to UN special representative Margaret Anstee saying he still thought the results were rigged but would accept them. The official said Mr Savimbi was also open to accepting an enhanced UN role in Angola, where it has been monitoring May 1991 peace accords.</p>

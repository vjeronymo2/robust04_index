			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM's mainframes enter the microprocessor age - Big Blue is developing two new lines which will be more price competitive International Business Machines plans to bring its traditional mainframe computers into the microprocessor age, significantly reducing their cost and making them more price competitive with 'client-server' networks of desktop computers. The latest generation of 'micro-mainframes' represents a central element of IBM's strategy to stem the erosion of its traditional mainframe computer market, which is seen by many as the primary cause of the company's financial woes. For 1992 IBM reported net losses of Dollars 4.9bn. As it struggles to regain the confidence of customers and investors, IBM this week revealed it is developing two new lines of mainframe-power computers built using multiple microprocessor chips similar to those that power desktop computers. IBM's 'classic' mainframe computers will also be re-engineered to use microprocessor chips. 'Our aim is to take a lot of the cost out of the systems, by replacing expensive processing units used in today's mainframe computers with integrated circuit chips,' said Mr Nicholas Donofrio, general manager of IBM's Enterprise Systems division. One of the new lines will be based on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor chips that are currently used in IBM's RS/6000 workstations. By using several of these chips working in parallel, IBM plans to create mainframe-class computers. The first of these 'power parallel' computers will be delivered within the next few months, Mr Donofrio said. It will be aimed at technical and scientific applications. However, in about 12 months, IBM will offer similar computers designed for commercial applications, he said. By gradually increasing the number of microprocessors in these computers, IBM will build a broad product line of computers. Like the company's workstation products, these will run the popular Unix operating system. The second product line will be based on a microprocessor version of IBM's current S/390 mainframe processor, also using parallel processing techniques. Aimed at IBM's current mainframe customers it will be designed to run existing mainframe applications programs. In addition, IBM is planning microprocessor-based versions of its 'classic' mainframe designs. 'During the second half of the 1990s, we plan to have an entire mainframe family based on microprocessor technology,' Mr Donofrio said. The planned systems will significantly reduce the cost of mainframe computing, he said. In the meantime, IBM is attempting to dispel the impression that its traditional mainframe computers are a dying breed by stressing the role that mainframe computers can play in new client-server networks as 'superservers'. This is hardly a new message. IBM has been trying to redefine the role of the mainframe more favourably for over two years. However, the company is now planning 'an intense campaign, bringing in real users and software developers' to talk about client-server applications of mainframe computers, Mr Donofrio said. Also getting new emphasis are the 'open systems' features of IBM mainframes. IBM will bring its proprietary software into line with existing and emerging standards, the company promises, to make it possible to link IBM mainframes to networks of computers from other manufacturers. The most concrete demonstration of IBM's determination to keep its mainframe sales alive is that customers world-wide will now be able to set the price they are prepared to pay for the latest versions of IBM's mainframes, including the models and upgrades announced this week. IBM has thrown out the price list that has previously established the starting point for negotiation of selling prices for its mainframes. The move brings IBM's US pricing policy into line with the approach it has taken in the UK for the past three years. Competitors see the new approach as recognition of existing market conditions in which 'it is probably several years since anybody paid IBM's list price, every prospective customer knows that', according to Hitachi Data Systems, one of IBM's competitors in the mainframe market. IBM hints it is going to become more aggressive in mainframe pricing. 'We are not going to lose market share,' says Mr Donofrio. However, the move could backfire. With no list prices, customers will have to get competing bids to ensure that they are getting a fair price, Hitachi suggests.</p>

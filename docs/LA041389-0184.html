			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> CITIES FILE PROPERTY TAX SUIT  </P> <P> A suit challenging the constitutionality of how property tax revenues are  distributed among California cities was filed Friday in San Bernardino Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Temple City, along with Rancho Cucamonga, Compton, Carson and El Segundo, are  petitioners in the suit, which charges that the system unfairly penalizes  cities that levied no or low property taxes before Proposition 13 was approved.  </P> <P> The proposition passed in 1978 limited property taxes to 1% of a parcel's  assessed value. State legislation passed to implement it calls for distribution  of property taxes according to cities' tax rates before the freeze.  </P> <P> As a result cities, such as Temple City, which did not have a property tax  receive no revenues, although their residents pay the same flat tax.  </P> <P> According to John Sturgeon, attorney for the petitioners, the suit was filed in  San Bernardino County because Rancho Cucamonga is the biggest loser in the  current system among the five cities. No court date has been set. The suit was  filed in San Bernardino because the state Supreme Court declined without  comment to hear the case on March 31.  </P></p>

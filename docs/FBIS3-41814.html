			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Brindle: "NHS Waits of 12 Months Growing </F> by 30 Percent a Year"]    [Text] The number of people waiting more than 12 months for  hospital treatment is growing at an annualised rate of more than  30 percent a year, according to official figures yesterday which  show overall queues for operations continuing to lengthen.    The figures are for the end of September and the picture  looks certain to worsen over the winter months as hospitals stop  or reduce operations on the grounds that their contracts for the  financial year have been fulfilled.    The quarterly September data show 1,030,763 people waiting  for treatment in England at the end of the month. This was an  increase of 1.3 percent on the total for the end of June, an  annualised rate of 5.2 percent.    Of the total, 70,512 people had been waiting between one and  two years, an increase of 7.7 percent since June, or 30.8  percent on an annualised basis.    Another 335 had been waiting more than two years in breach  of  the Patient's Charter, 334 of them awaiting treatment by a  specialist hospital run as a special health authority and one  awaiting general admission in the South West Thames health  region. The number of people waiting less than a year rose by  0.8 percent between June and September, or 3.2 percent on an  annualised basis, to a total 959,916.    David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, described the  figures as bad news for patients and an indictment of the  National Health Service market changes lauded by Virginia  Bottomley, the Health Secretary. With cancelled operations and  cuts becoming widespread, the queues represented the tip of the  iceberg. Dr. Brian Mawhinney, the Health Minister, said that,  compared with September 1992, there were still almost 10,000  fewer patients waiting more than a year. Compared with September  1991, the drop was almost 100,000.    Guardian Newspapers Limited, November 2, 1992</p>

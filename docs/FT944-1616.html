			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (7): The pace needs to quicken  -The economy minister answers his critics, in an interview with Anthony Robinson / Restructuring and employment As an economist, Mr Karel Dyba, minister of the economy and an old friend of Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, likes tackling questions such as 'Is it possible to restructure a socialist economy without either large-scale bankruptcies or heavy unemployment?' For most of the post-communist states, plagued with double- digit unemployment and idle factories, the answer has proved negative. But the Czechs, partly through good fortune but mainly through astute political and economic footwork, appear to have pulled off the trick. Sceptics argue that Czech full employment is largely an illusion, with government-enforced low pay allowing enterprises to keep under-employed workers on the payroll rather than unemployment lines. Alternatively they claim that Czechs have low unemployment because they have hardly started the painful micro-economic surgery on former state-owned enterprises which has led to mass lay-offs in seriously reforming states such as Poland or Hungary. Bankruptcies to date have been few and far between and mainly limited to small companies. Mr Dyba has little time for such criticism. Without changes at the enterprise level, it is impossible to sustain macro-economic stability, he argues. 'Our experience shows that speed is better than searching for perfection. We have moved from zero to 80 per cent share of privately-owned enterprises in five years. But this has been accompanied by dramatic structural changes. 'Employment in the farm sector, for example, has fallen by 50 per cent. The fastest growth has been in the service sector, especially tourism and financial services.' Countering accusations of slow change in the formerly bloated state-owned industrial enterprises - artificially biased towards heavy industry and the Soviet market, he reels off the manpower reductions in the largest five state-owned enterprises. 'The biggest employer of all, the Czech railways, shed 30 per cent of its former 165,000 workers between 1990-93. Skoda Pilzen, the biggest engineering conglomerate, lost 43 per cent, the OKD coal mines shed nearly half their workforce, the Vitkovice steel plant lost a further 28 per cent and the telephone monopoly SPT shed 13 per cent,' he says. But Mr Gabriel Eichler, chief financial officer of CEZ, the electricity corporation, which has slimmed its workforce from 16,000 to 12,000 in three years, says that with wages so low the real improvements in efficiency have come elsewhere. 'At CEZ labour represents only 2.6 per cent of total costs. In our case, the real improvement has come through a 500 basis points reduction in our average borrowing costs through tighter financial management.' Few companies are as capital-intensive as CEZ. The general pattern has been for loss-makers to be slimmed down rather than closed. Few workers have been sacked. Most have just walked away from low-paid, boring jobs and found new employment in the booming construction, hotel and catering, retail and distribution, banking, tourism and other sectors. A growing number have become self-employed or work for the fast-growing private start-up companies. The Czechs are slower, more cautious and less entrepreneurial than the Poles, who have taken to capitalism like a duck to water. But the country now boasts a growing number of private companies and entrepreneurial business types. The rate of job creation in the private sector is such that labour shortages and rapid labour turnover are now a growing concern. Mr Jan Havelka, head of Czechinvest, the government's inward investment promotion agency, says that one in five Czechs changed his or her job last year. As a result the Prague region, where 60 per cent of the GDP is produced, has turned into a magnet for foreign workers, especially Ukrainians, Serbs and other escapees from the Yugoslav imbroglio. The real question for Czech economic managers is not how to preserve employment and social peace but how to speed up the liquidation of hopeless enterprises so as to free labour for more productive use in sectors now facing skill shortages.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has given careful consideration to this argument, and disagrees with Cosco's assertion that the straps cannot become ignited. With respect to the photographs Cosco submitted of tests conducted on the straps with a cigarette lighter, Cosco believes that they show that the strap webbing smolders and then extinguishes itself without igniting. NHTSA interprets the photographs as illustrating that the straps support a flame which could injure a child restrained in the child seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In issuing Standard No. 302 in 1971 (36 FR 289), the agency cited matches, cigarettes or short circuits in interior wiring as examples of sources for fires occurring in the interior of vehicles. The agency believes that there are situations where the straps could become ignited. One example is children in the back seat of a car, playing with matches, a cigarette lighter, or other ignition source near a child restrained in a Cosco seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In point of act, had the tests been conducted under real life circumstances, the results could have been worse. Webbing samples are tested horizontally, but webbing is worn vertically. If a fire begins at the bottom of webbing, it will travel upward at a faster rate than it would in a horizontal placement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA considered Cosco's argument that, if fire is ``already consuming the child restraint and/or the vehicle seat upon which the child restraint is installed,'' the child would be injured from these sources as opposed to the shoulder straps of the restraint. This argument cannot seriously be presented as ground for granting an inconsequentiality petition. If a vehicle fire is of such intensity that it is destroying a child restraint or vehicle seat that is certified as complying with Standard No. 302, then it will destroy the shoulder strap as well whether or not it complies. NHTSA is concerned with fires of less intensity, where it is critical that interior components (the child seat as well as the components specified in Standard No. 301) do not ignite, or if they do, that they burn at a slow enough rate that there will be time to remove the child from the occupant compartment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cosco also argued that there was no real-world indication of a safety threat. It said that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Cosco has never received a report of the burning of a soft-shield harness strap. Cosco is unaware of any study that indicates that the burning of a child restraint harness has caused any injury or death. All occupant protection studies which Cosco has reviewed indicate an almost infinitesimal risk of injury or death by vehicle fires in total, at least in collisions. Cosco is unaware of any data on fires of the interior of vehicles unrelated to collisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In NHTSA's view, the fact that Cosco has not received any reports is not a sufficient basis on which to grant its petition. The present lack of such reports does not necessarily diminish the future potential of such incidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has, in fact, received a report which may have some relevance in this matter. The complaint was made to the agency's Auto Safety Hotline on August 30, 1993, reporting the burning of the belt of a Cosco child seat while placed for three hours in a vehicle parked in sunlight. According to the report, the claimant ``[n]oticed burning fumes and found burn marks [brownish discoloration] on the harness straps of the child restraint where the straps had been in contact with the top edge of the restraint's plastic shell as they lay across it.'' This incident raises concern that the burned fiber of the strap may have weakened the strength of the harness so that it might not provide the needed safety protection for a child occupant during a crash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cosco's final major argument was the owners might not respond to a future campaign of a more serious nature, if they were notified of one that concerned only a technical noncompliance. It argued: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> That child passenger safety advocates, child restraint manufacturers, and the Agency are aware of the negative impact of recalls resulting from technical noncompliance or defects that do not, as a practical matter, have true safety consequences. The most important negative effects of such recalls are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. That the public, because of the number and frequency of such recalls, pays no attention to recalls that actually affect, in a practical way, child passenger safety; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. That the public, upon seeing the number of recalls, concludes that child restraints currently available are unsafe and therefore decline to use them. The Agency is aware and, in fact, has publicly advised consumers to use child restraints that have defects or noncompliances that have that have resulted in recalls until such child restraints can be corrected. [An example of this advisement is contained in the docket.] This is in recognition of the fact that technical noncompliances or relatively insignificant safety defects do not compromise the overall effectiveness of child restraints. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statement that consumers ignore recalls because of their number and frequency is unsubstantiated. Further, NHTSA views it equally unlikely that, because of campaigns, consumers would conclude that child restraints are unsafe and decline to use them. Indeed, the opposite is more likely the case. Responses to safety notifications depend on factors including the type of noncompliance or defect, the type and extent of the notification campaign, media coverage, and the efforts of manufacturers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

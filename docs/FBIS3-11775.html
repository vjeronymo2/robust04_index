The harvest  workers have put a poor start behind them and, dismissing  difficulties, are fulfilling the trust placed in them. This is  the reason Camaguey was selected the winner in the eighth  regional emulation period with results surpassing those of Las  Tunas and Holguin Provinces. In sugar produced, they are second,  nationwide; in sugarcane grinding, yield, transportation,  planting, soil preparation, and power provided to the national  electric system, the region is the vanguard. This is very  encouraging and, in the opinion of specialists, denotes  efficiency and stability, even though there is still much to do.    The emulation assessment was chaired by Jose A. Naranjo,  chief of the commander in chief's coordination and support  staff, and Politburo members Nelson Torres, Sugar Minister, and  Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Camaguey Province, in addition to the first secretaries  of Las Tunas and Holguin Provinces.    It became evident in the analysis that an extraordinary  effort is required in the next 40 days in order to meet the  unalterable commitment of the three provinces decisive to Cuba's  sugar program. It was stressed that the doctrine of fulfilling  daily tasks is not only beautiful but essential, now more than  ever.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COUNTY AGENCY WEIGHS GO-AHEAD ON S.F. VALLEY RAIL ROUTE STUDIES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is meeting today to decide  which San Fernando Valley rail routes to study amid warnings that changes in  the options under consideration could force postponement of a Valley line until  the next century.  </P> <P> The 11-member commission is scheduled to vote whether to authorize the final  phase of a state-mandated $2.1-million engineering and environmental study of  cross-Valley route options.  </P> <P> The study results, expected no sooner than January, are to serve as the basis  for designating a route and determining whether the system should be light rail  or an extension of the Metro Rail subway system. The commission has about $800  million available to build one more rail system over the next 11 years.  </P> <P> However, environmental studies on two competing light-rail projects --  downtown-to-Pasadena and Marina del Rey to the western terminus of the Century  Freeway -- are nearly completed and commissioners predict that officials from  those areas will soon begin lobbying for the available funds.  </P> <P> Valley routes under consideration are the Ventura Freeway right-of-way from the  planned Universal City Metro Rail station to Warner Center and a Southern  Pacific railroad freight right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory  boulevards between Metro Rail's northern terminus on Lankershim Boulevard in  North Hollywood and Warner Center.  </P></p>

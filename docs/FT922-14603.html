			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Midlands companies focus on efficiency Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent COST CONTROL and cash management, allied to business planning, will be the most important elements in running a company over the next few months, according to the owners of private companies throughout the Midlands. Those priorities have emerged from a survey of 200 private companies, largely in manufacturing and construction, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, in Birmingham. More than four in five of those companies have a turnover of up to Pounds 10m. The aim of the survey was to gain an insight into business concerns as the economy prepares to move out of recession, which, with uncertainty about future economic policy caused by the general election, has forced companies to pay the highest attention to raising efficiency and cutting overheads. The emphasis on costs and cash, mentioned by more than nine out of 10 companies in the sample, gives the impression, Coopers said, 'that whilst little can be done to affect external factors, management is looking at controlling internal factors to compensate for this'. As to finance, only one in four companies felt the need to increase borrowing significantly and 21 per cent acknowledged that they were under pressure from their banks. Fewer than half the companies regarded the raising of capital as a serious issue. Coopers said the attitude towards capital-raising reflected the British practice of financing business with overdrafts and credit rather than long-term funds. It warned against 'boom and bust' cycles. The main business organisations have already warned that many small companies will face difficulties when they need extra cash to finance an expansion of output as the recession fades.</p>

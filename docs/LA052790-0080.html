			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT;  </P> <P> LET'S WEIGH THE URGE FOR ARMS DEALS AGAINST HISTORY'S LESSON -- THE UNFORESEEN  DOES THE MOST DAMAGE.  </P> <P> Is the Cold War over? Not if Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues are having  second thoughts about withdrawing Soviet troops from Europe.  </P> <P> Is the world becoming safer? Not if the United States accepts constraints on  advanced weapons while dangerous Soviet intercontinental ballistic weapons  remain unrestricted.  </P> <P> Has democracy triumphed? Not yet. Not in the Soviet Union or China or almost  anywhere in Asia outside of Japan. Not in the Middle East or Africa. While  democracy spreads in Latin America, fundamentalism spreads in Muslim nations.  </P> <P> Reason has not yet replaced force in Kashmir or Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or  Lithuania.  </P> <P> George Bush cannot write enough notes to comfort all the families of all the  victims of violence -- in Nepal, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Jordan, Beirut and  Nazareth. Secretary of State James A. Baker III cannot cut enough deals to  eliminate all the proliferating weapons of mass destruction.  </P> <P> It is not true that the case for democracy has vanquished all opposing  philosophies, only that it has vanquished European Marxism. We have not arrived  at the Heavenly City of 18th-Century philosophers or the Crystal Palace of  19th-Century prophets.  </P> <P> The fact is that no one knows what will happen next. The great movements of the  20th Century have come as a surprise. Communism, fascism, Nazism, Islamic  fundamentalism -- each was an unexpected development. Each seemed unlikely even  as it fastened a fanatical grip on an unwary society. Lenin and his Bolsheviks  were as implausible a band of conspirators as ever moved into a volatile  political situation. They were as implausible as Hitler and the freakish  freebooters who met with him in Bavaria and Berlin, as implausible as the  Ayatollah Khomeini and his frenzied followers, as implausible as the Chinese  Red Guard or Pol Pot's baby-faced killers in Cambodia.  </P> <P> Ours is a century of violent revolutions, each more unexpected than the last.  It is a century of utopian dreams and megalomaniacal revolutionaries who, as  rulers, move their subjects about like so many pawns on a gigantic chessboard  -- into cities, out of cities; from re-education onto farms, from farms into  re-education.  </P> <P> Always the world is surprised. We are surprised by war and surprised by peace;  surprised by economic growth (as in the Asian miracle) and surprised by  economic failure (as under socialism). We were surprised by Stalin's ruthless  conquests and by Gorbachev's abandonment of those conquests.  </P> <P> The truth is that we have not discerned the "laws" of historical development,  probably because there are none. Individual leaders have a greater impact on  history than we prefer to think because individuals are so unpredictable.  </P> <P> Much of what has happened since World War II has come as a surprise. And much  that lies ahead will also surprise us. We did not foresee the resurgence of  German and Japanese economic power, nor do we know the consequences for them or  us of Japan's highly leveraged security market and wide-ranging acquisitions.  No one anticipated the rapid liquidation of the Soviet Union's European empire.  Nor did we foresee the Soviet government's sudden halt of its withdrawal from  Eastern Europe. We do not know how long Gorbachev will retain power or what his  policies will be while he remains.  </P> <P> We are more involved with one another than ever, but that does not mean that we  like each other better. Some Japanese dream of saying "no" to America. Some  French will not say "yes" to NATO or to a special role for the United States in  Europe. The size and shape of the European community are less certain than  Brussels pretends. Difficulties in breaking East Germany out of the Warsaw Pact  expand that unknown. Uncertainty hangs as heavy as London fog over the future,  obscuring it.  </P> <P> It is a good time now, in advance of the American-Soviet summit, for the U.S.  government to step back and think again about a sweeping arms deal that does  not affect the presence of Soviet troops and tanks in Europe or the continued  production of ICBMs with a well-understood first-strike capability.  </P> <P> It is time for the Bush Administration to reiterate Ronald Reagan's message at  Reykjavik: A deal? Yes, but not at the price of enhanced American vulnerability  in a still very uncertain world.  </P></p>

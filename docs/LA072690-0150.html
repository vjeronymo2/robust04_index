			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The NFL is expected to announce the two cities to be awarded expansion  franchises Friday, with the new teams beginning play in 1993.  </P> <P> Among the cities that have been pursuing professional football teams are  Jacksonville, Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis and Charlotte, N.C. Oakland would  also be interested in an expansion team if the Raiders decide not to return  there from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "That's the best news we've heard since we started in the NFL derby," Arthur  (Chick) Sherrer, leader of Jacksonville's expansion efforts, told the Florida  Times-Union. "This formal process makes expansion a definite reality."  </P> <P> The expansion process was officially put in motion at the NFL owners' meeting  in March when Commissioner Paul Tagliabue named realignment and expansion  committees.  </P> <P> The league's last expansion was in 1976, when it added Tampa Bay and Seattle.  </P> <P> An owners' meeting scheduled to be held in Chicago today was called off, and  any matters that require a vote will be done by telephone.  </P></p>

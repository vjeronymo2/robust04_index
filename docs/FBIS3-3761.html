The Second Session of the Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] had also successfully carried out its  missions and closed earlier. The two annual sessions are an  important matter in the political life of the Chinese people and  important meetings for promoting economic development and social  progress in China. This year's two sessions were convened under  the favorable conditions of sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development and China's efforts to push forward the  reform of economic structure. The two sessions held high the  grand banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, upheld the party's basic  line, conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, and proposed  valuable opinions and made important decisions on reform and  development for 1994.    Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the  overall situation in the work of the entire party and state.  The sessions thoroughly discussed and spoke highly of this  overall situation proposed by the central authorities. All  localities, units, and sectors around the country should serve  and be subject to this overall situation in their work.  Economic construction is the center of all work. Reform and  opening up are the driving forces for development; development  and reform are the basis for social stability and the state's  long-term peace and stability; stability is the prerequisite for  developing the economy and promoting reform. As long as we  correctly recognize and handle the relations between reform,  development, and stability; notice new situations and resolve  new problems in a timely manner; and coordinate reform,  development, and stability and make them promote each other, our  modernization drive will win a new victory.    Maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development is the aspiration of the people around the country,  as well as a pressing need for the domestic and international  situations. The sessions fully discussed, in dialectical terms,  the relations among sustentation, rapidity, and healthiness in  the course of economic development. It is necessary to deepen  reform, open up wider, strengthen and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control, vigorously readjust economic structure,  promote technical progress, actively develop markets, and  control inflation in this year's economic work, and we should  virtually change our concepts for improving economic efficiency  and should by no means resume the course of blindly pursuing  output value, speed, and the expansion of investment scale.  This is an important factor determining whether there will be  healthy economic development. We should correctly analyze and  have a clear understanding of the situation -- not only the  favorable conditions, but also the adverse factors -- and do our  best to maintain a vigorous and stable growth rate in line with  reality.    The wheel of reform is driving China's economy and various  undertakings to a bright future, and people of all nationalities  in China have deep feelings for reform. The Chinese people  shall achieve two major objectives by the end of this century,  one is to achieve the second-step strategic objective of  socialist modernization and to achieve a comfortable living  standard, the other is to preliminarily establish a socialist  market economic structure. The attainment of these two  objectives relies on reform. In promoting this year's reform, we  must integrate the work of making significant breakthroughs with  the work of promoting reform as a whole. The tasks are arduous  and strenuous as we should not only push reform forward amid the  speedy economic operation, but also maintain stability and  development in the accelerating transformation of systems. To  complete this year's reform missions, we should not only  strengthen our confidence and adopt a scientific attitude, but  also remain sober-minded and do a solid job.    The two sessions have closed. As the guidelines of the  sessions are conveyed and implemented, China's basic principles,  policies, and measures for this year's economic work and various  undertakings shall strike root more deeply in the hearts of the  people and the overall situtation characterized by reform,  development, and stability shall become the common ground of  hundreds of millions of people. The current situation is good  and the opportunity is rare. Under the guidance of the CPC  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, let  people of all nationalities across the country unite together  with one heart and one mind and follow the course charted by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line to complete  this year's tasks in reform and development and win a new  victory in socialist modernization drive!</p>

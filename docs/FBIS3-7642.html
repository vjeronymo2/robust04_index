			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Il-hwa from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Quoting Chinese sources, ASAHI SHIMBUN said in a  report dispatched from Beijing today that North Korea's Kim  Il-song will not visit China until the nuclear issue is resolved.    According to these sources, China understands that Kim  Il-song has virtually refused to visit China.    In the opinion of the Beijing sources, Kim Il-song is wary  of  the possibility that China might claim credit if the nuclear  issue were resolved after he visited China because it would seem  to have been resolved due to China's persuasion.</p>

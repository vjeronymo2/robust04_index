			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (10): Largest of the Baby Bells - Decade of growth for Atlanta-based BellSouth When American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) was broken up in 1984 and its local phone companies divided into regional operating companies, the Atlanta-based BellSouth was the largest, and fastest-growing, of the seven 'Baby Bells.' Today, with annual revenues of more than Dollars 16bn and assets of Dollars 40bn, it remains the largest and fastest-growing Baby Bell, an indication that BellSouth has not wasted the opportunity during its first decade to build on the strengths evident at the company's birth. Chief among those strengths was the potential of its local market. BellSouth has had the good fortune to serve nine states based in the country's fastest-growing region, the southeast. While much of the rest of the US endured a recession in 1990-1991, and a subsequent slow and uneven recovery, the southeast sailed through the stormy waters of the period relatively unscathed and today continues to lead the nation in the pace of its economic expansion. Buoyed by an influx of both residential and business customers moving into the region from other parts of the US, growth in Bell South's access lines - the typical measure of a phone company's growth - has been the best in the industry. The company added 665,000 access lines in 1993, a rate it expects to top this year. 'The population migration into the southeast has been pretty steady for last couple of decades, and we get a direct benefit from that because people want communications,' says Mr John Clendenin, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth since its inception. The company has spent a lot of money over the years on its phone system in the region, an investment in technology which Mr Clendenin regards as crucial if BellSouth is going to maintain its growth rate. Between 1988 and the end of 1993, the company spent a total of Dollars 18bn on modernising its phone system. This year, another Dollars 3bn is scheduled to be spent on upgrading the system's technology. Heavy expenditure on technology is just one element of a three-part strategy BellSouth is pursuing - the others involve an aggressive move into the wireless cellular phone, paging and mobile data businesses (especially overseas, where the company is now the world's largest cellular operator), and a more cautious foray into the cable television market, where the company hopes to benefit from the much talked-about convergence of the telecommunications, computer and entertainment industries. Of BellSouth's careful entry into the cable television business, Mr Clendenin says: 'We're a very active participant in the explorations going on. All of the Baby Bells are getting their feet wet in this. We have not gone into cable overseas the way some have, but we are trying to learn the same lessons.' Its first lesson will come from a planned deployment of video technology to 12,000 homes in the Atlanta suburbs. BellSouth's chairman describes the experiment - which the company hopes will be approved by federal regulators later this year - as 'a fully interactive, fibre-optic system carrying communications and video programming into the home.' Prime Management, the 24th largest cable operator in the US which has been 22.5 per cent-owned by BellSouth since last year, is a key partner in the Atlanta test operation, which Mr Clendenin hopes will reveal the technology's potential - 'we'll learn a lot about what the customer wants, what they'll pay for, how they'll use it: it will become a platform for wider deployment.' The partnership with Prime is typical of the BellSouth policy of seeking partners whenever it explores new markets. This strategy is readily apparent in many of the company's wireless businesses - such as its co-operative ventures with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson GE to market mobile computing and cellular-paging products - but it is probably nowhere more evident than in its fast-growing overseas businesses. Outside the US, BellSouth has concentrated its energies in developing a significant presence in an eclectic mix of national cellular markets. While the company will be the fourth largest cellular operator in the US when the Bell Atlantic-Nynex union is completed, it is the largest global cellular operator based in the US. BellSouth has been pursuing its aggressive international strategy since the mid- to late-1980s, starting in Latin America and later France, Germany and other parts of Europe. The company is also moving into the near east (Israel), and the Far East - most notably China - and has long had a sizeable stake in Australia and New Zealand. In most instances, BellSouth shies away from wired telecommunications systems because it believes the cellular business offers a much more secure foothold in foreign markets. As Mr Clendenin says: 'Cellular in many of these countries has been a godsend. The telephone system in Caracas (Venezual) was so bad that you couldn't get a call through even if you were the president. Cellular came in and bypassed the local system, and performed marvelously as a substitute for local phone service.' BellSouth's most exciting overseas adventure is arguably in Australia, where it supplements its cellular business with its partially-owned subsidiary Optus Communications, the country's second largest long-distance and business network service operator. The company is also moving into the currently undeveloped Australian cable television market with its usual team of local partners. In some ways, BellSouth appears to be using Australia as a telecommunications laboratory. As Mr Charles Coe, president of BellSouth International, says of the company's business there: 'It will define the full potential of the relationship between telephone and cable TV operators.' He has such high hopes of the Australia operations that Mr Coe expects revenues from the country to reach Dollars 1bn by 1996. Expansion overseas, big spending on technology at home, and new investments in the cable business - none of this comes cheaply, and like most Baby Bells, BellSouth has been working hard to contain its escalating costs. The company, in fact, has been paring its payrolls since 1987, and last year that process culminated in the announcement of a plan to reduce the total workforce of about 80,000 by 10,200 before the end of 1996. The cuts in the plan, which should realise annual savings of Dollars 600m, come on top of previous workforce reductions totalling 6,500 jobs. To pay for some of these moves, the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 1.1bn last year. BellSouth, however, faces a tough task subduing cost growth because its core business - providing phone services in the south-east - is expanding so fast. 'We have an unusual problem - a big growth rate . . . which has complicated the downsizing (process),' says Mr Clendenin. 'We have to downsize with a scalpel - we can't not be there to provide service when you move into your home in Tuscaloosa.' Mr Clendenin, however, says that the company's target of reducing the workforce by 10,200 within the next two years could increase if circumstances dictate. How this will affect the Atlanta-area - where 16,000 BellSouth employees work - is uncertain, because BellSouth has not provided a breakdown of where the cuts will be made. The company, however, is happy to point out that its business contributes an estimated Dollars 2.5bn a year to the city's economy.</p>

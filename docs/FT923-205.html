			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Banks agree to roll over ex-Soviet debt A COMMITTEE of western banks agreed yesterday to roll over the bank debt of the former Soviet Union for another three months, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. This is the fourth time since December that banks have agreed to extend their claims on the total debt of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which amounts to Dollars 65bn-Dollars 70bn. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank, which heads the bank advisory committee on former Soviet debt, said the committee would recommend acceptance to the ex-Soviet Union's other bank creditors. Russia's economic reforms are seriously at risk and inflation could reach 'dangerous levels by the end of the year', a senior IMF official, Mr Hernando Cota, told Russian deputies yesterday, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.</p>

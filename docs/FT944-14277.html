			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Management can't replace thought The headlines from the UK Treasury's Fundamental Review of Running Costs were all about the loss of one in four in top personnel. But reducing the size of the Treasury is not itself an important contribution to expenditure control. It is a tiny department employing 1,400 people including clerical staff other supporting workers. The review claims that it did not attempt to make economies for their own sake, but rather asked whether a reformed and slimmed down Treasury could do its job more efficiently. There is a case to be made. The Treasury may be too hierarchical, and waste time and energy in passing papers from one level to another. There may still be too much candle-ends control of the expenditure of other departments in place of priorities and ceilings. Unfortunately the review does not say anything as straightforward. The principal author, Jeremy Heywood, is no shrinking violet and one would expect him to be direct and pungent. But something seems to happen to the writing of people, whether journalists or officials, who venture into management: they come under the grip of a woolly and obfuscatory jargon. The authors remark that such few officials as the Treasury does have abroad are mostly in America and they advocate a shift of emphasis towards Europe. More knowledge of languages will thus be required. This is correct and applies most of all to English. I would defy anyone who reads the full document of more than 200 pages to come to any intelligent conclusion on whether the proposed changes are for the better or the worse. The review has dozens of acronyms in each chapter, and there is no glossary. We have, of course, been here before. Similar reforms were advocated by the Plowden Committee in 1961. As one Oxford commentator suggested, the Plowden report must have gone through 'that lengthy process of redrafting, during which the sharp edges, the pungent phrases and any handle to outside critics were all removed'. Like the present review, Plowden went on about the importance of management and on the need for top officials to spend more time running their departments instead of on the more glamorous job of advising ministers. The review says that the ability to manage will be as important as the need to analyse policy. (In a one-sentence lifeline, it grudgingly admits that there will be a place for the analyst who cannot manage. Thank you, Jeremy.) The most important point of substance in the two reports is identical: the need for more delegation to the spending departments. There is, of course, the opposite view that unless a senior department, such as the Treasury, and a senior minister, such as the chancellor, get thoroughly involved in departmental detail, they will be easy victims to spending lobbies and pressure groups of all kinds. The outsider cannot judge. For the review gives no examples of spending control. Nor does it even list the limits below which departments can decide. It comes as a breath of fresh air to find the odd sentence on events and policies, for example that the sharp increase in the budget deficit in the 1990s took place because no one section of the Treasury was clearly responsible for ensuring that 'the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement came out on track'. The review rejects the idea of downgrading economic forecasts and contracting out the Treasury model. Here it is unconvincing. Finding policies which are less dependent on crystal gazing ability is just as demanding an intellectual task as making a forecast and a better use for Treasury brainpower. The chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has overruled his officials by suggesting a marketing of the Treasury forecasting work in a couple of years. But I wonder if he realises that more than a normal commercial tender is involved. The numerical estimates in the various macro models are adjusted to fit the most fashionable theories and not the other way round - and necessarily so. The review makes a brave attempt to distinguish between the Treasury mission statement (to maintain a stable macro-economic environment) and the 'objectives' (permanently low inflation) which may characterise particular governments. But the whole drift of the document is that economic policy consists of pursuing low inflation, a balanced budget and efficient control of public spending. I could not resist writing in the margin of my copy, 'signed Sir John Simon, 1939' (Sir John was the last British chancellor unaffected by Keynes). Simon may have been more right wing than his postwar successors. But what many politicians and their businessmen friends will never learn is that such matters are inherently contestable - there is no hard science in sight which manager-politicians can tap if only they run a tight ship. One postwar chancellor complained: 'Three Treasury knights have seen me and they have all told me to do different things.' That is a more accurate presentation of the state of knowledge than the managerialists would have us believe.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Labour tactical on Maastricht Bill The Labour party, which ended its conference in Blackpool yesterday, is refusing to be explicit about its tactics when the Maastricht bill resumes its Commons stages, Ralph Atkins writes. Although the Labour leadership backs the principle of closer European union, Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, said the party would want to examine the bill's content, particularly in the light of any changes made to satisfy the Danish people. She said Labour would oppose attempts by the government to impose a 'guillotine' on the bill - a measure restricting the time allowed for debate which is usually used to prevent filibustering by opponents. Labour is conscious that the divide among its MPs over Maastricht is substantial, although probably not as deep as among Conservatives.</p>

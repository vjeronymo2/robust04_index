			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (23): All in one basket, or pick your own - Self-Select &amp; Single-Company PEPs / Two variations that may appeal to the investor who has time and knowledge - as well as the willingness to accept greater risk SELF-SELECT and single-company personal equity plans are the lesser principalities within the Pep empire. Neither has been as popular as managed and trust-based Peps, but both can stake a claim to a place in an investor's portfolio. Single company Peps were launched at the beginning of 1991, with the main aim of allowing employees in an approved share-option scheme to transfer their shares to a Pep once the shares emerged from the scheme. The transfer can be made directly, without the usual 'bed and breakfasting' arrangement and without any liability for capital gains tax, so long as the transfer is made within 90 days. Individuals are allowed to invest Pounds 3,000 a year in a single-company Pep a year, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 general Pep limit. Over 110,000 single-company plans were taken out in 1991, and the amount invested was Pounds 270m, according to figures from the Inland Revenue. This represents only 5 per cent of the total Pep market by number of plans, and just over 4 per cent of the market by value. The main drawback with single-company Peps for the general investor is the risk resulting from lack of diversification. If you put the whole of your Pep investment in one share, you risk that company collapsing. A general Pep allows you to increase diversification over the years - by putting in Pounds 6,000 a year for 5 years, for example, you would be able to get a fair degree of diversification. You can, of course, take out a different single-company Pep each year. They are also very useful for those who have already accumulated a substantial portfolio of shares and want to hold as much as possible in a tax-efficient form. Beginner investors, however, should only consider a single-company Pep if they have already used up the maximum in a general Pep. Single-company Peps can be managed by a Pep plan manager, but are more popular on a self-select basis. John Spiers, of BESt Investment, says that most single-company plans are self-select, because it is difficult for investors to justify the difference in cost with a managed Pep when the investment dilemma is restricted to choosing a single stock. For many people, the most suitable companies are likely to be those which offer a good yield and are able to maintain their dividend. An even cheaper way of taking out a single-company Pep is through a Pep provider whose costs are subsidised by the company itself. Many FT-SE 100 companies provide this service, to reward their existing their small investors and to encourage new ones. The main Pep providers who specialise in this field are Bradford &amp; Bingley, Hoare Govett, NatWest stockbrokers and Cazenove. CCC&amp;P, which also used to be heavily involved in corporate Peps, closed this part of its business in October, recommending companies to transfer instead to Henderson Administration. The drawback with obtaining a Pep in this way - for example, an ICI Pep through its sponsors, Hoare Govett - is that you cannot then switch another company's shares into the plan, if your view of ICI's prospects changes. Self-select Peps are general Peps, subject to the usual Pounds 6,000 per year maximum; but, as their name suggests, the stock is chosen by the investor rather than a plan manager. Clearly, self-select Peps will only appeal to those with the time and the knowledge to manage their own portfolio. Investors will still have to operate through a plan manager, because only they are authorised to run Peps. Roz Barder, editor of Chase de Vere's Pepguide, says that out of the 700 schemes listed in the guide, only 75 are self-select. Your choice of Pep plan manager is therefore more limited, but that can make the task easier. The important criteria for making a choice will be the size and structure of charges, efficiency of service and administration, and any restrictions or conditions imposed on the Pep by its plan managers. Some plan managers structure their charge on the self-select Pep in a way to discourage frequent dealing. Others may have cheaper dealing charges but higher management or initial charges. Some will have both high dealing and management charges, and should therefore be avoided. BESt Personal Equity Plan has calculated total charges on a self-select Pep as a percentage cost of the investment. The calculation assumes that the full amount was put in when the plan was taken out, and that the average investor changed his portfolio twice during a three-year period. The average cost for the average investor is 13.3 per cent on these assumptions. Mr Spiers says that two of the cheapest providers are Alliance Trust and Lloyds Bank, with 1.8 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively. There are restrictions, however. Alliance Trust requires you to deposit the first Pounds 1,500 in one of its investment trusts, while Lloyds Bank, with its very low brokerage commission of 0.2 per cent, only deals on a certain day each month and restricts the choice of stock to a list of 100 blue-chip companies. Many of the plan managers charge a management fee for self-select Peps, which may appear incongruous because it is the investor who is managing the Pep by selecting stock and deciding when to buy or sell. However, Ms Barder says that companies without a management charge will probably impose a fee for dividend collection instead. She also advises investors to watch out for exit penalties. If you are going to be a relatively inactive investor, a self-select Pep should work out to be much cheaper than a managed Pep, but frequent dealing will raise the costs. If you are an active investor, it is probably better to take out a self-select Pep with a stockbroker, because dealing can be done immediately, rather than at the end of the day or at certain points in the month, which is a system that many of the banks operate. Consider, too, whether there are restrictions on the number of stocks that can be held in the Pep, and whether you have the flexibility to choose any stock you like, including an investment or unit trust. Some plan managers will provide advice, despite the Pep's being self-select, but this is likely to be when you already have an existing portfolio with them.</p>

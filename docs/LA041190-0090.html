			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVE RACES;  </P> <P> HILL TAKES BIG LEAD IN BITTERLY FOUGHT 31ST SENATE RACE  </P> <P> Capping a bitter and expensive campaign, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier)  appeared headed for victory Tuesday in a special election for a state Senate  seat in one of California's most Republican districts.  </P> <P> Hill held a 3-to-1 lead over his Democratic opponent in early returns from more  than 20,000 absentee ballots. The four-term legislator was seeking to replace  state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), who resigned in December  after serving more than 20 years in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Hill said Tuesday evening that his campaign had spent more than $90,000 on an  absentee-ballot strategy, but he was still surprised at the wide margin. "I  think it's certainly larger than what I thought it was going to be," he said.  </P> <P> Hill had more votes in just the absentee ballots Tuesday than he had when he  won the special primary for the seat in February. He said the results made him  optimistic about winning, but he said it was too early to declare victory.  </P> <P> Hill, 36, had been favored to win despite vicious attacks by his opponents who  focused on reports that he has been targeted by the FBI in its investigation of  political corruption at the state Capitol.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I think it was a factor since 80% of the mail was focused on it,"  Hill said earlier in the day. "I think it was reassuring to find that the folks  in the (Assembly) district I have represented for eight years trusted me and  hung in with me."  </P> <P> Democrat Janice Graham, 53, who opposed Hill in Tuesday's election, agreed that  the Republican voters who dominate the district appeared loyal to Hill and that  conservatives may also have been attracted to Hill's opposition to unrestricted  abortion.  </P> <P> Graham, a former schoolteacher who lives in Laguna Hills, had expected state  Democratic leaders and abortion-rights groups to join her campaign when Hill  narrowly defeated Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in a bitter  primary in February. But statewide leaders said they still considered her race  unwinnable.  </P> <P> The 31st Senate District stretches from West Covina in Los Angeles County to  Laguna Beach in Orange County. It has a registration edge for the GOP of about  54% to 36%.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian scheduled the race when Campbell resigned after more  than 20 years in the Legislature. Campbell was named president of the  California Manufacturers Assn.  </P> <P> The third candidate on Tuesday's ballot in the 31st Senate District was Robert  Lewis from the American Independent Party.  </P> <P> There were two other special elections Tuesday for openings in the Legislature.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County's 26th Senate District, Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon  (D-Whittier) was leading in the race for the Senate seat formerly held by  Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who quit in February after his conviction on  political corruption charges.  </P> <P> Calderon held a large lead in the early returns, although the registrar had  received only about 5,000 absentee ballots.  </P> <P> A third special state election was held Tuesday in San Diego to fill an  Assembly seat left vacant when Lucy Killea won election to the state Senate  last December. With nine candidates in the race, none was expected to receive  more than 50% of the vote, forcing a June runoff election between the top  vote-getters from each party.  </P> <P> Nine candidates -- five Democrats, three Republicans and a Peace and Freedom  Party member -- were on the ballot. Former San Diego City Councilman Mike  Gotch, a Democrat, and Republican Jeff Marston, a former aide to ex-U.S. Sen.  S.I. Hayakawa (R-California), each had about a third of the votes in the early  returns.  </P> <P> TUSTIN RACE  </P> <P> Councilman John Kelly lost as three TRAC candidates won.

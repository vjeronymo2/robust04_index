			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Clinton, riding high, heads for rough country: On eve of the State of the Union address. Jurek Martin reviews the state of the president By one yardstick, President Bill Clinton has good reason to look forward to presenting his first official State of the Union address to Congress tonight. He will speak after a first year of legislative achievement unmatched by any newly-elected president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, with the economy cruising along very nicely and a budget deficit now projected at a mere Dollars 180bn (Pounds 122bn), and, in consequence, with his own popularity rising back to where it was when he assumed office. He could take encouragement from the fact that his initial address to Congress last February (technically not a State of the Union message) was considered by all a raging success and that he has clearly taken the leadership in enunciating public concerns about the great issues of the moment - healthcare, crime and gun control, and reform of the welfare system. By another measurement, however, his remains an afflicted presidency, still struggling to find consistency. He is currently embarrassed by problems finding a new defence secretary, troubled by the Whitewater investigations into his financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s, and, overseas, disturbed that the Russian commitments to reform given him in Moscow only 10 days ago now look very suspect, while the situation in Bosnia deteriorates by the hour. Moreover, both parties in Congress remain deeply divided over what to do about healthcare, crime and welfare reform, reducing the president's chances of clear cut victories. Mr Clinton declared over the weekend that 'gridlock' was over, a post-North American Free Trade Agreement sentiment officially shared by the leadership of both parties, but declarations of its demise may yet, like reports of Mark Twain's death, prove premature. Even before any of the big issues come to the crunch on Capitol Hill, his most immediate problem is next month's Senate debate on the balanced budget amendment. Passage against his wishes would not only encourage Republicans but might persuade Democrats up for re-election in November to desert the presidential cause on other matters. Also, Ross Perot, the third force in contemporary US politics, promised over the weekend to mobilise his troops in favour of the balanced budget and against healthcare reform. Many members of Congress are afraid of his grassroots power. Still, one of the great advantages of the ceremonial State of the Union message is that it gives the president an unchallenged pulpit to go over the heads of a carping capital and talk to the nation about his agenda and rationale. The specifics may be lightly touched on but the broad themes are intended to strike important national chords. Mr Clinton has done this effectively in a series of recent speeches on the question of individual responsibilities to social issues aimed both at minorities and at the broad middle class. Tonight's address is likely to draw heavily on the one he gave last October in Memphis at the Rev Martin Luther King's old church in which he urged communities not to wait for the government to solve all their problems. This theme cuts across party lines and underpins Mr Clinton's own claim to be a 'new kind of Democrat' practising simultaneously fiscal responsibility and a tough, but caring, approach to social problems, including crime (the president may well endorse the populist drive to impose mandatory life sentences on anyone convicted of three violent offences). Inter-connected inside this framework are all the component parts of his ambitious domestic agenda, which, he is convinced with some justification, are broadly what the country wants and needs. Several recent polls have found that crime and healthcare have supplanted the economy, the focus of his first year, as the dominant national concern. It is likely, therefore, that domestic issues will dwarf foreign policy in tonight's address. Whatever his apparent difficulties overseas, the public, into which he is so finely tuned, simply does not follow the twists and turns in Russia, Bosnia and elsewhere. A Washington Post poll published over the weekend found 67 per cent satisfied with his conduct of external relations, even though a hypercritical Washington establishment fumes daily over the shortcomings of his foreign policy team's performance. Thus it may be sufficient for Mr Clinton merely to point to the Nafta victory and Uruguay Round trade accord, to promise to maintain pressure on Japan to open its markets, to highlight Nato's new approach to the former Warsaw Pact countries and to re-emphasise his commitment to democracy and reform in Russia and elsewhere in eastern Europe. He could, if he wanted, borrow one line from his speech in Brussels two weeks ago about the impossibility of the US controlling 'every event in every country every day'. But the Clinton target tonight will be the audiences that helped put him in office to solve national problems. He will claim he has made a very good start but that much tough sledding lies ahead. Not long after he sits down, predictable applause ringing in his ears, he will be finding out again how tough it can be.</p>

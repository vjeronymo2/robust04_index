			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON WINE: THE OTHER MONDAVI  </P> <P> SINCE THE MONDAVI BROTHERS split up in 1965, much has been written about Robert  Mondavi and his award-winning wines. But little has been heard of Peter and the  Charles Krug Winery that the brothers once shared.  </P> <P> This Napa Valley winery continues to be a family operation -- albeit Peter's  family. His son Peter Jr., with engineering degrees from Stanford, helped  design the winery's temperature-control systems and the computerized crushing  area. Marc, the younger son, supervises 1,200 acres of some of the finest  vineyards in the valley, including the winery's two choice vineyards in Los  Carneros, from which the vintage Pinot Noir and barrel-fermented Chardonnays  are drawn.  </P> <P> Marc has worked at the winery since he was 10. "I did just about everything,  jobs nobody else wanted to do," he says. "I learned from the ground up. It was  the ground I liked best, the vineyards. That's why I went to UC Davis, to study  viticulture and enology."  </P> <P> Although the winery's fresh, fruity Chenin Blanc has always been its hallmark  wine, it also produces superior Cabernet Sauvignon. As part of the 40th  anniversary of its "Vintage Selection," the first private-reserve bottlings of  Cabernet Sauvignons, Charles Krug released the '84, '83 and '81 editions.  </P> <P> Some notes on the new releases:  </P> <P> Charles Krug 1988 Chardonnay Los Carneros, $11.50. The bouquet suggests apples;  the taste, lemons. This gentle wine will age beautifully yet is drinkable right  now.  </P> <P> Charles Krug 1985 Carneros-Napa Valley Pinot Noir, $8.50. Charming wine of  jewel-garnet color with none of the tannic, tar-bitterness so often found in  California editions of this varietal. Fine balance, remarkable delicacy.  </P> <P> Charles Krug "Vintage Selection" Cabernet Sauvignon, $20. The 1984 is an  intense ruby color. Vanilla in the bouquet adds intrigue to the still-youthful  berryness. The California State Fair Wine Competition gave it a gold medal. The  '83 has garnet hues, with hints of cedar in the bouquet. Good structure, but  age will help. The loveliest of the trio is the 1981. This soft and elegant  wine may be at its peak, but it will hold for several more years. Robert  Lawrence Balzer  </P></p>

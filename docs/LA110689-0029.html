			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: MIRACLE LEGION EDGY AND WHIMSICAL AT BOGART'S  </P> <P> On its current album "Me and Mr. Ray," Miracle Legion, a group led by the duo  of Mark J. Mulcahy and Ray Neal, soft-pedals sounds suited for introspective  neo-folkies living on double espressos and tattered copies of Camus. So it was  a surprise when the Connecticut-based band (now a quartet) exploded on stage at  Bogart's on Friday with a refreshing surge of thorny post-punkisms. Even if  it's not 100% focused yet, this is a group with wide-angle vision.  </P> <P> Looking like a cousin of Tiny Tim, singer Mulcahy occasionally overdid the  "look ma, I'm eccentric" routine, but his raspy tone and gliding phrases recall  the emotional purity of Van Morrison. Guitarist Neal, a bundle of raw intensity  and Yankee ingenuity, transformed simple riffs into power cycles by dint of  commitment.  </P> <P> Not all the songs worked -- some are too arch, others too enigmatic -- but  Miracle Legion's hard edginess and sweet poetic whimsy are a bright light in  the increasingly dim field of independent, non-metallic, American bands.

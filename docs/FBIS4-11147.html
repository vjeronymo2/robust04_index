			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina  gave a detailed explanation of the Cuban Government's criteria  regarding Cuban emigres during the second day of The Nation and  the Emigrants Conference, at which this topic, considered the  meeting's main subject, was analyzed.    The minister explained that the overall perception of the  Cuban community abroad has changed. He stressed that current  migration laws respond to the need to protect Cuba, thus the  political rights of Cubans living in Cuba cannot be the same as  those who live abroad.    Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso told the press that  talks  between the official Cuban representatives and the 215 guests  are proceeding in an atmosphere of respect and are characterized  by an absence of confrontation.    Cuban visitors, most of whom are U.S. residents, requested  certain changes to the visa system, the creation of an official  organization to handle their affairs, and the opening of several  consulates in the United States. They also asked that their  children be allowed to study in Cuba.    The Nation and the Emigrants Conference was convened by the  Cuban Government and is being held at the Havana Convention  Center with the participation of Cubans who reside in 27  different countries.</p>

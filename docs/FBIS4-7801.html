			<p>BFN     [Text] A public statement issued by the Slovene People's  Party demands a debate on the responsibility of the state  president [Milan Kucan] for the situation in Slovenia and his  withdrawal, a State Chamber vote of no-confidence in the  government, and early parliamentary and presidential elections.  They demand this because of impossible conditions in the country  due to an ever-increasing disaster among the Slovene people and  the alienation of the authorities.</p>

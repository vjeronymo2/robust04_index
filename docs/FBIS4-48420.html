			<p>BFN     [Text] Following bloody clashes, Eduardo dos Santos' troops  are bogged down in the lower part of N'Dalatando, the provincial  capital of Cuanza Norte Province. The People's Armed Forces for  the Liberation of Angola logistics line from Dondo is totally  neutralized, without any possibility of movement forward or  backward. The air raids on civilian populations have not yet  ceased. By 1200 [1100 GMT] Firmino Lukamba, our correspondent  in the N'Dalatando war theater, reported that there has been  heavy bombing of the Lucala District and Quiangombe commune.  Houses, farms and other civilian property which are not  military targets are not being spared and human losses are  considerable.</p>

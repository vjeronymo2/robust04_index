			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Defections from pro-government increasing in Brazil DEFECTIONS from the pro-government parties in Brazil are increasing after the vote on Wednesday to approve a congressional report accusing President Fernando Collor of massive corruption. A poll of Congress members by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper shows support for impeachment doubled in the last 10 days, reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The opposition now has 300 of the 336 votes necessary to approve an impeachment process, with a further 165 deputies still undecided. Discussions on a transitional government are already under way. Senior Brazilian government officials have begun admitting for the first time that Mr Collor no longer has the Congressional support necessary to fend off the impeachment process, now due to be initiated on Tuesday. Dom Luciano Mendes, head of the Catholic Church in Brazil, was expected yesterday to add his voice to those calling for Mr Collor's resignation. The governors of the country's 12 largest states have all come out against the president and leaders of the country's powerful business community will meet in Rio de Janeiro on Monday to decide their position. Stephen Fidler reports in London: Brazil is set to sign on September 10 an agreement to issue about Dollars 7bn of 10-year bonds covering interest arrears to international banks built up in 1989 and 1990. Citibank, which heads the creditor banks negotiating with the Brazil, said the bonds will be issued once banks holding 95 per cent of the debt have signed the agreements. This should let the bonds be issued in the fourth quarter. In April 1991, Brazil and leading creditor banks agreed on the settlement of Dollars 8bn of debt arrears - Dollars 2bn in cash and the rest in bonds. Bonds are also being issued to cover interest on delayed interest. Banks will be able to choose between two classes of bonds, each of which has a three-year grace period before capital repayments start falling due. The government is talking over with leading creditor banks a comprehensive rescheduling of Dollars 44bn of bank debt, which Citibank expects will take a further two weeks to complete.</p>

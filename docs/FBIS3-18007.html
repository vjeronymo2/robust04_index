			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Late last night the Latvian Government gave its  approval to the treaty with Russia which is to lead to the  withdrawal of all Russian troops from the country by 31 August.  Today, [Swedish] Premier Carl Bildt travelled to Riga in order  to try to influence the Latvian Parliament also to approve the  treaty. Lars Gunnar Erlandson reports:    [Erlandson] The lightning visit which Premier Carl Bildt is  paying to the Latvian capital Riga today is almost exclusively  about what will happen to the treaty which Latvia is about to  conclude with Russia. There is strong opposition in the Latvian  Parliament to the treaty, which the government has said it will  be able to sign shortly. Everything indicates that the Russians  will be able to retain a radar station in Skrunda, but one  difficult issue is the rights which the Russians are demanding  for the thousands of retired Russian military staff remaining in  Latvia.    Latvian Premier Valdis Birkavs does not want to divulge what  advice he has received from Bildt, but he stressed that Sweden's  view of security in the Baltics is very important. This is what  Premier Carl Bildt had to say after the discussions in Riga.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] I believe that the great  significance of this troop withdrawal treaty is recognized here.  At the same time, we recognize the very difficult decisions  which this treaty means for Latvia, both with regard to the  radar base in Skrunda and with regard to the rights following  from this for certain military officers to retire here.    [Erlandson] Is that the hardest nut to crack?    [Bildt] It is difficult to know which is the hardest, but a  treaty of this kind means coompromise on both sides. There is a  strong nationalist opposition in Russia which does not want this  treaty at all, and there is uncertainty here, too.    [Erlandson] But could there be a treaty where something is  excepted, for instance the issue of retired officers?    [Bildt] That is part of the treaty, so I found it difficult  to see that, as things are now developing. The treaty is  written as a whole and all these things must be sorted out one  way or the other in a relationship governed by a treaty between  Latvia and Russia. One must be clear that, in the relations  between a large country like Russia and a small country like  Latvia, it is in the interests of the small country to have a  treaty. A state without treaties can always be utilized by the  big ones, treaties are always in the interests of the small  ones. [end recording]</p>

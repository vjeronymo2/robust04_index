			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Kalamazoo sale realises Pounds 4.3m Kalamazoo, the business systems and specialist print manufacturer, has completed the sale of its shares in Great American Software to Meca Software for Pounds 4.3m. That will be satisfied as to Pounds 2.6m cash, 800,000 of Meca loan notes and 100,000 shares. A further 140,000 shares will be issued subject to the performance of the company. The seasonal nature of GAS's trade, combined with the depressed US economy, meant that it would show, as a discontinued activity, a substantial loss in Kalamazoo's interim results to January 31 1992. Accordingly, the effect on Kalamazoo's balance sheet of the disposal was expected to be about neutral.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDITORIAL STAFF AT DAILY NEWS VOTES FOR UNION;  </P> <P> MARGIN IS 114-60; GUILD SEEKS OTHER EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> Reporters, photographers, copy editors and artists at the Daily News voted  114-60 for the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild as their union representative,  according to results made public Thursday.  </P> <P> The election comes about three years after editorial employees, who have been  nonunion, first contacted the union about representing them as their bargaining  agent.  </P> <P> Jim Smith, administrative officer for the local unit of the Guild, said that  the union will continue trying to organize employees in the newspaper's  circulation, advertising, finance and marketing departments. Pressmen,  composing room employees and paper handlers at the newspaper already are  represented by other unions.  </P> <P> The Daily News, based in Woodland Hills, is owned by sports and  cable-television entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke, who paid $176 million in 1985 to  buy the newspaper from the Tribune Co. in Chicago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Circulation Figures  </P> <P> In the six months ended last Sept. 30, the newspaper's circulation averaged  170,809 daily and 197,311 on Sunday, according to numbers reported to the Audit  Bureau of Circulations. Cooke could not be reached for comment. In a prepared  statement, Daily News Editor Robert W. Burdick said: "Our employees have voted  for a union and so be it. Our goal remains to produce the very best newspaper  we can for Daily News readers and we have every intention of doing this."  </P> <P> Smith said the vote in favor of the Guild was expected and that the main issue  in the campaign was "participation in the workplace," although money also was  an important issue. He said most of the editorial employees at the newspaper  make from $550 to $650 a week. By contrast, Smith said, the minimum scale for  editorial employees with five years experience at the Long Beach  Press-Telegram, a smaller Guild-represented newspaper, is $709 a week.  </P> <P> Sidney Rosen, assistant to the regional director at the Westwood office of the  National Labor Relations Board, said that under federal law the newspaper has  until next Thursday to file any objections to the election.  </P> <P> If the Daily News does not object, he said, then NLRB officials would certify  the results, which would clear the way for bargaining to start.  </P></p>

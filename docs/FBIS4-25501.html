			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Approved outbound  investments hit US$823.4 million in the first five months of  this year, up 70 percent from the same time last year, the  Investment Commission said Friday [10 June].    The commission said that the investments were mostly  targeted  at Southeast Asian nations, especially Malaysia, Singapore and  Thailand, showing that the government's "southern strategy" and  its policy of diversification of overseas markets has borne  fruit.    Investment in Malaysia was up 730 percent from the same time  last year, while investment in Thailand and Singapore was up 111  percent and 182 percent respectively.    Investment in Indonesia was down 59 percent, the commission  said. They blamed the decline on anti-Chinese riots there  earlier this year.    Investment in Vietnam also edged downward 0.25 percent, the  commission added.    Investment in overseas financial and insurance industries  was  up 273 percent to US$379.72 million during the period to top the  list of investment targets. Investment in the wholesale and  retail sales industry jumped 778 percent from last year,  electrical and electronic products investment was up 171 percent  and investment in the transportation industry was up 479 percent  from last year, the commission said.</p>

In a statement to the public, the association warned of "the  disastrous results of the policy of extremist Albanian political  parties" in Kosovo-Metohija, manifested in the mass quitting of  jobs, schools and university. This policy has deprived a whole  generation of young Albanians of proper schooling.    On the other hand, leaders of extremist Albanian parties and  war profiteers secured a good life for themselves and their  children, usurping for themselves the benefits that belong to  all in the province. They therefore have no moral right to  speak on behalf of all Albanians, said the statement.    The separatist ethnic Albanian leadership, which advocates  Kosovo-Metohija's secession from Yugoslavia and joining it to  neighboring Albania, exerts constant pressures on its fellow  countrymen to disregard the laws of Serbia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, to leave their jobs and refuse to pay  taxes.    Succumbing to these pressures, a majority of ethnic  Albanians  boycotted the 1990, 1992 and 1993 elections.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Big-business supporters turn on Major: Peter Marsh samples the views of sceptical executives Trying hard - could do better. That is the verdict on the government's record since the general election nearly two years' ago from leading business executives who are all firm Tory supporters. Several of those questioned in the FT poll said they were worried by the lack of leadership qualities of Mr John Major, the prime minister. None said they saw any reason to shift their allegiance, while some criticised Labour for failing to make the most of the government's difficulties. The 22 questioned constitute just over half the 43 business leaders - all at that time senior executives of big companies - who signed a letter supporting the Conservatives in The Times in March 1992, a month before the election. One of the signatories - Sir Patrick Meaney, former chairman of Rank Organisation - has died. The other 20 either could not be contacted or declined to participate. Many said the government should be given credit for riding the political storms of a serious recession and for bringing down interest rates after the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, so helping recovery. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan, who organised the original letter, said he remained confident about the government. He added: 'After coming through the worst recession in over 50 years there are clear signs we are entering a period of sustainable growth accompanied by low inflation.' However, serious criticism emerged of ministers' style and their ability to convey a strong image when presenting policies in such areas as health, education, and transport. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll supermarket group, said: 'My commitment to the Tories is no less, but my respect for them has decreased. Many Conservative MPs must be wondering what they can do to win the next election and one option is to have a new leader.' Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman of the Iceland food group, said: 'Some of the government's presentation has been appalling . . . I wonder if anyone has told Mr Major he is not much good on TV.' Mr David Kendall, former chairman of paper group Bunzl, said: 'You've got to have at the helm (of the government) a winner. There's no point in having someone who is respected but looks a loser.' Others said they were frustrated at how the prime minister often lacked authority in public. Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive of Trafalgar House, said: 'The achievements of Mrs Thatcher have been diluted. The government is accident prone and the case for Mr Major (continuing in power) looks unproven.' More charitable was Lord Stockton, president of Macmillan, the publisher. He said: 'In small gatherings, Mr Major has a clear view of the big issues and does a stunning job.' But he said that in public these capabilities frequently failed to come across. While generally supportive, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, said too many ministers seemed to want a hand in the overall direction of policymaking, which stopped the government conveying its views clearly. He added: 'Mr Major should impose his authority. He suffers from being a decent kind of person who does not like stamping on people's corns.' Relatively optimistic about the prime minister was Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate and Lyle. He said: 'Sometimes in business you appoint executives who do a bloody awful job for two years and then improve. Mr Major's got time to get better.' He added that Labour's record in opposition gave him no reason to switch sides politically. Mr Peter Drew, former chairman of construction company Taylor Woodrow, said the prime minister was 'just the kind of chief executive I would want' who had taken some 'courageous' decisions, while Sir John Cuckney, chairman of Royal Insurance, said it was 'premature' to judge Mr Major. Also supportive of ministers generally was Lord Delfont, president of First Leisure. He said: 'I'm as confident of the government as when I signed the letter. There has been an unfortunate run of scandals (mainly affecting the private lives of Tory MPs) but this is the kind of thing that could happen to anyone.' Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical retailer Dixons, accused some sections of the media of waging a 'vendetta' against the government, and Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy hotels group, said the scandals were 'background noise'. He added: 'I feel happier than six months ago. I think the government is getting back on top of things and business is looking better.' Others said the government should be given credit for creating the conditions for a steady economic upturn, though many said they were worried that the tax increases due in April would hold back recovery. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, said: 'We are the only country in Europe moving out of recession and the economic indicators are promising. There is a feeling abroad that the government is no good, but I would give them a vote of confidence.' Mr Richard Jewson, former chairman of builder's merchants Meyer International, said the government had to take a large share of the responsibility for the 'parlous state' of public finances which had necessitated the steep tax increases announced in the two Budgets last year. Mr Peter Catesby, deputy chairman of the Vaux brewing group, said: 'The problem (of high borrowing) should not have arisen in the first place. The government has not been radical enough in controlling spending.' Also expressing reservations was Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman of the Sears retail chain, who said: 'The government kept sterling in the ERM almost to the point of (economic) collapse and they still haven't admitted they made a mistake.'</p>

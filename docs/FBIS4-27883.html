			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  are most likely to hold subcabinet-level talks from June 9 or 10  to find ways to improve American access to Japan's auto and auto  parts markets, a senior Japanese trade ministry official said  Friday [3 June].    Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry  minister for international affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, commerce  undersecretary, will probably meet in Tokyo for three days, said  the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), who declined to be named.    The planned talks will follow ongoing working-level auto and  auto parts negotiations that started Thursday in Washington for  a two-day run.    The coming high-level meeting is designed to set objective  criteria as a tool to measure the openness of Japan's auto  markets and as a mechanism to review progress in bilateral auto  trade, the MITI official said.    During the Okamatsu-Garten meeting, Washington will also  give  a specific response to measures on auto trade adopted by Japan  as part of its market-opening measures announced at the end of  March, the official said.    In the ongoing working-level talks in Washington, the  official said the U.S. "Highly appreciated" the Japanese  measures, which focus on voluntary industry efforts to expand  purchases of U.S.-made cars under the "cooperation approach."</p>

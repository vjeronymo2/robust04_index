			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOLLIDAY'S FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES LEAD CAPISTRANO VALLEY  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School's 37-13 victory over Servite Friday night came  down to a simple game of catch between Cougar quarterback Tony Solliday and  wide receiver Dave Poltl.  </P> <P> Solliday completed 12 of 16 passes for 134 yards and four touchdowns, including  three to Poltl, as the second-ranked Cougars won at Capistrano Valley. Solliday  threw touchdown passes of 4, 23 and 4 yards to Poltl. Solliday's other  touchdown pass was a 27-yard completion to Scott Patton.  </P> <P> Poltl finished with four catches for 36 yards.  </P> <P> "Our game is passing," Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. "We just  needed some momentum to get it going."  </P> <P> Jeremy Brion supplied that momentum. The senior free safety intercepted two  passes by Servite quarterback Scott Jones.  </P> <P> One Brion interception set up a Solliday touchdown pass to Poltl late in the  second quarter. The Cougars intercepted three of Jones' passes, including two  by Brion, who returned his last one 80 yards for a touchdown in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> "His interception at the end (of the first half) really sparked us," Patton  said. "And the 80-yard return showed what he is capable of doing."  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley relied on its defense early while it waited for the offense  to get going.  </P> <P> The Cougars took a 3-0 lead when Tomek Mikler kicked a 27-yard field goal with  10 minutes 51 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Cougars struck again later in the quarter after Brion intercepted Jones at  the Capistrano Valley 44-yard line and returned it 28 yards to the Servite 28.  </P> <P> Then Solliday went to work, completing four consecutive passes, including a  four-yard touchdown completion to Poltl with 15 seconds left in the second  quarter. Capistrano Valley led, 10-0, at halftime.  </P> <P> In the first half, Capistrano Valley's defense held Servite to 44 yards total  offense, including one yard passing. The Friars finished with 199 yards total  offense.  </P> <P> Another Servite turnover led to Capistrano Valley's first score of the second  half. Cougar linebacker Scott Newell forced a Jones fumble that was recovered  by Jon Petke at the Servite 27.  </P> <P> On the next play, Solliday hit Patton in the back of the end zone for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> Servite cut the deficit to 17-7 with 3:19 left in the third quarter when Jones  capped a five-play, 61-yard drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Michael  Hill. Jones also threw a 33-yard completion to Ken Mousseau on the drive.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley didn't let up as Solliday drove the Cougars 80 yards,  finishing with his second touchdown pass to Poltl, a 23-yarder.  </P> <P> A four-yard touchdown run by Servite's Mike Wallock with 7:36 left in the  fourth quarter made the score, 24-13. Solliday's four-yard touchdown pass to  Poltl and Brion's interception return for a touchdown rounded out the scoring.  </P></p>

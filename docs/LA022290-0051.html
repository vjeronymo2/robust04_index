			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMMONIA SPILLS INTO NEWHALL NEIGHBORHOOD  </P> <P> An estimated 8,000 gallons of a weak mixture of ammonia and water spilled from  an ARCO plant and through a neighborhood in Newhall before being capped  Wednesday morning, but there were no evacuations or injuries, the Los Angeles  County Fire Department reported.  </P> <P> The leak was reported at 9 p.m. Tuesday at the ARCO steam and electrical  cogeneration plant near the 20800 block of Placerita Canyon Road, Fire Capt.  Lynn Mohr said.  </P> <P> The liquid, which was estimated to be more than 96% water, leaked from an  ammonia holding tank that had a water hose running inside it, Mohr said. The  solution spilled over the tank and flowed down a canyon and along nearby Oak  Orchard Road and Oakcreek Avenue into the dry bed of Placerita Creek, Mohr  said.  </P> <P> The leak was halted by ARCO employees about 1 a.m. Wednesday, he said.  </P> <P> Mohr said county health authorities were notified to investigate possible  environmental damage. Santa Clarita officials said soil samples were taken from  the spill area but it had not been determined if contaminated soil would have  to be removed.  </P> <P> Though several residents called the Fire Department to report the odor of  ammonia, Mohr said, no evacuations were considered. "It was fairly weak,  probably weaker than a household cleaning solution," he said. "We chose to let  the water flow with it and dilute it."  </P> <P> Mohr said the ammonia is used in scrubbers that clean emissions from the plant.  </P></p>

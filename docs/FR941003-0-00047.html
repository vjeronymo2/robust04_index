			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Section 314.94_Content and Format of an Abbreviated Application (21 CFR 314.94) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12) contained the patent certification requirements for ANDA's. For example, under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i), an ANDA applicant would provide a patent certification with respect to each patent that claims the reference listed drug or that claims a use of the reference listed drug for which the ANDA applicant is seeking approval. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) would permit an ANDA applicant to certify that there are no relevant patents that claim the listed drug or a method of use of the listed drug. Proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii) would permit an ANDA applicant to state that the use for which the applicant is seeking approval is not covered by a patent claiming a use for the listed drug.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. One comment claimed that proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) was inconsistent with the statute because the statute only requires ANDA applicants to make certifications for listed patents rather than patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Two comments added that the suggestion regarding patent searches that FDA made in the preamble to the proposed rule was irrational and legally insupportable. One company, however, agreed that ANDA applicants should submit patent certifications with respect to all patents, including those that had not been submitted to FDA for listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule simply paraphrases the statutory language in section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act. The rule does not require ANDA applicants to conduct patent searches. If the applicant believes that no patent exists, the applicant is to submit a patent certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) that no relevant patents exist. If the applicant believes that a patent exists but that the patent owner has not filed patent information at FDA, the ANDA applicant would certify that, ``in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge,'' no patent information has been submitted (i.e., make a paragraph I certification). FDA, however, believes it would be prudent for applicants to conduct patent searches if possible. A patent search could reveal the existence of an unlisted, but valid, patent and thus prevent an unnecessary expenditure of resources by applicants and FDA on a product that might not be marketable. A patent search might also enable ANDA applicants to avoid unnecessary patent infringement litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41. One comment suggested that FDA publish all patent information, including descriptions of the patents and patent numbers, in the Orange Book.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Orange Book already contains an addendum listing both patent and exclusivity information. This section provides patent numbers and patent expiration dates as well as exclusivity codes and expiration dates. In addition, for a use patent, FDA includes in the Orange Book a code identifying the indication covered by the patent. As for patent descriptions, FDA lacks the expertise to review and summarize patents and individual patent claims and does not believe that expanding the Orange Book to include patent descriptions would be an efficient use of FDA resources. However, persons who wish to obtain a synopsis of a particular patent can consult the Official Gazette for Patents, which is published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Official Gazette for Patents contains short descriptions of patents and is publicly available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42. One comment asserted that FDA should list patents that claim drug products for which the patent owner is not seeking or has not obtained approval. The comment explained that the statute requires NDA holders and applicants to submit information on ``any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application'' (section 505(b)(1) of the act). The comment, citing &sect;314.50(d)(1), claimed that ``drug'' means the active ingredient while ``drug product'' denotes a marketed product composed of active and inactive ingredients. Thus, because section 505(b)(1) of the act uses the term ``drug,'' the comment continued, any patent that claims the active ingredient is a patent that claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application and should be listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA disagrees with the comment's interpretation of section 505(b)(1) of the act. The statutory provision states that patent information is to be filed on patents that claim the drug ``for which the applicant submitted the application.'' Similarly, the House Report accompanying the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act indicates that the patent information to be filed ``includes the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in the NDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or which claims  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a method of using such drug  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess. 31&hyph;32 (1984) (emphasis added). Thus, both the statute and its legislative history reveal that Congress intended the term ``drug'' to mean ``drug product'' rather than ``active ingredient'' because NDA's are granted only for drug products and not for active ingredients. FDA's interpretation of this provision has been upheld by a United States magistrate in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pfizer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. HM&hyph;88&hyph;1019, slip op. at 10&hyph;13 (D. Md. October 2, 1989) and adopted by a Federal district court (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pfizer, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Food and Drug Administration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 753 F.Supp. 171 (D. Md. 1990)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 43. Several comments sought clarification regarding the interaction between proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v), 180-day exclusivity periods under section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, and licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because patent licensees are subject to 180-day exclusivity that has been granted to another applicant, the only instance in which proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) would apply would be where a patent licensee would seek to have an effective approval of its ANDA or 505(b)(2) application within 45 days of its receipt or filing (because the patent holder has 45 days to file a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant making a paragraph IV certification). Because the agency does not anticipate approving an ANDA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 505(b)(2) application in 45 days, FDA, on its own initiative, removed the provisions in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) and &sect;314.107(b)(1)(iv) related to consent by a patent owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 44. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii), which would require ANDA applicants to certify that there are no relevant patents that claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. One comment said that ANDA applicants should only be required to certify that no listed patents claim the listed drug referred to in the ANDA. The second comment suggested deleting the provision and revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) so ANDA applicants would certify that no patent information had been filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to accept the comments. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, an applicant makes a patent certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) if ``in the applicant's opinion and to the best of its knowledge, no relevant patents claim the listed drug or a method of using the listed drug'' (54 FR 28872 at 28885). The applicant makes the patent certifications under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i) when it is aware of or believes that a patent covers the listed drug. (Id.) FDA believes that &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) will enable FDA to ensure that each applicant has complied with the patent certification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

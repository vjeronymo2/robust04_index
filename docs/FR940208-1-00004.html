			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Because of the scope of the situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes that an amendment to the regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers receive the assistance they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing of this amendment will reduce the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships on those who have already suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community financial recovery from these disasters. The proposal to require crop insurance on the coming year's crop as a condition of making EM loans is necessary to protect the borrower and the Government. The requirement and its exceptions, however, will not delay the making or reduce the number of EM loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The making, supervision, and servicing of farm loans to FmHA borrowers is governed primarily by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT) (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.). In particular, 7 U.S.C. 1970 provides that the Secretary, and through delegation FmHA, shall extend emergency loans ``to any applicant seeking assistance based on production losses if the applicant shows that a single enterprise which constitutes a basic part of the applicant's farming, ranching, or aquaculture operation has sustained at least a 30 per centum loss of normal per acre or per animal production,'' or a lesser per centum as determined by FmHA, as a result of the disaster and other eligibility criteria are met. Under the statute, FmHA also must make production loss loans based on 80 per centum, or such greater per centum as determined by FmHA, of the total actual production loss sustained by the eligible applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing emergency (EM) loan regulations state that all financial disaster assistance/compensation will be considered in determining the applicant's eligibility for EM assistance and again in calculating the maximum amount of loss loan entitlement. Once eligibility is established, then all single enterprises showing a production loss are considered in the calculation to determine the maximum loss loan entitlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has concluded that modifications to the current provisions are in order. In the 13 years (since 2/13/80) that FmHA has employed the present calculation for determining eligibility, there have been numerous instances where producers would have suffered qualifying losses yet were deemed ineligible for an emergency loss loan only because the dollar loss was reduced by the amount of disaster related assistance/compensation so that the 30 percent loss level was not reached. Based on this experience, it is the Agency's opinion that the ability of FmHA to carry out the underlying intent of the program_to provide loans to farmers who have suffered losses due to natural disasters and who cannot obtain credit from private sources_has been seriously hindered. For this reason, the Agency has concluded that it can best serve these farmers, and thereby meet the goals of the program, by revising its regulations as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.163, by revising the applicant eligibility calculation to consider only the dollar loss of a single enterprise based on the difference in income between the disaster year and the normal year. Disaster related assistance/compensation would not be considered in the eligibility calculation. The maximum loss loan entitlement, however, still would be the sum of production losses to all enterprises less any disaster related assistance/compensation and costs not incurred. This change is necessary to respond to the extreme financial stress of many farmers affected by repetitive natural disasters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By changing the EM loan eligibility calculation, more applicants will be permitted to qualify for loan assistance. This revision to the regulation complies with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, prohibiting the duplication of Federal disaster benefits. The amount of the individual EM loss loan entitlement will continue to be reduced by the amount of any disaster related assistance or compensation received or to be received by the applicant. The Agency considered limited legislative history related to EM loan legislation (Pub. L. 94&hyph;68, August 5, 1975) which suggested that a person who had Federal crop insurance which covered a portion of the disaster loss might become ineligible by not meeting the 20 percent damage test (now 30 percent). The legislative history, however, was found unpersuasive and insufficient to require the Agency to continue its practice of considering other disaster benefits at the point of EM eligibility when not specifically required by statute. The Agency proposes these changes with the belief that more farmers in need will be assisted and a prudent loan making program will be preserved within statutory constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also proposes to amend &sect;1945.169 by requiring applicants to purchase multi-peril crop insurance when receiving EM loan assistance. CONACT section 321(b) states that an applicant shall be ineligible for EM loan assistance for crop losses to an annual crop planted or harvested after December 31, 1986, if crop insurance was available to the applicant under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. However, the Disaster Assistance Acts of 1988 and 1989; the Food Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (FACT Act) of 1990; the Dire Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1991; and the Supplemental Appropriations, Transfers and Recessions Act of 1992 waived this crop insurance requirement for losses to annual crops planted for harvest in years 1988&hyph;1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Central Electoral Commission of the Chechen  Republic has described the proposal by Russia's Central  Electoral Commission that Chechnya should hold State Duma  elections as a fresh ultimatum to Chechnya, the ANI agency  reports. Russia has not abandoned its gendarme methods. It is  setting a deadline for the Chechen state to wind itself up by 13  March 1994, the statement by the Central Electoral Commission of  the Chechen Republic says. All this, notes Groznyy's  Chechenpress agency, complicates relations between Chechnya and  Russia.</p>

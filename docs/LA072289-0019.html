			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 9,000 PHONES TEMPORARILY DISCONNECTED IN ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> A construction firm digging trenches for new phone cables damaged existing  phone lines in Palmdale Friday, disrupting service to about 9,000 customers in  the Littlerock and Lake Los Angeles communities of the eastern Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> The outage began about 10 a.m. and affected phones with the 261 and 264  prefixes in the Lake Los Angeles area and the 944 prefix in Littlerock,  officials said.  </P> <P> Customers did not lose complete service, but were unable to call outside of  those prefix areas or receive calls from outside those areas, Pacific Bell  spokeswoman Charlene Baldwin said. Pacific Bell repair crews had restored 90%  service by 4 p.m., Baldwin said.  </P> <P> Emergency calls to 911 were rerouted to a switching station, where a Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputy stood by with a radio to handle emergency  calls. The deputy had received only one 911 call as of 4:30 p.m., sheriff's  officials said, and no other problems resulting from the outage had been  reported.  </P> <P> Baldwin refused to identify the private construction company whose workers  caused the outage at 47th Street and Palmdale Boulevard in Palmdale, saying the  telephone company would investigate the incident.  </P> <P> "They were doing excavation in order to lay conduit for new underground  cables," she said. "They hit our cable and severed part of it."  </P> <P> A crew of about 15 was working to repair the damage, she said. Although she  predicted full restoration of service by early evening Friday, Baldwin said  there might be temporary service disruptions after that before all repairs are  completed.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- Yesterday's  decision of the Parliament, according to which 24 August was  declared the day of liberation, is an attempt to present events  from the point of view of those who call themselves liberators,  declared to BASA Alexandru Mosanu, leader of the Parliamentary  Block of Peasants and Intellectuals. In Mosanu's opinion, the  political aim of this decision was to induce more stress into  the situation and to rehabilitate the communist occupational  regime. The leader of the faction considers that the  parliamentary majority "realizes the interests of those who keep  an army of occupation on Moldovan territory." Characterizing  the political situation in the republic, Mosanu stated that  efforts are being made to reannex Moldova to the Russian Empire.  "In this context, Parliament's decision yesterday is an attempt  to falsify history," said Mosanu.</p>

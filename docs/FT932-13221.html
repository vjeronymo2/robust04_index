			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK civil servant powerless to halt EBRD spree: ODA man supervising building was unable to prevent lavish spending on bank's London headquarters A BRITISH civil servant 'lived a nightmare' last year as he watched the lavish spending on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's London headquarters, an official close to the affair said last night. Mr Nicholas Bailey, a member of the bank's building committee and an official at the Overseas Development Administration, was unable to halt the spending of millions of pounds on replacing marble in its new head office, redesigning the interiors of its lifts and installing curved wooden doors. An official said Mr Bailey had no power to prevent the lavish spending, because the bank's board had approved the building budget and the UK government's grant of Pounds 40m for the EBRD's buildings was given to the bank without any conditions attached. Because the grant had been given, Mr Bailey was made a member of the EBRD's building committee, set up to supervise work on the Pounds 55.5m fitting out of its new headquarters at Exchange Square in the City of London. No public official from any of the other 55 countries or agencies which own the bank was on the committee. The committee was chaired by Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the EBRD's director of the budget and director of the cabinet of Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president. At the end of 1991, the British government was involved in fixing the original budget for the building at Pounds 53m. The EBRD set this budget having employed the chartered surveyors, Gardiner and Theobald, as cost consultants. The ODA scrutinised the budget in conjunction with a retired architect, Mr Alec Reilly, with whom it had worked before. It did not believe the original specification for the building was too luxurious. An official said the original plan was 'high quality, somewhere between normal UK government standards and the more luxurious offices normally occupied by international financial institutions'. Chartered surveyors say the budget was generous compared to the fitting out costs of many UK buildings. The cost is equivalent to around Pounds 70,000 for each of the EBRD's 750 employees, higher than for most City offices. But the budget had to be approved by the board's directors, which represent the countries and international agencies which own the bank. Directors received only 'sketchy information' on the capital budget, said a director, who regrets that he and his colleagues were not more forceful in asking for more information. 'In some respects, we could have done our job better,' he said. Information on the building costs is contained in the EBRD's 1992 70-page budget document. There is a one paragraph reference to the fitting out: 'An allocation of Pounds 53m has been made in the budget based on the preliminary view of the quantity surveyor requested to estimate the cost of the fitting out works, including all the professional fees.' Directors say they received no other documentary information on the building costs of any substance. However at board meetings on 16 and 17 December 1991, they approved the budget. The British government says it insisted that contracts for the building work be awarded on the basis of normal procedures followed by publicly-owned institutions of competitive tendering. These are the procurement procedures which the EBRD insists that its customers in the public sector of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union also follow on infrastructure projects. However, in the appointment of French firm Berthet &amp; Pochy as leading architects, there was no open competition, though the contractor on the project, Bovis, did talk to four other architects practices before Berthet was chosen. Berthet &amp; Pochy had started to draw up plans for the building design before they were awarded the contract, said a UK government official. The EBRD wanted Berthet to be appointed, the official said. 'Architects are often the choice of the client,' he said. He added that the UK government 'looked at the firm's credentials' and became convinced it could 'do the job'. Three years ago Mr Attali wrote the preface to a book on the work of Berthet &amp; Pochy. Because Berthet had already done design work and a public competition would take at least two months, the government agreed that Berthet could be appointed as the leading designer on the project. When building began, the EBRD discovered that the costs of certain materials were lower than it had anticipated in the budget. The savings were around Pounds 5m. But rather than save the money, the building sub-committee decided to make the fittings and furnishings more luxurious. The UK government is understood to have been alarmed when it learned of the 'excesses', according to an official, but felt it could not intervene, since the board had approved the budget. An official listed several departures from the original specification, including the shadowless carpet, specially designed desks, replacing the lift interiors, replacing the original marble in the building and installing a mural. In the event, the spending got out of hand. Around the beginning of this year the EBRD had to ask its directors to increase the building budget to Pounds 55.5m. The British government sent a letter warning that spending must now be more tightly controlled. But in the words of the official, the horse had already bolted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The week of June 7-11 saw  share prices at the Korean stock exchange fluctuate and plummet  in general over the North Korean nuclear standoff.    During the week, the leading composite stock price index  plunged 11.65 points from 930.26 on June 4 to 918.61 on Saturday.    The week started with a crash, influenced strongly by the  worsening nuclear issue.    The index was down 8.54 points on Tuesday from the weekend  (Monday being a holiday). The plunge was also due to ebbing  player deposits.    On the following day, Wednesday, there was a sharp rebound  following two straight days of decline. The index jumped 11.30  points over the previous day to close at 933.02    Investors showed optimism as they thought much of the  nuclear  dispute's impact had already been absorbed.    The rise continued on Thursday when the index picked up 2.77  points. Once during the day it soared 7.57 points on rumors  that at the Hong kong stock exchange, players preferred  Korea-related issues in the expectation of an early resolution  to the nuclear question.    The surge did not last long, however, as the index plunged  on  Friday in a wave of selling by wary players. A brake applied by  the stock exchange to the concentrated buying of specific issues  by institutional investors also contributed to the decline.    On Saturday, the index crashed 10.33 points on reports that  the International Atomic Energy Agency was adopting sanctions  against North Korea.    During the week, 144.44 million shares or 28.89 million  shares a day changed hands. During the previous week, volume  was 175.05 million shares.    Institutional investors bought more than they sold in the  week. Their buying amounted to 857.8 billion won and selling to  725.3 billion won, representing 27.6 and 23.3 percent,  respectively, of the total.    Players' deposits gained by 43.7 billion won or 1.4 percent  in the week ending June 9, from 3,041.6 billion won on June 2 to  3,085.3 billion won.    Market analysts said the market would be favorably affected  by the continuing business recovery, the stability of market  funds and expected heavy buying by institutional investors.    Unfavorable factors facing the market would include the  lingering nuclear question, signs of labor unrest and the recent  trend toward increases in international raw material prices and  monetary interest, the analysts said.</p>

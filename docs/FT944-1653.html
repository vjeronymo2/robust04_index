			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Chances look better for a holiday rally - New York Ever since the Federal Reserve last raised interest rates in November the market has zig-zagged as investors tried to guess whether the it would raise rates again in December. This week they should produce an answer after the Fed's open market committee meeting holds its final meeting of the year tomorrow. It was not until the central bank boosted interest rates by 75 basis points on November 15 that the market woke up to the reality that the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, meant business when he promised to wring inflationary pressures out of the economy. The following week, stocks took a nose-dive as strong economic data suggested to market players that earnings might be battered by another rate increase by the year-end. Also that week, the yield curve representing the spread between two-year notes and the long bond began to flatten, indicating that bond market players expected an economic slowdown. Last week, however, sentiment began to shift as relatively tame increases in consumer and producer price indices suggested that the Fed might wait to see the full effects of this year's six increases before undertaking more tightening. The yield curve, which had tightened to 13 basis points, spread back out to 28 points by the end of the week and the Dow recovered 3 per cent of its value. Stocks typically get a boost at the end of the year, but until last week analysts were sceptical about whether the market could stage its traditional holiday rally. Now investors will be watching to see if the market's recovery was due to fundamental changes in sentiment or technical factors surrounding last Friday's 'triple-witching hour', when options and futures on stock indices expired together in 60 minutes of trading. Mr David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, believes it was a bit of both. 'The consumer and producer price data were good and we got put into overdrive by options,' he says. Data on November durable goods orders due out on Friday should give investors an indication of Fed policy for the coming year, but reaction may be muted as Friday is the last day of trading before Christmas and volumes are expected to be low. A consensus of economists expects orders to increase by about 1.4 per cent after a 1.0 per cent decrease in October. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will release its final GDP figure for the third quarter, but the number is not expected to have much of an effect as investors have already seen two preliminary figures. At the end of November, third-quarter GDP growth was estimated to be 3.9 per cent, and analysts do not expect any significant change.</p>

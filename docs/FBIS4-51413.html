			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region in the remote northwestern part of China  promises China's oil and mineral future.    With exciting discoveries being made one after another in  the  Tarim Basin, the region is providing high hopes for China's oil  future, at a time when the nation has become a net oil importer.    Over the past five years surveyors have found nine oilfields  and 34 oil structures in the basin. The biggest discovery is a  100-million-ton oilfield in the middle of the basin.    Experts estimate the basin's total reserves of oil and  natural gas at 18 billion tons, about one fifth of the nation's  total reserves.    Last year the basin produced 1.6 million tons of crude oil,  ranking 11th in the country's top oilfields list. The  authorities expect that the basin's oil production will reach  2.1 million tons this year, and five million tons by the end of  1996.    In another development, the region's gold production has  climbed from the second from the bottom to the ninth among all  the Chinese regions.    With gold deposits found in more than half of the region's  80  counties and cities, local sources said, the gold rush reminds  people of that of the California in the last century.    Xinjiang is also rich in copper, a metal that is in short  supply in China. The potential reserves are estimated at more  than 10 million tons. Some experts predict that the Axili  Copper Mine at the foot of the Altay Mountains will soon become  the second-largest in China, after the Tongxing Mine in Jiangxi  Province.    Figures released by the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and  Mining  show that the region boasts reserves of 43 kinds of minerals,  including oil, natural gas, gold, coal, copper, salt, precious  stones and rare metals.</p>

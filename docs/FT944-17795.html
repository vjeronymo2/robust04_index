			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China hopes to raise Pounds 15m in flotation Churchill China, the third Staffordshire-based china company to float this year, is expecting 1994 profits to exceed the record level of 1991. The pathfinder prospectus yesterday forecast pre-tax profits, before bonuses to directors, of Pounds 3.6m for the year to December 31. This would be ahead of last year's Pounds 2.9m, struck on turnover of Pounds 36m, and 1991's Pounds 3.23m on sales of Pounds 31.5m. The company, which celebrates its bicentenary next year, is owned by the Roper family. It is aiming to raise Pounds 15m via a placing. About two-thirds of the money will go to the three Roper brothers on the board, their families and family trusts, while Pounds 5m will be used as part of an investment programme to improve capacity and quality. 'In the next five years investment in the company will be double the investment we undertook in the previous five years,' said Mr Stephen Roper, chief executive. The Roper family, which has run the company since 1922, will own about 55 per cent of the company after the placing. In addition to providing funds for investment, the group, which operates tableware, hotelware and fine china divisions, expects the expanded shareholder base to provide a market for existing shareholders and opportunities for employees to invest. Mr Roper described 1991 as an exceptional year, with exports to continental Europe particularly strong. Recession in Germany and Spain knocked profits back in 1992, but the upturn in business seen in 1993 had continued this year. Hoare Govett is both sponsor and broker.</p>

The Kansas City Corporation Commission required the operator to perform periodic leakage surveys of all customer-owned service lines and to repair or replace all lines round to be leaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Mandate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 115(a) of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the Act, Pub.

RSPA invites public comment on (1) Whether customer-owned service lines occur in petroleum gas systems subject to &sect;192.11 and (2) If so, whether the petroleum gas systems have been properly installed and periodically maintained. Commenters are requested to support their responses with leak and incident data that includes information on personal injuries, deaths, property and environmental damages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> AGA Petition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Gas Association (AGA) has petitioned RSPA to issue immediately a proposed rule to establish the notification regulations mandated in section 115 of the Act (P&hyph;50, September 1, 1993). In its petition, AGA expresses concern that, lacking federal guidance, state and local authorities may move forward and adopt notification requirements that could make compliance with federal regulations difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AGA has requested RSPA to incorporate the following language to satisfy the notification requirements for operations of customer-owned service lines:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each operator meeting the applicability requirements of paragraph (c) (of this section) shall provide notification to customers covering the maintenance of customer-owned lines.

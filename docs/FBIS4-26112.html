			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The United States  reiterated today that it will resume talks with the Democratic  Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) if the DPRK is ready to freeze  its nuclear program.    The U.S. Administration will discuss the DPRK's position  with  U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who just ended his private  visit to the DPRK today, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee  Myers said in a statement.    It was reported that the DPRK told Carter it will agree to  allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors  to stay in the DPRK and to replace its present nuclear program  with a new light water reactor technology.    President Bill Clinton said Thursday [16 Jun] if this  development means that the DPRK "is genuinely and verifiably  prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on", then  the U.S. will be willing to resume high-level talks with the  DPRK.    Myers said that preliminary reports on Carter's visit  "present the possibility that the North Koreans may be prepared  to make commitments and take actions" that would pave the way  for a new round of talks.    The U.S. would also seek confirmation through "diplomatic  channels" on the DPRK's position, she added.    "If this meaning of the message is clearly confirmed through  those channels, and we hope it will be, we would be prepared to  enter a third round of talks to resolve the outstanding issues  between North Korea and the international community," Myers said.    But she also said that "we are continuing to consult on a  sanctions resolution at the U.N. Security Council."</p>

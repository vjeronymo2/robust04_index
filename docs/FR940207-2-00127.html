The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a NYSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the Exchange's established uniform options listing standards. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the NYSE must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing without an agreement. Second, the NYSE's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing under the NYSE rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float'' of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR Approval Order requires the NYSE to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31528 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57256 (December 3, 1992) (``ADR Approval Order''). A comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement provides, among other things, for the exchange of market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchaser or seller of the securities traded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Furthermore, the NYSE options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other applicable requirements of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

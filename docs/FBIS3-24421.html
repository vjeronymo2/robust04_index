			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Stakhov: "They Promise That Businessmen </F> Will Not Be Shot in Uzbekistan, and That They Will Even Make a  Good Living"]    [Text] Half a year ago the president of a Western company,  who made almost weekly visits to Moscow and had even opened an  office here, decided to stop doing business in Russia. "Working  here is inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous," he explained  his decision tersely, although he had been making great plans  just two years ago and had even managed to act on some of them.  His euphoria soon passed, however, after it had been throttled  by Russian irresponsibility.    Now he sees Moscow as only a transfer point--going from  Sheremetyevo-2 to Sheremetyevo-1, and from there to Almaty, and  then back home by the same route in reverse. In Kazakhstan he  found what he could not find in Russia: a reliable and secure  foundation for normal business activity. I would not exclude the  possibility that he and his Western colleagues will now begin  buying tickets to Tashkent as well. The harsh political climate  in Uzbekistan unexpectedly turned out to be a favorable  atmosphere for business. Unprecedented measures are being taken  in Tashkent to carry out economic reforms, protect private  property, develop business, and attract foreign investments on a  broad scale.    President I. Karimov did what Moscow had tried and failed to  do in the reverse order: He began by strengthening his political  base and then opened the door to the market economy while  keeping his finger "on the pulse." When Yu. Abdullayev,  Uzbekistan's ambassador in Moscow, was asked what had made this  possible, his reply was brief and to the point: "The time was  right."    Judging by the edict the president of Uzbekistan issued on  this matter, the mechanism of the process itself, which should  be fine-tuned by various agencies in the next month (a special  interdepartmental council was established to coordinate their  work), should assign priority to the legal protection of  non-governmental property, to administrative penalties and  criminal liability for violations of the property rights of  citizens, and to privileges, credits, and state guarantees for  private owners within the limits specified by the Constitution  of Uzbekistan. This means that the state will be responsible for  securing a civilized business climate for those who are  occasionally shot in Russia with the complete connivance or  impotence of government officials (to which end the criminal and  civil codes and other legal instruments in Uzbekistan will be  supplemented and revised).    Apparently, guarantees of this kind are essential before a  person can start doing business within the territory of the  former Union and even start taking an interest in economic  conditions. Tashkent is letting the market faucet run at almost  full blast. Joint-stock companies of the closed type, for  example, are to be "opened up." Republic commercial exchanges  will sell state property slated for privatization and sell stock  in enterprises undergoing this process. Facilities in the trade  and service sector and parcels of land may be acquired as  private property in competitive bidding sessions. Furthermore,  the bidder will not even be required to declare the source of  the funds used for the acquisition of property.    Existing bureaucratic obstacles in the licensing procedure  will be eliminated to stimulate business activity. Permits for  various types of business activity will be issued by seven  different agencies, including the Ministry of Health and the  Ministry of Public Education. There will be no restrictions on  the amount of foreign currency brought into the country or taken  out of the country by citizens of Uzbekistan and by  foreigners--unless, obviously, some aspect of the transfer is  against republic law.    The formation of joint ventures for the production of  consumer goods will also be convenient in Uzbekistan. If the  foreign share of the capital stock of these joint ventures  exceeds 50 percent, they will be exempt from the payment of  taxes on foreign currency receipts and from the obligatory sale  of part of the foreign currency to the republic Central Bank for  the first five years.    Officials in Tashkent, in contrast to those in Moscow, felt  it would be counterproductive to "shelter" local producers with  high import duties and thereby strip the domestic consumer  market bare. For this reason, customs duties on all but a few  types of goods will not be charged until 1 July 1995. In  addition, there are some export quotas, especially on  foodstuffs. Customs duties on exports will range from 5 percent  of the contract cost (for cotton fiber or raw silk, for example)  to 50 percent (mixed feeds, table salt, and matches) and 100  percent (antiques of cultural value).    These rates are temporary, of course, and are certain to be  reviewed after the improvement of conditions in the food supply  and several other spheres.    One more item on the list of measures connected with  economic  reform is extremely important in the establishment of a free  market. It concerns the host of bureaucrats who are smothering  the businessmen in Russia. This is why the edict specifically  stipulates (and we can only hope that this is not a mere  declaration) that any kind of interference in the finances and  management of enterprises, establishments, and organizations,  irrespective of their property status, by the heads of  administrations and superior administrative bodies will not be  tolerated, and neither will the creation of various types of  extra-budgetary funds in rayons and cities with deductions from  the income of enterprises, establishments, and so forth.    The innovations in Tashkent did not escape the notice of the  West or the East. They are certain to influence economic  processes in other Central Asian republics, where Tashkent would  like to consolidate its influence, with the energetic  encouragement of some rich Muslim countries, primarily Saudi  Arabia. Karimov's recent trip to Turkey was no coincidence. We  can assume that the first investments will begin flowing into  Uzbekistan from Turkey. Karimov got his start in politics, but  now he wants to win economic victories as well.</p>

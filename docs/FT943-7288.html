			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Personal View: UK needed at the heart of Europe Recent events in Europe - from the argument over the successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission to the fate of war-torn Bosnia - have highlighted the difficult evolution of relations between the continent's nation states. There is a growing tendency to form alliances between European Union members on the basis of national interests. Germany and the UK are promoting deregulation. UK foreign minister Mr Douglas Hurd and his French counterpart Mr Alain Juppe have taken the lead in trying to find solutions for Bosnia. Mr John Major and Mr Silvio Berlusconi have compared notes on European policy. And there is always Franco-German co-operation, said to be the motor of European integration. As in any community, this tendency for shifting alliances within the EU can be healthy - as long as there is a basic consensus within the EU on objectives. In these times of political and economic reorientation it is of paramount importance for the EU to maintain this consensus and develop it further. It is reassuring to see the UK playing an active part in this process - after a period of concern that its position could become increasingly defensive. For industry it is encouraging to note that the UK government has identified the search for measures to establish a competitive framework for European companies as one of its priorities. Deregulation, dismantling the bureaucracy and privatisation in key sectors, such as energy and telecommunications, are in our mutual interest, be it on a national level or in Brussels. Here we have classic British-German co-operation, as in the attempt by the two countries to find strict criteria for subsidiarity within the EU. The principle of subsidiarity is basic to the functioning of markets and - in a broader sense - for democracy, as we in Germany know from experience. But we must also realise that there are limits to subsidiarity in any community, particularly in areas that are crucial to industry, such as environmental policy or export controls on weapons and the technology of mass destruction. The UK has decided to opt out of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. It seems doubtful that this decision is really in the interests of the country, and of its industry in particular. We cannot avoid a discussion with other EU countries on social policies, as is illustrated by the recent debate on the misconceived works council directive. It is always better to try to influence decisions that may have consequences for British industry than just to stand aside. Recently, the Confederation of British Industry presented its business agenda for Europe. German industry is in line with most of the CBI's priorities. We underline the importance of the completion of the single market as a big achievement and the linchpin of the EU. We also agree with the CBI's proposition that Europe's future cannot simply rest on free trade or the single market. Because our industries are increasingly global, we know that our home base, the EU, is central to our competitiveness. Economic convergence cannot be achieved simply through macroeconomic policies and should not be hastily arranged for political reasons. Stability, predictability and favourable conditions throughout the Union - in monetary policy, interest rates and exchange rates - are of great importance for our companies. The Maastricht process is far from perfect, but it is a credible attempt to take the Union forward. Economic and monetary instruments should not be misused to promote policy objectives that would not otherwise be implemented. But would it not be in the interest of our companies if the single market were complemented by a European monetary union - provided, of course, that monetary stability is guaranteed? German-based companies are increasingly adopting European strategies and even identities. They are already pursuing their own vision of a united Europe. Various national interests could get in their way, as politics in Europe is trailing far behind. It is in the interest of European industry to strengthen - and to deepen - co-operation, be it economic and monetary policy, foreign and international security policy, or the co-ordination of internal policies such as crime control. It is also in the interest of European companies to develop a trans-European infrastructure. This is true for information technologies which are at the heart of our future competitiveness. We must think beyond national borders and establish new European structures vigorously. Equally important is an improved transport network. Though the UK has no land link with the rest of the continent, this geographical insularity should not detract from its interest in a modern infrastructure that would benefit both continental and UK distributors. We should be realistic about what can be achieved in the process of integration and how serious the temptations for misguided quick fixes are. This is particularly true for the European monetary union which has so far not been properly thought out and suffers from an ambitious, possibly unrealistic schedule. But there is no reason to disbelieve that one day the UK, along with Germany and others, will be part of a monetary union. We must be careful not to follow obsolete concepts of national interests and shifting alliances between nation states. This is a challenge for all, but a particular one for those who consider themselves the great architects of Europe. The UK should be among them.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun -- Diplomatic sources have reported  that early this morning a group of 16 Cubans used a truck to  force their way into the German Embassy in Havana to seek  political asylum.    The source reported that at 0915 GMT, the group, which  includes women and children, crashed the truck in which they  were traveling against the iron gate at the entrance of the  embassy, opening it, and entering the diplomatic grounds, where  they requested political asylum.    The German Embassy is in the Miramar neighborhood (in west  Havana), a few hundred meters from the Belgian ambassador's  residence, which has been occupied since 28 May by 118 Cubans  who have requested political asylum to leave Cuba.    German Embassy officials consulted by telephone have refused  to comment on the matter and have asked journalists to contact  the German Foreign Relations Minister in Bonn.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1507 GMT on 13 June reports that a  total of 21 Cubans -- three women and 18 men -- took refuge on  Monday at the German Embassy in Havana, according to the German  Foreign Ministry in Bonn.]</p>

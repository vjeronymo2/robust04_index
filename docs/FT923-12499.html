			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 2p premium in MFI dealings Shares in MFI Furniture Group ended their first day's dealings at 117p, a premium of 2p to the issue price. The flotation, which valued the company at Pounds 669m, saw applications for only 44 per cent of its public offer, which comprised 137m shares. However, another 410m shares were placed. Mr David Barclay, of County NatWest, the bank sponsoring the issue, said the lack of retail interest in flotations at present meant that issues were effectively placings with aclawback facility for non-institutional investors. The Stock Exchange insists that at least 25 per cent of the shares sold in a flotation above a certain size be offered to the public.</p>

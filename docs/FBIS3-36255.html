			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Excerpts] Tokyo, 3 Feb -- Colonel General Andrey  Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian border troops, who  is at present in Tokyo, today showed Russian journalists a video  recorded by Russian border troops. It clearly shows about 10  Japanese fishing vessels out of a total of 130 fishing vessels  which violated the Russian state border on 21 January this year.  [passage omitted]    The video made by the Russian border troops left no doubts  about the authenticity of the fact that the Japanese fishermen  violated the Russian Federation state border. The video, made  with the help of special equipment from a border troops'  helicopter, clearly shows the registeration numbers and names of  the vessels, in particular vessels with the numbers  "H-K-2-20234" and "H-K-2-19082," and the schooners "Kosio-maru,"  "Tayio-maru," and "Nogisinko-maru." The video clearly shows the  crews of two vessels covering the numbers of their schooners  with improvised means in order to prevent the Russian border  troops from recording the numbers.    Andrey Nikolayev pointed out in an interview with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent that he is ready to hand over the video  to the Japanese officials, including the leadership of the  Directorate for Security at Sea, if he receives such a request.  "If there is no such request then we will hand over the video  to Russian Television on arrival in Moscow," he said.    It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent that  during the first, in Russian-Japanese relations, talks held  today between the commander in chief of the Russian border  troops and representatives of the Directorate for Security at  Sea, the Japanese side was informed that the Russian border  troops have a video which proves the violation of the Russian  Federation border on 21 January by Japanese fishing vessels.  Yet the Japanese border troops failed to ask for the video.    It remains completely unknown what other issues were  discussed at Andrey Nikolayev's meeting with his Japanese  colleagues. Informed sources have told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the Japanese side insisted that there should  be total confidentiality at the talks and that their contents  should not be made public. According to sources, this is  connected with the fact that Japan's attitude toward direct  contacts with Russian border troops -- a country with which  Japan still does not have a peace treaty, and that means no  state border -- remains sufficiently painfully sensitive.

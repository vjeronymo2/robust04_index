In a speech marking the Exim Bank's official opening, Mr  Chuan said the bank would provide financial services to the  export sector, particularly those services not yet offered by  other financial institutions. These could include medium- and  long-term financing for some specific export products, export  insurance and guarantees. New and small exporters in particular  stand to benefit from the expanded services and additional  sources of working capital.    The Premier said the insurance service would increase  exporters' confidence in expanding their markets. [passage  omitted]    The Government believes that on any issues Thailand's  trading  partners consider unfair, Thailand must listen and address them  appropriately, the Premier said.    "But we will not give in to unreasonable demands from any  particular countries. Therefore any concessions we make will be  in agreement with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade."    By following this line, Thailand has left the Priority  Foreign Country list and is now on a Priority Watch List. Under  the latter, Washington cannot retaliate promptly; the worst it  could do is return Thailand to PFC status, Mr Chuan said.    Commenting on the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, he  said  the Government realises the importance of international trade  regulations and the need for a central agency. Such an agency,  he said, can be a haven for small countries such as Thailand in  international trade negotiations. "Now that the GATT negotiation  is complete the Government is determined to follow the GATT  agreement closely. We will strictly abide by the rules and  demand the same thing from other countries." [passage omitted]  "Although we try to avoid any adverse consequences, sometimes we  have to make sacrifices on some issues or else our trading  partners can use it as an excuse to make trade retaliations  which will cost us more." [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Chuan recalled that when he attended the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation group summit in Seattle last  November, last year, he was determined to show the world that  Thailand believed in the spirit of economic cooperation among  Asia-Pacific countries on technology transfer, personnel  development and investment in the region. The Government is also  firmly committed to the success of AFTA the ASEAN Free Trade  Area, he said.    "We will not only pursue the policy of the preceding  governments but will speed up the procedures so that AFTA can  accomplish its objectives sooner. Moreover we will increase the  number of products listed in AFTA cooperation, which we believe  other member countries will agree with." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / 'Shadow toll' road plan to be announced Details of the first road schemes to be financed and built by the private sector in return for the payment of 'shadow tolls' by the government are expected to be announced today. Under this initiative motorists will not pay tolls - the companies which build and manage the roads will be paid by the government according to the number of vehicles which use them. Companies will design new sections of road, ensure that they are maintained to a set standard and even arrange to clear snow. The government's aim is to move to a system of real tolls, with motorists paying directly for the use of motorways. It is testing electronic tolling systems with the aim of introducing motorway charging after 1998. The British Road Federation said a 10-mile link-road between the M1 and the A1 near Leeds was expected to be among the first road contracts let on the basis of 'design, build, finance and operate'. The road is expected to cost Pounds 117m and would remove 8,000 heavy trucks a day from Leeds city centre. Other likely schemes identified by the federation include the M1/M62 interchange at Lofthouse near Leeds, costing Pounds 31m, and the upgrading of sections of the A1(M) between Hook Moor and Bramham, North Yorkshire, costing Pounds 79m, and between Alconbury and Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, costing Pounds 83m. The federation said: 'Shadow tolling can give us some road improvements years earlier than if we waited for the Treasury to fund them conventionally. But we are not getting something for nothing and these improvements will still have to be paid for with public money.' According to Wilde Sapte, a law firm which has studied the shadow tolling initiative, it will be difficult in the early stages to quantify the risks to companies of taking on the construction and management of road schemes. A move to real electronic tolls could lead to motorists diverting from motorways, for example.</p>

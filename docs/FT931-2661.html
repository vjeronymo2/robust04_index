			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Strong performance from Reed Elsevier: Newly combined group ahead 19%; Upbeat statement on shape of the merger REED International and Elsevier, the UK and Dutch publishing groups which merged on January 1, said the fabric of their new organisation was taking shape. Reed yesterday reported nine-month figures to bring it into step with Elsevier, which gave full-year results for 1992. From now on the merged group will report combined results, although both companies will retain their separate stock market listings in London and Amsterdam. A strong performance by books and publishing caused Reed International to lift pre-tax profits 10.2 per cent to Pounds 137m in the nine-month period to December 31. Scientific publishing helped Elsevier increase its 1992 operating profit before tax - which it traditionally regards as the best measure of its performance - by 19.3 per cent to Fl 618.2m (Pounds 225.3m). The combined group produced a pro-forma statement for the year to December 31, which showed a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 412m in the year to December 31. Sales were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 2.46bn. Merger costs of Pounds 42m were taken as an exceptional item, as were restructuring costs of Pounds 12m, although these were unrelated to the merger. Reed Elsevier said measures had been taken to ensure that the combined group's medical publishing companies were managed on a unified basis, the business-to-business operations in the US were merged, and the scientific journal businesses in the UK integrated. 'Cost-savings have been identified in other parts of the business, but in the current year much of the benefit will be masked by the restructuring costs that follow such a significant merger.' The group's book, magazine and newspaper businesses had performed well in difficult economic conditions and would benefit from cyclical recovery. There was, however, little evidence this had started yet in the UK and in 1993 these markets were expected to weaken in the Netherlands.

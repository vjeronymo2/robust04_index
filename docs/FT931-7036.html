			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: On the Piste - Theatre John Godber's plays are immensely popular. Only Alan Ayckbourn among living British playwrights attracts a bigger audience. It is easy to believe in his appeal. When Dave (Ivan Kaye), the used car salesman in On the Piste, describes girlfriend Bev (Gillian Tompkins) as 'something to do when the pubs close' he gets a hiss that would have pleased any villain in Victorian melodrama. Godber catches the speech and prejudices of the working class with the facility of a writer of television soaps, and his plots would seem familiar to an addict of EastEnders. His magic ingredient is to set the plays in specific oddball locations - a night club in Boun-cers; a rugby club in Up 'n' Under: and an Austrian skiing village welcoming its weekly band of British holidaymakers in On the Piste. This has toured the provinces for some time but has been drastically re-written and re-designed for its London debut. The biggest change is to the sets, by Julie Godfrey. These are truly impressive, as nursery slope follows mountain top, with a sauna and hotel lobby thrown in. Few actors can have addressed the West End suspended from a stalled ski lift. For the first 10 minutes you marvel as the actors snow plow and traverse down the astro turf (the secret is to line the skis with baby bubble-bath), and speak their lines, too. It is a fresh approach for Godber, who traditionally favoured minimalist sets and plenty of action, but gives an undoubted fillip to the evening. The plot is familiar - the falling apart of a group of no hopers who by the end have had as miserable a time as the cast of Hamlet - but some characters are woefully under written and strangely unbelievable. Tony, the ski instructor, is the only link with Austria (the action could really take place anywhere), and although Peter Birch is chillingly familiar as he goes through his weekly sales pitch to his band of ski virgins you never quite know whether he is as superficial as he seems or dying quietly inside. You might like to guess whether he sleeps with frustrated Alison (Julia Deakin), superior Melissa (Stephanie Pack) or good natured Bev. Melissa, too, the Sloane fallen among plebs, never gets her moment at the confessional, and remains elusive, and in making the nerdish Chris (Paul Bown) a successful voice-over in TV commercials Godber is way off-target. Olivier, Welles, even Angus Deayton, have milked this lucrative and much sought after profession. Still there are pleasures along the way as we re-learn the familiar lesson that men are bastards and women are weak. Bev, with her macaw voice and bruised heart, is a memorable character, and the involved audience, well seasoned with skiiers, loved it, happy to laugh at the tumbles, cry with the rejections, and shriek with embarrassment at the sauna scene.

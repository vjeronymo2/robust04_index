			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Counties review dubbed 'a mess' The government's decision to make the Local Government Commission for England conduct a further review of councils in Derbyshire and County Durham could itself be open to judicial review, it was said yesterday. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow local government minister, described the review as a 'mess'. He said: 'The reference back of Durham and Derbyshire and not of Cleveland appears to be a highly partisan move which could well leave the secretary of state (Mr John Gummer, environment secretary) open to judicial review.' Plans to restructure all three counties were unveiled this month by the commission. However, the government announced a change to its guidance for the commission in September, which made it clear that it expected the two-tier status quo of counties and districts to be replaced by unitary authorities. Mr Straw said Cleveland, which is Labour-controlled and is to be split into four unitary authorities, might have a case for judicial review because it will not be re-examined by the commission. Mr Dennis Pettit, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, said the move over Derbyshire and County Durham called the independence of Sir John's commission into question. The cross-party Association of District Councils, though, said it signalled the end for the two-tier status quo.</p>

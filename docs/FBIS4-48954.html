			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 1 (XINHUA)--The Shanghai municipal  rules on implementation of the land-use law of the People's  Republic of China came into effect today.    According to the 76-article rules, all companies,  enterprises, organizations and individuals except those covered  by special laws and regulations, are allowed to receive the  right of land use through the form of assignment for the purpose  of development, utilization or business. In addition, all  commercial projects including those involving foreign investment  should transfer the right of land use through public bidding or  auction rather than through negotiations as has most often been  done in the past.    An authoritative official noted that with the implementation  of the new rules, the practice of combining free utilization of  land with paid use has been replaced by paid use for all  utilization of land in the city.    Meanwhile, the official said, the Shanghai municipal  government will continue to list more fields in land use besides  commercial housing for foreign businessmen to invest in.</p>

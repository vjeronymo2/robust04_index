			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Quake Doesn't Shake Muni Bonds: California's municipal bond market, the  nation's largest, felt barely a ripple from the Bay Area earthquake, though  some of the roads, bridges and buildings financed by the bonds sustained  damage. Prices of the bonds were virtually unaffected by the quake. Mutual fund  operators said they received few panicky calls from investors in  California-based municipal bond funds, and almost none of the investors pulled  out.  </P></p>

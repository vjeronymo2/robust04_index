Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic said on Sunday he  was confident that Yugoslavia's leadership would not do anything  to Krajina's disadvantage while negotiating with Croatia on the  normalization of their relations.    The delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  Croatia on Saturday had talks in Zagreb on the normalization of  their relations, based on the declaration signed in Geneva  mid-January.    Jarcevic reiterated that these talks had included a large  number of issues, ranging from humanitarian to political issues,  and underscored he held the view that Croatia was responsible  for the exile of 300,000 Serbs, who did not in any way violate  the laws of the new Croatian government. For that reason,  Croatia should be 'put before the bar of justice,' Jarcevic said.    On the issue of the re-opening of communications, in  particular the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, Jarcevic repeated the  already familiar conditions set by R.S.K. that had to be  fulfilled first: peace must be established between R.S.K. and  Croatia and Croatia must allow R.S.K. to establish foreign trade.    R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly  Serb-populated  parts of Croatia in response to its forcible secession from  former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the constituent  nation status of Serbs to that of a national minority.    R.S.K. has been the U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March  1992 and, as planned, it will keep this status until a final  political solution has been found.    After the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia had  signed the declaration on the normalization of their relations,  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said that the  declaration did not prejudge the issue of the R.S.K. final  status.</p>

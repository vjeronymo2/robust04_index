			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Egerer, head of the National Security </F> Office's Constitutional Protection Directorate, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given: "On the Renewed  Hungarist Movement -- High-Ranking National Security Leader  Gives Interview to NEPSZABADSAG"]    [Text] On 5 May a Budapest court approved keeping Albert  Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos, leaders of the Hungarist Movement, on  remand, which had been ordered on 2 May, because of the  increased danger that they might commit more crimes. We  interviewed Laszlo Egerer, leader of the National Security  Office's Constitutional Protection Directorate, on the  background to the appearance of the successor to the former  Arrow-Cross organization [Hungarian fascist organization during  the Nazi period].    [Egerer] Arrow-Cross and National Socialist parties operated  in Hungary from 1935, mostly following Ferenc Szalasi. The  establishment of the Hungarist Movement coincided with the  launching of the National Socialist Hungarian Party in March  1938. Pal Teleki's government dissolved it but, under German  pressure, it again became legal under a different name and, as  the Arrow-Cross Party, it came to power on 15 October 1944.    After World War II, afraid of reprisals for the war crimes  and crimes against humanity committed by them, many members of  the Hungarist Movement emigrated to various countries of the  world. After emigrating, representatives and sympathizers of  Arrow-Cross power established regional groups -- in Australia,  Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Western Europe  -- of the Hungarist Movement. Their activities were mostly  limited to publishing their internally circulating journal, UT  ES CEL [ROAD AND GOAL], and to organizing local events.  Personal conflicts, rivalry, and dissent by the leaders and the  membership characterized this movement from the beginning. From  1945 to 1975, former Arrow- Cross leader Arpad Henney headed the  movement, having been appointed by Szalasi as his political  successor. After Henney's death, Imre Tatar Tarjanyi, who was  living in Germany, became the movement's leader and kept this  role until autumn 1993. At the time, he was a parliamentary  deputy for the Arrow-Cross Party.    [Correspondent] We have arrived at the present. How has the  Hungarist Movement been reorganized?    [Egerer] After the change of the regime, the Hungarist  Movement's emigre organizations made contact with extreme  right-wing groups in Hungary so as to make Hungarism legitimate  as a political line, and to rehabilitate Szalasi's Arrow-Cross  dictatorship. After 1990, many elderly activists of the  movement came to Hungary and personally tried to do something to  achieve these goals. In the course of this, the Hungarist  Movement's representatives from Australia, Canada, and the  United States made contact with Istvan Gyorkos, the leader of  the illegal extreme right-wing organization the Hungarian  National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal], who was accepted as  the domestic representative and maintainer of Hungarist  traditions. The international and domestic media coverage of  the criminal proceedings launched against Gyorkos in 1992 played  a part in this because this introduced him to the extreme  right-wing emigre groups. Through his contacts, Gyorkos often  received financial support from Western emigres to establish the  Hungarist Movement in Hungary. In addition to this, extreme  right-wing Hungarian propaganda publications -- UT ES CEL -- and  reprinted books of the ideologists of Hungarism -- Szalasi,  Istoczy, and Marschalko -- were often sent to Gyorkos and other  extreme right-wing activists for further circulation.    [Correspondent] When did Albert Szabo appear?    [Egerer] He returned home on the instruction of the  Hungarist Movement's Australian group. Szabo has dual Hungarian  and Australian citizenship. He held discussions with Gyorkos a  number of times on coordinating the operation of the extreme  right-wing groups and on presenting them as a united movement.  However, the Hungarian branch of the Hungarist Movement was not  formed because of its poor organization, lack of social support,  and mainly the individual ambitions and rivalry between Gyorkos  and Szabo.    In the autumn of 1993, the Hungarist groups operating among  emigres in the West jointly declared that they were appointing  Istvan Gyorkos as leader of the movement because the former  leader Tarjanyi, living in Germany, could not carry out the work  of directing the organization. Szabo did not accept this, tried  to compete with Gyorkos, and established the World National  Popular Rule Party.    In spring 1994, the foreign groups of the Hungarist Movement  made Gyorkos and Szabo understand that they would only continue  to support them financially if they appeared as a united  movement in political life. It can be attributed to this and to  the lack of success in the election campaign that the  establishment of the Hungarian wing of the Hungarist Movement  was announced on 27 April 1994. This was primarily a symbolic  act, as only 11 people signed the minutes that registered the  establishment. In spite of their loud statements about the  broad social support for their "movement," the number of their  sympathizers does not even extend to a few hundred. The vast  majority of people belonging to this movement are not clear  about the ideology or history of Hungarism, have a low  intellectual level, and primitive opposition to Gypsies and  Jews, and chauvinism dominate their views.    On 28 April 1994, on charges of conducting extremist  propaganda activities, the police instituted criminal  proceedings against Gyorkos and Szabo -- who call themselves the  leaders of the Hungarist Movement in Hungary -- on the  well-grounded suspicion of incitement against the community in  violation of Paragraph 269 of the Penal Code.    [Correspondent] No proceedings have been initiated started  against Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem, who appeared at the movement's  gatherings together with the other two people. Why not?    [Egerer] In view of the facts known to us, the well-founded  suspicion of incitement against the community under Paragraph  269 of the Penal Code was not raised in his case.</p>

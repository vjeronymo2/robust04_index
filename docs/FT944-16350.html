			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Activity muted as investors await data Activity remained muted yesterday on the Continent ahead of the release of US data later this week, writes Our Markets Staff. In its latest European strategy report JP Morgan says there is little sign of short-term relief for the region's equity markets because of the uncertainty surrounding a further rise in US interest rates. However, the broker says, the medium-term outlook for the core countries of France and Germany is positive, because of 'robust growth and low inflation'. By contrast, Spain and Italy, while likely to experience even stronger growth, might be affected by higher inflation and higher short-term interest rates, leading to an underweight recommendation. FRANKFURT rose during official hours but then fell back slightly in late trading, but the day was marked by a general lack of interest ahead of this weekend's elections. The Dax index put on 6.51 to 2,077.57, then fell to 2,069.98 later. Schering added DM21 to DM959, adding to Tuesday's gain which followed news of the presentation of a rival multiple sclerosis drug. Elsewhere BASF put on DM3.1 to DM313 and Bayer DM5.1 to DM356. Financials were pulled in both directions: Deutsche Bank fell DM2.8 to DM712.2, Dresdner Bank DM1 to DM389, while Allianz rose DM14 to DM2,277 and Commerzbank DM2 to DM320. PARIS featured individual stories as the CAC-40 index drifted in a listless fashion, ending down a marginal 0.88 at 1,918.14. Turnover was FFr3bn. UAP was among the worst performers, off 5 per cent at FFr138.50, after reporting a fall in first-half profit to FFr853m, below most analysts' expectations. Carrefour went in the opposite direction, rising FFr46 to FFr2,184, denying reports that it might make a bid for a UK supermarket group. Sanofi picked up a further FFr11.10 to FFr252.30 after announcing the sale of part of its bio-activities division on Tuesday. ZURICH was lower in quiet conditions, with trading dominated by professionals. The SMI index closed 7.5 down at 2,562.7. Ciba registered shares eased SFr4 to SFr716. The company's announcement of a 3 per cent decline in nine-month sales proved in line with expectations, although the negative impact of the strong Swiss franc was slightly worse than expected. Roche, reporting third-quarter figures on Monday, saw its certificates finish flat at SFr5,880. UBS shares showed little reaction to comments by Mr Martin Ebner, chairman of BZ Bank, that he was not trying to gain control. The UBS bearers picked up SFr2 to SFr1,240, and the registered stock was unchanged at SFr300. However, Mr Ebner's BK Vision fell SFr40 to SFr1,400. Brown Boveri bearers continued their comeback, picking up another SFr11 to SFr1,111 in heavy trade, after their period in the doldrums. Other cyclicals were also higher, Fischer adding SFr10 to SFr1,555, and Sulzer rising SFr6 to SFr891. Second-line insurers saw continued demand, with Berner rising SFr90 to SFr1,490 on continued speculation that Allianz, which holds a 30 per cent stake, might be planning to expand its share. Baloise added SFr45 to SFr2,845, but Elvia eased SFr20 to SFr3,600. AMSTERDAM was unable to maintain the gains of the previous two days and the AEX index was left trailing 1.81 at 402.30. VNU, which denied reports that its television interests would be affected by new competition in the sector, dipped Fl 3.20 to Fl 176.80. Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, slipped 20 cents to Fl 15.10 after reports that Cityline, a division of Lufthansa of Germany, might replace the F-50s in its fleet. MILAN made an early attempt to rally, but the momentum was soon lost as technical, month-end deadlines, and simmering political worries once again made their presence felt. The Comit index finished 2.85 ahead at 639.68. Some blue chips managed to hold on to gains. Benetton, still recovering from last week's sharp losses, rose L59 to L19,935, and Cir was L21 ahead at L1,858. Demand was also noted for the Fiat motor components maker, Magneti Marelli, ahead of its merger with Gilardini. Magneti gained L44 to L1,292. Falls were seen, however, among the telecommunications companies, with Stet losing L40 to L4,479 and Telecom Italia giving up L64 to L4,143. STOCKHOLM featured a further strong gain in Ericsson, the B shares rising SKr2.50 to SKr417.50, after good results from Motorola in the US. However, most investors were awaiting the country's inflation data due out today. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 10.20 to 1,425.20. HELSINKI was stronger on expectations that Sunday's referendum will result in a yes vote for EU membership. The HEX index was up 35.32 at 1,899.04.

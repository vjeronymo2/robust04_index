			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Swissair appeals to Biggles - Travel Update Not just anyone can get their hands on the controls of a commercial jetliner, but Swissair is offering the next best thing: a chance to pilot one of its seven flight simulators. The Swiss national airline is to rent out spare time on its Zurich-based machines, which simulate the performance of the Boeing 747, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and MD-81, the Airbus A-310 and the Fokker 100. The fee varies from SFr500 to SFr850 (Pounds 230 to Pounds 390) per hour, including an instructor and an on-hand Swissair pilot.</p>

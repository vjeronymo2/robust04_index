			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Technology: A kick-start for multimedia - Technically Speaking EVERYONE is talking about multimedia. Rapid growth has been predicted for this combination of text, sound and pictures. A number of the factors necessary to make this growth happen are finally falling into place. In the personal computer world, many manufacturers are now building their hardware with CD-Rom drives built in (CD-Rom being the main delivery system for multimedia products). Also, the drives have tumbled in price and CDs are cheap to produce. However, if we are to see a real explosion in the market, with the multimedia CD realising its potential and becoming common in homes and businesses, a big obstacle needs to be overcome - the cost of creation. Up to now, principally text-based CD-Rom products have been developed and marketed by publishing houses whose principal copyright asset is text. The moment a book publisher strays from its traditional copyright base and enters the world of multimedia, creative costs can be crippling. Yet multimedia is exactly the area publishers need to be in to service the information market of the next century. The importance of reducing the cost of materials in a multimedia CD-Rom product is considerable. Imagine all the elements which go to make up a 20-volume encyclopedia - then at least double this to take account of the fact that multimedia also uses sound, animation and film. To give an idea of scale, some interactive CD products contain thousands of colour photographs and text documents. If these are sourced at the rates charged by photographic agencies for book products, the cost of the images alone would be more than Pounds 250,000. A few more overheads of that magnitude, and the whole business becomes impossible. Consequently, some hardware and software manufacturers have poured huge subsidies into multimedia titles in a bid to ease the transition to commercial reality. However, with the spectrum of multimedia resources in the hands of so many disparate copyright holders, publishers and software developers do not see such a simplistic approach working. There is another related problem: the 'price-perception' of a CD as opposed to that of a book. The public's idea of what a CD should cost is influenced by the lower price of music CDs. People are willing to pay hundreds of pounds for a set of printed volumes, but it is difficult to sell a CD to the home market above, say, Pounds 200, however much information has been squeezed on to it. This is a depressing realisation for the multimedia author, especially when you consider how much can be fitted on the disc (the complete works of Shakespeare take up only 5 per cent of a CD's storage capacity). Should budding multimedia authors simply throw up their hands in despair? Not at all. Since publishers have a huge advantage in owning copyright on text and other book-related materials, many may think they can corner the market by jealously guarding their perceived advantage. They would be deluding themselves. Multimedia is a co-operative affair. The computing industry thrives on the enthusiasm and drive of small developers and authors. It is in the interests of publishers to share their copyright materials with resource holders in other industries, whether music, film or animation. This would make available, at reasonable cost, the single most expensive creative overhead. The best way of imagining how such a development would work is in terms of a resource centre. Authors or authoring organisations would become subscribers, their fee purchasing a particular level of usage, including republication of materials selected. The idea is to kick-start the development of the multimedia industry. It provides obvious cost advantages to authors which, in a competitive market, will inevitably be passed on to the purchaser.

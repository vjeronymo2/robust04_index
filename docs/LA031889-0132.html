			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET WATCHES WINNING HANDS-DOWN IN ITALY  </P> <P> In an era of high-tech electronic gadgets, the Soviet Union's old-fashioned  mechanical watches are conquering fashion-crazy Italy.  </P> <P> Genuine Soviet-made watches are selling in classy Italian jewelry shops as fast  as the Soviets can produce them, and the rest of Europe and the United States  are the next targets.  </P> <P> Less than 5 months after the first Cyrillic-inscribed "Made in the USSR"  timepieces crossed the border, the Soviet watch industry has received the  highest of accolades -- thousands of fakes are appearing on the streets.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has long been the world's third-largest producer of clocks and  watches -- after Switzerland and the Far East -- but until last fall, exports  were confined to selling parts and movements to Western makers.  </P> <P> The chunky, 1950s-style wrist-watches, including five models previously made  exclusively for the Red Army, are the most successful Soviet consumer products  to reach the West under Mikhail Gorbachev's new era of reform.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Status Symbol  </P> <P> Displayed in high-class Italian shops next to gold Rolexes and diamond-studded  bracelets, the utilitarian Paketa and Red Army Boctok watches have become a  sought-after status symbol.  </P> <P> "We have convinced jewelers who sell watches worth millions of lire (thousands  of dollars) to display side by side these simple Soviet products which cost as  little as 100,000 lire ($75)," said Orazio Occhipinti, who last fall clinched  the European distribution contract for Paketa.  </P> <P> Occhipinti said that his entire stock of 40,000 Paketa watches was sold out in  the 2 months before Christmas and that he that has no doubt that the 150,000  more he plans to import to Italy in 1989 will get a similar reception.  </P> <P> "They are an anti-status status symbol. . . . The Russians seem a bit  astonished. They can't quite understand why they're in such demand," Occhipinti  said.  </P> <P> His Milan-base Mirabilia firm won the contract against competition from about  50 Italian companies keen to capitalize on the wave of "Gorby fever" sweeping  Western Europe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eager for Hard Currency  </P> <P> Eager for hard currency, the Russians needed little persuasion to sell, and  Italy, whose 6 million watch sales a year make it the third-largest consumer  market in the world, was the ideal place for a test launch.  </P> <P> "Once a watch was simply a watch and something you bought for a lifetime. Now  it's a fashion accessory which also tells the time. Men change them like they  do ties, and for women they're like earrings," said Occhipinti, whose teen-age  daughter has a collection of "about 20" cheap and cheerful watches.  </P> <P> "Given the success, we could have asked twice the price, but we decided to  market the Paketa as a fashion item aimed at the middle and upper classes," he  said.  </P> <P> Following a major Italian trade fair in Moscow last October, another Italian  company, Time Trend, won a 5-year contract to handle the first ever commercial  sales of the legendary Boctok wristwatch.  </P> <P> The five distinctive models, bearing the design of either a parachute,  submarine or tank for the respective divisions, a plain red star for infantry  and a special version for all commanders, are available in the Soviet Union  only to the military, importers say.  </P> <P> On sale in Italy since late January for 280,000 lire ($210), they are being  snapped up by collectors and the ordinary public despite minimal advertising.  </P></p>

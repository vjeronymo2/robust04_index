			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / PM set for key move on Ulster Mr John Major will today map out his government's response to the IRA and loyalist ceasefires in Northern Ireland in what Whitehall officials last night were describing as a landmark on the road to permanent peace in the province. During a visit to the province later today Mr Major is expected to publicly acknowledge for the first time that the government is now operating on the 'working assumption' that the end to violence is permanent. He is likely also to spell out the terms and timetable for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to bring the republican movement into the negotiations for a new constitutional settlement. Speaking ahead of a planned summit meeting on Monday with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Major will signal the end of the exclusion orders banning Mr Gerry Adams and other prominent Sinn Fein members from visiting the British mainland. Senior Unionist politicians predicted that Mr Major would also signpost the essential elements of the govern-ment's tests for the IRA to demonstrate its good faith. In the meantime, he is likely to seek to underline his own determination to secure peace by announcing a phased withdrawal to barracks of British troops in the province. The prime minister's visit comes after a meeting of senior ministers yesterday which gave him a free hand to press on towards talks with republican leaders by Christmas. Downing Street said the government was moving towards adopting a 'working assumption' that the IRA ceasefire was permanent. The summit between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major will be their first face-to-face meeting since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires. The two will discuss the joint framework document with which they hope to inject momentum into political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. In Dublin yesterday, Mr Reynolds met Mr Adams to discuss progress on the peace process and plans for a cross-party national forum for peace and reconciliation. Mr Adams said: 'The momentum for real peace is still there, and is building.' But he criticised the 'hesitant, faltering and begrudging' UK response to the IRA ceasefire.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister brother Muhammad Salim Basindwah  today left for Cairo on a visit to Egypt. He will convey a  message from Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, to his brother President Husni  Mubarak about relations between the two brotherly countries and  Yemeni developments. Basindwah will also lead our country's  delegation to meetings of foreign ministers of the Nonaligned  Movement, set to convene in Cairo from 30 May to 4 June.    Before leaving Sanaa, the foreign minister told SABA' he  will  take the opportunity of his presence in the Egyptian capital and  his attendance at the nonaligned conference to convey a true  picture of what is going on in Yemen to as many ministers as  possible. He will make the point that no one is out to force  unity on others, because unity has been in place for four years.  It must be made clear to the world that there is an attempt to  force secession on the country and that some quarters try to  misrepresent the situation.    The foreign minister hoped the nonaligned conference will  produce beneficial decisions for the peoples of the movement.    The Yemeni delegation to the conference includes the under  secretary for political affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and  other ministry officials.</p>

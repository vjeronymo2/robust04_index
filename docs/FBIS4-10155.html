			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos presidential </F> residence in Mexico City; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] This afternoon, around 1400, Mexico  and Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement at Los  Pinos Presidential Palace. President Salinas de Gortari and  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who  arrived in Mexico City around noon, signed the document. This  document, which has 23 chapters, will enter into effect on 1  January 1995. Here is Elizabeth Diaz Otero with a report:    [Diaz] Good afternoon. During the ceremony to sign the  document, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said the free  trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico will promote  greater trade and investment, employment, and welfare  opportunities for both nations. This document, which opens the  door for the free trade of goods between the two nations, will  result in greater economic growth and development, and  consequently more justice with accompanying tangible benefits  for society.    In the presence of Costa Rican President Calderon, who came  specifically for this ceremony, President Salinas underscored  that the way to advance Latin American integration is with  actions, not just words. The meeting took place in the Adolfo  Lopez Mateos Hall at Los Pinos. President Salinas spoke about  the diversification of relations between Mexico and other  countries and the advantages of competition.    [Begin Salinas recording] National businesses, especially  medium-sized and small businesses, will find broader markets  with differences regarding levels of complexity and development.  This agreement will benefit economies of scale and facilitate  the specialization of various goods. With this treaty we sign  today, we will also promote the development of the comparative  advantages of all Mexican federal organizations. This agreement  will lead to strengthening decentralization and federalism  because domestic producers will be increasingly less dependent  on the behavior of a single market. [end recording]    [Diaz] President Calderon euphorically called this free  trade  agreement with Mexico the greatest foreign policy accomplishment  of his administration because it gives Costa Rican products  access to the Mexican market, a huge market with 90 million  people. He gave a long speech in which he said that 5 April  marked the onset of the 21st century for Costa Rica and praised  President Salinas, comparing him with Bolivar, Marti, Juarez,  and San Martin. He emphasized that the free trade agreement  should not be viewed as a deal that will only favor businessmen.    [Begin Calderon recording] The free trade agreement between  Mexico and Costa Rica should not only be viewed as a matter of  interest for businessmen and shopowners. The elimination of  tariffs represents the elimination of economic, mental, and  cultural barriers. This agreement will have significant  repercussions for the future of all citizens, and it heralds a  new period in relations between Mexico and Costa Rica and  between Costa Rica and the other North American nations. [end  recording]    [Diaz] This free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa  Rica is considered the most thorough agreement negotiated in  Latin America. This is so because it contains an entire array  of rules that will give transparency and security to the  productive sectors; promote trade in goods and services; protect  industrial secrets, brands, and copyrights; and facilitate  investments in both countries. This treaty, as you have said,  if ratified by the Mexican and Costa Rican senates, will enter  into force on 1 January 1995. A large number of the tariffs  will be eliminated -- in the case of Mexican exports, 70  percent, while in the case of Costa Rican exports, 75 percent.  This reduction of duties will continue gradually over a decade.  It will mainly protect agricultural products like meat,  plantains, poultry products, and sugar.    [Announcer] The signing of this treaty is beneficial for  Costa Rica, as well as for Mexico, of course. I will cite an  example to give an idea of the figures we are talking about.  Costa Rica currently exports -- according to 1993 statistics --  an average of $60 million to Mexico, mainly raw materials. With  the signing of this bilateral free trade agreement, Costa Rica  will be able to increase it sale of goods and services to Mexico  400 percent. That is, the current value of the market, which is  $60 million, could grow to $250 million, which is very  beneficial for Costa Rica and the Mexican commercial opening.  [passage omitted]</p>

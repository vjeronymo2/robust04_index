			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Social  Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) announced its militants are  determined to defend "with their own lives" President Joaquin  Balaguer's presumed victory in last Monday's general elections.  In a communique, the ruling party said that from now on,  Balaguer's followers are declaring themselves "on permanent  vigil to defend Joaquin Balaguer's triumph."    Based on provisional results announced by the Central  Electoral Board, JCE, Balaguer is reportedly the virtual winner  of the 16 May elections. Opposition candidate Francisco Pena  Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) has contested  the results.    The most recent results released by the JCE showed Balaguer  leading with a margin of 1.01 percent over Pena Gomez. The JCE,  however, has yet to review the irregularities reported by Pena  Gomez, who claims that approximately 200,000 opposition  militants were not in the electoral registry.    The charges made by the Social Democratic candidate were  supported by international observers who supervised the  elections. Representatives from the business sector, the  Catholic Church, and the media have issued a call to the JCE to  seek a solution to the postelectoral crisis and prevent possible  street riots.    Although there have been no acts of disorder so far, the  authorities decided to deploy Army and National Police troops in  Santo Domingo and along roads leading to the capital. The troops  have been confiscating small arms from the civilian population.</p>

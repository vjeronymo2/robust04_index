			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Azerbaijan-Armenia talks President Geidar Aliev of Azerbaijan and President Levon Ter-Petrosian of Armenia met yesterday in Moscow to seek a peaceful settlement of their war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia's foreign ministry spokesman said both sides had demonstrated a willingness to seek compromises. 'However, at least one more round of intensive work will be required to finalise the document,' he said. The agreement being discussed calls for an end to hostilities, disengagement of warring parties, the deployment of mostly Russian peacekeepers and the return of refugees. But there still are outstanding issues, such as when Armenian forces will withdraw from areas seized outside Nagorno-Karabakh and the exact composition of the peacekeeping force. The agreement also does not stipulate the final status of the enclave, which has declared independence from Azerbaijan.</p>

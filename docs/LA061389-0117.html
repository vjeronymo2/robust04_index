			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANON TO INVEST $100 MILLION IN NEXT INC., GET SEAT ON BOARD  </P> <P> Canon Inc. of Japan has agreed to invest $100 million in Next Inc., the  brainchild of computer pioneer Steven Jobs, to acquire one-sixth of the  privately held 4-year-old company.  </P> <P> The agreement gives Next a hefty financial boost just as it gets set to begin  volume shipments of its sleek, black computer workstations.  </P> <P> "We hope this will erase anybody's worries about Next's long-term financial  stability, its ability to invest in (research and development) and in  manufacturing," Jobs told a group of reporters and industry analysts before a  tour of the company's automated factory in Fremont.  </P> <P> The terms of Canon's agreement are essentially the same as those negotiated  with H. Ross Perot when he invested $20 million in the company in 1987. Canon  will receive a seat on the board of directors of the company and has agreed not  to acquire more than 20% of the firm for at least 10 years.  </P> <P> Although Canon's investment was widely expected, most rumors speculated that  Canon would invest $20 million in the company.  </P> <P> But Canon's agreement does not include any technology licenses or manufacturing  rights -- a point Jobs stressed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Very Difficult Market  </P> <P> As previously reported, Canon also acquired the right to sell Next's computers  in Asia as part of the $100-million deal.  </P> <P> "The distribution agreement opens a big market for Next, but the Japanese  market has been very difficult for U.S. vendors," said analyst William Lempesis  of Dataquest.  </P></p>

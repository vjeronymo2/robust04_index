			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The cask vendor presented dose assessment results in the SAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for both 5- and 10-year-cooled fuel. However, for this rulemaking, NRC used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dose assessment for 5-year-cooled fuel for the shielding analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation source term and for accidental releases of radionuclide material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC's use of the 5-year-cooled fuel assessment is conservative and bounding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC specifies, in Section 1.2.1 of the Certificate of Compliance a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel acceptance parameters. These parameters, which may include burnup,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial enrichment, heat load, cooling time, and radiological source term,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define the properties of those assemblies that can be stored in a cask. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such parameter of interest for the Standardized NUHOMS is the radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source term that forms the basis of the shielding analyses. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameter, the vendor proposed an alternative approach. Specifically, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel assemblies that fall outside the specified source term parameters but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy all other parameters, the vendor proposed to allow licensees to do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual cask shielding calculations to show compliance with the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis dose rates. This could result in more assemblies in a licensee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory that would be eligible for dry storage. In the instance noted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comment, the NRC did not agree with the vendor proposal. The Certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Compliance dose rate specifications provide a simple check to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DSCs are not inadvertently loaded with the wrong fuel. The dose rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications are based on the shielding analyses provided by the vendor in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its SAR. Because of differences in non-fuel components in the ends of some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies, dose rates higher than those evaluated by NRC in the SER may occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the ends of casks than were assumed in the shielding analysis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance specifications allow for this possibility and permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the licensee to store such fuel provided the licensee verifies proper cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrication, conformance with all other fuel parameters, and compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation protection requirements. The site-specific calculations referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the comment are not shielding calculations, but rather are the licensee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written evaluations (or dose assessments) required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(2)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish that the radiation criteria for ISFSI in 10 CFR 72.104 have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met. The Certificate of Compliance also requires that the licensee submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter report to the NRC summarizing its actions in this type of case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters were concerned with fuel clad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity issues. Particularly, they were concerned with potential problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may arise because of differences between vertical and horizontal storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter noted that it was essential to inspect the cladding carefully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the minute hairline cracks which would allow the radioactivity inside to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escape. Another commenter wanted it made clear that for fuel to be eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for storage it doesn't need to be specifically inspected nor require special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling or storage provisions within the spent fuel pool. The commenter also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that pinhole leaks in fuel rod cladding do not constitute gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaches. The commenter wanted fuel cladding integrity clarified. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter claimed that horizontal storage of fuel rods will lead to cladding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration that would challenge the technical specifications of the NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask. Another commenter was concerned about the possibility of fuel rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bowing that could result in weighted contact between the fuel cladding/crud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the DSC guide sleeve, with the potential for eventual bonding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials over the duration of the storage period. One commenter, noting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some of the fuel in the spent fuel pools could be nearly 20 years old, was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that the fuel will not be tested for leaks using specific techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as penetrating dyes, eddy current, sipping, or ultrasound before canister  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading. A commenter wanted all fuel with known defects and all water-logged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel retained in the spent fuel pool until the cask integrity under operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions is fully demonstrated. Another wanted to know how ``grossly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breached'' fuel will be ultimately handled and shipped off site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the Standardized NUHOMS, PWR fuel rods are stored in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal orientation and do not normally deflect in the middle of any span  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that the rods contact the DSC guide sleeve. However, the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists that a bowed rod may come in contact with the guide sleeve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to storage of BWR fuel, the fuel channel that surrounds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel bundle (rods) provides a barrier to separate coolant flow paths, to guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the control rod, and to provide rigidity and protection for the fuel bundle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during handling. Therefore, the BWR fuel rods inside the channel do not come  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in contact with the guide sleeves. Even if there were contact with either PWR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or BWR fuel rods, the interaction would not present a significant concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the guide sleeve material is stainless steel, which has a very low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of corrosion, and the DSC cavity is evacuated and back-filled with inert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> helium, which further reduces the likelihood of any corrosion or bonding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the guide sleeve and fuel rods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

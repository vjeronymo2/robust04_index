			<p>BFN     [Text] "Only the Latvian Republic can decided whose  military bases can be stationed on its territory," says a  message distributed by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on  Wednesday evening after the publication of the Russian  president's order on the creation of Russian military bases on  the territories of CIS states and the Latvian Republic "to  ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above  mentioned states and to test new armaments and military  equipment."    On April 6 a source in the Kremlin reported to Interfax that  the wording about the creation of a military base in Latvia "is  the result of an inappropriate phrase which was included into  one of the documents of the Defense Ministry and then appeared  in a corresponding order of the Russian president."    The message of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry underlined  that "unilateral actions by Russia aimed at the creation of  military bases in the Latvian Republic despite the will of this  sovereign state contradicts the principles of international law  and international obligations taken by Russia as a member of the  UN and CSCE."</p>

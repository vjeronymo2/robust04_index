			<p>BFN     [Text] The steel sector wage dispute for the areas of North  Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, and Bremen has been settled.  The engineering union IG Metall and the employers have  concluded an agreement aimed at safeguarding jobs. For the  120,000 workers in this sector, they agreed that the 35-hour  week will be brought forward from 1 April 1995 to 1 May 1994.  For the first time, the union did not ask for a wage increase.  The wage agreement will apply for 12 months.</p>

By yesterday not all details of the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] response had been  released to the public. Today it is said that besides the three  provinces offered by the government, UNITA also wants to have  full governing authority over Benguela, Huambo and Bie  Provinces. This is not all, Jonas Savimbi's organization wants  more than 20 districts and about 50 communes in other provinces.  A source has said what UNITA wants is to create a good support  base to fulfill its former aim of taking over power.    On the government portfolios, yesterday it was said that  UNITA had retracted its position and today the contrary has been  said: Jonas Savimbi's organization wants the leadership of five  or six key portfolios as ministers or deputy ministers.  Analysts say this is an indirect way of demanding  power-sharing. The government has assessed UNITA's stand, and  today it did not even reply in writing. It only reminded the  mediators and UNITA itself that its offer is not negotiable.  Either UNITA accepts and the talks continue, or it refuses and  everything is over. In other words, the government does not  agree with UNITA's stand. Now, the mediators and observers are  once again in the midst of a crossfire.</p>

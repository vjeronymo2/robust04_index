			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Politicians ready themselves for pensions bill debates Politicians from all parties were yesterday bracing themselves for a series of marathon late-night debates on the pensions bill, the largest item of legislation to be brought before the current session of parliament, James Blitz writes. At the end of a week in which the bill was laid in the House of Lords, government ministers did not disguise the technical difficulties they will face in getting its 153 clauses through the upper house and the Commons. The bill, which covers a wide range of issues, from occupational pensions to the equalisation of the retirement age for men and women, will be debated in the upper house at 'second reading' on January 24. After a Lords committee stage beginning in early March, it will be brought to the Commons in May. It would have to complete all its stages in both houses by the end of October to get on the statute book. The government's difficulty in pushing the Criminal Justice Bill through the last session of parliament demonstrated the pitfalls that can occur when debating large and complex legislation. There were so many amendments to the bill drawn up by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, that it had to be concluded in parliament's 'spillover' period at the end of the session. Implementation of the pensions bill should be easier. The Labour party has said it will approach debates on the legislation in a positive spirit and there is cross-party support for the principle of building in safeguards for occupational schemes. But business managers will face some problems. Tory MPs - led by Mr Winston Churchill, member for Davyhulme - are threatening to introduce an amendment increasing pensions for overseas residents. If the government fails to back the principle, costing Pounds 230m a year, there could be protracted debate - and even a rebellion - on the issue. Government ministers are also certain to be heavily over-worked in pushing the measures through late-night committee sessions. Two junior social security ministers - Mr William Hague, who drafted the white paper on occupational pensions, and Mr James Arbuthnot - will guide the bill through the Commons. But Mr Hague is also charged with implementing important legislation on disability rights and may not be present for all the debates. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security select committee, said yesterday that he expected the bill to run into timing difficulties. 'There is no system of timetabling debates in the Lords, so they can go on for quite a while,' he said. But he added: 'It is crucial we get the legislation right because there will never be a bill of this kind again in our lifetime.'</p>

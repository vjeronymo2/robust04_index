			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (6): European perspective - EIS case study: Electronics supplier / The size of Philips Consumer Electronics made it difficult to get an overview that allowed managers to compare and co-ordinate operations, until an EIS was implemented Picking a supplier who would be around in the long term was vital to Philips Consumer Electronics - and so was international support. As one of Philips' five leading product divisions with a Pounds 6bn turnover of its own, PCE needed to overhaul its information systems in line with its European reporting structure. The aim was to provide a co-ordinated approach, with some local autonomy. 'The main issue was gathering information across diverse groups and presenting it to managers so that they can make effective decisions,' says Royston Morgan, information manager at PCE. Problems in co-ordination were first pointed out by the colour TV business group, which wanted to compare factory with factory using the same yardstick. The ability to analyse differences called for an EIS, and four or five were assessed. Pilot's Command Centre and Lightship Professional software satisfied Morgan's demand for a product that would provide co-ordination across Europe. 'Any application had to fit in with our infrastructure and support our business aims, allowing us to co-ordinate centrally from the headquarters in Eindhoven,' he says. There are now 200 regular users of the system, and 350 or so approved users, largely in the layers of management below director-level. Mr Morgan sees direct bottom-line benefits after 18 months, particularly in sales and marketing areas, but remarks that the main effort has to go into business thinking, not programming. 'It's not a question of who can program it, but of who can understand the business, and translate those needs into an application,' he says. 'The analysts must understand the business in general, and be able to translate the business needs of others.'

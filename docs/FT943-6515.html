			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs and sales professionalism Sir, Your report on the professionalism of salespeople, or lack of it, ('Unloved and incompetent', August 25) is, sadly, largely true. The Kinnaird survey findings are similar to those of the Sales Qualifications Board's survey, published last year at the launch of the first sales NVQs. Apart from the self-employed sector, total employment costs, last year, of the UK's 400,000 salesmen and women, were Pounds 11.8bn - 4 per cent of their companies' total sales revenue and, in many cases, their largest overhead. Our survey showed that less than 5 per cent had any recognised qualification in selling and that none of these qualifications were to any nationally agreed standard of competence. The sales NVQs now on offer, have been designed not just to focus training on the essential competencies required of salespeople in any industry, but to give salespeople the opportunity to be part of a recognised profession. More than 300 companies have embarked on the process of becoming assessment centres for sales NVQs, which shows that the industry does recognise the problem. Richard Berry, Sales Qualifications Board, London, WC2 9DP</p>

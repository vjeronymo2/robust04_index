			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Books: Arabia re-visited - Children's Book of the Month THE ARABIAN NIGHTS by Brian Alderson, illustrated by Michael Foreman Victor Gollancz Pounds 14.99, 192 pages IT COULD be argued that the book known as The Arabian Nights, that fascinating oriental patchwork of tales, jests and moral instances, is as much a fabrication of the 18th century as Percy's Reliques or any of those other attempts that were made during that century of so-called Enlightenment to 'rescue from oblivion' collections of old ballads and the like. In fact, the primary source for what came to be known as The Arabian Nights was Antoine Galland's French translation of 1704, which led very quickly to an English version. Galland had consulted a range of Arabian manuscripts but these sources did not include versions of some of the most famous tales in the collection, Aladdin and Ali Baba. According to Brian Alderson, the historian of children's literature who has produced this splendid new edition of the book, Galland heard these tales from the mouth of a Maronite storyteller who happened to be wandering the streets of Europe. The fictional narrator Sheherazade was, of course, a woman of quite awe-inspiring stamina when it came to telling stories - such are the lengths to which a human being is prepared to go when threatened with decapitation - and Alderson's offering of a mere 192 pages is less than 10 per cent of what the most complete version might be. Earlier abridged editions of The Arabian Nights often have left her out altogether because of the delays that must occur inevitably when morning comes and the tale-telling is interrupted; but the truth is that her presence is an enriching element, making certain tales more poignant or more suspenseful. What Alderson has sought to do in his rendering of the book is to re-create the sense of exoticism that the idea of The Arabian Nights evokes in the reader. So, he has resorted in his prose to what he himself describes accurately as a 'richly upholstered Victorian' style, which serves his purpose well. Not being an Arabic scholar, he has leant heavily upon both Sir Richard Burton's great 16-volume Nights and Supplemental Nights of 1885-1888, so beloved of Somerset Maugham, and John Payne's translation, also of the 19th century. What is perhaps most interesting about The Arabian Nights is the extent to which so many of the tales, fables and moral instances have found their way into European folklore and fable. Motifs appear that find a parallel in Grimm or Andersen. On one occasion - the delightful tale of a faithful parrot that is embedded in a larger sequence entitled 'The Fisherman and the Jinni' - the story finds an echo, according to Alderson, in a similar anecdote recorded in England as late as 1914 when a parrot was called a liar because it 'talked about the day it rained beans and bacon after the cook had thrown the dinner at it.' This is the oral tradition at work again, burrowing underground like a colony of moles, moving in many directions at once. And no one is quite sure where they will appear next.</p>

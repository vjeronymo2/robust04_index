			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF COLLEGE SPORTS ON TRIAL  </P> <P> Apart from the Jeff Koterba cartoon (April 13) depicting the (Norby)  Walters-(Lloyd) Bloom trial as opening the Pandora's box of college sports  deceits, the media seems to have missed the point.  </P> <P> The trial was exploiting the deeper hypocrisy of college sports. If Walters and  Bloom are guilty of fraud in advancing loans, then what about the fraud of the  universities?  </P> <P> It was really big business college sports that was on trial.  </P> <P> RICHARD GUTTMAN  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

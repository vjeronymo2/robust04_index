			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Government puts brakes on Taiwan's rally - But the stock market speculators might not stay away for long GOVERNMENT action to prevent what it saw as a return to the destructive, speculative fever of two years ago appears to have nipped Taiwan's New Year stock market rally in the bud. Analysts say, however, that the country's bright economic outlook and relative political stability suggest the speculative money might not stay away for long. The stock market's 17.2 per cent rise in January was mainly liquidity-driven, as is traditional in the weeks before the Chinese New Year, with year-end bonuses and settling of accounts boosting the amount of money in circulation. The victory of the Nationalist Kuomintang government in last December's National Assembly elections also boosted confidence, as fears about political stability, generated by opposition calls for independence, were temporarily abated. Most of the island's top 40 industrial stocks rose in line with the market in January, with President Enterprises showing a 20 per cent increase and Uniglory Marine a rise of 41.3 per cent in that month. A notable exception was Microelectronics, normally a favourite with foreign investors, which has seen a big fall-off in earnings since this time last year. Its shares rose by a mere 1.9 per cent during January's rally and have since fallen by around 10 per cent. But when trading resumed on February 8, after the week-long Chinese New Year holiday, the stock market tumbled by 2.9 per cent as domestic investors, of whom around 85 per cent are individuals, deserted equities in droves. There were widespread fears that the central bank would tighten monetary policy after Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun expressed concern that the stock market was losing touch with reality. With the painful memory of the 1990 crash still present, when the weighted index plunged by 80 per cent, the government's policy towards the stock market has increasingly been to clamp down at the first sign of overheating. The central bank's pledge to keep a tighter rein on the money supply after a 20 per cent rise in the M2 measure in January, has had a dampening effect on the stock market. The central bank has also issued more than TDollars 72bn (Dollars 2.9bn) of bonds and bills since February 8 in an attempt to mop up excess liquidity, but, analysts say, with only limited success to date. However, it was the central bank's decision in mid-February to put a squeeze on the inflow of foreign equity investment capital, just one year after opening the market to foreigners, that came as the biggest shock. The central bank's decision to suspend funds from abroad for purchases of equities in Taiwan was apparently aimed at relieving upward pressure on the local currency against the US dollar. Even so, it aroused worries about investing in the island. The weighted index fell by 3.3 per cent on February 17 and another 1.9 per cent the following day to the month's low of 4,766.91, a fall of 11.6 per cent from the year's high of 5,391.63 on January 30. The unofficial ban is still in effect, although the bank decided in principle last week to consider new applications, provided that they were subject to strict scheduling requirements and a daily ceiling of Dollars 5m. The central bank has said it is waiting for foreign exchange markets to stabilise before the inflow of foreign funds into the island can return to normal. The stock market has since recovered, the weighted index closing at 5,033.53 yesterday. Analysts say the prospects look good for a solid first half, but they do not expect the index to rally beyond 6,000. Government plans to issue up to TDollars 192.5bn of bonds between February and June are intended to keep up the drain on liquidity. With such a high proportion of individual investors, however, Taiwan's stock market is likely to remain volatile and vulnerable to manipulators, who ramp share prices up and down, followed en masse by individuals who aim to take profits in their wake. Mr Steve Champion, of International Investment Trust, says that for the manipulators to be less effective, more foreign and institutional investment will be needed. As another analyst said: 'It's still a rocky road to maturity.'</p>

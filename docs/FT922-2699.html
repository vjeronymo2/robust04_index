			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Packaging mess THE European Community produces an annual 50m tonnes of waste from the packaging of consumer and industrial goods. It is an environmental mess in voters' own backyards. Unfortunately, individual governments around Europe are tackling the problem in counter-productive ways. The EC's attempts to decide harmonised rules and targets for disposal of packing refuse have become badly bogged down. A planned directive on packaging waste has gone through four preliminary drafts in the past 18 months. But the Commission will now probably wait until after the summer break before formalising a final proposal. The measure will not pass into national law before 1995 at the earliest. A viable packaging directive is badly needed to accompany next year's single market. Proliferating national regulations and systems, unless checked, could become not only a symbol of lack of common policies on the environment, but also a serious impediment to trade. The packaging impasse underscores the difficulties of bridging gaps among richer and poorer states. Common rules must be acceptable both to the 'green' north and to less environmentally-conscious Mediterranean states. The Commission aims to reduce sharply volumes for final disposal by increasing the proportion of packaging re-used in industrial processes, either by recycling, or through material or energy recovery (for instance, incineration). The Commission wants countries to recover or recycle 90 per cent of all packing waste output over 10 years, compared with the present average of 18 per cent. Ambitious objectives like this are needed if industry is to provide the necessary technological solutions, but the EC must take care lest it sets across-the-board targets which, for difficult products like plastics, cannot be met. Germany has led the way in the greening of packaging laws by tightening industry's obligations to take back and re-use packing material. Other countries have also introduced tough national schemes. A packaging free-for-all causes three sets of problems. First, if countries introduce rules banning or restricting, say, beer in non-returnable bottles, this amounts to a restriction on trade - discriminating against both importers and companies from different regions of the same country. Second, targets and collection systems may be uneconomic. Surplus waste collected in one country can spill into other countries, depressing material prices and hampering recycling schemes. Third, poorly-thought out recycling networks can produce an overall negative environmental impact when all the energy and pollution costs are taken into account. The EC must seek to marry principles of environmental soundness with measures which do not fragment and distort markets. Its packaging strategy must rely on economic incentives as far as possible. Above all, governments must show the political will to knit together the present regulatory patchwork into a cohesive whole. Speedy action to break the packaging logjam would be a welcome sign that - whatever the clouds over the Maastrict process - the Community can maintain momentum in a vital area of its business.</p>

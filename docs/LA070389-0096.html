			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AQUINO BARS MARCOS, ALIVE OR DEAD  </P> <P> Deposed Philippine leader Ferdinand E. Marcos will not be allowed back to his  homeland dead or alive, President Corazon Aquino said today.  </P> <P> Aquino said she was opposed to the return of Marcos, 71, because of the  potential trouble his supporters could cause. The former president is near  death in a Honolulu hospital.  </P> <P> Asked why she was opposed to the return of Marcos when he died, the president  said:  </P> <P> "We realize that Mr. Marcos is a Filipino citizen and should be allowed to come  back. However, I also have to think about the lives of the millions of  Filipinos whose lives could be affected by the return of Mr. Marcos, because  his supporters, and especially his family and his associates, could be thinking  of ways and means to destabilize this government."  </P></p>

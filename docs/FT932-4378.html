			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy eases rules on savings instrument THE Bank of Italy yesterday moved a step further in its liberalisation of money market instruments by relaxing rules on issuing certificates of deposit. Separately, the treasury announced it would issue L2,857bn in new five-year floating-rate notes to repay some of the 'frozen' tax credits due to Italy's biggest banks and companies. The changes to the rules on one of Italy's most popular savings instruments will benefit both bank issuers and investors. Opportunities for savers will be increased as banks will be able to issue CDs in foreign currencies, rather than just lire, or the domestic currency indexed to foreign currencies. The minimum size of individual certificates will be reduced to L1m from L5m, broadening the appeal. Moreover, banks will be given much greater flexibility on interest rates paid, with the possibility of paying different coupons for certificates of similar maturity, depending on their size. The liberalisation also directly benefits banks. The Bank of Italy has eased the conditions on reserve requirements for CDs, which earlier this year were lowered to 10 per cent of banks' holdings from 17.5 per cent. The rate of interest on the obligatory reserves of CDs will also be increased from 5.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The rules regarding obligatory reserve requirements on CDs with shorter maturities, treated as cash, have already been eased. The tax credits repayment will benefit the big ENI state energy and chemicals group in particular. It will receive about L800bn in new floating-rate notes, while more than L600bn is due to the IRI state holding company.</p>

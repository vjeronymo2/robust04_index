			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Rail strike to go ahead at midnight RAIL travellers were warned yesterday by British Rail to finish their journeys by 10 o'clock tonight or risk being stranded. Last-minute talks between BR management and union negotiators failed to avert a 24-hour national rail strike which is due to start at midnight. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union are protesting about threatened compulsory redundancies and the use of outside contractors. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, said after the talks: 'They asked me to give a guarantee of jobs for life in the railway which I obviously couldn't give. They're asking for something no employee in the land has got.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the union regretted BR 'were unable to see their way to meet what we thought were reasonable demands'. In London, many buses will be off the roads in a separate dispute over cuts in pay for employees. Mr Steven Norris, London transport minister, last night warned commuters that parking restrictions would be 'vigorously enforced' along main routes, and announced a string of measures to cope with the expected influx of cars during the rail strike.</p>

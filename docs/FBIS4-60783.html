			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>   [Text] At the beginning of a news conference at the  Supreme Soviet, Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb summed up the results of  the extraordinary, 14th, Supreme Soviet session. He dwelt on  the changes and addenda to certain legislative acts in  connection with the signing of the monetary merger agreement  with Russia. In particular, he said:    [Begin Hryb recording] In accordance with the agreement in  the area of tariff regulations on external economic activities,  both sides should introduce identical customs tariffs, taxes,  and duties with regard to imports and exports. Under these  conditions, customs duties in mutual trade are canceled as of 1  May. The Russian side also commits itself to fully abolish  customs duties on supplies of energy resources and raw materials  to Belarus. Under this commitment, imports from Russia will be  much cheaper. The decrease in prices for energy resources and  raw materials in connection with the abolishment of customs  duties will allow us to decrease the production cost of  Belarusian goods, as well as [word indistinct] production and  trade in our Republic. [end recording]    Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb then introduced  members of the Constitutional Court to journalists. These  judges were elected by Supreme Soviet deputies at yesterday's  extraordinary session. Mechyslaw Hryb described how deputies  were nominated for this high post.    [Begin Hryb recording] Candidates for this high post were  put forward with the participation of people's deputies,  permanent commissions -- especially the Commission for  Legislation and the Commission for Statehood Building, and the  Supreme Soviet Presidium. Proposals were also made by the  Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus, the Prosecutor's  General Office, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, and the Justice  Ministry. This work was being carried out openly, with the  broad discussion of candidacies in Supreme Soviet commissions  and at the Presidium sessions.    As you can see, there were many candidates proposed for the  Constitutional Court. At Presidium sessions, we considered  several dozen candidates. At the Supreme Soviet session, we  considered 16 people, after listing them on a secret ballot.  There were 10 candidates introduced on the secret ballot due to  the fact that the Constitutional Court should comprise 11  judges: nine members, one deputy chairman, and one chairman.  All this was agreed upon. Nine judges of the Constitutional  Court were elected by secret ballot. One candidate did not go  through on the ballot. Thus, according to the law on the  Constitutional Court, this judicial body, with regard to the  number of judges, is legitimate and can begin work today.  According to our laws, the Constitutional Court is legitimate if  the body has at least seven members. So, it is legitimate. The  Constitutional Court chairman will be elected by the Supreme  Soviet at the recommendation of the future president. As has  become known, at their session yesterday, members of the  Constitutional Court elected Professor Valeryy Tsikhinya, doctor  of juridical sciences, deputy chairman of the Constitutional  Court.

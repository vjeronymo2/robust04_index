			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Germany The March surge in German money supply may have shocked Frankfurt's financial markets, but the Bundesbank is unlikely to risk international opprobrium by raising interest rates. Equally, with the M3 aggregate growing at an annual rate of nearly 10 per cent, there is less reason than ever to expect a cut in official rates this year. Higher rates might make the money supply problem worse. The inverted yield curve has already swollen demand for short-term bank deposits, which form part of M3, at the expense of bond investment. That is pushing up the rates on government paper, incidentally limiting the scope for lower gilt yields in the UK. Interest rates are a blunt instrument for curbing credit when generous subsidies are available on loans to eastern Germany. But all the Bundesbank can do now is sit tight till inflation abates. If Germany's European partners cannot accept the consequences, their only recourse is a realignment. What price Maastricht then?</p>

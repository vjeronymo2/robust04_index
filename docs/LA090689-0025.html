			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'CHAMPION' SPOTLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL WITHIN US ALL  </P> <P> "The Champion Within," airing at 8 tonight on channels 28, 15 and 24, is an  excellent choice to launch this season's "Infinite Voyage" series.  </P> <P> A slight departure from the science series' usual fare, "Champion" -- a look at  researchers who are using athletes as living laboratories to better understand  the human body and make it function more efficiently -- is a well-paced show  that will hit home with viewers who share the national passion for physical  fitness.  </P> <P> But there is more to this hourlong documentary than just a narrow focus on  already exceptional athletes trying to perform better. Writer-producer Richard  J. Wells has taken "Champion" a step further, showing how the benefits of the  research can apply to just about everybody.  </P> <P> Case in point: the segment on Dr. Peter Cavanagh. A researcher at Penn State,  Cavanagh initially was concerned simply with improving running shoes. This led  to efforts to design shoes for patients with severe medical problems. In  "Champions," Cavanagh is seen working with a diabetic who is endangered by an  ulcerated foot as a result of losing feeling in her feet. Cavanagh's custom-fit  tennis shoe will help protect her and restore some of her lost mobility.  </P> <P> Mobility is something that athletes take for granted, but the ability to get  about can make a major difference in the quality of life of an older person.  "One of the myths is that as we get older, our ability to respond to exercise  is reduced," says Dr. Bill Evans of the USDA Nutrition Research Center on Aging  in Boston. "That's simply not true." Evans' test group of octogenarians showed  the same increases in muscle size and strength after aggressive training as did  young people -- a happy proof that it's never too late to start exercising.  </P> <P> Much of the appeal of "Champion" (which also will air Monday on KTTV Channel  11) is its skill in imparting an understanding of our innate potential. The  human body is capable of performing remarkable feats -- in everyday life. As  this show amply demonstrates, we can all exceed our expectations, push the  limits of our self-imposed boundaries.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Split trust launch A NEW split capital trust is being launched to tap the revived enthusiasm of private investors for the investment trust sector. Schroder Split Fund will offer a mix of zero coupon shares, income shares and capital shares. The zeros, as their name suggests, will pay no income but aim to give the investor steady capital growth. The zeros' launch price is 100p and the planned repayment value will be 203p in 2002, a gross redemption yield of 8.25 per cent a year. Profits will be taxed as capital gains, and will be effectively tax-free, since few investors use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance. The zeros are 125 per cent covered at launch - in other words, the trust has more than enough assets at launch to repay the 2002 redemption value of the zeros in full. The income shares will have a gross initial yield of 9 per cent, at the issue price of 100p. There is a significant risk of loss of capital; the trust's assets will have to grow at 4.2 per cent per annum for the shares to be repaid in full. However, the income shares can participate in the trust's growth. If the assets and income of Schroder Split rise by 7.5 per cent per annum, then the gross redemption yield will be 13 per cent. Schroder is also offering a new High Income personal equity plan, based on the income shares. There will be no initial charge on the Pep between February 10 and March 4; the annual charge will be 1 per cent plus VAT. Income will be paid quarterly. The capital shares will be entitled to the remaining assets after the income and zero shareholders have been repaid. Shareholders will only be repaid their original investment of 25p if the assets grow by 4.7 per cent per annum between launch and 2002. The 'gearing' effect means capital shareholders will do well out of a bull market. If the trust's assets and income grow at 7.5 per cent per annum, the capital shareholders will receive a gross redemption yield of 21.5 per cent pa. One problem with some split capital trusts is that, to meet the income requirements, the manager has to invest in high-yielding stocks or convertibles, at the expense of capital growth. The portfolio yield on Schroder Split will be 5.5 per cent which the manager argues is lower than on many other split trusts. The launch expenses of the trust will be capped at 4 per cent and total annual expenses will be 0.7 per cent.</p>

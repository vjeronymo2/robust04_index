			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Paris Opera officials Thursday named 36-year-old Myung-Whun Chung music  director of the Bastille Opera, confirming reports of the appointment widely  circulated earlier this week. The Korean-born conductor -- who leads the radio  orchestra in Saarbrucken, West Germany, and was associate conductor of the Los  Angeles Philharmonic under Carlo Maria Giulini -- succeeds Daniel Barenboim,  who was fired from the post in January by Pierre Berge, the  government-appointed chairman of the Paris Opera board. Elements in the  Barenboim-Berge conflict were the conductor's $1.1-million salary for four  months, and artistic control over the composition of the opera orchestra and  the naming of stage directors. No details on Chung's salary or the length of  his contract were given, but Chung did say that it calls for him to be in Paris  for at least six months a year, and gives him final say in the hiring of stage  directors. A compromise on revamping the orchestra is still being worked out.  The Bastille position, which was previously offered to Charles Mackerras and  Marek Janowski, among others, will be Chung's first opera directorate. Neither  Chung nor Berge offered any specific plans for the first season in the new  opera house, which will be inaugurated July 13 with a special concert as part  of the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution.  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Taking control of Father's finances MY FATHER, who is 87 and lives alone, is gradually becoming less able to manage his affairs. He has, for instance, recently sold for a nominal sum various antiques, including some furniture, to dealers who made a casual call to his house. He has no record of the transaction, no name or address of the dealer and no means of recovering his property. There are many other examples of his inability to deal with his personal finances and he claims to have lost various sums of cash from his money belt while out shopping. I believe it is now necessary to supervise his financial affairs. What would need to be done to be done to arrange this? For instance, how would I go about securing a power of attorney? I also believe that the time is approaching for him to consider a move to supervised accommodation. Who should I contact for information on private and local authority homes and how should I pay for their services? You may need to obtain an Enduring Power of Attorney, if your father is still capable of executing a legal document such as that. You should consult the social services department in his local authority for the information which you require. If you obtain an Enduring Power of Attorney you must see that it is registered as soon as possible. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

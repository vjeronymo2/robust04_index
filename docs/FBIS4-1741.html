			<p>BFN     [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], April 3 (XINHUA) -- A Myanmar  [Burmese] mission will be sent to Muse, a town on Myanmar-China  border, to supervise legal and free gem trade from May 1, 1994.    An official report here said that Minister for Mines Lt-Gen  Kyaw Min inspected certain towns along Myanmar-China border on  April 1.    He found there is gem smuggling in those towns, so measures  are to be taken to prevent it, while allowing legal and free gem  trade.    As for the supervision commission, the minister said it will  help negotiate deals between local merchants and foreign traders.    Out of the proceeds, he said, 15 percent will be taxed and  current accounts for the remaining 85 percent will be opened at  the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom stocks in demand STRONG US buying for telecom issues in the wake of this week's announcement of a Dollars 22bn merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc proved the spur for the strong advance of the market as a whole. The demand for telecom stocks, first seen on Thursday, came early in the session, though a host of other features also played their part in the day's rise. BT was one of several stocks to gain from the rally and sentiment was further enhanced by reports of recommendations from Strauss Turnbull and UBS. The shares moved 9 1/2 ahead to 456 1/2 p, as turnover soared to a hefty 14m. It was also the day's most active stock in the traded options where the equivalent of an additional 4.4m shares was also dealt. It was the strong overnight performance of the Hong Kong market that was the additional bonus for Cable &amp; Wireless. C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom, a substantial contributor to C&amp;W's earnings. The shares raced forward and at the day's best were up 42 at 995p, before a bout of profit-taking saw them relinquish some of the early gains to finish a 17 up at 967p, after trade of 7.9m. Other strong performances in the sector came from Securicor 'A' which put on 3 to 790p, and Vodafone Group, 8 better at 559p. After a recent good run, favoured by investors looking for positions in defensive stocks, the water sector is now braced for a period of uncertainty. None of the stocks, which provide a refuge in a shaky market with high yields, was able to run with yesterday's momentum that swept through most other sectors. Most of the shares gave up a few pence. According to one analyst the sector has been overbought and is poised for a balancing. 'It is nervous at these levels and the market has begun to realise that.' Also hanging over water stocks is the impending announcement of the methodology which Ofwat intends to use in its pricing decisions. Caution is likely to trouble the stocks ahead of the news expected early next month. Welsh fell back 8 to 654p; Northumberland lost 4 to 675p; North West gave up 3 to 556p and South West went down 3 to 579p. The buoyant Hong Kong market boosted several stocks in the banks sector. These included HSBC, 10 better at 756p, Standard Chartered which also put on 10 to finish at 1024p. Lloyds, which has a stake in Standard, gained 14 to 577p. However it was a recommendation from Morgan Stanley that was said to have responsible for the advance in Abbey National where the shares put on 8 to 425p. Lasmo, which suffered slightly in the previous session after a debt downgrading by Moody's, managed a convincing fightback. Market talk had it that the shares' rally was down to interest over a proposed asset sale by the company. European buyers are thought to be offering bids in excess of the Pounds 100m expected for Lasmo's stake in the Markham North Sea gas field. The shares gained 5 to 141p in strong turnover of 7.1m. Strong activity was seen in British Gas shares ahead of it going ex-dividend on Monday with the stock being pursued by basket traders and income funds. In healthy turnover of 12m the price moved up 7 1/2 to 336p. One analyst also saw a little psychological fillip for energy shares in the first taste of a winter cold snap. BP traded in sound volume of 10m with shares firming a penny to 326 1/2 p. A boost for Burmah came with the change in stance by Hoare Govett. The broker turned from a hold position to a buy. Enterprise continued to benefit from positive sentiment and pushed up 8 to 487p. The strong market trend boosted Shell Transport helping the shares rise 8 1/2 to 689p. A placing of 5m Storehouse shares by Panmure Gordon, the London broking house, was behind the well-above average activity in the stock. The placing at 200p helped boost volume to 10m and the shares gained 4 to close at 203p. Shares in Northern Foods trailed the market, falling 5 to 242p, on the possibility that it may reduce its milk prices following Tesco's move to slash the price. Analysts said, however, that the move only affected Tesco whose shares hardened a penny to 203p. Sentiment in the US for brand name food companies spilled into the UK market benefiting several stocks. These included Cadbury Schweppes. where the shares gained 8 to 472p, Unilever, which jumped 21 to 1115p, and United Biscuits, 2 better at 367p. Brewing group Allied-Lyons was boosted by the same sentiment and the shares advanced 14 to 583p. A line of stock overhanging Allied Colloids was said to be largely responsible for the stock's slip of 4 1/2 to 236p. ICI kept in step with the market adding 10 to 729p albeit in low volume. The prospect of cuts in UK defence spending cast a cloud over several stocks in the field causing them to buck the market trend. GEC lost 9 to 344p, on speculation that a new missile programme could be in danger. Shipbuilder VSEL was also out of favour on the prospect of cuts in naval spending. The shares eased 4 to 845p. Automotive and aerospace components group Lucas Industries were in demand, with those who favour the stock continuing to believe an announcement of a the group's new chief executive is about to be made. The shares gained 8 to 175p as 5.5m were traded.</p>

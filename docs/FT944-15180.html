			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record western lead and zinc demand forecast Demand for both lead and zinc in the western world will reach record levels this year and rise again in 1995, helping to bring the markets back into balance gradually next year. This optimistic message comes from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, an intergovernmental organisation with members from 30 countries, which has been meeting in Vienna. It says demand for the two metals will continue to be driven by strong growth in the US and a recovery in Europe. Zinc demand in Europe next year is forecast to reach 2m tonnes, a level not seen since 1991. But little change is expected in Japan. However, the group said the outlook for lead was the more positive and added that it recognised 'that the stocks of zinc in London Metal Exchange warehouses currently exceed 1.2m tonnes or 10 weeks of consumption'. Production from zinc mines is therefore expected to fall again this year - by 2 per cent to 5.13m tonnes - after an 8 per cent drop in 1993. But zinc mine output is then expected to rebound, by 5 per cent, in 1995 as production is increased in Australia and Canada. Exports, notably from China where zinc output rose substantially last year - by 209,000 tonnes to 857,000 tonnes - will continue to plague western markets this year, according to the group, but are expected to be below the 380,000 tonnes seen in 1993. Zinc consumption is forecast to rise by 4 per cent to 5.76m tonnes this year and by a further 3.6 per cent to 5.97m tonnes in 1995. Zinc metal production is expected to be up by 1 per cent to 5.38m tonnes and by another 1.5 per cent to 5.45m tonnes in 1995. The group says former eastern bloc countries are providing accurate data on their lead and zinc industries. It forecasts zinc metal output in these countries will be about 1.61m tonnes this year and next, 'depending on trends in the CIS', while consumption in both years will reach 960,000 tonnes. Lead metal production in the former eastern bloc will be about 900,000 tonnes in 1994 and 1995, according to the group, while consumption will be 590,000 tonnes. In the western countries, lead consumption this year is forecast to grow by 5 per cent to 4.72m tonnes. Lead metal output is expected to rise by 3 per cent to 4.55m tonnes, most of which will be recycled metal. But about 2m will come from mines. Next year consumption is forecast to rise by 2 per cent to 4.83m tonnes, while metal production is expected to go up by 2 per cent to 4.65m tonnes, including 2.03m tonnes from mines. Lead exports from eastern Europe are expected to remain 'substantial' this year but might decrease in 1995.</p>

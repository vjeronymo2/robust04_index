			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Swans at risk in MoD order delay Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, faces a damaging four-month wait to hear whether it has won a Ministry of Defence order crucial to its future. The MoD said yesterday it would not decide until July which company had won the refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship, for which the tender deadline is next Thursday. Swan Hunter's receiver, Price Waterhouse, which is optimistic of receiving at least one bid for the company before Thursday, expects any bids to be conditional on the award of Sir Bedivere, an 18-month contract which could be worth around Pounds 30m. But as one of the two remaining frigates at Swan Hunter - the company's only current orderbook - will be completed and handed over in mid-May, more redundancies may then be inescapable if the refit award remains uncertain. With the workforce already cut by nearly 1,500 to 1,038 since receivership in May last year, additional redundancies could threaten the 'golden nugget' of skilled Swan Hunter employees which the receivers have described as the 'essence' of the business they are seeking to sell. Yet for Swan Hunter's bid to have a chance of success, it must be underwritten by a prospective purchaser guaranteeing completion to cost and on time. Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said earlier this week that he hoped the MoD would take the minimum time necessary to consider the tenders. Six tenders are likely for the refit. The MoD said three to four months was needed to assess them properly. A spokesman said: 'It certainly won't be before then.' On Monday Swan Hunter union leaders, who see the Sir Bedivere refit as crucial to Swan Hunter's survival, launch a three-day lobbying campaign at Westminster. They are targeting 139 Conservative MPs in whose constituencies there are companies which work for Swans or could do so.</p>

Specialists in emitted light facilities, who are few  in number worldwide, will be trained, and new ways of utilizing  emitted light will be developed by focussing on a flexible  research system in which the facility will be opened to  researchers both from Japan and abroad.    JASRI was established in 1990 in order to unify the  management of Spring-8; the beginning of operations is scheduled  for 1997 when a part of the equipment will go on line.    The basic kinds of research will include: 1) development of  new fields for the utilization of emitted light; 2) research to  advance the equipment; and 3) support for the experiments of  extramural researchers who will use the facility.    In order to heighten the efficiency of research, research  themes are being studied by a committee that includes extramural  specialists. The fluidity of researchers will be increased by  setting time limits for research themes. A utilization system is  being prepared which will be truly open to extramural  researchers.    The STA has taken a course of creating legislation in order  to smoothly promote the management and operation of this  facility.    Spring-8 is a circular accelerator with a circumference of  approximately 1.4 kilometers, and it can heighten the energy up  to 8 giga-electron volts. By bending this electron beam with  magnets SPring-8 can generate light emissions that are about  1,000 times brighter than that of conventional equipment.    It is expected that, in addition to basic research in  physics, the facility will play a role in a wide variety of  research fields such as the diagnosis of blood vessels in the  heart, and the analysis of semiconductor materials on the atomic  level. Test operations will begin from 1997. The facility will  be of a larger scale and will have a higher performance than  similar equipment that is being built in Europe and the United  States.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Government onslaught on Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR'S senior colleagues last night launched a concerted onslaught on the Conservative party's Euro-sceptics as the prime minister sought to revive his government's battered political fortunes. The attempt at the Conservatives' spring conference in Harrogate to isolate opponents of the Maastricht treaty was led by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman. It coincided with a similarly orchestrated effort by ministers to convince a wider UK audience that the economy is emerging from recession. That will be followed later today by an upbeat speech by Mr Major himself in which he will claim that the economy of the UK - and its government - are now turning the corner. Underlining the government's intention to speed up the Maastricht ratification process, Mr Hurd said that as long as the debate over the treaty continued the Conservatives were left 'divided' and Britain was 'unable to pull its weight'. Voicing weariness with the protracted debate at Westminster, Mr Hurd said: 'It's in the national interest that we ratify the treaty. Let's get on with it.' He warned that if the trench warfare in the House of Commons was allowed to derail the treaty, British ministers would be reduced to 'bit-part players' in deliberations on the future of Europe. Economic recovery in Britain would be jeopardised as its European partners pushed ahead without restraint with their plans for a single currency. As Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, picked up the same themes, Mr Hurd confirmed that the government had decided to complete the ratification process before the parliamentary recess in July or early August. Mr Clarke told reporters that the Conservatives had always tolerated dissent but the cabinet now judged that it was threatening the authority of the government. 'Enough is enough is what we are now saying to the Euro-rebels,' he said. That foreshadows several fresh confrontations with the party's Euro-sceptics over the next few weeks as Tory business managers seek to accelerate the pace of the detailed scrutiny of the legislation in the House of Commons. But senior ministers were emphasising privately that the cabinet was now determined to staunch the wounds inflicted by the ratification process. In an effort to detach the dissidents on the Tory backbenches from their local constituency associations, Sir Norman issued a blunt demand to the activists at yesterday's meeting of the central council for loyalty both to the government's European policy and to Mr Major personally. In deliberately uncompromising language, Sir Norman said party unity could not be regarded as an 'optional extra' by Tory MPs, reminding them that they should 'never forget' that Mr Major had led the Conservatives to their fourth election victory. For his part, Mr Heseltine accused the Euro-sceptics of undermining Mr Major's influence with his European counterparts in future negotiations. Sir Norman made a veiled threat that senior MPs opposed to the treaty might risk their executive seats on the 1922 committee of backbench MPs if they continued to vote against the government on procedural motions. Senior ministers, however, played down suggestions from some pro-Europeans that rebel Tory MPs might face expulsion from the party. Grassroots rebels, Page 6</p>

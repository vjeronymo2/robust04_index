			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Conventional cars are multiplying - All 1994 models are safer than the cars they will replace. The industry has also been trying to minimise their impact on the environment / New Models IN an ideal world, all the new cars which will make their debut at Frankfurt and Tokyo motor shows would have been designed simply and solely as safe, economical personal transport making the minimum impact on the environment. Some of them have - although they are mainly concept cars which may or may not go into production. In the meantime, conventional cars with potential maximum speeds exploitable only at rare intervals on the de-restricted parts of Germany's autobahnen are alive and multiplying. The new Porsche 911 and Toyota's new Supra, which is capable of 180 mph (290 kph) but restricted to a more seemly 155 mph (250kph), prove that the supercar is surprisingly resistant to the disapproval of the environmental/conservationist lobby. To be sure, all 1994 models, be they European, American or Far Eastern, are safer than the cars they will replace. And the industry has been going to great lengths (and enormous expense) to minimise their environmental impact during manufacture, for the whole of their working lives and when they are finally scrapped. Active safety has been enhanced by the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) which have become standard equipment on medium and higher priced cars. Traction control systems, using the same electronic sensors as ABS, are gradually being introduced. Permanently engaged four-wheel drive is available on a limited number of purely road-going cars for buyers who feel the need for maximum possible tyre grip for performance or safety reasons. On the passive safety front, reinforcing bars are now fitted to the cheapest cars to limit intrusion into the passenger protecting cell in side-on accidents. Buyers of executive-class cars now expect driver-side airbags as standard equipment, with passenger-side airbags as not-too-expensive optional extras. ProCon Ten, an ingeniously simple mechanical system which pulls forward the steering wheel in an impact severe enough to displace the engine backward and simultaneously tightens the seat belts against driver and front passenger remains exclusive to Audi. There are signs that it will be abandoned in favour of airbags. The new VW Passat being launched at Frankfurt has them as standard for both front seat occupants. Impact-sensitive, self-tightening belts, however, are now common to most makes of car. Inevitably, improving the driver's chances of preventing a hazardous situation from developing into a collision, and protecting a car's occupants better if the worst should happen, has its downside. Making new models crash-safer has increased their weight and complication. To maintain or improve performance, particularly acceleration and easy driveability in traffic, they are tending to have lower overall gearing, which does not help fuel consumption. The potentially adverse effects of heavier construction and lower gearing on fuel consumption are being offset by improved electronic management systems for petrol engines and the wider adoption of fuel-efficient diesel - and particularly turbo-diesel - engines. Volkswagen is showing at Frankfurt a management system which further improves the economy of diesel cars by shutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engine on downgrades. Saab's 900, its first new model since General Motors took a controlling interest, is to be available - initially only in the turbo version - with a Sensonic automatic clutch. This system is a half-way house. The driver still has to change gear with a conventional lever but there is no clutch pedal. Sensonic provides many of the advantages of a conventional torque-converter automatic transmission without any fuel consumption penalty. Eliminating the gear lever and shifting by buttons on the steering wheel is the next step. There are signs at Frankfurt - and there will be signs at Tokyo - that a rash of really small cars is coming in the second half of this decade. New models will be nearer to the Fiat Cinquecento and Japanese microcars in overall size than existing small Europeans such as the British-made Nissan Micra, the Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa, Renault Twingo and Rover 100 (Metro in UK). Corsa and Micra have proved that in terms of performance, ride comfort and general utility, the only thing distinguishing a really small car from a medium sized one is its bulk. Mercedes-Benz, whose Vision A 93 design study is a Frankfurt talking point, speaks of growing demands by customers for cars of individuality and quality that will be suitable for use in crowded conurbations but still capable of longer journeys. BMW's 3.7 metre-long E1, designed for either battery-electric or petrol-engine power, is similarly targeted. The Fiat Cinquecento, seemingly parkable anywhere, does not feel in the least out of its depth on a motorway; and it is on the market now. Recognising that multi-cylinder buyers do not necessarily want a conventionally large car has led General Motors to offer a 2.5 V6 engine in its medium/large Opel Vectra (Vauxhall Cavalier), Calibra coupe and Saab 900. Especially when combined with automatic transmission, a small V6 is an appealing package, as Japanese producers like Mazda realised earlier on. Next year, Ford's successful Mondeo will go on sale with a US-made 2.5-litre V6 engine and automatic transmission. The civilised benefits of air conditioning have already spread from luxury to executive cars. Now they are now begining to reach the broad base of the European market, just as they did years ago in the US and Japan. At the same time, the convertible market is booming, with Peugeot launching its 306 and Volkswagen its new Golf soft-tops at Frankfurt and Saab promising a new 900 cabriolet by the spring of 1994. Just as the BX propelled Citroen into the mainstream European car market in the early 1980s, the Xantia which has just succeeded the BX is proving a powerful challenger in the fleet market traditionally dominated by Ford and GM products. It is an outstanding car, widely tipped as a likely European Car of the Year 1994 contest winner. It combines a roomy though elegantly styled body with advanced self-levelling suspension and refined diesel and turbo-diesel engines. In the luxury class, Rolls-Royce has squeezed more power from its venerable V8, while Mercedes-Benz, aware of a trend among business buyers away from very large cars with very large engines, has introduced a 2.8- litre, six-cylinder version of the S-Class. Some versions of its new C-Class saloons, which have been aimed at younger than traditional Mercedes-Benz buyers, have the world's first four-valves-per-cylinder diesel engines. Although they have been on sale for some weeks in Europe, they are making their first show appearance at Frankfurt.</p>

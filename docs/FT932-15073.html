			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Government climbs down over changes to competition law THE GOVERNMENT has backed away from radical changes to the law on anti-competitive behaviour, such as the introduction of large fines on companies. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that ministers had rejected the idea of a prohibition on abuse of market power by an individual company, and had decided that the best way forward was to strengthen the existing law. The climbdown follows intensive lobbying by the CBI and other industry representatives, which had expressed deep opposition to the prospect of fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too cheaply and refusing to supply certain outlets. When the green paper outlining options for reform was published in November, the government indicated that introducing a European-style prohibition on anti-competitive behaviour deserved 'serious consideration'. But Mr Hamilton told the House of Commons that consultation had made it clear that any benefit prohibition might bring to the consumer would be outweighed by the additional regulatory burden on business. It could even inhibit rather than promote competition because of the uncertainty it would create. He also argued that a prohibition would apply in fewer market situations than the present law, since to define in legislation what constituted anti-competitive practices would be less flexible than the existing regime. Instead, the government plans to strengthen the law in four areas. The director-general of fair trading will have greater investigative powers, such as limited rights of entry and seizure. The areas in which he can accept undertakings enforceable in the courts will be expanded. The director-general will also be able to make interim orders prohibiting specific actions by a company while an investigation is carried out by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Ministers will discuss how to deal with cases where specific property rights are exercised in an anti-competitive way, for example rights of access. Opposition MPs, who had welcomed the consultation paper, accused the government of choosing the 'soft option', and expressed concern that ministers had rejected the call from the Consumers' Association for tougher action. Mr Hamilton denied that the government had 'caved in to industry'. It was a fallacy to believe that opting for a prohibition system would have been in the consumer's interest. Not all companies were pleased by yesterday's announcement. Mercury Communications, which has 11 years' experience of living with a dominant competitor, BT, said it was 'very disappointed' that the government had not chosen a more radical option. Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, said: 'The costs argument has been overstated and has been used as an excuse for going for the option that avoided addressing the real issues.'

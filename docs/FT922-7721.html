			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sinful windows TEN YEARS ago I committed a sin: by unwittingly having two plastic windows installed on the ground floor of this Grade II listed building. Nobody noticed, however a recent event has attracted the council's notice. I have been told to replace with wood ones. I Understand that after a period of seven years they have become an 'established fact'. Is this correct? The former four-year rule does not apply to development after 1963. You can invite the Council not to exercise its power to serve an enforcement notice, but you cannot establish a legal claim to the right to keep the offending windows. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

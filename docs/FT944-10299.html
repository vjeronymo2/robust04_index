			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Lords plan register of interests The House of Lords is considering opening a register of members' interests to bring peers into line with the Commons after allegations of impropriety against MPs. The proposals, prompted by the prime minister's Commons statement on standards of public life, are being drawn up by the powerful Lords procedure committee, which sets guidelines for the conduct of business in the House. The committee, chaired by Lord Ampthill, a crossbencher, is expected to receive a report shortly from Sir Michael Wheeler-Booth, clerk of the House, on the practicalities of setting up a register. However, a register could be established only after a vote on the floor of the House. It would probably be supported by most Labour and Liberal Democrat peers, but might face opposition from Conservative backwoodsmen - peers who do not attend the House regularly. Peers say that such a big constitutional innovation would probably have to be decided on a free vote, which would mean that party leaders would have little control over the outcome. Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, was not available for comment on the proposed register. However, he told peers last month that 'in view of the current climate, it is clearly right that the question should be examined again'. Much of the impetus for the register has come from Lord Richard, Labour's leader in the Lords, who has also pressed for the upper house to be subject to oversight by the new standing committee on public standards, chaired by Lord Nolan. Lord Richard said: 'As far as we are concerned, this is something that ought to be pressed. Standards in the Lords should be the same as the standards in the Commons, and that would include a register of the interests of members.' However, peers point out that the unelected House faces special problems compiling a register. One senior peer said: 'All that could really be done would be to withdraw the party whip, which would not worry most peers too much. Quite a lot of active peers are crossbenchers anyway. 'Things are really more casual up here than they are in the Commons. It is not a just question of peers being employed by consultancies, it is that so many have outside interests of their own. 'People usually declare specific interests, but if you own half of Scotland you have an interest in almost everything that is debated. A register would not solve the problem, but it would make things more transparent.'</p>

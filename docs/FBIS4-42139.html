			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat  Ataman has said that it is long overdue for Greece to remember  its international responsibilities regarding terrorism, for it  to fulfill them without further delay, and to end the unfriendly  policies it has been pursuing against Turkey.    Replying to a question during his news conference today,  Ataman recalled the confessions of PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] militants who were caught after they came to Turkey  to carry out terrorist activities. The militants said that they  arrived in Athens from Frankfurt on 20 February, underwent  terrorist training in a camp in Greece, and then infiltrated  into Turkey from Meric river in order to attack tourist,  economic, and military targets in Turkey. Ataman pointed out  that these confessions were videotaped.    In the wake of this development, the spokesman said, Foreign  Ministry Deputy Under Secretary Unal Unsal summoned the Greek  ambassador to the ministry.    Ataman went on: "Ambassador Unsal conveyed the information  to the Greek ambassador, told him that it is understood that the  PKK is being trained in Greece and is receiving material and  moral support in that country. Unsal asked the ambassador for  information in connection with this matter and stressed that  this is a grave development."    Ataman explained that after this meeting, Ambassador Unsal  invited the U.S., French, British, and German ambassadors to the  ministry and briefed them on this grave situation.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the  requested  information has not yet arrived from Greece. He stressed that  backing terrorist organizations against Turkey will not lead  Greece anywhere. He said: "Those who sow wind today should  never forget that they will reap a storm tomorrow."</p>

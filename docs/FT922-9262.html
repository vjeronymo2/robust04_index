			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: The right formula for a chemical reaction - Paul Abrahams on how cyclical and geographical factors make the sector hard to predict Chemicals companies have proved to be the ultimate cyclical stocks. Burdened with large capital-intensive plants, they have had a tendency to do exceptionally well when times are good and particularly poorly when times are bad. With such stocks timing is crucial: the trick is to switch out of defensive companies into the cyclical ones as demand picks up. However, not all European chemical issues are straightforward recovery plays, according to Ms Wendy Anderson, European chemicals analyst at County NatWest in London. The timing of recovery for the groups will depend upon their differing exposures to cyclical businesses and geographical areas. One of the key determinants will be exposure to the US market, which is likely to recover before Europe. All European chemical companies have been reporting an upturn in demand in the US. The question is whether that upturn is sustainable. Hoechst, Bayer and Henkel in Germany, as well as Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland, have reported increasing demand in different product areas - a development that lends weight to the possibility of a sustained recovery, according to Ms Jackie Ashurst, European chemicals analyst at James Capel. One British industrialist believes chemical companies are under-reporting the recovery in the US for fear of being caught out as they were last year, when a brief upturn fizzled out. Those with the greatest exposure to a US-led recovery are Hoechst and Bayer in Germany, and Akzo in the Netherlands. Du Pont, of the US, has recently reported much improved results at its fibres operations, and Hoechst, which has a fibres business in the US, may well benefit too. The high level of dollar earnings at Rhone-Poulenc, the French group, is mostly because of its recent acquisition of a controlling stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group. Since people are ill no matter what their financial status, the company is less highly geared to a US recovery than might at first be apparent. In terms of exposure to particular markets, analysts believe it is important to avoid stocks heavily involved in the plastics and petrochemicals industries. The main difficulty in petrochemicals is overcapacity. Supply already outstrips demand, and the position is likely to deteriorate. Demand is expected to rise by only 4.5 per cent over the next two years, while supply is due to increase by 9 per cent this year, and 6 per cent in 1993. Ms Anderson at County NatWest reckons there are likely to be few plant closures because the least efficient European plants are state-owned, and governments are unwilling to take on the political implications of significant job losses. 'Any recovery in petrochemicals is likely to be slow and painful. It is possible that the sort of margins seen in the late 1980s will only return at the end of this decade,' she warns. Those companies most heavily implicated are Solvay, DSM and BASF. A further consideration in picking recovery chemical stocks is the effectiveness of the widespread cost-cutting measures. Few Continental companies have been able to implement the sort of radical restructuring carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries, of the UK. However, both Akzo and DSM have pushed through impressive programmes that have started to show in their results. In terms of timing, chemical shares are likely to underperform over the next couple of months, according to Ms Ashurst. Historically, the chemical industry goes quiet during the summer and most have recently paid their dividends. There remain concerns, too, about the state of the German economy. Ms Ashurst, however, expects stocks with US exposure and without a heavy reliance on petrochemicals to outperform the market during the second half of the year.</p>

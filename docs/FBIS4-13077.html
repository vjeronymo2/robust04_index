			<p>BFN     [Text] Esteemed Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani, leader of the  Mahaz-e Meli-ye Eslami [National Islamic Front], asks for a  cease-fire, first of all, for solving the country's current  problems. After meeting the UN secretary general's special  envoy in Peshawar, Pir Gaylani in his interview with a VOA  reporter said: After the cease-fire a Loya Jerga [great council]  or an urgent invited council should be set up. The council  should have the power to appoint the future government and its  leader, in order to take the place of the present government  after the end of term of esteemed professor Borhanoddin  Rabbani's leadership. Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani further said:  The above Shura council is to start work under the supervision  of the United Nations and Conference of the Islamic Countries  and is to take urgent action for the restoration of security. He  added: The future government can devise the constitution through  the Loya Jerga, in which the people's genuine representatives  can take part. Thus, the ground will be prepared for a free  election.</p>

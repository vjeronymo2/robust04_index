			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Antiquarian booksellers gather in Paris Blowing the dust off the image of the old books trade is a major reason why 82 leading international dealers are gathering until Wednesday in the Mutualite, on Paris's Left Bank, for their sixth biennial fair. Placed under the 'haut patronage' of the country's most eminent bibliophile, President Francois Mitterrand, this year's Foire Internationale du Livre Ancien is the biggest ever, with 24 dealers from abroad, including five from the US and three from London - Bernard Quaritch, B J Shapero and Sims Reed. Professionals in the antiquarian books business regard Paris as the capital of their trade. The city has many more top dealers than London, the French tradition of book collecting is two centuries old and there is an abundance of raw material which is not siphoned off by auction houses as happens in Britain. This year's president of the quaintly-named SLAM, which runs the fair (Syndicat National de la Librairie Ancienne et Moderne) is dealer Dominique Courvoisier, whose bookshop is near the Luxembourg Gardens, on the Left Bank  -the historic heart of the Paris book trade. This year, he said, with European frontiers open, dealers are particularly anxious to present a wide range of their best books (there are some 20,000 on show) to create a good image with the public, convince them that books are affordable and generally break down their inhibitions about visiting bookshops. According to Courvoisier, the days when the well-heeled collector patronised a single dealer are over. Nowadays, the increasing scarcity of books and bigger and better cataloguing mean that most collectors prefer to shop around. The Paris fair is expected to attract French, Italian, Belgian and German collectors, although Courvoisier says it is impossible to predict precisely who will turn up or what will sell. Courvoisier is asking FFr75,000 (about Pounds 8,900) for a very rare beauty and hygiene manual for ladies printed in Lyons in 1531. Only a handful of copies has survived 400 years' anxious consultation by women wanting to whiten their teeth with powdered stag's horn or erase their wrinkles with a mixture of white lilies and pale honey: for similar reasons of destruction through regular use, very old books of cooking recipes are extremely rare. Not all the books at the fair are either so rare, so expensive or, indeed, so ancient. Paris dealers, Didier Lecointre and Denis Ozanne are among a handful of specialists in the world who handle illustrated 20th century books on art and architecture.</p>

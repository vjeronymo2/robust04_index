			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Fashion: Glamour and warmth in thermal underwear - Vests and long johns can be shown off The whole point of underwear is, of course, that it was designed to be worn under the real McCoy, the clothes in which we present ourselves to the world. Of late, though, it has been a commonplace that what was once kept hidden is proudly revealed. British Vogue, in its January issue, goes so far as to show a photograph of the perfectly formed Kelly Klein (wife of Calvin) wearing . . . guess what . . . to a party in New York? A thermal vest. Not an embroidered bustier or a frilly bit of froth but a sensible (though sleeveless) thermal vest. And she was not wearing it underneath anything, it was what passed for her only top. Anybody who feels they might look equally fetching going to parties in thermal vests is spoilt for choice. So, too, are those who may want them for rather more mundane reasons, such as feeling a little on the chilly side. Thermal wear, I should hasten to say, has no precise meaning - it simply stands for something light and warm and indeed it is its lightness in relation to the warmth it offers that is thermal clothing's best asset. The best skinny little numbers can be hidden away under jackets, silk shirts, evening dresses and supply warmth without bulk. Their very skinniness makes them perfect with jeans, with the new season's drawstring pants (to minimise the bulk around the waist), or, with just a little bit of lace edging peeping out from under a jacket, under a silk shirt or a cashmere cardigan. Damart, possibly the most famous of all the thermal clothing suppliers, goes in for a special fibre of its own - Thermolactyl Chlorofibre - and this year it has combined it with Modal to give an even lighter, softer texture. Through its mail order brochure (ring 0274-568234 for a copy) you can still buy the straightforward thickish long johns (Pounds 17.99) and long-sleeved vests (Pounds 19.99). However, for some time Damart has offered much less utilitarian options and this year it has recruited the designer Juliet Dunn. The result is a well-priced collection which should have something for almost everybody - vests for children, lace-edged long-sleeved vests (Pounds 16.99), short-sleeved vests with delicate lace trim at the neck and trimming on the sleeves (Pounds 12.99), while its camibrief (Pounds 12.99 and like a very lacey body, only warmer) would look glamorous under a tuxedo. Marks and Spencer's Warmwear line, introduced last year, is particularly versatile (I wear it as nightwear on safaris) and although M&amp;S has more or less run out of this winter's supply, there is still some to be bought if you look around. C &amp; A produced some excellent thermal wear this winter, combining practicality with glamour and all at great prices. It still has quite a good selection in most of its stores. It, too, has homed in on glamour with lots of lace trim and scalloped edging and soft fabrics so that tops in particular can do double-duty as outerwear. Top of the range names to look out for are Hanro, a Swiss make, which besides the usual cotton and fine wool has a particularly 'thermal' range made from a combination of fine wool and silk. To team with the skinny vests (round-necked, V-necked, short-sleeved, long-sleeved) it has equally skinny and delicately lace-trimmed pants (briefs, long-leg and very long-legs). Stocked by Fenwick of New Bond Street, Harvey Nichols and Harrods, both of Knightsbridge, London SW1 and other good department stores, prices are higher with a pair of briefs selling for about Pounds 15 and a set of wool and silk long johns and long-sleeved vest costing about Pounds 120. John Smedley fine-guage woollen and sea-island cotton underwear has become a cult name. Beautifully made, the woollen range is clearly the one for chilly mortals to seek for the combination of simplicity and fine quality. Prices start at about Pounds 30 and it is sold by S. Fisher of Burlington Arcade, Way In at Harrods and by many good stores (phone 0629-534-571 for stockists).</p>

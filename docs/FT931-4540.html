			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (2): Know your customer - Credit rating is an industry in its own right THE business information market has expanded significantly over the past decade. New players have emerged to challenge the old-established groups and the demand for ever-faster credit decisions has both pushed and been pushed by rapid technological change. At the same time, only a tiny percentage of commercial sales decisions are taken on the basis of information provided by an outside credit rating agency. The challenge for the industry is two-fold: to convince more businesses of the need for properly informed sales decisions and to refine the technology to make this possible. 'Credit vetting should start at the sales stage,' says Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International (D&amp;B), which claims to be the largest provider of business information in the UK. 'The sales force will become disillusioned if it takes an order which is not accepted by the credit control department. Consider that the average cost of a sales call is Pounds 150.' 'A credit control policy should enable the sales people to concentrate on customers who will be the most profitable,' says Mr Brian Bailey, managing director of UAPT-Infolink. 'Yet often this is hampered by a conflict between the sales director and the finance director.' If these barriers can be broken down the potential for the business information providers is enormous. Only one in 15 commercial sales decisions is taken with help of 'third party' information, calculates Mr Mellor. Mr Bailey puts the figure at 'a few percent'. The reason for this reluctance may lie in the availability of business information in the UK from one central source, Companies House. Compare this with continental Europe where company information is often lodged with local chambers of commerce or even the US, where relatively few companies - 17,000 against 900,000 in the UK - are required to file returns. But the value of this information may be more apparent than real, the business information groups claim. Companies House data can be up to 15 months out of date. In boom times, let alone a recession, this delay can conceal payment problems at a company. Fortunately for the credit rating industry demand for credit information comes not just from the corporate end-user but from a host of intermediaries, financial groups such as finance and leasing companies, factors and the credit insurers. Although they collect a great deal of information themselves they provide a ready market for the services of the information companies. The task for the information provider is to collect the published information available - company reports, county court judgments, directors' disqualifications - and to supplement this with unpublished information on the past payments performance of companies and individuals. Where the information companies add value is in bringing this disparate information together in a single credit report and, even more important, interpreting it for their customers. It has been in the market for consumer information where the most rapid growth occurred during the 1980s. Increasing affluence led to a rise in the purchase, on credit, of expensive consumer durables such as video players, cars and boats. At the same time the deregulation of financial markets meant that many more financial products, also involving long-term financial commitments on the part of the purchaser, became available. Unlike the commercial sector there was often very little information available on the ability of the private individual to meet his credit commitments. And whereas a supplier could take security on the assets of a company or the personal assets of its directors there was less security available when granting credit to a private individual. Some of the information providers have their origins in serving the consumer market, providing information to mail order houses, for example, while others come from a commercial background. As time has gone by commercial pressures have forced the larger groups to provide both sorts of information, either by collecting it themselves or by establishing links with companies which could fill the gaps in their portfolio. There are considerable benefits from being able to provide both commercial and consumer information, says UAPT-Infolink's Mr Bailey. 'With new companies which do not have a trading record it is important to be able to flip over into our personal database with information on directors.' UAPT-Infolink claims to be the oldest UK credit information organisation, tracing its origins back to 1842 and the foundation of the London Association for the Protection of Trade, a mutual association of traders to exchange information about their customers. Amalgamations turned the London association into a united association or UAPT in 1965. The other main players in the business information market have also broadened their scope. D&amp;B has established links with Equifax Europe (UK), a consumer information group, while CCN which started out providing consumer information, now offers commercial information services. ICC Information Group specialised at an early stage in the financial analysis of companies and industry sectors and still provides a range of City-oriented services but it too offers credit checking information. The information collected by these organisations is available in many forms, in hard copy, print, by post, telephone, fax, viewdata or computer link-up. Increasingly information is required immediately to permit a sales decision, so on-line services have grown in importance. Customers with a heavy demand for information may take out a subscription while those with only intermittent need for information may buy one-off reports. Some customers may require a detailed financial report while others may make do with a quick credit assessment. 'We have a modular system which allows us to carry out checks to different levels of detail depending on the risk,' says Mr Kevin Still, marketing manager of UAPT-Infolink. Some of the information groups provide a written summary of the company being assessed while others have devised short-hand codes to convey a credit rating. The result of all this work on compilation and analysis has been to make information much more readily available to a broad range of users. 'The small firm can now exploit information which would have only been available to the bigger company 10 years ago,' says Mr Bruno Tavernier, a director of ICC.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / ITV takeover stance criticised A SIGNIFICANT shareholder in an ITV company yesterday wrote to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, protesting about the attitude of ITV management to takeovers. Mr Nicholas Berry, chairman of Stancroft Trust, which owns 10 per cent of Grampian, the holder of the ITV franchise for northern Scotland, said ITV chairmen and chief executives should not be campaigning against a relaxation of the takeover rules. He said he favoured more ITV takeovers as a way of realising shareholder value. In his letter to Mr Brooke Mr Berry said he did not believe that Grampian's neighbours should be prohibited from taking over the company, since this would obviously be beneficial to shareholders. 'I believe that similar views would be expressed by shareholders in the other companies,' said Mr Berry. He added that spokesmen for the companies involved, often owning a minute number of shares, represented no one but themselves. Mr Berry raised the issue following the meeting on Monday between the ITV chairmen and Mr Brooke to discuss whether there should be a relaxation of the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over. There was a majority at the meeting in favour of takeovers among the nine if, as seems likely, the government does not intend to extend the 'moratorium' on takeovers due to run out at the end of this year. It is already possible for any European Community company - apart from the nine ITV groups - to take over an ITV company. Until the end of the year the Independent Television Commission has to be informed of a takeover move in advance and has the discretion to block it if it is judged to be prejudicial to the ITV network. But there is not an automatic block or moratorium. A friendly bid from continental Europe or any British company outside the ranks of the ITV nine would stand a better chance of success than a hostile one. But the ITC concedes that it could be difficult to decide whether a bid against an ITV company really was hostile if its shareholders were attracted by the financial deal. From January next year the ITC will merely have to check that a bid is consistent with the rules set by parliament.</p>

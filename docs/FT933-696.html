			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Angels come to the rescue  -A growing breed of private investors to rival the venture capitalists When Iain Johnston joined GB Mailing, a young software company, its founders had already tried, unsuccessfully, to raise venture capital finance. But most of the venture capitalists approached did not understand the technology while the one which did thought the project was too risky. It also wanted too large a stake in the business. 'We needed a small amount of funding to get our marketing off the ground,' says Johnston, who is now managing director. Johnston, who had been working as a management consultant up until the time he joined GB, turned to his former boss, Robin Davies, for help. Davies put up Pounds 50,000 for a 5 per cent stake. Davies, who still heads his own consultancy, says he backed Johnston and GB Mailing for a mixture of emotional and commercial reasons. 'It was not a classic City-style analysis,' he says. 'I had an absolute belief that Iain Johnston could make it succeed and the two other directors were believable and likable people.' GB, which sells mail sorting and marketing software, has justified his faith. It has grown rapidly in the past three years, employs nearly 40 people and expects turnover this year to reach Pounds 2m. Davies is on the point of exercising an option to double his holding. Davies says this is the first time he has made an investment of this kind - he is a non-executive director and has no day-to-day involvement. But he is one of a growing breed of private investors or 'business angels' which has emerged in recent years. The typical angel has a business background. Many have made money by selling their own business, though most are comfortably off rather than fabulously wealthy, according to research by Colin Mason of Southampton University and Richard Harrison of Ulster University. Angels are more willing to invest on a hunch than the professional venture capitalist and they are often motivated by a desire to get involved, part-time or full-time, in the running of the business. They are also prepared to invest relatively small amounts and to be patient investors at a time when professional venture capitalists are concentrating on the bigger deals and are becoming increasingly short-term. Signs that the economy is beginning to recover have given an added urgency to the role of angels. There are concerns that the banks will be more cautious about backing small businesses while the demise in December of the Business Expansion Scheme, which gives tax breaks to equity investors, will narrow the funding options open to small firms. Angels have been recognised for some time as providing an alternative to the formal venture capital industry but have proved difficult to organise into a coherent force. Linc, a 'marriage bureau' run by a group of enterprise agencies, and Venture Capital Report, a newsletter which attempts to bring together entrepreneurs and investors, have had only limited success. Unlike the professional venture capitalists, business angels cannot be found in a business directory. 'Believing in angels is like believing in motherhood - it is self-evidently a good thing,' comments Lucius Cary, founder of Venture Capital Report (VCR). 'There does not appear to be a downside until you go into it more deeply. Then you find there is a large number of angels who cannot find deals but who, at the same time, are unwilling to subscribe to VCR or one of the other networks. There have been many initiatives over the years but most have failed.' After many false starts, Cary and others involved in backing entrepreneurs believe that a turning point may now have been reached. The key is a government-backed scheme to set up pilot marriage bureaux in five areas of the country. The government gave Pounds 40,000 each for a two-year experiment to five Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in Bedfordshire, Calderdale and Kirklees, Devon and Cornwall, East Lancashire and South and East Cheshire. All five TECs have been asked to bid for a further year's worth of funding. The two most successful appear to be the Cheshire and Devon and Cornwall TECs. The Cheshire programme, known as Techinvest, has brokered six deals worth Pounds 500,000 since it was launched last February. More than 50 investors with about Pounds 1.5m of available capital have been signed up, says Vivienne Upcott Gill, Techinvest manager. Crucially, Techinvest has not only found investors in Cheshire. It has also attracted angels from outside the region by establishing contacts with Linc and Venture Capital Report. It believes that this combination of a local exposure with links into a national network is a key to its success. Upcott Gill, who had previous experience of investor networks from working for Cheshire County Council, says a big factor in Techinvest's success is the work it puts into advising the entrepreneurs on how to present their proposals and into training sessions for investors on subjects such as structuring deals and forming syndicates. Equally important is the work which the angel networks put into selecting the good propositions for investors and filtering out the 'duds'. Venture Capital Report, which was founded in 1978 and which now has just over 450 subscribers, provides brief but very thorough descriptions of the business proposals that it features. Colin Mason, who has carried out a review of the five pilots, says the more successful ones share three characteristics. They are based in areas with a strong regional identity, a reasonable number of wealthy residents and an entrepreneurial culture; they are run by people with a missionary zeal; and they have sufficient funding. 'They must have the resources to carry out a continuous promotion campaign because there will be a constant turnover of business propositions and, to a lesser extent, investors,' says Mason. Upcott Gill calculates that Techinvest would need an annual budget of Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000 to perform effectively. 'These schemes need substantial long-term funding,' she says. 'If they were commercially viable, accountants would be doing it.' Some accountants do maintain lists of wealthy private clients who might be prepared to back a business. Blackstone Franks, a London firm, has about 600 clients on its 'private investors list' with no less than Pounds 250m available to invest. 'That is more than many venture capital companies,' comments Richard Coon, the partner in charge. But Coon estimates that few deals have been done in the two years that the firm has kept this list. 'It is not our primary activity and matching investors with business proposals is horrendously difficult.' The growing realisation of the potential of angels - Mason estimates they may have between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn available for investment (compared with the Pounds 1.4bn invested by the venture capital industry last year) - has prompted others to take an interest. In the UK, National Westminster Bank is researching the possibility of creating a nationwide register of business angels. Meanwhile, a former banker, Nigel Lacy, has launched the Capital Exchange, a network of advisers who will carry out a basic vetting of proposals for publication in a bi-monthly magazine, the Capital Exchange Gazette. But the difficulties that relative amateurs encounter in making investments should not be underestimated. One hopeful angel who began backing small companies after a lifetime spent making stock market investments for a large City institution found it a less than rewarding experience. 'I invested in five or six companies but my timing was wrong and virtually every one had to be written down,' he says. 'It became too demanding and I wanted more leisure time. This is something that the country needs but it is a great deal more difficult than it sounds.' *Linc, 071 236 3000. VCR, 0491 579999. Techinvest, 0606 737009. Capital Exchange, 0432 342484.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Blystad objectors stay with company Two of the directors of Blystad Group who objected to the successful hostile offer from Abbot Holdings are staying with the new company. Mr MA McDowell and Mr Paul Bews have resigned from the Blystad board, along with the three members of the Norwegian Blystad family. However, they are remaining on the board of KCA Drilling and other subsidiaries of the group. An adviser to Abbot, a private company set up by Mr Alistair Locke, said that the differences between the two men had not been great and had only arisen after lengthy talks when they were close to agreement. Over the weekend Mr Locke, who now controls more than 75 per cent of Blystad, made a further appeal for the remaining shareholders to accept. He intends taking the company private as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Observer: Harmonious union Choosing Belgian socialist Willy Claes to be Nato's secretary general makes it easier to fill the same post at Europe's other defence organisation, the Western European Union. But not much. Leading the WEU is a sensitive job. Whoever gets it will have to jolt into full-blooded existence a body which - having finally got Washington's blessing - has been designated as the European Union's defence arm. Claes's victory probably eliminates his compatriot, Marc Eyskens, from the WEU race; the rules of European musical chairs dictate a limit on Belgians - or any other nationality - occupying top notches. Portugal's Jose Cutilheiro is in with a chance, with his Atlanticist credentials appealing to the UK, though not to the French. The two front-runners though are veteran Italian diplomat Giovanni Jannuzzi, currently ambassador to Nato, and Enrique Baron Crespo, the Spanish politician and former president of the European Parliament. The Spaniard's socialist background might count against him, too many socialists being almost as difficult to swallow as too many Belgians. The Italian camp stresses the quiet efficiency with which Jannuzzi co-ordinated the EU's foreign policy secretariat for four years. France anticipates a stalemate and a couple of its former cabinet ministers wait in the wings. With so little union, maybe the incumbent, former Dutch defence minister Willem van Eekelen, would like to stay put?</p>

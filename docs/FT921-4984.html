			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Siemens Nixdorf lifts turnover 26% SIEMENS Nixdorf, the loss-making computer subsidiary of the German electrical and electronics group, boosted sales by 26 per cent in the first four months of the current financial year to DM3.8bn (Dollars 2.3bn), according to the chairman, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig. Orders were up 14 per cent on the same period of the previous year, at DM3.7bn, he told the annual general meeting in Paderborn. If this growth rate could be maintained to the end of the year (September 30), then Siemens Nixdorf could expect a significant improvement in its results, he said. However, the subsidiary, rescued by the Siemens group from collapse in 1990, will still be in the red, thanks to the fierce price competition between computer manufacturers, he said. Price cuts would cost the company some DM800m. In the 1990-1991 financial year, the first year after the takeover, Siemens Nixdorf posted a loss of DM780m, and turnover fell by 2 per cent to DM12.1bn. Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction group, says all divisions at home and abroad contributed to improve profits in 1991, although it gave no actual figures. It said it planned a dividend in line with profit development. For 1990 Bilfinger posted 1990 a net profit of DM43.5m.</p>

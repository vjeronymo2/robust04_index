			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / A saviour comes to Valencia: Peter Bruce hears Aznar tell 30,000 people what they want to hear - it is all right to be conservative in Spain THIRTY thousand people pushed and shoved to get inside the grand old bullring in the middle of Valencia. A third never made it and stood cheering outside. It was the biggest rally of the Spanish election campaign. The air throbbed with the party anthem. When Jose Mara Aznar entered the arena, his bodyguards struggling to stop screaming supporters mobbing him, the roar was so loud the place shook. 'Pre-si-den-te]', they shouted, 'Pre-si-den-te]' The welcome was both uplifting and frightening. Here was a mild and ordinary man, leader of the centre-right People's party (PP) and favourite to win the election on Sunday, being embraced and hailed as if he were a saviour. There was change in the air in Valencia on Wednesday night. In the great Left-Right see-saw of Spanish politics, the Right are coming back. 'Vamos a ganar,' the crowd shouts, 'vamos a gobernar.' We are going to win, we are going to govern] Valencia, once a Socialist redoubt, will be taken by the PP. The crowd is warmed up by the mayor, Ms Rita Barbera, who attacks the Socialists for building a high-speed train line to Seville not to Valencia. 'And,' she says, 'because of the negligence of Felipe Gonzalez, Valencia missed out on two big projects - Euronews and Eurodisney.' Not everyone understood but they roared all the same. Former French president Valery Giscard D'Estaing, got up to 'give testimony of my friendship, solidarity and esteem to Spain, the People's party and Jose Mara Aznar'. The crowd became a bit irritable with Mr Giscard's poor Spanish but he ended well, comparing his presence with the alternativa - a bullfighter's first real fight, where the novice is given the first bull of the evening. This is always 'confirmed' by a fight in Madrid. Mr Aznar's alternativa would be confirmed in Madrid on Friday (Mr Aznar's last rally), 'and on Sunday in all of Spain. He will be carried out shoulder high through the big gate]' Then Mr Aznar strode on to the platform to the PP anthem and 30,000 Valencianos chanting To-re-ro, to-re-ro. He spoke for about 45 minutes. The speech, devoid of policy content, was perfect for the occasion and Mr Aznar has become good at it. Over and over, he finds ways to repeat his same message - the Socialists are corrupt, inefficient, wasteful. Socialism is dead. He had been in Brussels at a meeting of centre-right leaders. 'All of them,' he cries, 'from Chancellor Kohl to (a tiny pause) the Belgian prime minister want a PP victory.' Cadence is everything in the Aznar speech. When he raises his voice, they cheer, and they have come to cheer. They want to hear someone tell them it is all right now to be a conservative in Spain and that 'their' time has come again. The faces are younger and hungrier than those at a Socialist rally. Behind him, a group of people start chanting 'Felipe el corrupto, Felipe el corrupto,' and he rounds on them sternly. 'No no no,' he says wagging a finger. 'I will not have any of that.' This is his moment to be conciliatory. 'We are nice people,' he says. But he is quickly back on the attack. 'Why were the Socialists in France kicked out of power?' he asks. 'For unemployment and corruption. And why are they going to be kicked out here? For unemployment and corruption.' Down below with the guests, Mr Giscard applauds. 'I want more jobs, more businesses, more competitiveness, more productivity,' Mr Aznar says. 'We need austerity, not waste; jobs, not a government that brags about how well it looks after the jobless.' He apologises for having to stop. He is tired. He promises to come back when he is 'president' (of the government). He walks, or is shoved, around the ring, shaking hands. On the podium, his wife, Ana, is autographing flags and hands. People walk away from her with their faces illuminated as if by a spiritual experience.</p>

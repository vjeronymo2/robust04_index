			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military spokesman in the Defense  Ministry has stated the following:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Truly  God loves those who fight in his cause in battle array, as if  they were a solid cemented structure. [Koranic verse] With deep  faith that God supports the soldiers of right, the people, and  the revolution and that he will grant them victory, the heroes  in our valiant Armed Forces pursue their heroic and epic  fighting in the battles of confrontation of all the forces of  apostasy, rebellion, and secession led by the criminal and evil  elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] command in the  governorates of Lahij, Abyan, and Aden, scoring decisive  victories in the performance of their tasks.    As we affirmed in a previous statement the day before  yesterday our valiant Armed Forces in the southwestern axis  succeeded in completely destroying all the units of the (Labuza)  Brigade camp and have proceeded from it toward the al-'Anad camp  where our valiant forces succeeded yesterday morning in crossing  the fortifications of its first defensive line. Our forces  continue to bravely and firmly engage the other defensive  fortifications of the camp, which is considered one of the most  important military strongholds that the elements of apostasy and  secession in the YSP command had [word indistinct]. It contains  defensive fortifications contributed by the Soviet experts  during the Communist rule, as well as huge weapons arsenals, and  an air base that was administered before 22 May 1990 by the  Socialist bloc. Following the unity, this place remained out of  reach for the institutions of constitutional legitimacy. No one  knew its secrets except the members of the rebellious,  secessionist gang and those who are close to it.    This gang was depending on this place to implement the most  serious episode of its conspiracy to destroy and fragment the  homeland. The final phase to restore this place to the Armed  Forces and constitutional legitimacy is now under way, thanks to  the heroes of the forces of unity and legitimacy.    In the Lahij Governorate axis, units from our Armed Forces  are now working to finish their combat missions in the face of  the forces of the secessionist gang. The units are advancing to  achieve their objectives.    In the Abyan-Aden axis, our forces have also continued to  defeat the secessionists hostile, desperate attacks advancing  from the Aden garrison, forcing them to retreat.    In the face of the treacherous air attacks on the units of  our valiant Armed forces and on defenseless cities, the heroes  of the Air Defenses courageously confronted them. They managed  to shoot down a fighter aircraft in al-Rahidah region and  another in the al-Dali' area. They also shot down a third  aircraft in [name indistinct] in the Qa'tabah District. The  aircraft of the forces of apostasy and secession concentrated  their attacks on the city of Ta'izz and al-Rahidah. One of  their odious shells hit al-Rahidah Hospital, killing several  patients in the hospital.    The Air Force aircraft in our valiant Armed Forces also  conducted several offensive sorties against what was left of the  camps and concentrations of the secessionist, rebellious forces  in all axes of the fighting, achieving success in all their  combat missions. They returned safely to base.    The forces protecting unity and upholding constitutional  legitimacy and democracy received a number of troops, including  commanders, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers, who were  misled by the secessionist elements. They joined the ranks of  right and unity, and the trench of the state and its  constitutional institutions, expressing their loyalty to God,  the homeland, the revolution, and the unity and rejecting the  orders of the separatist clique. They stressed their readiness  to continue fighting along side their colleagues in the Armed  Forces in defense of unity and the constitutional legitimacy in  order to defeat the remaining dens of the mutinous secessionist  clique.    Large quantities of weapons, ammunition, combat equipment,  and vehicles were seized. Information also clarified that the  rebel separatist forces are forcing citizens, including young  people, to join their ranks after all their threats and calls to  the citizens to respond to the illegitimate general mobilization  decision issued by the deposed Haytham Qasim Salih. This is  taking place while the morale and the feelings of confidence in  victory are increasing within the ranks of the units fighting in  support of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and in  defense of democracy. The citizens' hopes in all governorates  are increasing in that those who wanted to disturb the people's  life, fragment their unity and bargain with their fate and  existence in the service of their own sick whims and  illegitimate ambitions, which are hostile to the people and the  homeland and to all the principles and values, will inevitably  be doomed. O you who believe, if you will help the cause of  Allah, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic  verse] Issued by the Defense Ministry.</p>

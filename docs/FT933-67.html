			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Precious metals weakened suddenly in mid-afternoon on US fund liquidation, initially in the silver and platinum markets, but subsequently in GOLD. The London bullion price surrendered what remained of last week's rally to close at Dollars 352.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 4 on the day. Dealers said they could not pinpoint a specific reason for the selling but that without the support given to the market recently by the Russian political turmoil a move lower at some time had been inevitable. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices remained under pressure from bearish fundamentals and the three months price closed at Dollars 1,723.25 a tonne, down Dollars 19.25. The last signs of the recent technical supply squeeze appeared to have disappeared with the cash discount widening Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 23.75 a tonne. The NICKEL market also continued to suffer from its weak fundamentals. The three months price hit a fresh 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars 4,150 a tonne before recovering slightly to Dollars 4,165, still down Dollars 40. The gentle slide in the ALUMINIUM market continued, although some downside stability was found around 5 1/2 -month lows. Compiled from Reuters</p>

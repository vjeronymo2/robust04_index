The  stagnation of infrastructural construction has upset and  restricted the development of our national economy. In the  1990's -- during which time our country will raise its national  economy to a new level -- the task of infrastructural  construction is even more arduous and heavy. We must seize  opportunity, develop overall plans and rational distribution,  plan, effectively build and manage infrastructural  constructionl, and make it yield maximum social and economic  benefits.    Since the beginning of reform and opening up, we have  gradually changed the old pattern of relying completely on state  investment in the field of infrastructural construction, and  have created a new situation in which the central government,  local governments, and enterprises make joint investments  through various channels and comprehensively use foreign funds  in infrastructural construction at various levels. Enthusiasm  has been greatly aroused in all quarters. Infrastructural  construction is proceeding vigorously in all localities,  entering a stage of rapid development. However, in recent years  infrastructural construction has also shown a trend of  disregarding objective conditions and economic efficiency, and  of blindly seeking large and rapid construction. Some  localities are so eager to accelerate development they vie to  put forward impractical development objectives, ignore the  unified plan for infrastructural construction, and build  "small-and-all-embracing" as well as duplicate projects in small  areas. Some of them disregard the realities of local financial  and material resources; they love to build large projects and  emulate others, thus wasting money and creating low utility  rates and losses in operation. Some of them violate  construction procedures and encourage the practice of "beginning  construction first to hasten approval from higher authorities"  and "acting first and reporting afterwards." Some of them  down-size large, key projects in their reports so it is easier  to get state approval; after obtaining approval, they will  upgrade the projects in both scale and standards. Others give  foreign businessmen unauthorized guarantees for greater share of  profits from joint ventures and cooperative infrastructure  projects. The consequences of so doing are detrimental to the  healthy development of a socialist market economy, to the  rational allocation of resources, to overall economic  efficiency, and to the coordinated development of the economy as  a whole. Some of the practices even hurt the interests of the  state. For this reason, leaders at all levels must pay great  attention to them.    We should be realistic in doing everything. While we  should do everything we can, we should act according to our  capability. Since the policy decision on a major  infrastructural project and its execution directly affect the  overall arrangements of the national economy and the overall  macroeconomic balance, it must be made under unified state  planning and guidance. Infrastructural projects are usually  systems engineering projects which require large investment;  long construction times; and complex, well-coordinated support  facilities. They must follow construction procedures prescribed  by the state. The construction procedures embody the  requirements of the inherent laws of engineering. Strictly  following construction procedures is an indispensable guarantee  for making scientific decisions on a construction project and  for its smooth construction. The objective of economic  construction is to yield benefits. In infrastructural  construction, we should also give full consideration to both  social and economic benefits. We should try in every possible  way, and should concentrate our strength to build the  infrastructural projects which concern the interests of the  whole and meet the urgent needs of economic development.  However, infrastructural construction should proceed in an  orderly and step by step manner. It will not do to lag behind.  It will not do to either go all out in building projects  blindly in disregard of feasibility and benefits, or to exceed  by too much the actual needs. In our country -- where the  economy is relatively backward and shortages of funds and  material will exist for a long time to come -- we should  concentrate our forces even more in order to fight a battle of  annihilation and prevent duplicate and blind construction from  causing great waste.    For infrastructural construction, all localities and  departments should do a good job in formulating a regional  development plan under unified state planning and guidance, and  in consideration of their own realities and characteristics.  Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in studying  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  should comprehensively and accurately understand Comrade  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, should firmly establish the notion of taking  the entire country into account, should act according to our  capability in a realistic manner, should stress benefits, and  should do a down-to-earth job in effectivley building  infrastructural projects.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Commitment to eastwards expansion expected - But a divided EC can provide only modest assistance ONE of the few concrete decisions expected from the Copenhagen summit is for the EC to commit itself for the first time to Community membership for six post-Communist states in eastern and central Europe. Since it will still be many years before these countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania - have strong enough economies to survive in the EC, the 12 heads of government are also expected to agree measures to accelerate political and economic integration with the Community. The package is modest when measured against east European needs. But it is as bold as could politically be expected from the 12, mired in recession and with some member states hesitant about the enlargement negotiations already under way with Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. The measures include faster access for east European goods to the EC market; targeting EC aid for infrastructure and industrial restructuring; and the creation of a 'European Political Area' through joint action in areas of common interest such as energy, transport, the environment and research, and structured collaboration on security issues through regular joint meetings. The European Commission document that heads of government are set to endorse insists that it is in the EC's interest to commit itself to an enhanced relationship with the former Soviet satellites if they are to become future partners rather than unstable neighbours. 'As the scale and the costs of restructuring (the east European economies) become apparent,' the document argues, 'opposition to change is growing, with the risk of destabilisation and the reversal of current policies.' A European Political Area, it says, is 'vital in view of the absence of a coherent security structure covering the countries of central and eastern Europe, and the consequent feelings of insecurity in the region.' Yet the commitment on membership carries no target date for entry. Nor, despite pressure from the Commission, Germany and the UK, is agreement likely on a date for a summit between the EC and the east Europeans to review the latter's progress towards membership. 'There is nervousness about raising expectations' in eastern Europe, one EC diplomat says. There is also danger that the commitment on membership will be so grudging as to weaken east Europe's reformers. France, indeed, was pushing to tighten up the general membership criteria by making them more explicit. To qualify for the EC, the summit's conclusions were expected to say, a country should be a stable democracy that guarantees human and minority rights, with a functioning market economy able to conform to EC law and withstand the competition of the single market. The candidates would have to endorse the Maastricht objectives of political and monetary union. But the Community itself would take into account whether it could maintain the elan of European integration if it let them in. This last hurdle emphasises the division in the 12 between 'deepeners' - federalists who fear enlargement will brake progress towards European union  -and 'wideners' who hope that by embracing an unprecedented number of new members the EC will have to become a much looser entity. This is a battle which should climax in the 1996 constitutional review foreseen at Maastricht, when reform of EC decision-making and the streamlining of its institutions will be decided. By then, the Scandinavians and Austria are supposed to have become members, and member states such as the UK which favour a wider Europe hope this will tilt the balance of power against the federalists. Though no dates were in prospect for the east Europeans, the UK was last night pushing hard for a firm date for concluding the accession talks with the candidates already in the EC's ante-room.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> PAPER BANGLES  </P> <P> DELICATE WAVES of dots, diamonds, leaves, flowers and abstract designs weave  their way around a Lydia Pollard bracelet. A face peers out from behind a  corner.  </P> <P> One color flows into another. At first, the work is puzzling. Is it made of  fabric? Is it hand-painted? Plastic? Actually, Pollard's wearable collages are  made of dozens of tiny bits of paper, adhered to a wooden bangle.  </P> <P> "I love paper," says Pollard, who collects basketfuls of wrapping paper,  magazine illustrations, calendars and catalogues. She painstakingly tears these  papers and her own hand-dyed papers into strips, mixing and matching the  pieces. The bangles are finished with a matte lacquer that adds to the subtle,  Oriental quality of the work. Barrettes, earrings and pins are constructed a  bit differently. Pollard approaches these more like miniatures, often using  faces as the center of a composition with other related forms or items  surrounding it. (Prices for the various items range from about $22 to $32.)  </P> <P> Although she keeps busy supplying a number of museum shops around the country  -- including the Smithsonian Institution -- Pollard does accept commissions.  </P> <P>  Lydia Pollard can be reached at LSP Designs, (213) 472-6077.

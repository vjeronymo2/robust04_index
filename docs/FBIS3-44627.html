Government of Dongcheng District and representatives of Hong  Kong Huixian Investment Company, Ltd. signed the agreements  respectively. Chen Xitong, secretary of Beijing Municipal party  committee, Deng Nan, vice minister of the state commission for  science and technology, and Zhang Baifa and Wang Baosen,  executive vice mayors, attended the signing ceremony.    Before the signing ceremony, Chen Xitong and other leaders  met with the noted Hong Kong enterpreneurs, including Li  Jiacheng, Dong Jianhua and Li Hanzhao. Chen Xitong extended  welcome to the friends from Hong Kong who came to conduct  cooperation. He said: Viewed on a long-term basis, Beijing  will become a more open, modern city. I think many people will  notice this. At present, Beijing has approved of the  establishment of over 7,000 of the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises. We welcome more people to come and stage their  performances in the "arena" of Beijing and to conduct  emulations. We will support those who run fast in the race.  The second-phase Dongfang Square construction project jointly  built by Dongcheng District and Hong Kong Huixian Investment  Company. Ltd. is a huge project. It is hoped that both sides  will conduct more consultations, maintain close cooperation and  do a good job in designing this project. The Beijing  construction team is capable of undertaking formidable tasks.  We will spare no effort to support this team in starting  construction and finishing it early. Chen Xitong said: China  is thriving and marching towards the goal of becoming better-off  with great confidence. Beijing is a developing city. Over the  past few years, it has completed a construction area of more  than 10 million square meters every year, of which, 5 million  square meters are residental homes. However, the most arduous  task in attaining the goal of becoming well-off is the housing  problem. Your willingness to actively participate in the  capital's housing construction projects in addition to your  investments and cooperation in some large items are greatly  welcomed.

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: 95% of families will be poorer, Labour claims Labour yesterday accused the Conservatives of becoming 'the high-tax party' and said 95 per cent of families would be worse off. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the Budget Red Book showed that the tax burden would rise from 34.25 per cent of national income this year to 38.5 per cent by 1998-99. 'The Tories have now presented the British people with the biggest tax demand in history - overall a tax rise over the next three years of Pounds 24bn,' he said. Mr Brown accused the prime minister of breaking his promise at the 1992 general election that taxes would come down 'year on year'. He told the Commons: 'This Budget finally broke any residual trust that even the most ardent Tory could have in this government over taxation policy.' Labour concentrated its fire on claims that the government had broken its promises not to raise income tax, value added tax, and National Insurance contributions. Shadow ministers also highlighted the impact on public services of the decision announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut public spending by Pounds 8bn over three years. However, Conservatives accused the opposition of failing to spell out how it would have reduced the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement without raising taxes or cutting spending. The Labour attack was further blunted when Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social services secretary, claimed that the 50p a week provided for pensioners by the VAT compensation scheme was insufficient. 'This is not full compensation. It is Mr Clarke calculating the minimum he must pay to survive. He may have bought off some of his own rebels but he can't buy off the old and the cold with 50p,' Mr Dewar said. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, prompted roars of Conservative laughter by producing a newspaper article written two weeks ago in which Mr Dewar called for compensation of 50p a week. Labour also failed to respond to the chancellor's announcement that a freeze on central government pay bills is to be extended by two years until 1997, affecting 5m public-sector workers. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, accused Mr Clarke of 'stealing' Labour's ideas for childcare allowances, closing tax loopholes and improving small businesses' cashflow through curbs on late payments.</p>

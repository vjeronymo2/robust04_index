			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The social and political  agitation by Ecuadoran Indians, which has kept the country in  upheaval in the past eight days, worsened in the last few hours  with violent incidents that reportedly led to the death of four  Indians from the Andean Province of Canar, south of Quito.    Organized by the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador (Conaie), which includes most of the Indian groups, the  Indians are strictly carrying out a "great protest mobilization  for life" to demand the repeal of a new agrarian law approved by  the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Indians charge that  the law is unconstitutional.    A source from the organization told AFP today that on  Thursday the Indians of the Amazon region began taking control  of the facilities for four petroleum wells managed by the Elf  Hydrocarbures company of France and the Ecuadoran State  Petroleum Enterprise.    The provinces through which the Andes mountain range crosses  have been cut off from each other because the main highways have  been blocked. Hundreds of Conaie members armed with work tools  such as machetes and picks occupied the roads, which they are  not leaving for any reason despite the presence, until now  peaceful, of troops and policemen.    Nevertheless, the unrest got worse yesterday when Indians  looted stores and the public market of the city of Canar, in the  Andean province of the same name. This action provoked a  reaction from merchants. Approximately 20 Indians and merchants  were injured in the violent clashes, during which weapons  appeared.    Segundo Serrano, mayor of Azogues, the capital of Canar,  told  AFP by telephone that in the violence an Indian died from blows  to the head. This has been officially confirmed by authorities.  He added that, according to reports from Indian leader Jose  Guaman, the merchants burned a community house and that the  bodies of at least three Indians were found among the rubble.  This has yet to be confirmed.    "The situation was on the verge of getting even worse when  the Canar Indians tried to start a fire in a fuel distribution  facility in the city of Canar," Serrano added. He indicated that  the city awoke today under the military control of Army troops,  which were urgently deployed to the site to try to retake  control and prevent more violence. "The people of Canar are  living tense times. There is great fear in the center of the  city, which only has five policemen," he said. The mayor also  said the Indians have reportedly threatened to come down from  the mountains to burn the city.    Meanwhile, Conaie Vice President Rafael Pandam told AFP that  another Indian was killed on Thursday in Tungurahua Province (in  southern Ecuador) during the protests. He said the Indians will  "oppose to the death" the agrarian law because it harms their  interests and demands. As an example, he said the elimination of  the Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform and Settlement  (IERAC) also means the disappearance of the legal distribution  of land to the Indians, who will have to seek new lands at the  same time that arbitrary settlements are encouraged.    Conaie President Luis Macas urged the Court of  Constitutional  Guarantees (in charge of enforcing the laws) and the  constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice "not to  permit such big violations of the constitution because this  would lay the groundwork for absolute chaos in all areas."</p>

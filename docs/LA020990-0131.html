			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY BOARD VOTES 8TH SCHOOL CLOSURE  </P> <P> About 200 parents watched in helpless outrage Thursday night as the Fountain  Valley School District Board of Trustees voted to close the city's oldest  elementary school because of low enrollment.  </P> <P> In an emotionally charged meeting that lasted for two hours, about a dozen  parents spoke against the proposed closure of Fountain Valley Elementary School  -- and threatened legal action to keep it open.  </P> <P> Despite the opposition, the board voted, 4-1, to close the school.  </P> <P> "We will not let this die," parent Barbara Emerson said of the vote. "We will  take it straight to court."  </P> <P> Rabbi Stephen Einstein, who cast the dissenting vote, received a standing  ovation from the audience when he told fellow board members that strong  community opposition warrants re-evaluation of closure.  </P> <P> "To hear parents attend every meeting with valid concerns over this matter made  me think twice, and I believe the school should not be closed," he said. "But I  do feel that each board member voted the way they felt best."  </P> <P> The vote came after several months of heated debate between community members  and officials of the school district, which has had a steady enrollment decline  for the last 10 years. Seven schools have been closed in the area since 1979;  many parents believe that one more is far too many.  </P> <P> "We don't feel the board is listening to us or addressing our concerns," Cherie  Dwhytie, a leader of the opposition group, said before Thursday night's  meeting.  </P> <P> The group told board members that their concerns center on the lack of an  environmental impact study by the district to determine what effect closing the  eighth school in 10 years would have on the district.  </P> <P> "They have not addressed how the increased traffic will affect our  neighborhoods or our air," Dwhytie said. "Closing this school will overflow the  other open schools, causing more traffic for them and forcing the cancellation  of many programs for lack of space, not to mention what happens to people's  home values when there isn't a neighborhood school."  </P> <P> But board members say a school must be closed this year to compensate for the  loss of money from the state because of dwindling enrollment. Fountain Valley  Elementary School, with just 302 pupils, is the obvious choice, board members  argue.  </P> <P> The board's decision means that the school's pupils will be relocated to three  other schools -- whichever one is one mile from their home or nearer, according  to district officials.  </P> <P> "We want to know what happens when the population begins to climb," said Carol  Barnes, a member of the opposition group. "Our figures show that the birthrate  is beginning to do just that. But will there be schools for them?"  </P></p>

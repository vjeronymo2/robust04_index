			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON MAKES MOST OF OREGON'S MISTAKES  </P> <P> Washington intercepted four of Bill Musgrave's passes and recovered three  fumbles in defeating Oregon, 20-14, in a sloppily played Pacific 10 Conference  game Saturday at Seattle.  </P> <P> The Huskies took the lead for good in the third quarter on a one-yard touchdown  run by quarterback Cary Conklin.  </P> <P> The Huskies, 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the conference, avoided losing their fourth  consecutive game, which would have been most losses in a row in Coach Don  James' 15 seasons in Seattle. The three defeats were the most by a Washington  team since 1976. Washington beat Oregon for the first time in three seasons.  </P> <P> Washington recorded three of its seven turnovers in the fourth quarter,  including a fumble that stopped a last-ditch Oregon drive on the Huskies' 40  with 1:38 left.  </P> <P> Oregon is now 3-3 and 2-3.  </P> <P> Washington State 31, Stanford 13 -- Steve Broussard broke off tackle and ran 71  yards for the Cougars' first touchdown early in the second quarter and scored  again on a five-yard run later in the same period to lead No. 17 Washington  State to a win at Pullman, Wash.  </P> <P> The Cougars (6-1 and 3-1) fumbled the ball away on their first two possessions,  but scored four touchdowns in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Stanford (1-5 and 1-3) led, 10-7, after scoring its only touchdown when Tom  Vardell recovered a fumble in the end zone.  </P> <P> But Aaron Garcia, who completed 23 of 41 passes for 341 yards and two  touchdowns, hit tight end Doug Wellsandt with a 12-yard scoring pass and then  capped a 93-yard drive with a 24-yard touchdown pass to C.J. Davis seven  seconds before halftime and Washington State was on its way.  </P> <P> Arizona St. 17, Oregon St. 17 -- Paul Justin of Arizona State threw for a pair  of second-half touchdowns and Oregon State's Pat Chaffey ran for two scores as  the two teams battled to a standoff at Corvallis, Ore.  </P> <P> Troy Bussanich of Oregon State missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt as the game  ended.  </P> <P> Oregon State is 2-3-1 and 1-1-1.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BACKS RULING ON 'FIFTH DOWN'  </P> <P> Game officials acted correctly when they allowed Santa Barbara High a so-called  fifth down against Canyon in a Division II semifinal football game Dec. 2,  according to a Southern Section administrator.  </P> <P> Bill Clark said Thursday that a review of videotape of the game's final 10  seconds indicated that game officials had acted "within the parameters of the  rules" and that the case is closed.  </P> <P> Canyon officials claim that their team was wronged in the controversial 28-27  overtime loss to Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> With Canyon leading, 21-14, with 10 seconds left, Santa Barbara quarterback  Poncho Renteria fumbled the snap at the Canyon one-yard line on fourth down,  but the Cowboys were penalized for swatting the snap. After officials walked  off the penalty, the clock was started with four seconds left and Canyon  stopped Santa Barbara for a two-yard loss.  </P> <P> However, the officials realized that they had erred, according to Clark, and  stopped that play before it was over. The clock was stopped and on the ensuing  play, the "fifth down," Santa Barbara scored a touchdown to force overtime.  </P> <P> Clark said that Santa Barbara was entitled to a final play because the  officials ruled that when the Cowboys swatted the snap they attempted to  consume time illegally, a violation of the National Federation of State High  School Assn. rules.  </P></p>

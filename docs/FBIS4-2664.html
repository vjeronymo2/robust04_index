			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said here today that the Chinese Government attached great  importance to the development of oil and natural gas, both on  land and offshore.    During a meeting with Kenneth Derr, chairman of the Chevron  Corporation of the United States, Li said that China would like  to cooperate with foreign petroleum companies, including  Chevron, in this regard.    Li told the U.S. guest that since China began its  exploitation of offshore oil fields in the 1970s, the industry  had taken shape, and its prospect were very bright.    With development of the economy and improvement of people's  living standards, China's demands for petroleum products would  rise, Li said. Therefore, the country will accelerate the  development of the industry.    He described the oil field in northwest China's Tarim Basin  as one with great potential, and he extended a welcome to  foreign oil companies to join in its development.    Li hoped that Chevron would be successful in the exploration  for oil in East China Sea.    Chevron and China signed an agreement on the development of  oil in that area last year.    Derr said that as one of the largest energy companies in the  United States, Chevron had advantage in terms of capital and  technology. The corporation has decided to strengthen the  cooperation with China, in which it had confidence.    Derr and his party arrived here to participate in the  strategic plan meeting from April 11 to 18, which is sponsored  by Chevron Overseas Company.    Among those at today's meeting were Gan Ziyu, vice minister  of the State National Planning Commission, and Wang Yan, general  manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.</p>

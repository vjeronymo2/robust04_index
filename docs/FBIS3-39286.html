			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Spanish Government will maintain its current  level of official cooperation with Cuba in 1994, despite the  difficult straits the Spanish economy is now experiencing. Jose  San Gil, the Spanish ambassador to Havana, said that despite the  economic difficulties which we are all going through I can  assure you that the Spanish Government considers it a duty to  maintain its cooperation this year.    According to the ambassador, Spanish cooperation from Madrid  to Cuba amounted to approximately seven million dollars in 1993.  This reflects the Spanish Government's political decision.  Beyond the official interpretation, this should be seen as a  mark of the interest and affection of the Spanish people.    Ambassador San Gil added that about 120 Cubans are trained  or  retrained every year in Spain. Furthermore, all the projects  currently under way will continue.</p>

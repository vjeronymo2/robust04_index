			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: France, Germany in dispute over Airbus assembly THE launch of a new European Airbus 125-seat airliner, the A319, is being held back by French demands that it should be assembled in France rather than Germany. The disagreement over the A319, a shorter derivative of the A320 twin-engine narrow-body airliner, highlights again the problems of managing the collaborative Airbus programme between its four partners: Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), British Aerospace (20 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent). The German and UK partners back the new programme, but Aerospatiale argues assembly at Hamburg would cut its overall workshare below its 37.9 per cent stake. Airbuses have traditionally been assembled at Aerospatiale's plant in Toulouse. But Germany won its bid two years ago to locate at Hamburg all final assembly and internal fittings of the A321, a stretched derivative of the A320, due to be delivered to its first customers in 1994. Assembly of the proposed new A319 at Hamburg, giving Germany final assembly of a second Airbus aircraft, would tie in with the Airbus supervisory board's decision to concentrate final assembly and final internal fittings to customer specification at one site, rather than split between Toulouse and Hamburg, as before. But Aerospatiale is understood to be opposing Hamburg assembly of the A319 and urging assembly in Toulouse, which already assembles the A300/A310 widebody airliners, the A320 and the new A330/A340 long-range widebody jets. The row risks delaying the launch of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 171.4m) programme to build the 125-seater aircraft. Airbus was wanting a go-ahead from its supervisory board to start offering the new aircraft to airline customers at the end of next month. It has argued the A319 would complete its family of narrow-body airliners and help it compete more strongly against its US rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas which offer 125-seat-range aircraft. Airbus has dropped the idea of building an even smaller A320 derivative with 100 seats.</p>

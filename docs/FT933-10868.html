			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / 'Security zone' withdrawal seen as way to peace IF Israel's aim was to destroy Hizbollah with its seven-day bombardment, then it failed, according to Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister. He said the only way to end any threat from the pro-Iranian group was for Israel to commit itself to withdraw from its self-declared 'security zone' in south Lebanon. After such a commitment, and even before actual withdrawal, Lebanon and Israel could set up a joint security committee for the south and address the question of security in north Israel, Mr al-Hariri said. In an interview with the FT, he said: 'The Israelis give us two options,' adding: 'Either we disarm Hizbollah and risk entering into a civil war because Israel is still occupying the country, or Israel destroys our country. But there is a third option - that they commit to withdraw from south Lebanon, then there will be no need for resistance against them.' Mr al-Hariri's remarks follow government statements that it could not act against Hizbollah while the group had the legitimising 'political cover' of Israel's presence in the 15km 'security zone' in south Lebanon. Neither, officials said, could the government publicly oppose any acts of resistance against Israeli targets within that zone. The government is aware it must do nothing to risk reigniting the sectarian fighting that consumed the country in its 17-year civil war. But officials understand the threat Hizbollah poses both to the Middle East peace process and, potentially also, to the newly united Lebanese government itself. The government believes, however, that a strengthened Lebanese army could contain any threat of attacks against northern Israel, but only if the Israelis commit themselves to withdraw. Under the ceasefire 'understanding' that silenced Israeli guns on Saturday, Hizbollah has apparently undertaken to cease Katyusha rocket attacks into Israeli territory - the pretext for Israel's bombardment. Hizbollah will also be restrained by the knowledge that further attacks would bring a powerful Israeli reprisal which could, in turn, draw considerable hostility against them from the thousands of refugees now streaming back to their battered villages. Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, has clearly been decisive in obtaining the ceasefire 'understanding', under what appears to have been considerable US pressure.</p>

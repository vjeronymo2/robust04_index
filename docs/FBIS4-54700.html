			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item; by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>   [Text] New York, May 3 (TANJUG) -- It appears that the U.N.  Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) is allowed  only to open fire, as it did recently at Kalesi and Gorazde,  when 12 members of the Army of the Bosnian Serb Republic (VRS)  were killed, according to news reports, but is not allowed to  see what it sees and to hear what it hears, let alone to say  publicly anything about it.    The above results from U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's reply to a letter received from United States  U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, in which Butrus-Ghali was  sharply censured for the statements made by his generals and  civilian representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the  truth was told about the conflict in that former Yugoslav  republic and the U.S. foreign policy was criticized.    Albright a week ago vehemently criticized Butrus-Ghali's  special envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi for  refusing to order new air strikes against Serbs at Gorazde, a  town in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    There followed statements of UNPROFOR commander for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose and other unidentified  U.N. officials who insisted that the reports from Gorazde were  false, that the figures about the casualties and destruction  were overinflated, and that the U.S. had nearly drawn the United  Nations into a larger-scale war on the basis of incorrect  assumptions.    In the latest letter to the U.N. secretary-general, Albright  said she was writing to protest in the strongest possible terms  the comments of U.N. officials who keep the secretary-general  directly informed through Akashi.    Butrus-Ghali replied the same day to the closely-spaced  two-page letter, saying he shared the U.S. ambassador's deep  concern over the fact that the criticism of the U.S. policy in  the former Yugoslavia by ranking UNPROFOR officials had been  quoted in news reports. The U.N. secretary-general said he had  sent a letter to Akashi informing him that he considered such  comments totally unacceptable and requesting a thorough  investigation. Butrus-Ghali said he had asked of Akashi to take  all steps for such things not to happen again.    Without speculating about whether "the gentleman had backed  down," as some claim, or just the opposite was true, the message  is clear: UNPROFOR must keep silent and dance to the U.S. tune.    Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills has told the press that  both Akashi and General Rose continue to have the  secretary-general's confidence. However, it is obvious that  they do not have Washington's confidence and that whether they  will keep their current posts will most likely depend on the  degree of their obedience.    Sills practically quoted a part of Albright's letter when he  said that the secretary-general felt it was not all right for  ranking U.N. officials or peace operation personnel to criticise  the policy of Western U.N. member-countries. Sills said U.N.  officials in the field should use other means than the press to  get the information to their superior on the east river. It is  well known, however, that Butrus-Ghali has several times  "misplaced" key reports about the guilt of the Muslim side in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that he has rejected to publish the  report of a commission which has investigated crimes committed  by U.N. troops, primarily U.S., in Somalia.    Under the constant threat from Washington that it will cut  off funds, Butrus-Ghali has decided to close the eyes and shut  the ears of the UNPROFOR personnel, and has thus reduced the  United Nations to a blind follower of U.S. policy. The U.S. has  put a "dollar muzzle" on UNPROFOR and released the safety on  their rifles. Butrus-Ghali's acquiescence with such a state  leads the United Nations to an abyss in which the League of  Nations had found itself prior to World War Two.</p>

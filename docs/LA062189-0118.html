			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF MILKEN ALLY BEGINS IN NEW YORK  </P> <P> Opening arguments began Tuesday in the federal racketeering and fraud trial of  five officials of the now-defunct securities firm Princeton/Newport Partners LP  and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader.  </P> <P> The six are accused of making phony securities trades to generate more than $13  million in false tax losses for Princeton/Newport from 1984 through 1986. They  also are accused of illegally manipulating the market price of stock in COMB  Co.  </P> <P> The trial, which is expected to last more than two months, may give the first  glimpse of some of the government's evidence against former Drexel "junk bond"  chief Michael Milken, who also is awaiting trial on racketeering and securities  fraud charges. The case also marks the first use of the federal racketeering  law against principals of a securities firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accused of 'Parking' Stock  </P> <P> In his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Hansen said the  government would offer proof that Princeton/Newport engaged in sham securities  trades with three brokerage firms to create false short-term capital losses and  long-term capital gains. He said securities were "parked" temporarily with the  brokerage firms under a secret, illicit agreement to buy them back on a  specified date at a specified price different from their true market price.  </P> <P> He compared the defendants' alleged parking and later repurchase of the  securities to the use of a yo-yo, whereby "Princeton/Newport sent these  securities out with a big string on them, waiting only for the moment when they  give a little tug on the string and they all come right back into their hands."  </P> <P> Hansen said part of the evidence in the case would include a tape recording of  a telephone conversation between two of the defendants, Charles M. Zarzecki,  Princeton/Newport's head trader, and Bruce Lee Newberg, then a trader at  Drexel. Hansen said the tape, seized during a raid on the firm's New Jersey  offices, recorded Zarzecki confirming that he had sold stock to artificially  depress the price of COMB common stock, in accordance with a request by  Newberg.  </P> <P> Hansen said the end of the conversation includes the following exchange:  </P> <P> Newberg: "You're a sleaze bag."  </P> <P> Zarzecki: "You taught me, man."  </P> <P> Newberg: "Welcome to the world of being a sleaze."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Appropriate, Lawful'  </P> <P> Other defendants in the case include James Sutton Regan, the firm's managing  general partner, as well as general partners Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul A.  Berkman, and Princeton/Newport controller Steven B. Smotrich. The firm had  offices in Newport Beach and Princeton, N.J. It was founded in 1969 by Regan  and Edward Oakley Thorp, a former mathematics professor at UC Irvine. Thorp  wasn't charged with any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Theodore Wells, Regan's lawyer, went first late Tuesday as defense lawyers  began their opening arguments. He said Regan would take the witness stand in  his own defense during the trial and testify that all of the trades were  "appropriate, proper and lawful." He said the trading was done in response to  changes in federal tax law, and he said Regan gained nothing financially from  the trades the government claims were illegal. All of the defendants have  denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Spectators in the packed courtroom of U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter  included lawyers for Milken and his brother, Lowell Milken. The Milken case is  expected to go to trial some time next year, and part of the charges against  them include allegedly illegal schemes with Princeton/Newport. Newberg is also  a defendant in that case.  </P></p>

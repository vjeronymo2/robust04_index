			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: What the economists have to say GAVYN DAVIES, Goldman Sachs It will be very difficult to rejoin the system quickly because I think the chances of getting back into the same bind are too great. I think the government will take the opportunity for a breathing space in which to ease policy and get the pound and interest rates lower. They will then wait for a recovery and lower German rates before trying to rejoin. I don't think they are going to push rates below German rates because they won't want to see the pound in free fall. Sterling should settle at around DM2.50-DM2.60 with rates at around 9 per cent. ***** STEVE HANNAH, IBJ International confidence in the government's economic policy in the years to come and the premium we will have to pay on sterling as a result will be very high. But having blown its credibility the government might as well make the most of the situation while it can. It should introduce a balanced package of lower interest rates, but at the same time tighten fiscal policy. The government can't be seen to be taking all the benefits without accepting some disciplines. Otherwise we could become the banana economy of Europe. ***** JIM O'NEILL, Swiss Bank Corporation Maastricht is essentially dead; the French are going to vote on something which no longer exists. That means Britain can concentrate on domestic issues. We should let the pound go down to about DM2.50 and cut interest rates. But regaining credibility with the financial markets will be difficult for the government. If Britain re-joined the system too soon we could see things go wrong disastrously once again and the pound could be tipped over the edge. From a political and economic view it would be better to let the pound float.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Rights issues The sharpness of the market reaction to rights issues from Alfred McAlpine yesterday and YJ Lovell the day before suggests that investors are finally tiring of cash calls from the construction sector. This is scarcely surprising, given that a third of the Pounds 3bn raised in rights issues in the year to date has come in construction and property. This, in turn, raises the question of what is to be done with the money. Much depends on how far one believes in the standard tale of imminent recovery and consequent opportunities, as opposed to the suspicion that companies are simply repairing their balance sheets while the going is good. If the former, the price of building land and property is about to be bid up by institutional cash at one remove. If the latter, the banks will get their money back and will doubtless think twice about advancing fresh loans to those sectors for some time. One good argument for the latter theory is the illogicality of companies using shareholders' cash to buy land and property if they genuinely believe the upturn is at hand. The time to rely on equity is at the peak of the cycle, when financial flexibility is going to be needed in the downturn. It is precisely at the trough that companies should be gearing up again on shareholders' behalf. But the question is one of a difference in timing. It is in the nature of the equity market to rise well ahead of recovery. If companies grab the cash accordingly, it need not follow that they agree with the market's prognosis. Carrying this argument to its conclusion might suggest a temporary difficulty for the market as a whole. In itself, there is nothing wrong with the market running ahead of the game. The difficulty is rather to do with institutional cash flow. The obvious way to replace the cash drawn out of institutional coffers by rights issues is for companies to make cash bids. If investors are confident enough to advance the cash, companies are not yet confident enough to spend it on takeovers. Rumours of the big bid from such as BTR have been around for some time. It is getting to the point where the market needs cash on the table.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Following Footsie - News in Brief NATIONAL &amp; Provincial is offering a second version of its Guaranteed Equity Reserve account. This links the return to the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, with a guarantee of investors' money back if the index falls. As with most other products in this field, the investor receives no benefit from the dividend yield on the Footsie, a significant component of return over five years. The final return will be based on the average of the Footsie over the last six months of the five-year period. N&amp;P quotes a gross rate of 133.33 per cent of the growth of Footsie, but this is available only to non-taxpayers. Basic rate-payers will get 100 per cent of the rise; higher rate-payers will get 80 per cent and probably would be better off in an indexed unit trust. Bonuses for early investment will increase these returns slightly. Withdrawals are allowed after one year but subject to penalties. If Footsie has failed to rise, you will lose 5 per cent of your capital; if it has increased, you will receive 50 per cent of the rise (for basic rate-payers) and 40 per cent of the rise (for top rate-payers). The minimum investment is Pounds 500 and the issue will close on May 31. ***** PRIVATE investors looking for information on companies - including profit, earnings per share figures and brokers' forecasts - can, in addition to the sources we mentioned last week, consider the Earnings Guide. A monthly booklet costs Pounds 270 a year and a weekly guide, for use on a personal computer, is Pounds 1,200 plus VAT. Further details from Earnings Guide, PO Box 1, Horsham, West Sussex, RH12 3YY. ***** ENTERPRISE Zone investments, which allow full tax relief at the investor's top marginal rate of tax, have gone quiet this year. At one point, they seemed likely to overtake the business expansion scheme. The latest offering is less glamorous than previous offerings involving Olympia &amp; York, but probably less risky: it will buy cold storage units in Scunthorpe. Collect 1, sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital and managed by Property Enterprise Managers, will buy land in the Scunthorpe Enterprise Zone on which 63,500 sq ft of warehousing is being built. There is an agreed 27-year lease to Scunthorpe Cold Stores, with a projected rental yield of 8 per cent. Rent is underwritten by the Dibdin Group, which has assets of Pounds 19m. There is no external bank guarantee, and money has been put aside to pay the first three years' rent, plus up to two years' rent after that if necessary. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000, with a total capacity of Pounds 5.25m.</p>

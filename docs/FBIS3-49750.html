			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] There was a festive session held in Sarajevo  today to mark the repelling of one of the strongest offensives  in the 1st Corps' operational zone. The session was attended by  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Foreign Minister Irfan  Ljubijankic, [names indistinct], heads of the Executive Council  and Assembly of the City of Sarajevo. Those fighters of the 1st  Corps who had contributed most to the repelling of the enemy  offensive were presented with the appropriate decorations. Here  is a report by [name indistinct]    [Correspondent] At the beginning of the session, the  fighters and their officers were addressed by Brigadier (Ismet  Dahic), deputy commander of the 1st Corps. He stressed that the  fighters had been prepared for the enemy offensive, which  started on 21 December, and that despite 40,000 shells fired and  the fact that Chetnik [word indistinct] units took part in these  battles, the fighters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the  end turned the situation to their advantage.    After that (Dahic) presented decorations to the members of  the brigades whose fighters took part in these battles on behalf  of the Corps commander. They will be handed to them  subsequently. [passage omitted]    We have reached the half-way stage, Foreign Minister  Ljubijankic said. The other half could be even more difficult,  but what we have done so far compels us to go further.    Finally, the fighters were addressed by Prime Minister  Silajdzic, who was greeted with a long applause. He conveyed to  the fighters greetings from President Izetbegovic, who was  unable to attend. Speaking about the future of the Geneva talks,  Silajdzic stressed that if the aggressor continues to destroy  Sarajevo and other towns and to kill civilians during the Geneva  talks, the talks will not be held.    There is certain fear abroad of a republic in which the  Muslims would constitute a majority, Silajdzic said. That this  fear is not founded is best illustrated by the conduct of the  members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the territories  under their control. People of other nationalities are not being  expelled. Places of worship are not being destroyed. Only  criminals should be afraid of such an army, Silajdzic said.    This was a brief summary of what was said at today's festive  session organized to mark the repelling of a fierce enemy  offensive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Confidence in government policy has been obtained  from the State Duma. This was stated at a news conference today  by the acting finance minister. Sergey Dubinin noted that  deputies' criticisms will be taken into account in the  finalization of the budget. Therefore, he did not rule out the  possibility of a future reduction in the state's administrative  apparatus in favor of increased expenditures on science.  Dubinin said that the government will endeavor to submit the  1995 budget to parliament as early as September. Moreover, it  will be drawn up while taking into account a reform of taxation  policy. The supervision of all the accounts of enterprises,  including their hard currency, will be more strict.    Dwelling on privatization, Dubinin said that it has not  brought the budget any real revenue, since the ideology behind  it was based from the outset on a free handout of state  property. Forecasting the level of inflation, Dubinin noted  that it would be under 10 percent. By the end of the year, a  level of between 5 and 7 percent is quite realistic. In his  view, the exchange rate for the dollar will not rise above 3,000  rubles.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: FOR MANY, LIVING ON THE HILL IS TOPS;  </P> <P> ADAMS HILL: ONCE PART OF A RANCHO, THE AREA STRADDLES THE LOS ANGELES AND  GLENDALE BOUNDARY. IT NOW ATTRACTS RESIDENTS 'WHO NEED A HOME THAT'S NOT OUT OF  REACH.'  </P> <P> Adams Hill, on the border of Los Angeles and southeast Glendale, is a sunny,  breezy, jaunty place, bedecked with flowers and burbling with bird song.  </P> <P> Dawn LaMadeleine Carrillo of Coldwell Banker, listing the area's main  attractions, says: "It's so close to L.A. Also, a lot, a lot of the homes there  have views. And you can find three-bedrooms in that area for 250 ($250,000)."  </P> <P> How close is it? Well, most Angelenos have seen Adams Hill, even if they don't  know what they're looking at: A cross marks the spot.  </P> <P> It gleams white from the museum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, which occupies  the southwest part of the hill, and is plainly visible for miles in either  direction from the Golden State and Glendale freeways. Adams Hill nestles  between those two freeways, just north of where they intersect.  </P> <P> Nestle, that favorite verb of the real estate industry truly applies here.  Small houses nestle on small lots that nestle on winding roads, some of which  -- belying the quaint and rustic feel of the area -- bear the names of vast and  sophisticated Eastern campuses: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Wellesley, Cornell,  Oberlin, Dartmouth.  </P> <P> John Wilson, an associate at Dorn-Platz &amp; Co. realtors, says that in  addition to a lot of old-timers "who love the place," the hill represents "an  intermediate step upward," ideal for "people who are moving to the area who  need a home that isn't out of reach."  </P> <P> Wilson grew up in the area but sensibly refrained from living on Adams Hill --  his brand of deadpan drollery might charm the birds from the trees. After he  retired from the Bell System, he says, "I cut the same bush every day at the  house and followed my wife around like a puppy dog" until he started his career  in real estate at the age of 59.  </P> <P> The houses on Adams Hill, he says, "generally are 40 to 50 years old, family  homes, well-maintained," that go "for somewhere between $120 and $150 a square  foot."  </P> <P> Besides its preponderance of old-time Anglos, the hill shows "quite a cross  section of ethnic groups," Wilson says. And residents agree, mentioning Asians,  Latinos and the fastest-growing segment, Middle-Easterners: Armenians,  Iranians, Syrians and Lebanese.  </P> <P> One glance at Adams Square, at the corner of Adams Street and Chevy Chase  Drive, tells the story. Next to the rosy-beige Adams Square Pharmacy with its  modest Art Deco tower, is the Super Mercado, and across the street is an  Armenian grocery, the Zeitoon.  </P> <P> The pharmacy's owner, Gil Franklin -- who's on a first-name basis with most of  his customers -- says the building, which once contained a ballroom upstairs,  has housed a store of some kind for 75 years. Nearby, at the intersection of  Adams and Palmer streets, the first Baskin-Robbins ice cream store opened in  1948.  </P> <P> Forest Lawn is the largest landholder on Adams Hill ("They're very quiet  neighbors," cracks Harnsberger Real Estate agent Cheryl Johnson), and those  spacious acres probably represent the major draw for winged nesters.  </P> <P> Some human ones are put off by the proximity to the cemetery. Bob Taylor, an  associate at Harnsberger, says "about 40% would like to purchase because of  Forest Lawn; maybe 60% wouldn't."  </P> <P> Among the unspooked category were architect Georgie Kajer, who bought her house  eight years ago for $85,000, and Bruce Cranston, 34, a Walt Disney Co. creative  executive who moved there at the end of May, paying "close to the high 200s,"  he says.  </P> <P> "I think everybody considers Forest Lawn a plus, to look up there and see open  space," says Kajer, a past president of the Adams Hill Homeowners Assn. "We get  raccoons, opossums, skunks, all kind of little critters from across there."  </P> <P> Explaining his move from Pasadena, Cranston says, "First of all, I have friends  up here, . . . industry associates. And it's a hill, a well-kept hill."  </P> <P> He revels in his view of south Glendale, and his easy commute. He considers the  price he paid "very reasonable" in light of comparable houses in other areas,  he says. "And there's always a breeze. It's cool at night."  </P> <P> It's impossible to talk to anyone on the hill, old or new residents, without  hearing mention of "afternoon sea breezes." It was a prime selling point of  1920s developers.  </P> <P> Until then the hill, roughly bounded by Palmer and Glendale avenues, Verdugo  Road and the Forest Lawn boundary, had been almost bare. It was part of 36,000  acres that Jose Maria Verdugo received from the governor of California in 1784.  </P> <P> At his death in 1828, Verdugo left his Rancho San Rafael to his son, Julio, and  daughter, Catalina. Don Julio, who was bequeathed the portion that included  what is now Glendale, lived on Adams Hill from 1860 until his death in 1876.  After that, as the rancho was broken into smaller parcels, W.C.R. Richardson  owned much of the hill, which at the time bore the name of the Santa Eulalia  Ranch.  </P> <P> At the turn of the century, Glendale stopped at Colorado Boulevard. The  settlement south of there was named Tropico by Southern Pacific when it built a  railroad depot. Forest Lawn arrived in 1906. Tropico acceded to becoming part  of Glendale in 1918, and a few years later, developers hopped onto the inviting  hill in force.  </P> <P> What is remarkable about their ads is how well they capture its flavor today.  </P> <P> A 1923 newspaper promotion, thinly disguised as a news story, points out that  the area's being "only about 20 minutes by automobile from Fifth and Spring  streets .  </P></p>

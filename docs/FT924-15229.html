			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Tec fees found to vary widely WIDELY VARYING fees are being charged by Training and Enterprise Councils for assessing companies applying for the Investors in People kitemark. A survey by Personnel Management, the magazine of the Institute of Personnel Management, found that charges varied from Pounds 150 to Pounds 400 a day. The kitemark is being promoted by Tecs and the government as potentially one of the most important indicators of good training and personnel practices within a company - assessing, for example, whether companies regularly review individuals' personal development plans. The government has not given Tecs any specific funding for assessing employers' eligibility, but it allows assessors to charge up to Pounds 500 a day.</p>

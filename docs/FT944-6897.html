			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / China to ease coal trade China's Ministry of Internal Trade plans to ease controls on trading of coal but will keep control over some mines and some coal trading to back infrastructural development. A growing part of the remaining coal supply will be freely traded, the newspaper China Daily reported. China has gradually eased government controls on a number of key commodities as part of its market-oriented economic reforms. In some cases, such as cotton, controls have been reimposed because of hoarding and quality problems. Easing restrictions on coal trading and distribution is intended to help improve the economic efficiency of state-run coal mines by allowing prices to rise, the report said. Subsidies now used to help support indebted mines will be used to finance state coal purchases at higher prices. China's coal output between January and October rose 5.8 per cent over the year-earlier period to 920m tons. Demand for coal, however, is growing at an annual rate of 7.4 per cent.</p>

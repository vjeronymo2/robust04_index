			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: IN THIS CORNER, THE LA JOLLA VERSION OF 'MEET THE PRESS'  </P> <P> Amid quiches and canapes, there was no place like UC San Diego Chancellor  Richard Atkinson's home to play last week's hottest game, "Meet the Press  Secretaries."  </P> <P> Any of the 100 local guests who hoped to engage the ear of a former  presidential press secretary found the odds quite favorable for getting his  wish since eight of the 10 who signed on to participate in last Friday's "The  Presidency, the Press and the People" symposium on the university campus were  on hand at the Thursday reception.  </P> <P> James Brady and Jody Powell were no-shows, but NBC news commentator John  Chancellor, who served as the symposium's moderator, attended with his wife,  Barbara, and made quite a splash with the carefully chosen list of influential  friends of UCSD and of KPBS-TV, which taped the forum for local broadcast last  week and for a PBS special that will air nationally later this year.  </P> <P> The lights in the reception rooms inexplicably and rather entertainingly  flickered out periodically during the evening, but with so many luminaries  present, few people seemed to notice the blackouts.  </P> <P> The evening was basically an instance of the "mingle and munch" phenomenon --  the press secretaries, presumably all veterans of Washington's rubber-chicken  routine, seemed enthralled by the Ortega chili quiche -- and it revealed a side  of Beltway protocol probably unknown to the majority of the San Diego guests.  Presidential press secretaries, or so it would seem, prefer to stand in  corners, a pose that evidently prevents flanking movements by impatient  glad-handers.  </P> <P> Newsman Bill Moyers, who served in the Johnson Administration, stood his ground  in a corner of the dining room through most of the reception. Other corners  became the temporary fiefdoms of the Ford Administration's Ron Nessen and  Reagan's Larry Speakes.  </P> <P> There were exceptions to this rule, just as some of the men did not wear bow  ties,  </P> <P> which seem to be the secretaries' sartorial secret sign. The garrulous Pierre  Salinger, well remembered from the Kennedy years and now based in London as  chief foreign correspondent for ABC News, roamed freely through the crowd,  shaking hands, chatting at length and showing a preference for the toasted  cheese canapes passed by servers.  </P> <P> George Reedy, who served Lyndon Johnson and now is a professor of journalism at  Marquette University in Milwaukee, retired early to the terrace to examine the  inclusive view of La Jolla and its cove offered. He huddled for a while with  Chancellor Atkinson, who came outdoors to enjoy his pipe and stayed on to give  the bartender explicit directions in the construction of Reedy's preferred  Martini (vodka, an olive and lots of ice).  </P> <P> Conversations often turned to the headier topics of the moment, such as Panama  (Bush Administration spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was to have participated in the  symposium, but he canceled after the invasion), but veered just as often in the  direction of San Diego tourist opportunities. Moyers repeatedly asked guests to  steer him to La Jolla's best practitioner of California cuisine.  </P> <P> Both Atkinson and his wife, Rita, spent much of the evening in the receiving  line, the post they regularly occupy at official functions given at their  residence. Asked how she liked having more than 100 guests in her home nibbling  sushi and turkey won-tons, Rita Atkinson shrugged and said, "Oh, I'm used to  it."  </P> <P> In addition to press secretaries -- the list included George Christian, Ronald  Ziegler and Jerald terHorst -- the guest list also included a few who had  served under them, including Margita White, who worked for the Nixon and Ford  administrations. She arrived with close pal Gloria Penner of KPBS, who  described the symposium as another indication of San Diego's increasing  prominence in national affairs.  </P> <P> "There are those who believe that, next to the President himself, the most  powerful person in government is his press secretary, and I'm inclined to  agree," Penner said. "To have almost every one of the press secretaries  together here in San Diego positions us, once again, as a national power base."  </P> <P> KPBS Community Advisory Board Chairman Viviane Warren saw the symposium as  benefiting the city, but she also thought it might aid in expanding important  minds that are constantly subject to Washington's peculiar myopia.  </P> <P> "It's like bringing the Beltway here, like transplanting a little of  Washington's charismatic 'oomph' to San Diego," she said. "But it's also good  for the press secretaries. They've never been all together outside the Beltway,  and their meeting in San Diego gives them a fresh perspective for their  exchange of ideas."  </P> <P> Whether exchanging ideas or simply the addresses of La Jolla eateries, the  press secretaries seemed to have a good time at the Atkinsons', as did the  local guests, among them KPBS Executive Director Paul Steen; UCSD Associate  Vice Chancellor Mary Lindenstein Walshok; Richard and Harriet Levi; Hugh and  Pat Carter; Paul Marshall and Darlene Davies; Donald and Darlene Shiley; Art  and Jeannie Rivkin; William and Anne Otterson; Harry and Susan Summers, and  Marianne McDonald with Adrian Jaffer.  </P> <P> The 33 young women who will be presented at the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority's  35th annual debutante tea and orientation Sunday learned, among other things,  that they will be expected to wear floor-length white gowns with modest sleeves  and billowing hoop skirts. The importance of the hoop skirts was repeatedly  stressed to the debs, who met at the UC San Diego International Center and who,  on the whole, seemed to take the information with youthful equanimity.  </P> <P> The sorority's local Epsilon Xi Omega chapter expects an attendance of at least  900 at "Through the Years, a Vision Fair," to be given March 31 at the San  Diego Marriott. Proceeds from the event will fund scholarships to be awarded to  10 to 12 college-bound seniors at San Diego high schools, and will also fund  such chapter projects as Neighborhood House, the Urban League and the United  Negro College Fund.  </P> <P> The sorority also assists several Headstart programs in the county. "We think  we're doing some real dynamite things," said chapter spokeswoman Cheeneah  Armstrong, who added that in addition to attending parties and charm classes,  the debs will be expected to engage in community service projects, such as  assembling Easter baskets for homeless children and working in literacy  programs. "The girls often will get together to choose, as a group, the service  they wish to perform," Armstrong said.  </P> <P> Chapter President Marsha Jamison said that more motives than might be readily  apparent fuel her group's enthusiasm for the annual debutante ball, which ranks  as one of the city's longer-running events.  </P> <P> "Our main focus for the girls is leadership enhancement, which is why they go  through both cultural and volunteer experiences," Jamison said. "All of these  are designed to make the debs self-assured and confident by the end of the  season. The proceeds go back to the community, and several years ago, we were  the first organization to receive the San Diego Black Achievement Award, which  always had gone to an individual."  </P> <P> Some of the newly minted debutantes expressed both excitement and a bit of  apprehension about their impending bows.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Legislation for pension security Sir, Your timely leader (May 11) outlining improvements needed to pensions schemes seems unexceptional apart from the suggested shift towards money purchase schemes. If these depend on the gamble on market performance and annuity rates at retirement day, they do not achieve the essential ingredient of a pension scheme - predictable and therefore reliable pensions. Now is the time not only to legislate for fund security but also to remedy the shortfalls of the Fowler legacy, which is not achieving the quintessential tenets. One is that we should all pay for our pensions as we journey through our working life. (But the abolition of compulsory membership of occupational schemes is now coupled with only voluntary personal pensions and is consequently resulting in an unacceptable proportion of people making no pension provision at all, so these will become an ultimate burden on the state). Another is 100 per cent fully-transferable service between occupational schemes, ensuring maximum flexibility for the benefit of the economy and for individual career prospects. The only financial beneficiaries of down-rated transfer values are the former or the new employers or both; a person changing his job should not be robbed in this manner when he has paid for his pension in good faith. The defensive but tortuous actuarial arguments (which adhere only to company considerations) ignore the essential national need that pensions need to be reliable. Personal pensions gain portability only by sacrificing reliability. What is needed is complete interchangeability between occupational pension schemes such as exists within the 'Club' in the public sector. Already many large company schemes match the Club in quality though not interchangeability. The Club scheme should become a model and perhaps even compulsory. It must surely be a sine qua non that if a company is to underwrite any actuarial deficiency then it is entitled to any actuarial surplus but only as a contribution holiday and not to repayment, because a deficiency might recur.

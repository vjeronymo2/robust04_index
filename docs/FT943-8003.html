			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Stadshypotek swings into black A sharp decline in loan losses enabled Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage credit institute, to swing back into profit in the first half ahead of a SKr3bn share issue planned for this autumn. The institute said operating profits of SKr651m (Dollars 82m) followed a SKr350m loss in the corresponding 1993 period. Mr Lars Wohlin, managing director, called the result 'very satisfactory' and put the group on track for full-year profits of SKr1.3bn after last year's SKr866m deficit. Profit before problem loans climbed 27 per cent to SKr1.66bn due mainly to higher net interest income of SKr2.04bn. The real force behind the revival was a 39 per cent drop in loan losses to SKr1.01bn. Problem loans have fallen to SKr6.1bn from SKr7.1bn at the year-end. The share issue will widen the ownership base of the institute, currently 100 per cent owned by Stadshypotekassan, a trustee fund. Two thirds of the shares will be offered to the institute's borrowers, who can waive subscription rights in favour of domestic and international institutions. Book value of distributed equity will be SKr9bn. The process bears similarities to Abbey National's conversion from mutually-owned building society to a bank, although unlike Abbey, Stadshypotek does not have savers and relies on wholesale bond markets for its funding. The institute will be listed on the stock market during the autumn. Joint global co-ordinators of the issue are Kleinwort Benson and Alfred Berg. Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, yesterday reported a decline to DKr366m (Dollars 59m) in first half profits from DKr2.37bn a year ago, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Core banking profits improved to DKr1.08bn from DKr919 following a drop in bad loss provisions by DKr200m.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY, CONSUMER GROUP FIGHT REVIEW DEADLINE IN SCE-SDG&amp;E MERGER  </P> <P> The city of San Diego and a local consumer group are opposing a proposal that  calls for state regulators to complete their review of San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison by March 30, 1990.  </P> <P> In a filing made last week with the state Public Utilities Commission, the  utilities suggested that their proposed review schedule included ample time for  merger critics to voice concerns to regulators. "While our proposed schedule is  not a leisurely one . . . it can hardly be characterized as a 'rush to  judgment,' " according to the filing.  </P> <P> The March 30, 1990, deadline coincides with a "drop dead" date that the two  utilities included in their merger agreement, which was announced in November.  The utilities have maintained that either company could abandon the deal if it  is not completed by then.  </P> <P> However, the proposed hearing schedule has drawn strong opposition from the  city and from Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action  Network, a San Diego-based consumer group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Review Extended  </P> <P> The consumer group has asked commissioners to extend their review of the  proposed merger until February, 1991, nearly a year longer than suggested by  Edison and SDG&amp;E. The city of San Diego believes that the review should be  extended until December, 1990, according to William S. Shaffran, deputy  attorney for the city of San Diego.  </P> <P> PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn Carew will hear arguments on the proposed  review schedule in a preliminary hearing Thursday in San Diego. It is unclear  when Carew will set a deadline for the review.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E and Edison have been arguing for a shorter review, while the utility  consumers' group, the city and other intervenors who question the need for a  merger have been pressing Carew to approve a lengthier proceeding.  </P> <P> The schedules proposed by the city and the consumers' group are driven largely  by a disagreement between the utilities and the Division of Ratepayer  Advocates, a PUC staff group that will issue a report on the proposed merger.  </P> <P> Edison and SDG&amp;E maintain that the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates  could complete its review and issue a report by July 17 of this year. The  Division of Ratepayer Advocates, however, has maintained that it cannot  complete its report until late this year.  </P> <P> Shames said Monday that the utility consumers' group needs two months to gather  testimony for its report to the PUC. However, the group can't begin that review  until after the Division of Ratepayer Advocates issues its report, Shames said.  "That's our major stumbling block with the schedule" presented by the  utilities, Shames said.  </P> <P> The city and the consumers' group also are arguing that Edison and SDG&amp;E  have failed to address significant issues in testimony. "UCAN feels that  Edison's (merger application) is incomplete, as do a lot of other intervenors  who believe that a lot of proper issues were not addressed," Shames said.  </P> <P> The city and the consumers' group have argued in PUC filings that the utilities  have failed to address the proposed merger's effect on competition in the  electric utility industry and whether there are alternatives to the merger that  would benefit customers.  </P></p>

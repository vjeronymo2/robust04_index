			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> New Ojai Fest Head: Englishman Christopher Hunt, who directed the $4.2-million  Pepisco SummerFare outside New York City, has been named consulting director of  the three-day, late-spring music festival in Ventura County. Hunt, 43, says his  goals are to "perpetuate a wonderful tradition" and eliminate an estimated  $90,000 deficit -- the largest in the festival's history. The red ink came from  last June's event, which generated less-than-expected ticket revenue, followed  by a fund-raising shortfall. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

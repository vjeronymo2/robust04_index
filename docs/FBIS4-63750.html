			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarusian Deputy Foreign Minister Petr Belyayev  announced that his republic's possible participation in NATO's  Partnership for Peace [PFP] program would not be analyzed before  presidential elections and the autumn parliamentary session.    In his opinion, politically, Belarus was ready to join this  project, and had informed the NATO leadership.    In an interview with INTERFAX, Belyayev said that the search  for his republic's possible participation in NATO's program was  very difficult, because Belarus had not yet reorganized its  armed forces due to the deteriorating economic situation.    Belarus must not hasten to join the Partnership for Peace  program, because it was faced with many problems in conventional  and strategic disarmament.</p>

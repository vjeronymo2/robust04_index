			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo extends losses to a fourth consecutive session THE NIKKEI average fell for the fourth consecutive day on the lack of window dressing for the September interim book-closing, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index shed 349.01 to 17,399.08, having seen the day's high of 17,909.71 in the morning session on buying by investment trusts, before extending its losing streak on late selling, and falling to the day's low of 17,398.98 just before the close. Volume remained thin at 260m shares against 231m. Losers led gainers by 693 to 243, with 161 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 21.12 to 1,310.60 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.85 to 1040.91. Buying by public postal insurance funds, and other public funds, advocated by the government's emergency fiscal package in August, was seen yesterday. However, this buying remained light. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that daily average trading volume and turnover grew to a year's high in September. Daily volume averaged some 390m shares, the largest since the same time last year when volume was 482m shares. Daily turnover averaged Y342bn, the biggest since Y430bn in October 1991. High-technology issues declined on worries over the higher yen. The currency closed at Y119.25 against the dollar, a new all-time high. NEC fell Y16 to Y697 and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y40 to Y1,070. Banks were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y130 to Y2,440 and Mitsubishi Bank fell Y130 to Y2,020. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, rose Y12 to Y510 on speculative trading. Aisin Seiki, a car parts maker, rose Y85 to Y980 on rumours of a successful nuclear fusion experiment. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 134.12 to 19,017.60 in volume of 25.5m shares. Roundup SENTIMENT was mixed in the region yesterday. HONG KONG closed weaker for the third consecutive day, the Hang Seng index losing 74.48 to 5,505.44, 3.2 per cent below last Friday's close. Turnover rose from HKDollars 1.78bn to HKDollars 2.00bn and brokers said that all sectors came under selling pressure except for banks and utilities. AUSTRALIA saw trade swollen by an ADollars 55m portfolio put through by BZW, but anticipated gyrations on futures failed to materialise and the All Ordinaries index closed 2.7 down at 1485.0. BANGKOK fell as investors worried about a meeting between Stock Exchange of Thailand officials and brokers to discuss price manipulation. The SET index closed 3.52 lower at 847.00 in turnover of Bt10.74bn. TAIWAN closed sharply higher after technical buying of blue chips by institutional investors and brokerages helped to improve sentiment. The weighted index rose 126.92, or 3.7 per cent, to 3,524.21 in turnover of TDollars 15.7bn against TDollars 10.8bn. MANILA rose in active trade for the second day in a row, the composite index ending 9.18 higher at 1,404.54 as blue chips, led by the telephone stock PLDT and oil issues, lifted the market. Brokers said that bullish sentiment was partly due to reports that the authorities had broken a syndicate linked to kidnappings in the capital. BOMBAY took a cue from the state-owned mutual fund, Unit Trust of India, which started buying on Tuesday, and the BSE index rose 98.67 to 3,294.42.</p>

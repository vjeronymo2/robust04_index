			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  COOK IT LIGHT: A HAM LOAF WITH VEAL -- AND TURKEY  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: I have used this Ham Loaf recipe since the 1930s. It is hard to  find veal in small markets, so the last time I made it I used turkey. That  changed the taste for me very much. I also used liquid egg substitute.  </P> <P> Could you lower the cholesterol and fat, and still have a nice Ham Loaf for me?  Thank you.  </P> <P>  -- HELEN, Broadlands, Ill.  </P> <P> BAKED HAM LOAF  </P> <P> 1 pound ground ham  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds ground veal  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 cup cracker crumbs  </P> <P> 1 cup milk  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 6 slices pineapple  </P> <P> 10 maraschino cherries  </P> <P> 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dry mustard  </P> <P> 1/4 cup vinegar  </P> <P> Combine ham, veal, eggs, cracker crumbs, milk, salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Generously grease 10 1/2 x 6 1/2-inch loaf pan. Place 6 slices pineapple with  maraschino cherry in center and between each slice in bottom of pan. Combine  brown sugar, mustard and vinegar and spread 1/2 over fruit.  </P> <P> Pack meat mixture in pan over fruit and sauce. Spread remaining brown sugar  mixture over top of loaf. Pack down well. Bake at 400 degrees 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Turn out on platter. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR HELEN: This is truly a delicious meat loaf. Unfortunately, there isn't  much I can do to it that is going to make it significantly healthier than the  variations you may have already tried.  </P> <P> Veal is naturally higher in cholesterol than almost any other meat. Since the  turkey substitution didn't taste right to you, I have left the veal alone. Just  be sure you use the leanest meats that you can get. You might try using turkey  and veal in combination (such as 1 pound veal and 1/2 pound turkey). Turkey has  about half the cholesterol of veal, and only about two-thirds of the calories.  </P> <P> I have used liquid egg substitute and non-fat milk in my revision, and I also  specified pineapple packed in juice to be sure you aren't using the kind packed  in heavy syrup, which is practically pure sugar. I don't recommend using  maraschino cherries either, so I made them optional. I prefer to avoid the  chemical additives they contain, especially the red dye.  </P> <P> By eliminating the salt and substituting whole-wheat bread crumbs for the  cracker crumbs, I was able to reduce the sodium in your recipe. I like the  flavor the bread crumbs give the loaf as well as the added fiber.  </P> <P> The sauce is another source of calories, so I reduced the amount of brown sugar  and specified "dark brown sugar" to get maximum flavor for the calories  consumed. I also based my nutritional analysis on both recipes making eight  servings since I determined that the whole loaf yields about sixteen 1/2-inch  slices.  </P> <P> You have been enjoying this Ham Loaf for more than 50 years, and I hope my  revised version will enable you to enjoy it for another 50!  </P> <P> REVISED BAKED HAM LOAF  </P> <P> 1 pound extra-lean baked ham, ground or very finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds extra-lean ground veal  </P> <P> 1/2 cup liquid egg substitute  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 cup soft whole-wheat bread crumbs  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dry mustard  </P> <P> 1/4 cup white vinegar  </P> <P> 6 slices canned pineapple, packed in juice  </P> <P> 10 maraschino cherries, optional  </P> <P> Combine ham, veal, egg substitute, milk, bread crumbs and pepper. Combine brown  sugar, dry mustard and vinegar in separate bowl.  </P> <P> Spray 10 1/2 x 6 1/2-inch loaf pan with non-stick vegetable coating. Place 6  slices pineapple on bottom of pan. Place cherry in center of -- and in between  -- pineapple slices. Pour 1/2 sauce mixture over fruit.  </P> <P> Pack meat mixture in pan over fruit and sauce. Pour remaining sauce over top of  loaf. Bake at 400 degrees 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn out onto platter. Makes 8  servings, or 16 (1/2-inch) slices.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> Original Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 420  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 165 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 17 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 982 mg  </P> <P> Revised Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 338  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 83 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 11 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 840 mg  </P></p>

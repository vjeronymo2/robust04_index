			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon The market has been wondering for some time whether and when MB-Caradon will go on the acquisition trail. But the strategic need to do so is growing more acute, to judge by yesterday's interim results. Pre-tax profits were up 28 per cent on the first half of last year. The interest charge fell as last year's rights issue proceeds were applied to reducing debt. Operating profits from security printing rose 45 per cent. That masks a pretty dismal performance in UK building materials, a market which appears to have got worse as the half progressed. MB-Caradon has managed its way through the recession better than some in this sector, but there must be a limit to the degree to which efficiency gains alone will limit the damage. It would be rash to assume that continental markets will continue to provide offsetting growth or to rely on much further gains from security printing. Last year's second half was already strong in that division. Volume growth is weak and operating margins have now topped 20 per cent. Scope for further enhancement is limited. Happily, gearing is down to 12 per cent. How the management exploits this strength is crucial to securing future growth. It has been reluctant to go on a buying spree too early in the downturn, but there is also a danger of missing the boat. Similarly, timing is of the essence in the sale of its 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox. The holding has more than doubled in value since the beginning of 1991. Finding a buyer will be harder once the recovery is complete.</p>

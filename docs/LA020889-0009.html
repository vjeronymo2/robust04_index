			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CUMMINGS, PIERCE LEAD BUCKS TO 115-106 WIN  </P> <P> Few thought the Milwaukee Bucks would have the fourth-best record in the  National Basketball Assn. this far into the season.  </P> <P> But they made believers of the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night at Milwaukee.  With Terry Cummings scoring 31 points and Ricky Pierce leading a late charge,  the Bucks beat the Cavaliers, 115-106, for their fourth win in a row and their  19th in their last 23 games.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers are 3 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Milwaukee in the tough  Central Division, and the Bucks have given Cleveland reason to believe they  pose at least as tough a challenge as the Detroit Pistons, who are three games  out.  </P> <P> Three of the four best records are in the Central. Cleveland, best in the NBA  is 34-11, the Pistons are 30-13, the Lakers 32-14 and the Bucks, who were 11-10  after the first quarter of the regular season, are 30-14.  </P> <P> One reason this victory is impressive is that the Cavaliers (14-9) have the  NBA's best road record. Another is that, while the Cavaliers were at full  strength, the Bucks were missing Sidney Moncrief and promising rookie Jeff  Grayer. Both have knee injuries.  </P> <P> Brad Daugherty kept the pressure on the Bucks in the first half when he was 9  for 12 and Cleveland led, 60-56.  </P> <P> Cummings, who has scored 81 points in three games with the Cavaliers, scored 18  in the first half to keep the Bucks in the battle.  </P> <P> By early in the last quarter, the Bucks led by six. But Cleveland had an 8-0  run and, with 7:30 remaining, led, 96-94. That's when Cummings and Pierce went  to work. A 7-0 run was interrupted by two Cleveland baskets, but Pierce sank  two baskets and Cummings another to make it 107-100 with 4:40 left.  </P> <P> After losing 13 of their last 20 games last season and getting knocked out in  the first round of the playoffs, the Bucks were not highly regarded going into  this season.  </P> <P> Age was one reason. Jack Sikma was 33, both guards, Moncrief and Pressey, were  over 30. There was age everywhere except for injury-prone Grayer, just out of  Iowa State.  </P> <P> Until Del Harris, in his second season as the replacement for popular,  successful Don Nelson, took 7-foot-3 center Randy Breuer out of the starting  lineup and put 6-foot-10 Larry Krystkowiak in, the Bucks appeared destined to  be an also ran.  </P> <P> But Sikma thrived at center and Krystkowiak, in his third pro season out of  Montana, became a giant at power forward. He has averaged 11.8 points per game.  </P> <P> "All I know," Cummings said, "is that people are taking us seriously. We have  known for some time we are capable of beating anybody. This was a big one."  </P> <P> New York 117, Washington 105 -- On a night when they played poorly at home, the  Knicks were fortunate to have Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley around to  control the boards.  </P> <P> And, when Ewing scored 12 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, the Knicks  won their 17th in a row at Madison Square Garden. They are 20-1 at home. The  only loss was to the Lakers.  </P> <P> "We played a terrible game," Ewing said. "But now, we have enough confidence to  win. Last year we would have lost this one."  </P> <P> The struggling Bullets have lost seven in a row on the road and are now 3-19  away from home.  </P> <P> New Jersey 109, Seattle 99 -- Obviously, the Nets fine performance against the  Lakers Sunday night was not a fluke.  </P> <P> With Dennis Hopson scoring 20 points and the other guard, Lester Conner turning  in a triple-double at East Rutherford, N.J., they beat the SuperSonics for the  second time in a row.  </P> <P> Conner, who had 13 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in this game, had 13  points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds last Tuesday at Seattle when the Nets ended  the Sonics' 17-game home winning streak.  </P> <P> The Nets didn't do anything for the teamwork of the Sonics. Dale Ellis, who  scored 34 points and Xavier McDaniel, who had 15, got into a heated argument in  the dressing room. Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff sent the media out as  tempers raged.  </P> <P> "I think the fight was good," Bickerstaff said. "Maybe it will fuel the fire.  The fight was caused by the frustration of losing."  </P> <P> Chicago 118, Charlotte 93 -- Michael Jordan was knocked flat by a stray elbow  to the face and came up limping in the first quarter at Chicago. It turned out  the elbow belonged to teammate Bill Cartwright.  </P> <P> But, Jordan scored 14 points in the third quarter, eight of them in a row, to  break the game open. Jordan, who scored 32 points and had five assists in 32  minutes, sat out the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Utah 96, Miami 77 -- The Heat played its normal road game, sinking only five of  their first 25 shots and lost for the 21st time in 22 games away from home.  </P> <P> Karl Malone, the No. 2 scorer in the NBA had 26 points for the Jazz, now only  one-half game out of first in the Midwest Division, and John Stockton had 20  points and nine assists.  </P> <P> Sacramento 114, San Antonio 99 -- Kenny Smith sparked a 17-2 burst late in the  third quarter at Sacramento that put the Kings in front and Ricky Barry, with  three bombs, kept them in front to end a six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Kings trailed, 67-66, in the third quarter before Smith scored seven points  in the rally. In the last quarter Berry scored 11 of his 23 points to keep the  Kings in command.  </P> <P> Portland 134, Dallas 125 -- Jerome Kersey scored a season-high 33 points and  reserves Steve Johnson and Kiki Vandeweghe keyed a fourth-period rally to lead  the Trail Blazers at Portland.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers, down by as many as 16 points, trailed 104-92 after three  periods but Johnson scored nine of his 14 points in the opening 6 1/2 minutes  of the fourth quarter, including two consecutive rebound baskets that capped a  24-9 spurt and gave Portland a 116-113 lead.  </P> <P> Vandeweghe scored nine of his 17 points in the final period as the Trail  Blazers outscored Dallas, 42-21.

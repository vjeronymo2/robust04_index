			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MARY STAR SHINES BRIGHT IN 28-9 VICTORY  </P> <P> Rolling Hills and Mary Star High Schools started the football season a day  before most the rest of the Southern Section at Daniels Field in San Pedro on  Thursday night, with the usual first-game rustiness.  </P> <P> Mary Star won, 28-9, but from the look of the first half, both teams seemed as  if they could have used a bit more preparation.  </P> <P> Running back Matt Redlew fumbled the ball away on the Titans' one-yard line to  end the Stars' first drive. The Stars also allowed a second-quarter safety when  a center snap sailed over the head of punter Jose Bermudez and into the end  zone.  </P> <P> Redlew ran back a first-quarter punt 29 yards for the game's first touchdown.  </P> <P> Robert Coulter, Rolling Hills' deluxe running back, ran into a roadblock in his  quest for a second 1,500-yard season. Coulter finished with 30 yards on 12  attempts.  </P> <P> Vince Orlando swept around the right side for a 14-yard touchdown run on Mary  Star's first possession of the second half, giving the Stars a 14-2 lead.  </P> <P> Option quarterback Nick Mariani capped the scoring with touchdown runs of one  and five yards.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills got its only touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Bill DeMucci to  Matt Kuptz in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Serra 38, Pasadena 0 -- Halfback Jerald Henry rushed for 98 yards and four  touchdowns, all in the first half, to lead the Cavaliers in a non-league season  opener at Pasadena City College.  </P> <P> Henry scored on runs of two, 42, eight and 46 yards as Serra opened a 24-0  halftime lead. The Cavaliers scored two more TDs in the fourth quarter on a  38-yard pass from quarterback Alex Marcelin to Clayton Cutrer and a 47-yard run  by Louis Williams.  </P></p>

From among those irregularities, the list of which has been  faxed to us, we mention the following: the broadcasting, on the  eve of elections, of two speeches made by President Mircea  Snegur, as the speeches doubtlessly had an electoral character;  a number of cases in which votes were cast while more than one  person was present in the ballot booths; a number of cases when  votes were cast outside ballot booths; attempts made at certain  polling stations to influence the voters; and the nonregistering  of persons who had already voted, which allowed for the same  persons to cast two or even more votes.</p>

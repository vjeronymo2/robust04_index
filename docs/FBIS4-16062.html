			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's newspapers  pay attention to the treaty on pooling the Russian and  Belarusian monetary systems which was signed on Tuesday. The  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection that  "Russia's national interests lie, apart from all else, in secure  and quiet borders. [no end quotes as received]    The newspaper notes that under the present conditions when  the border runs near Smolensk, a situation will be disquieting  if Belarus is not our friend, let alone enemy. "Any vacuum will  be filled up at once. Russia should think about its own  interests.    "Belarus will find a way to determine its bearings. It has  people and structures oriented on Russia. It is with them that  we shall cooperate. Opponents of reintegration do not sleep  either. According to the logic of events, they shall make the  next move."    In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, "we can  say now with satisfaction that political wisdom of Russian and  Belarusian leaders is taking the upper hand over considerations  of secondary importance".    The TRUD newspaper stresses that "the signing on Tuesday of  the treaty on pooling the Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems is possibly one of the greatest sensations".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an article by member of the  Russian academy of sciences Georgiy Arbatov on Soviet-American  relations where he notes: "It would be wiser for the United  States to appraise prospects for relations with Russia not from  the viewpoint of who occupies what post in the Russian  Government, of how great inflation or budget deficit is  (although this can be important for taking a decision on  credits).    "Other things are much more important for policy-makers:  What  is happening to the Armed Forces, what policy Russia pursues  towards the former Soviet republics, what happens to the  development of democracy and freedom of speech in Russia, how  open our policy is, what progress is achieved in fulfilling  disarmament treaties signed with the United States, what  prospects are for their ratification, etc.    "Sure, responsibility for the future of our relations rests  on both sides."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Admiral Igor  Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy.  Commenting on the events at the base of moth-balled ships of the  Black Sea Fleet in the Odessa port (Ukraine), admiral stresses:  "The fact that a Russian officer was handcuffed and beaten up (I  have in mind Captain Feoktistov and his deputies) is a crude  violation of human rights and rights of servicemen. "These acts  run counter to all Russian-Ukrainian agreements. I'm surpised  that Russian sailors had enough patience not to make a single  shot. However, some people were clearly waiting for these  shots."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an interview with Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov who claims that "everything Anatoliy Chubays (eds:  Chubays is responsible for the country-wide privatisation  programme) is doing, leads the country to its collapse".    At the same time, he states that he "has sincere relations  with President Yeltsin. And I would like to say the following  thing: I'm loyal to the president. No undercurrents. In future  too. I do not change sides".    The same newspaper runs an interview with former first  deputy  chairman of the Soviet KGB Viktor Glushko, describing his  viewpoint on the abortive state coup in Russia in August 1991.    A sensational theft took place at the grand hotel Evropa in  St. Petersburg, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI  newspaper. British national Luizidis Miltas fell victim of  robbers.    They stole his attache case from his suit with 15,000 U.S.  dollars, six million roubles, a credit card, his firm's seal and  commercial contracts with Central Asian countries. The Briton  assessed the value of documents at 17 million dollars.    In his opinion, the hotel security service did not take  adequate measures to prevent the theft. The security service of  the five- star hotel informed militia of the incident nearly  three hours later, although the theft was reported at once.</p>

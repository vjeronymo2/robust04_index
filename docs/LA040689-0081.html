			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  COOK IT LIGHT: DUTCH APPLE PIE: SIMPLE CHANGES TO EFFECT A HEALTHIER BOTTOM  LINE  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This Dutch Apple Pie recipe is one of my attempts to reduce the  calories and cholesterol in a favorite recipe. I've had raves about my version,  but I'm curious to know if you can cut out anything else to make it even  healthier.  </P> <P>  -- SUSAN SMITH, Suffern, N.Y.  </P> <P> SUSIE'S DUTCH APPLE PIE  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs  </P> <P> 1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened  </P> <P> 5 1/2 cups peeled, cored and sliced Rome apples  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> All-purpose flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour  </P> <P> 1/3 cup butter or margarine, at room temperature  </P> <P> Combine graham cracker crumbs and softened butter or margarine.

Serve at room  temperature. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SUSAN: Since you have already made some good changes in the recipe, my job  was a little easier. However, I was able to achieve a significant reduction in  the bottom-line figures with a few adjustments of my own.  </P> <P> I first tried to make this pie with only one-third cup crumbs and one  tablespoon margarine in the crust. The resulting pie tasted fine, but when  compared to your version the crust looked too skimpy. Therefore, I increased  the margarine and crumbs so the revised pie more closely resembles the  original. I was also able to reduce the amount of brown sugar by adding some  apple juice concentrate, increasing the cinnamon and adding vanilla to increase  the perceived level of sweetness.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> </P> <P> RE-REVISED DUTCH APPLE PIE  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine, softened  </P> <P> 10 graham-cracker squares, crushed into crumbs  </P> <P> 5 1/2 cups peeled, cored and sliced Rome apples  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons apple juice concentrate, thawed  </P> <P> Whole-wheat flour  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> Combine softened margarine and cracker crumbs.

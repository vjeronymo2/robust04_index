			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mihaela Rodina] </F>   [Text] Bucharest, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The room is cluttered with  old furniture, and yellowing photographs of the stars of  yesteryear look down from the walls of what seems a fitting  headquarters for Romania's National Party of the Right (NPR).  It is one of three extreme right-wing parties that have been  created since communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu was toppled  and executed in December 1989. Party president Radu Sorescu  told AFP: "Anti-semitism is old hat, these days we must fight  against immigrants and gypsies." Sorescu, a 30-year-old former  teacher of the Romanian language, told AFP he had spent two  years ensconced in a library to bring his party's doctrine to  fruition.    Romanian President Ion Iliescu last July asked the state  prosecutor to check on the legality of the NPR and two other  parties, the Movement for Romania and the Fatherland Party,  worried at the spread of apologists for fascism. The prosecutor  ruled in November that the parties were law-abiding, a  declaration immediately contradicted by a newspaper that got  hold of the NPR's internal constitution.    That document stipulated that members had to be of Romanian  origin, would wear the brown uniform of the Nazi army the  Sturmabteilung (SA) and could win the Nazi Iron Cross for  exceptional service. Despite provision for a Hitler salute in  the constitution, Sorescu said his supporters never gave such a  salute. But he did not deny the similarities between his dogma  and that of the Iron Guard, the pro-Nazi Romanian movement which  was active in the 1930s.    He maintains that he has retained only its "good points",  citing nationalism and discipline, and denounces the "mistakes"  the Iron Guard made before it was banned in 1941, like  assassinating opponents and deporting Jews and gypsies. "Many  people share our views, but are afraid to express them openly,"  he said, comparing the position of the NPR with that of French  ultra-nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front.    "Everybody called him a fascist, until the government  started  adopting the same stance on foreigners," he said. The party's  quarterly THE NEW RIGHT has a print-run of 5,000, and it is  snapped up like hot cakes. Its pages are brimful of attacks on  democracy -- "a utopia turned to anarchy" -- and of threats  against gypsies, who are blamed for rising crime.    One of the latest editions had an interview with Le Pen, who  said that France could no longer be a haven for foreigners.  "Ninety percent of Romanians hate gypsies," Sorescu said by way  of explanation for the magazine's success.    The NPR claims it is non-violent, but envisages legal moves  against those it judges to be incapable of integration, and  recommends sterilising gypsy women and creating "reserves" for  the "most recalcitrant" members of that minority. According to  the human rights organisation Peoples in Peril, based at  Goettingen in Germany, there have been more than 20 serious  attacks on gypsies since the fall of Ceaucescu.    The last was on September 20, when two gypsies were lynched  and a third was burnt alive in his shack at Hadareni, 400  kilometres north of here, by a mob out to avenge a Romanian  stabbed to death by a gypsy. Still in its embryonic stage, the  Romanian right garnered less than 0.2 percent of the vote at the  last general election in September 1992. But Sorescu is  confident his party will score much higher the next time round.</p>

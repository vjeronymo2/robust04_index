			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dice tumble in Kuala Lumpur over whether Chinese will play THERE is little the Chinese like more than a gamble. In Malaysia these days, it's a case of a gamble on a gamble. Two companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, Magnum and Dunlop Estates, have been involved in protracted negotiations with the authorities in Guangdong province, southern China, to set up a joint venture lottery. The people of Guangdong and elsewhere in China have been denied a legal flutter for many years. If the Magnum/Dunlop venture comes off there could be very handsome profits indeed. But if is the word. Both Magnum and Dunlop are part of Multi-Purpose Holdings, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, run by Mr Lim Thian Kiat, a 32-year-old Malaysian Chinese entrepeneur, who controls one of Malaysia's main lotteries through Magnum. Investors were queuing up to take a gamble on Mr Lim's gambling venture in China. This month, both Magnum and Dunlop requested a temporary suspension from the KLSE, apparently to avoid widespread speculation in their shares. Two weeks later, Mr Lim announced that, in principle, the Guangdong authorities had approved the project and requested that the suspension of the Magnum/Dunlop shares be lifted. In an unusual move, the KLSE refused. It wanted to know more about the status of the Guandong venture. Heavy rumours swept the Kuala Lumpur market about large blocks of Magnum and Dunlop shares being traded off course - outside the KLSE. Mr Lim came up with some guarded answers. Mr Lim said that, while Guandong had approved the project, other relevant authorities, presumably in Beijing, still had to give their endorsement. Little else was given away as, according to a Magnum/Dunlop statement, additional information could jeopardise 'corporate and business objectives'. The KLSE relented and, in the middle of last week, allowed trading in Magnum and Dunlop to resume. While analysts expected a drop in share price, the opposite happened. Shares in both companies made gains, though traders were somewhat mystified as to who was buying. Yesterday, shares in both Magnum and Dunlop fell in heavy trading. The gamblers are still there, still waiting to see whether their gamble on a gamble in China will eventually come off.</p>

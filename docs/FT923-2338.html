			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Panic feels pressure of diehards: Serb nationalists are becoming more radical ANOTHER confidence vote is being threatened against the federal Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, in a move which could further weaken his already fragile position in the federation. The threat came from senior nationalist members of Serbia's ruling Socialist party after Mr Panic yesterday suggested to his cabinet that the smaller Yugoslavia lodge a fresh application for membership of the United Nations. Mr Panic earlier this week received a commitment from both Moscow and Peking that they would support the application. But Serbia's Socialist party argues that Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has an automatic right to the seat since it is the legal successor of the former Yugoslavia. Yesterday, UN and European Community diplomats said the new Yugoslavia, as yet, has not the right to claim that status. Mr Borisav Jovic, an ardent critic of Mr Panic and a close supporter of Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, said the prime minister, by discussing the UN issue with the Yugoslav government and not the federal parliament, was by-passing his powers. But western diplomats yesterday said this was a pretext for further undermining Mr Panic, who is viewed as one of the few Serb politicians with whom the UN and the EC can negotiate. 'This is precisely the danger. We cannot make Panic into another Gorbachev - with lots of international support, but no domestic backing,' an EC diplomat said. 'The west should help Panic by lifting the sanctions,' said one of Mr Panic's advisers. The UN remains determined not to lift the sanctions. 'If the sanctions are not lifted, then Panic might fall,' his adviser added, conceding that Mr Milosevic could gain either way. 'This is Balkan politics. If some of the sanctions are lifted, Milosevic can claim victory by saying his firm stance showed the west that Serbia had a case all along. If they are not, then Milosevic can kick Panic out,' another adviser to the prime minister explained. He added that the west should impose sanctions on Croatia, since it has seized a swathe of territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina, undermining the UN. Public support remains dogged for Mr Milosevic. 'To put it simply. If the west wants Milosevic out, we will support Milosevic. We don't want to be dictated to by the west,' said Mr Jovan Zivanovic, a car mechanic.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Fashion: Stocking up on accessories WHEN you hang up your stocking for Santa this year, make sure it is a matt, black, opaque one. Into such a voguish receptacle the modern Father Christmas (wearing red biker's leathers trimmed with white fake fur and riding a Harley Davidson instead of a reindeer sleigh) will be unable to resist pouring all your accessory requests. With many women exercising a strict moratorium on serious fashion buys, this year it is the essential accessory or inexpensive basic item that updates your wardrobe and most of them are not too pricy for the present list. Start with jodhpurs - although you may need a pillowcase rather than a stocking if that is what you really want. Jodhpurs are this year's advance on leggings to go with last winter's comfortable loose sweater or shirt, but also good with dandy-style equestrian jackets. Best in basic black, they are Pounds 49.95 by Huntsman from Fenwick, Pounds 29.99 at Stirling Cooper and from Pounds 19.99 to Pounds 34.99 at Miss Selfridge. Black leather jeans are every designer collection's must-have, but Top Shop's are only Pounds 59.99, Miss Selfridge's Pounds 69.99. The new long-skirted or slim-trousered silhouette demands a new shoe shape, with more of a heel, perhaps a slight platform (do not overdo it unless you think Minnie Mouse is elegant) and a higher cut such as lace-up or elastic-sided ankle boot. Red or Dead's styles in this vein go from Pounds 60, Pied-a-Terre's from Pounds 39 to Pounds 99 and Russell and Bromley have wonderful long-toed lace-up ankle-boots for Pounds 95.50. Bored with the plain white shirt that has gone under your suit jacket for the past three seasons? Then abandon the jacket and try a cobwebby black crochet waistcoat as the first salvo in the 1970s fashion war. Costing Pounds 25 at Miss Selfridge, and Pounds 24.99 at Top Shop, the black crochet will also see you through party evenings over velvet or chiffon. Printed waistcoats are a big part of the dandy look for women and men - from Pounds 25 at Marks and Spencer to Pounds 59 and Pounds 99 (this one in silk) at Fenwick. Another variant on the white shirt is an old-fashioned men's white silk evening scarf (from antique shops or new version at Fenwick, Pounds 19.95) tied stock-style on the neck. Newest in scarves, and a pointer for next spring, is the long, 1920s style, in shimmery pale printed panne velvet, Pounds 69, or soft plain silk with contrast border, Pounds 85, from Georgina von Etzdorf (who can match the print in ties and scarves for your man).</p>

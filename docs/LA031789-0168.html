			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SYRACUSE 104;  </P> <P> BUCKNELL 81  </P> <P> Freshman Billy Owens had a career-high 27 points, and seventh-ranked Syracuse  outscored Bucknell 36-8 at the end of the first half en route to a 104-81  first-round victory today in the NCAA Midwest Regional.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Syracuse, 28-7, meets the winner of the Florida-Colorado State  game Sunday in Reunion Arena for the right to advance to next week's regional  semifinals in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Owens, only the third freshman in Syracuse history to reach the 400-point mark,  had 23 of his points in the first half.  </P> <P> He was only three points short of the Syracuse record for a freshman set by  Dwayne Washington in 1983, but he had scored no more than 19 points in any game  this season.  </P> <P> Stephen Thompson added 21 points, All-American Sherman Douglas hit 19, and Matt  Roe contributed 19 points, including four 3-pointers in the second half.  </P> <P> Mike Butts led the Bison, 23-8, with 22 points.  </P> <P> The Orangemen had some early problems against 15th-seeded Bucknell, the East  Coast Conference champions, before applying a killer full court press.  </P> <P> The lead changed 12 times in the first half before Syracuse clamped on the  press and scored 36 of the first half's final 44 points for a 52-36 half-time  lead.  </P> <P> Bucknell closed to within 10 points in the second half, but Roe killed the  rally with his 3-point shooting.  </P> <P> Syracuse played without starting center Derrick Coleman, who sat out the game  nursing a sore back and muscle spasms.  </P></p>

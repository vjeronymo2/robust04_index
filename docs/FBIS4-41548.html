			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Gennadiy </F> Yezhov]    [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- We are wholly in favor of  channelling most of the finance Russia receives from abroad  directly into the investment sphere, Viktor Chernomyrdin told  today's session of the Consultative Council on Foreign  Investment in the office of the Russian Government.    The head of the cabinet expressed confidence that there  already exists the necessary prerequisites for shifting the  emphasis of Western financial support for reform in Russia.  Traditional loans whose repayment is directly guaranteed by the  Russian Government should be abandoned in favor of targeted  financing for specific projects, based on collateral and other  ways of ensuring that loans are repaid, he remarked.    Chernomyrdin singled out five main areas on which the  Russian  Government will focus as it implements policy on attracting  large-scale foreign investment.    First, it will strive to ensure that legislation regulating  the activities of foreign investors is as complete and settled  as it should be.    Second, it will seek changes to the tax system designed to  stimulate production and investment.    Third, it will pursue a vigorous investment policy, in the  context of which it intends to allocate most centralized  financial resources on a competitive basis, promote mixed (state  and private sector) funding, provide government guarantees for  investment and improve the system of insurance for capital  investment.    Fourth, competition in industry and, especially, banking  should be given the utmost encouragement.    Fifth, foreign investors will be given the legal information  they need.    The prime minister referred to legal enactments regulating  enterprises with foreign investment that are in the pipeline.  He said that draft laws envisaged a number of major changes to  the tax position of foreign investors. Enterprises with foreign  investment are expected to be exempted from profits tax for five  years after registration. Restrictions on operations connected  with the movement of capital are likely to be lifted and foreign  investors (i.e. enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital)  will be granted the right to own land on which they build new  enterprises, installations, or production facilities.    Furthermore, enterprises with foreign investment will be  allowed to keep all the hard currency earnings from exports of  their own goods. Machinery, technological equipment, spare  parts, raw and other materials, components,and semi-finished  goods that enterprises import for their own production needs  will be exempted from tax levies and customs duty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The government of the  republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) remains by its stand that  negotiations with Croatia should be held in Geneva, because this  secures the R.S.K.'s equality in the negotiations, R.S.K.  foreign minister Milan Babic has told TANJUG.    "By conditioning the venue for the negotiations, Croatia is  trying to impose a political approach which does not comply  either with the principles which we have advocated, or with the  building up of mutual confidence founded on interest," Babic  said on Wednesday, after an R.S.K. government session. He  expressed regret that the deputy co-chairmen of the conference  on former Yugoslavia had not yet found a compromise solution for  overcoming this problem, but were holding out solely for  proposals by the Croatian side.    The key to the final resolving of relations with Croatia is  in the recognition of the R.S.K. by the international community  and in the signing of a peace accord with Croatia on that basis,  Babic said.</p>

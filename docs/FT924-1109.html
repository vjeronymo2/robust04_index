			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Major urges caution on Bosnia: Bush and Clinton pressed to accept gradual increase in pressure on Serbia MR JOHN MAJOR last night urged President George Bush and President-elect Bill Clinton to accept a gradual increase of pressure on Serbia rather than immediate military action to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia. As Mr Major joined Mr Bush in Camp David after a telephone conversation with Mr Clinton, his officials voiced confidence that this weekend's talks would result in the passage by Christmas of a United Nations resolution authorising military action to ground Serbian flights. The resolution would be accompanied by sanctions designed to reinforce Serbia's isolation. Mr Major's talks came amid signs that western governments were preparing to give full international recognition to the former Yugoslav province of Macedonia which is also threatened by Serb expansionism. At last week's Edinburgh summit, Greece blocked European Community recognition of Macedonia because of objections to its name. But senior British officials believe that the stalemate in the EC will not prevent Macedonia securing full UN membership in the first two or three months of next year. The officials also stressed the 'deterrent' element in the new UN resolution on Bosnia, adding that Mr Major remained firmly opposed to immediate military action against aircraft breaching the no-fly zone. In hectic negotiations in Europe this week both the US and France had pressed for a tougher military response to Serbian violations, officials said. In talks in Ottawa with Mr Brian Mulroney, Mr Major won the support of the Canadian prime minister for his cautious stance. Both agreed that passage of a resolution authorising enforcement of the no-fly zone could be followed by a graduated response to violations. Serbian aircraft might first be warned against taking off and then face the prospect of being forced to land rather than being shot down. In Sarajevo yesterday, Lord Owen, co-chairman of the international conference on Yugoslavia, persuaded Bosnian Moslems to agree to attend face-to-face local talks with Serbs and Croats. 'There is a readiness that wasn't there in September to talk . . . Whether it is serious we shall see,' he said. Michael Littlejohns reports from the United Nations: The UN Security Council yesterday authorised UN troops to escort an EC delegation bound for Bosnia to investigate reports of the systematic detention and rape of Moslem women by Serbian militias. In a unanimous resolution, the Council condemned 'these acts of unspeakable brutality'. Separately, the UN General Assembly, in a non-binding resolution, called for the use of force and the removal of the arms embargo against Bosnia. All 12 members of the EC, plus Canada, were among 57 abstentions, in a vote carried by 102 votes with none against. The US supported the motion which was initiated by Islamic states.

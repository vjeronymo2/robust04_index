			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Novosti'' newscast: Video report from the </F> Permnefteorgsintez Association by Mikhail Klepov and Boris  Petukhov, identified by caption; figures in brackets denote  broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [060810] [Klepov over video of small stream  followed by Permnefteorgsintez oil refinery installations]  Not so long ago this stream, the Pysh, used to be aflame. Oil  refinery waste flowed into it and was set alight to prevent it  from reaching the Kama river. There was even a special position  for this purpose, whose holder was described as the  ``incendiary.'' With the commissioning of pumping stations the  situation has changed. Now there are fish in the stream.    Air pollution monitoring has been stepped up. Discharges of  noxious chemicals into the atmosphere have been halved in recent  years. Sudden blowouts are a thing of the past. Hothouses  where flowers are grown have appeared literally under the  flares. The air in the production units is much cleaner now.  Modern production lines are being introduced here. An  automated motor oil and solvent packaging line is in operation.  Russia's first line packaging bitumen for the construction  industry has just gone into operation. The Association is  unstinting with hard currency earned from the sale of its output  when it comes to retooling and modernization. All this helps to  increase production efficiency and improve the ecological  situation.    Nonetheless, many problems remain. Noxious discharges into  the atmosphere have not yet been reduced to the permissible  limit; substantial amounts of petrochemicals still collect in  the soil; not all the waste is yet being recycled. All these  issues are being addressed by the collective in cooperation with  scientists and health and hygiene service staff. Great hopes  are being pinned on the modernization of the enterprise. A  decision to this effect has been taken by the Russian  Government.

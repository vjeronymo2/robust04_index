			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: AT THE ROOT OF A HAIRY STEREOTYPE  </P> <P> The three morning television shows have focused on an old question: "Do blondes  have more fun and bigger ratings than brunettes?"  </P> <P> For as long as I can remember, dark-haired women have been treated as an  acquired taste -- like anchovies. They're the villains in novels, the  stepmothers in fairy tales and the witches in films. They're represented by the  Leona Helmsleys, the Alexises and the girls who never get the guys.  </P> <P> If Jane Pauley had been blond, she never would have grown older. If Kathleen  Sullivan had been blond, she never would have been replaced. If Zsa Zsa Gabor  had been a brunette, she'd be making license plates in a penal institution  somewhere.  </P> <P> I don't know what it is about light hair that seems to bring forth an image of  goodness, innocence and vulnerability, but it has always been so, ever since  golden-curly-headed, sweet, orphaned Shirley Temple triumphed over  mean-spirited, spoiled, brattish Jane Withers.  </P> <P> You have to wonder if Harry would have loved Sally if she'd had dark hair.  Would Jane Russell have been the legend if she had gotten the bleach and  Marilyn Monroe the dye? Would the world be rooting for Ivana if she had black  hair?  </P> <P> Some stars saw the handwriting on the contracts and changed the course of their  careers by lightening up. I used to see Linda Evans on "The Rockford Files" as  a brunette, but her career didn't really take off until she became blond  Krystle on "Dynasty." Loni Anderson went unnoticed as a brunette; it wasn't  until she emerged as a sexy blonde on "WKRP in Cincinnati" that she became a  star.  </P> <P> The irony is that blondes still carry a stigma of their own -- that of being  "dumb."  </P> <P> How many blondes do you see in the U.S. Senate? Can you actually see Supreme  Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with platinum hair being treated with any  credibility? Or Sen. Nancy Kassebaum or Elizabeth Dole being spoken to in words  of more than three syllables if they were blondes? Forget the polls; I could  have told Geraldine Ferraro that people don't vote for blondes for vice  president.  </P> <P> I say you can't tell what's inside the package by the wrapping or the size of  the box. Meryl Streep is blond and she's smart. Elizabeth Taylor is sexy and  she's a brunette.  </P> <P> We've been told too long that women are worth an expensive hair coloring. Maybe  we should be rewarded for what we contribute to this world. That's what we're  really worth.  </P> <P> If I sound passionate about this, it's because I just had my roots dyed . . .  sable brown.  </P></p>

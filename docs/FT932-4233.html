			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Technology: Flying higher and further - Victoria Griffith reports on a replacement for Concorde The unveiling of the supersonic Franco-British Concorde two decades ago mortified many in the US aerospace industry. Although Concorde enjoyed limited commercial success - only a handful are in operation today - the sleek aeroplane gave the European industry a tremendous technological base to build upon, and served as a very visible reminder of the technological competition from the other side of the Atlantic. The US aerospace industry is determined that it will not be left on the ground when the next generation of supersonic craft is launched. At one time, the country had its own supersonic transport programme. But this ended in 1971, when the US Congress cut off funds for the SST project - with environmental arguments playing a strong role - after a contract had been awarded to Boeing. However, the launch date for the next generation of aircraft built to fly faster than sound may not be far away. A joint government and private sector research project in the US - officially known as the High-Speed Research Programme - has made a significant amount of progress in supersonic design and is expected to have a product ready for the market in the early part of the next decade. If everything turns out as the US aerospace industry plans, the new aeroplane should represent a substantial improvement on Concorde. The desired aircraft would probably not fly much faster, but it would be a lot kinder to the environment. Among the project's goals are a 90 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and much lower noise levels. According to its architects, the new aeroplane would also be cheaper than Concorde, would offer much more passenger space and would be able to travel far greater distances. Whereas Concorde can only be used for medium hauls, the new supersonic aircraft would be able to travel from Tokyo to Los Angeles in only four hours, compared with 10 hours today. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), which runs the supersonic research project, foresees a large market for the new aeroplane. According to the agency, as many as 2,000 new supersonic craft may be in use by 2015, generating sales of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.32bn) for the US sector. The research project receives financial and personnel support from aerospace manufacturers McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, as well as from General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which participate in engine development. Established three years ago, the programme is about to move into its second phase, which will require the testing of large models in flight simulators. Much research has focused on new materials to help designers achieve the desired results. High-speed flights generate a great deal more heat than that produced by ordinary subsonic craft, for instance. Part of the project's research concentrates on the use of ceramic matrix composites and other new materials which can withstand extremely high temperatures. 'The engine will have to stand temperatures 1,000'F (550'C) higher than the engine in a normal aircraft,' says Richard Hines, programme manager at Pratt &amp; Whitney. High-temperature resistance - not only within the engine, but within the airframe as well - will be essential if the new aircraft is able to travel the long distances hoped for. The programme is also working on new materials to increase the temperature tolerance of the airframe to 175'C. Another priority is the development of a low-emission engine. The project hopes to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 per cent, in a bid to cut ozone depletion. The key to this, according to Nasa, is to burn the fuel in a way that avoids excessive flame temperatures, which produce the offending gas at a high rate. One possibility is to cool the engine by mixing fuel vapour with air upstream of the burning zone. Much of the research into emissions and heat resistance feeds into another key element of the programme - reducing the high sound levels of supersonic air transportation. Anyone who has been visually impressed by Concorde in flight knows the technology's downside - the extremely high noise levels. The new materials with which Nasa has been experimenting should produce an aircraft up to 50 per cent lighter, according to Louis Williams, director of the High-Speed Research Division at NASA. The lower the weight, the less the drag on the aeroplane and the lower the sound level. Researchers are also focusing on noise at take-off. The faster the aircraft reaches high altitudes, the less annoyance it will give to people on the ground. One possibility is an engine that has a lower jet velocity at take-off than it does in flight. Another solution to the noise problem may come from new exhaust nozzle technology. 'The less thrust we have on take-off, the lower the noise,' says Bruce Bunin, programme manager at McDonnell Douglas. To reduce the thrust, the new engine may take in slower-moving air from the outside and mix it with the high-velocity air of the engine. Without substantial progress on the environmental front - both in terms of noise levels and emissions - the Nasa programme may have a short life. 'We're not even going to touch this in the final development stage unless we're sure it's environmentally sensitive,' says Samuel Gilkey, programme manager at General Electric. 'If we're restricted from flying into certain airports for environmental reasons, as happened with the Concorde, we just won't have a big enough market to make it worthwhile.' Even if the research yields a relatively low-noise aeroplane, noise pollution worries make it unlikely that supersonic flights will occur over land. Still, an easy-listening sonic boom would encourage more airports to open their runways to over-the-ocean arrivals and take-offs. That and the added improvements in increased space, price, and lower emissions could make the final product extremely desirable.</p>

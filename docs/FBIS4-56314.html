			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Panama maintains good commercial relations with the  EU (European Union), although there have been some differences  regarding some products. This was announced by Commerce and  Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega.    Although the EU has imposed certain restrictions on our  country, on products such as bananas, seafood, and fish,  Commerce and Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega said multilateral  commercial relations are at a very high level. A ruling is  pending in the case of bananas.    [Begin Fabrega recording] Within those commercial relations  we have some differences of opinion, such as on the topic of  bananas. We have established mechanisms of communication,  however, and have announced our position. Certain countries of  the EU support our stand, and this is being defined by a  tribunal. We expect a ruling will favor our decision sometime  around October. [end recording]    In the case of seafood, Panama will make certain  modifications so as to later resume commercial relations with  European countries on this product.    [Begin Fabrega recording] In the Athens meeting, we held  some  meetings with ranking EU officials. They explained what gave  rise to the problem with seafood in terms of the rules of origin  of the seafood. We were able to reach a very satisfactory  agreement on such rules. We think that within a very short time  our seafood products will enter the European market duty free.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke focuses on opposition education plans THE Conservatives yesterday took the election battle to Labour's ground with a sharp attack on opposition plans for education, Philip Stephens writes. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, accused Labour of planning to reverse the drive towards higher standards for education, which he said was behind the government's school reforms. Mr Clarke launched a poster campaign which suggests that Labour would turn children into dunces by abandoning the national curriculum, diluting examinations and banning the publication of school-by-school results. Mr Clarke said the opposition planned 'an assault upon the future of our children'. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spokesman, responded with a point-by-point denial of the charges, saying that Mr Clarke was guilty of a series of obvious and 'outrageous' lies.</p>

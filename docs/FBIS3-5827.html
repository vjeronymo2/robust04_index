Strategic Commander  Col. Thura Thiha Thura Sit Maung then detailed the progress of  the Ye-Tavoy railway line project.    Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Maung Aye said that during  the time the SLORC holds state powers, it is constructing new  railway lines in states and divisions in order to provide smooth  transportation. He expressed his satisfaction at seeing local  people willingly and competitively participate in the project in  order to bring about development in their respective areas. He  said the state is providing vast sums of money, both in local  and foreign currencies, for the railway construction projects.  He urged the departmental authorities and local people to  participate actively and cooperate in the project. He also  spoke on forest conservation, expansion of agricultural  enterprises, and expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations.    Next, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt addressed the  meeting. He said he had come to Ye along with the deputy  commander in chief of the Defense Services and ministers to  inspect the progress in the construction of the Ye-Tavoy  railway, which is being undertaken for the sake of local  development, and to provide the necessary assistance.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that during the time it holds state  powers, the SLORC is working for national development and to  improve the standard of living of the indigenous people. He  said the prevalence of law and order and local peace and  tranquility are the main prerequisites for carrying out national  development tasks. He said all citizens should work hand in  hand, in unity, and with zeal and diligence in the name of  national progress. The SLORC has invited the armed  organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold in order  to work hand in hand.    He said that armed organizations in Mon State understood the  state government's invitation and held an initial round of talks  with us. Preparations are underway for the second round of  talks. He expressed his hope that the armed organizations in the  Mon State will return to the legal fold following the second  round of talks.    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the USDA is  the most fundamental organization for the entire Union and that  the objectives and aims of the organization are based on the  spirit of patriotism in striving for the emergence of a modern  nation. Therefore, he said, he urged the entire general public  -- including public servants -- to work for the further  expansion and strengthening of the USDA. He said while it is  necessary for all armed organizations in the jungle to make  joint efforts in striving for the emergence of Myanmar as a  modern nation, it is necessary for all indigenous people to  participate with diligence and zeal.

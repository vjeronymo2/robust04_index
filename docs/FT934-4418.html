			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Extracts from Pehr Gyllenhammar's resignation statement For many years I have worked as assigned by the board of directors to provide Volvo with an economically sound structure and to participate in the establishment of a world-class automotive industry through a merger with Renault. Since the board's proposal for the merger is deemed not to have the support of the shareholders, I have decided to resign from Volvo's board of directors, effective immediately. My special assignment from the Volvo board has been strategic. That is, to develop a co-operation with Renault and to complete the Procordia project. This assignment has now been carried out after four years of preparations. The proposal to merge with Renault has been subject to a lively debate. Discussions have been conducted with a fervour that has gone well beyond anything that is normal for large business deals. The Swedish maxi devaluation has created hopes that Volvo will now do well on its own. A couple of positive quarterly reports and the prematurely published monthly results would have changed Volvo's strategic position in the world automotive industry? This of course is not the case. The alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management who, understandably, has lost their confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will require time, energy and will be demoralising. To build for the long term is the base for a good industry. Our painstakingly built relations with France and with Renault will now be destroyed. The critics of our merger turn their backs on Europe and the world. This reduces the probability of a Swedish presence in Europe and for Volvo's long-term survival. The excitement over a temporary upturn in Volvo's share price should be seen in the perspective of the lost opportunity for Volvo to develop in a larger industrial structure. The weakness of capitalism is its shortsightedness. The tendency is to follow the law of the least resistance. Volvo is now left with a failed merger project. With a crushed organisation which since September this year has been built for Renault-Volvo RVA. With an alliance which certainly has to be dismantled, and with concern and worries which will not quickly disappear after what has happened. Volvo is right now a wounded company and runs the risk of being uprooted from its unique and genuine Gothenburg base, with a perspective towards the world. Volvo is about people in a joint mission. I have had a firm belief in Volvo's future in a merger with Renault. I have today decided to leave the Volvo board of directors with immediate effect.</p>

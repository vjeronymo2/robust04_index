			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Bonn urged to come clean on finances THE German government was challenged yesterday to spell out clearly the country's financial situation and urged to freeze public spending. Publishing details of financial problems and their causes would make it easier to persuade people of the need to economise, according to Prof Hans-Jurgen Schmahl, head of the HWWA economics institute in Hamburg. The condition of state finances was increasingly alarming, he said at the presentation of a review by the country's five main economics institutes. Companies and individuals faced increased social security contributions, he claimed, because outgoings were outstripping income. Describing the institutes' lowered forecast of 1 per cent growth in the west this year as 'uncertain', he urged more pay claim moderation and renegotiation of agreements guaranteeing most east German workers pay parity with the west by the end of 1994.</p>

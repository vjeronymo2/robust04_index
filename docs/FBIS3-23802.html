			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Armenpress report: "People Need Normal Conditions"] </F>   [Text] A "roundtable" in the House of Journalists organized  by the "Armenia-Russia" and "Ayk" societies and the Journalists  Union of the Republic of Armenia was devoted to problems of the  migration of the population from the country.    The chairman of the "Armenia-Russia" society, Professor of  Philology Vladimir Grigoryan, who opened the meeting, emphasized  the importance of the problem under discussion. The ultimate  goal of the "roundtable," he said, is the development and  submission of recommendations to the republic's government.    The scientists who spoke subsequently--sociologists,  economists, demographers--were almost unanimous in the main  point: the problem of migration should be examined and monitored  at the state level.    As one should have anticipated, opinions differed in the  particulars. Thus, the director of the Sociological Research  Center, Gevorg Pogosyan, who cited a figure for those annually  leaving the Republic of Armenia (23,000-25,000--this is only  those stricken from residence permit registration and how many  leave while retaining it is not known precisely), focused the  attention of his colleagues on the "brain" drain from the  country. That is why it is necessary to create conditions for  full-blooded work in the motherland for national intellectuals.  The fact is that there are scientists and even entire institutes  of the European level in Armenia. The diaspora and friendly  developed states can help in this matter; however, not on the  crudely "humanitarian" level being done, for example, in  Bangladesh and Somalia.    The prominent Armenian sociologist Agaron Adibekyan offered  his vision of the problem: study the mental state of the  migrants, who, in his view, are siezed with a fear of the  unknown based upon an information vacuum. Explanatory "therapy"  is needed in order for people to know what is waiting for them  in the future and how to adjust to difficulties and to find a  way out of the negative realities on the spot.    Doctor of Economic Sciences Suren Karapetyan, who considers  that the outflow of population from the Republic of Armenia is a  good thing under present conditions, expressed a contrary point  of view. As an argument he referred to the objective capability  of Armenia's agriculture to feed its population of almost four  million only for... two months a year. And even industry is not  capable of ensuring its needs under market economy conditions,  as well as the employment of labor. That is why it is pointless  to raise the question of hindering the outflow of the  population. One needs only to selectively regulate it to retain  the cadres which constitute the nation's intellectual potential.    Rafik Seyranyan, a scientific associate of the Institute of  Philosophy, dwelt on the problem, dear to him, of refugees, a  certain portion of whom, after a short sojourn in the  motherland, have left it. In particular he noted the  significance of their intellectual and labor potential for  Armenia, having proposed the creation of a data bank (not a  primitive questionnaire one but one more in depth) in order to  utilize this considerable force for the good of the republic.    The emotional speech of Candidate of Economic Sciences Sevak  Ayvazyan provoked the approval of the majority. He named the  breakdown of the former union and the rejection (even if  temporary) of a pro-Russian orientation as the global cause of  the breakdown of life (and as a consequence--of mass migration).  Having supported the idea of the creation of a governmental  organ on migration-related problems, S. Ayvazyan also stated the  urgency of the day-to-day ensuring of the survival of our  compatriots.    An interesting thought was heard in the speech of  cooperative  chairman Suron Tarkhanyan, who suggested the idea of the  balancing of exports and imports. Nothing prevents Armenia from  exporting work groups and services besides goods, for example,  the construction brigades traditionally in demand in the CIS  countries. Organization of the latter should emanate from state  structures. This will relieve the republic and also will bring  in a profit to the republic from abroad.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Drop in M0 growth fuels hopes of interest rate cut Hopes of a fall in UK interest rates were fuelled yesterday by news that the seasonally adjusted annual increase in M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, fell to 5.3 per cent in January, from 5.8 per cent in December. M0 is one of a number of indicators of inflationary pressure followed by the government. Traders hoped that signs of a slowdown in M0 growth might persuade the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England to cut rates after their monthly monetary meeting tomorrow. However the main reason for the drop in M0 growth was a decline in banks' operational balances at the Bank of England. Growth in notes and coins, the main component of M0, rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to January, the same annual increase as in December. The increase between December and January was a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent. On an annualised basis, notes and coins in circulation have been growing at 9 per cent over the last three months. Even after the January fall, the M0 rate remains above the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per cent. But the monetary authorities have not been too concerned about this, arguing that low interest rates, which have reduced the effective cost of holding cash, are helping to cause high M0 growth. The Bank of England also released figures yesterday showing that December growth in M4, the broadest measure of money supply, was slightly lower than indicated. Seasonally adjusted M4 rose 0.6 per cent, compared with an earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours keen to embark on another hostile bid AIRTOURS, the tour operator, is keen to embark on another hostile bid after its failure to acquire its rival, Owners Abroad, earlier this year, Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said yesterday. Speaking to the Association of British Travel Agents' convention in Majorca, he said that when Owners Abroad published its next full-year results its shareholders would be better able to judge whether or not Airtours had offered a fair price. Mr Crossland said he had learned from the Owners Abroad bid: 'The one thing I did learn about the City is that there are some people there who are like rhinoceroses. They are thick-skinned and they charge a lot.' He added, however: 'I'd love to do it again.' He said the bid for Owners Abroad had failed for three reasons. The first was the success of Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, in persuading LTU, the German company which owns Thomas Cook, to make a financial commitment to ensuring that Airtours was defeated. The second was that the Takeover Panel had applied the rules relating to concert parties more vigorously to Airtours than to Owners Abroad. The third was the defection of a previously-supportive institutional investor to Owners Abroad. This is believed to have been a reference to Gartmore, the investment manager. Mr Crossland said that if Airtours looked outside the UK for future acquisitions, Germany would be his favoured market.</p>

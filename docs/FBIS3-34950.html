His confessions and other clues indicated  that this equipment was to be delivered to him in the German  port of Hamburg by Djamel Lounici who is wanted for involvement  in a number of terrorist activities.    An unforeseen event happened and prevented the delivery of  the equipment at the German harbor, but in the end the weapons  were delivered to Hacene Mialet in the Belgian port of Antwerp.  Investigations are continuing and have led to the arrest of  several people involved including the above-mentioned sailor.    The weapons seized are: 20 rifles, 15 automatic pistols, a  considerable quantity of ammunition, two-way radios, and optical  equipment.</p>

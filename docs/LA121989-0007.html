			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESCUADRON DE LA MUERTE  </P> <P> Could death squads from El Salvador be operating here? Most people would  instinctively call that impossible and blot out the thought that the terrible  brutality of that country's civil war is a problem for the many Salvadoran  refugees who have fled to the United States. But in the large refugee  community, people aren't so sure. That's why last week's action by Los Angeles  Police, who named a local Salvadoran businessman as a suspect in death  squad-style threats against local priests and refugees, is important. It says  that law enforcement is determined not to let the grisly battles of El Salvador  surface in the Southland.  </P> <P> The validity of the allegations will have to be determined in a court of law  when and if Carlos Rene Mata, 35, is formally charged. Mata, the proprietor of  an overnight delivery firm that ships goods between Central America and the  United States, is already in jail on suspicion of receiving stolen property and  of threatening a former employee of his company, Pipil Express. He also faces  trial in U.S. District Court on charges that he smuggled illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> Allegations of Mata's possible links to death squads in El Salvador were  contained in an affidavit filed last week by a police detective involved in the  continuing investigation of his activities. The FBI, the U.S. Customs Service  and Immigration and Naturalization Service are also involved in the probe.  </P> <P> Death squads are a frightening aspect of the long Salvadoran war. Bands of  right-wing thugs who harass and intimidate their political opponents with  threats, kidnapings and murder, the death squads have killed almost as many  people as have died in combat.  </P> <P> The possibility that death squads might be in Los Angeles was first raised in  1987, after three kidnapings of Salvadoran refugees, one of them a woman who  was also raped by her abductors. About the same time, local priests active in  helping Central American refugees also revealed that they had received  telephoned death threats and anonymous notes signed with the initials "E.M.,"  which stands for Escuadron de la Muerte -- Spanish for death squad. Similar  threats were recently reported by two local refugee agencies.  </P> <P> After the 1987 incidents, police and the FBI assigned investigators to  determine if they might be linked. It is still not known whether the probe of  Mata and his company grew out of those incidents. In any event, the actions  taken against Mata send a signal to the entire community: Allegations of  death-squad activity are taken seriously in Los Angeles, and death squads will  not be tolerated here. And anyone inclined to take the dangers posed by death  squads lightly should recall how Chilean dissident Orlando Letelier was  murdered by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's secret police on the streets of Washington  in 1976.  </P> <P> An estimated 300,000 Salvadorans live here, so it's impossible to keep the  tragedy of El Salvador from crossing national borders and brushing the lives of  emigrants. But if law enforcement is vigilant, the bloodshed of that war will  never spill onto the streets of Los Angeles.  </P></p>

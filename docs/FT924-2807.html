			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Japanese nearer to financial contribution Japan is considering whether to provide a financial contribution to UN-backed relief efforts in Somalia, Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday, Steven Butler reports from Tokyo. Mr Kato's comments were the strongest indication yet that Japan would back the international effort led by the US, although Japan may still be vulnerable to criticism that its response was late and inadequate. In particular, it is widely believed that Japan's slow reaction has damaged its chances of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Mr Kato said it was still too early to discuss the potential size of a Japanese contribution. Mr Kato said, however, that Japan faced no constitutional barriers to supporting the effort, since it was humanitarian in nature. He said Japan may provide medical assistance and refugee relief, and would consider whether to support the effort with Japanese personnel. However, there would be little public support for sending troops from its Self-Defence Force to Somalia. A unit of Japanese troops is now in Cambodia as part of the UN peace-keeping effort. This is the first time since the second world war that Japanese troops have been dispatched overseas, and there has been controversy both at home and throughout Asia. After a wrenching domestic debate, Japan eventually contributed Dollars 13bn to supporting UN efforts in the Gulf War.</p>

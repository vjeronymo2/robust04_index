			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan's long-term credit banks fall sharply JAPAN's three long-term credit banks reported an average 44.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended in March. The weakest of the trio, Nippon Credit Bank, suffered a 60 per cent plunge in profits, partly due to a restructuring of finance company affiliates. As with most other Japanese banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and NCB reported a sharp rise in operating profits as falling interest rates created a favourable spread. But those earnings were eroded by fresh provisions for non-performing loans. For the first time, the banks provided individual totals for their bad loans  -Y543bn (Dollars 4.9bn) at IBJ, Y715bn at LTCB and Y592bn at NCB, where assets shrunk 5.5 per cent during the period. The bank is still overhauling three financial affiliates, whose problem loans are estimated to be about 20 per cent of outstanding loans. The country's seven trust banks face problems with property-related loans from their trust account, and reported an average fall of 26.7 per cent in pre-tax profits. They also capitalised on favourable interest rate trends, with operating profits leaping by as much as 108 per cent at Chuo Trust and Banking. Mitsui Trust and Banking reported a more modest 7.6 per cent increase in operating profit, while Mitsubishi Trust and Banking recorded a 47.19 per cent increase. Net interest revenue rose by 130 per cent at Yasuda Trust and by 21 per cent at Sumitomo Trust. The trust banks' profit reports would have been less flattering if not for afavourable change in accounting regulations late last year by the Ministry of Finance. In previous years, trust banks were only allowed to report interest already received on loans from their trust account. However, for the period just ended, they were able to report delayed payments from troubled clients, as long as they were not more than six months overdue. The banks announced their individual non-performing loans, ranging from Y73.1bn at Nippon Trust Bank to Y561.8bn at Mitsubishi Trust, though these figures tell only part of the story. Mitsubishi Trust is one of the stronger trust banks, and the Japanese definition of non-performing loans gives banks much flexibility in calculating their totals. As long as one payment has been made in the past six months, the loan is not necessarily bad. The banks' capital adequacy ratios are also a poor guide to their health, as even the shakiest of the trust and long-term credit banks was well above the 8 per cent threshold, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements.  ------------------------------------------------------                CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS (%)  ------------------------------------------------------                             March 1993     March 1992  ------------------------------------------------------ Mitsubishi Trust               9.77           8.38 Sumitomo Trust                 9.81           8.78 Mitsui Trust                  10.22           9.10 Yasuda Trust                  10.25           8.42 Toyo Trust                     9.79           8.55 Chuo Trust                    10.04           8.12 Nippon Trust                  10.34          10.37 Industrial Bank of Japan       8.97           8.33 Long-Term Credit Bank          9.09           8.27 Nippon Credit Bank             9.00           8.33  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Suzuki to develop minicar with VW SUZUKI and Volkswagen are to develop jointly a European minicar to be built by VW's Spanish subsidiary SEAT in Spain. The car will replace the Marbela, which SEAT makes under licence from Fiat, its former partner. Minicars, of which Suzuki is a big producer in Japan, are smaller than virtually any car produced in Europe. Both SEAT and Suzuki-badged versions are expected to be sold throughout Europe, through each partner's distribution network.</p>

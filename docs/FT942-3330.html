			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint for the line It is becoming something of a tradition for European telecom operators to pay fancy prices for minority stakes in their US counterparts. BT started the trend with its Dollars 4.3bn investment in MCI last year. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are following suit with their Dollars 4.2bn investment in Sprint. It is a mark of the relative dynamism of US operators that European groups have to bribe them to become partners in global alliances. As well as negotiating a good price, Sprint has been able to clinch a central role in the new alliance. It will own half the alliance's global network, despite being smaller than either partner. Sprint will also have total responsibility for marketing the partnership's services within the US, a third share in European markets outside France and Germany, and a half share in the rest of the world. Whether this will be sufficient to win over US regulatory authorities is unclear. The argument that foreign state-owned monopolies should not be allowed to compete in the US could strike chords with the Clinton administration. Approval may be contingent on the French and Germans opening their own markets to competition. Rival groups are unlikely to wait for regulatory decisions before planning their responses. AT&amp;T may well formalise its association with Unisource, an alliance of Swiss, Dutch and Swedish operators. BT will redouble efforts to woo Japan's NTT as well as seeking to build up its position in continental Europe. That leaves Cable &amp; Wireless looking like the odd man out. It has opted to provide global services through its existing 'federation' of operators. But what it possesses in geographic reach, it lacks in financial muscle.</p>

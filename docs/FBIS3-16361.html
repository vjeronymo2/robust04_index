			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- Aleksandr Livshits, leader  of a group of experts to the president of Russia, is against the  passage of bills on an economic state of emergency and on the  restoration of administrative mechanisms of management,  including a wage freeze.    In a statement received by ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [16  March],  Livshits admits that "the Federal Assembly, of course, has the  right to determine legislative work priorities". However,  Livshits, dr. of science (economics), is of the opinion that  "the Russian economy is now in need of a legislative basis for a  market economy, not a state of emergency which would not resolve  a single deep-seated problem".    Livshits also points out that "the government, basing itself  on the presidential message to the Federal Assembly, must  energetically implement its programme and monitor the situation.  The government should not be pulled about and rendered  panicky," he emphasises.    The presidential message determines a reform strategy and  basic guidelines for domestic and foreign policies. "No such  thing as an economic state of emergency is spelled out there,"  the presidential adviser noted.    "The president makes active efforts in a quest for national  concord. Any actions of the Federal Assembly in this respect  will find understanding and support. But concord does not mean  a renunciation of reform or a rollback to unjustified emergency  measures," Livshits stressed.</p>

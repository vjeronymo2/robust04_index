			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (10): In search of an overhaul - European financiers now view restructuring as part of their staple diet Merchant banks and financial advisers are changing their opinion of corporate restructuring, long regarded as a byword for redundancies, asset disposals and a company's reluctant admission that it had failed to diversify. European financiers, who in the past told clients to restructure as a last resort, now view the process as part of their staple diet and a growing source of mergers and acquisition opportunities. That change of heart has, to some extent, been forced by the economic climate in continental Europe, where a raft of industries are struggling with prolonged recession. Against that background, restructuring has emerged as preventive medicine against the worst effects of falling sales and increased competition. International corporate financiers have become the mechanics of this operation, with companies turning to them for a complete overhaul rather than a routine service. This involves identifying over-extended parts of the business; finding likely buyers for non-core activities; and, where necessary, underwriting injections of fresh capital. Ms Naneen Neubohn, managing director of financial advisory services at Morgan Stanley, says: 'Restructuring now encompasses a range of strategic options. It can be as small as a dividend cut to a major change in a group's debt portfolio.' For many companies such moves are a precondition to forming international alliances or, in some cases, making the group a palatable target for an overseas suitor. Sweden's Nobel Industries, for example, was forced to embark on a significant restructuring last year before Akzo of the Netherlands would proceed with its Pounds 1.38bn merger plan. Mr Ken Costa, deputy-chairman at S G Warburg, claims the transaction - creating one of Europe's largest chemical groups - shows how merchant banks are benefiting from the restructuring process. 'The restructuring had to take place because Nobel's debt levels were too high. It did that by using London's capital markets - it's proved a resilient place to get these deals off the ground.' Similar criteria also led to a radical shake-up and thousands of job losses at Saab, the Swedish automotive group, before General Motors of the US took a 50 per cent holding. Once restructured and revived as part of an enlarged group, these companies tend to be better placed to compete in international markets. The restructuring process, meanwhile, has another side effect at least as lucrative to the merchant banks as refinancing of struggling companies. Mr John Griffiths Jones, senior corporate finance partner at accountants KPMG, says disposals by companies undergoing restructuring have now become the main source of takeover opportunities in the UK - promising sizeable fees for the financial advisers involved. He cites British Aerospace's decision to sell Rover Group earlier this year to BMW of Germany as 'a classic example of restructuring by one group leading to globalisation by another'. Faced with strong competition in its main aerospace and defence businesses, BAe opted to dispose of its automotive subsidiary - realising Pounds 800m in cash. The deal - although opposed by Honda, Rover's long-term partners - promised fresh capital for BAe's core businesses, while giving BMW access to a wider product range and cheaper labour. Corporate financiers stand to gain not only from fees on the main transaction, but also from subsequent deals. KPMG, for example, says it has been consulted by BAe on a large number of joint aerospace ventures, which it now regards as a safer route to expansion. 'Restructured companies see joint ventures as a low-risk way into particular markets, and more clients are now coming to us for advice on such projects,' says Mr Griffiths Jones. He is one of a growing number of financiers detecting a shift from outright acquisitions to long-term strategic partnerships. Although there will always be large one-off purchases, such as BMW's Rover acquisition, these have been overtaken by mergers and joint ventures. Mr Piers von Simson, head of corporate finance at S G Warburg, says these deals are being driven by restructuring. 'Many companies have realised they need to be more focused and can only progress as global players in partnership with other groups.' That realisation has been hastened, he adds, by a recession in Europe which has forced companies to sell any non-core businesses trading at a discount. In turn, that has created acquisition opportunities for groups which have emerged from the downturn with strong balance sheets and healthy profits. Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, says: 'There are a lot of UK companies on a high earnings multiple and we can see them making clever justifications for buying new subsidiaries.' Under this heading, disposals and acquisitions now come under the restructuring umbrella. Companies are using the process to concentrate on core activities, while also expanding the business through international joint ventures or by selecting potential subsidiaries with an obvious industrial fit. Guinness, for example, recently restructured its seven-year alliance with LVMH in a move enabling the UK drinks group to concentrate on the French company's cognac and champagne activities rather than its luxury goods and fashion business. Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, says the restructuring will strengthen the companies' joint trading ventures and prevent an outside takeover of the Moet Hennessy cognac and champagne brands. Such moves show how companies are using restructuring to overcome the effects of recession and protect their core businesses, according to Mr Richard Broadbent, director of investment banking at Schroders. 'Companies are now looking four or five years ahead and are putting the steps in place to get them there,' he says. 'There's much more long-term strategic thinking taking place, and the option most frequently considered is restructuring.'</p>

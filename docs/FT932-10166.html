			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Pound falls on rate cut speculation STERLING slipped sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday as dealers took the view that the UK government might cut base rates again to try to improve its political fortunes. In London the pound closed 3 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4625 and 4 cents lower at Dollars 1.535, and was at roughly the same level by the close of New York trading. Sterling was also a full percentage point below its Friday close when measured against its exchange rate index, which tracks sterling's value against a basket of currencies. It closed last night at 79.9. Speculation that the UK might again ease monetary policy, thus stimulating the economy, helped the FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares to rise 36 points to close at 2,829.7. Economic data on consumer credit and producer prices also raised hopes for inflation-free expansion in the UK economy. On the money markets, there was mild speculation that base rates could be cut by the autumn. Three-month sterling cash closed at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 5 15/16 per cent.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Separate Solution and the  Carrot Policy," TISHRIN says in an editorial: The separate  solution cannot guarantee dignity or rights to those who chose  it as a means to end the conflict with Israel. The Gaza-Jericho  agreement is fresh, living proof of this.    The paper adds: The Oslo agreement maintained the Israeli  economic hegemony and turned the self-rule leaders into tax  collectors begging for help and charity from the Arab and world  financial centers.    The paper stresses that the separate solution means  abandoning the international legitimacy and UN resolutions, as  well as the principles on which the peace process was based. It  also means that Israel is appointed the only point of reference  for all agreements and steps that may be accomplished.    The paper adds: Israel is not only eating the carrot, but  also the hand that extends it.    The paper reviews the ceaseless aggressive Israeli conduct  toward the Arabs, the oppressive and repressive acts in the  occupied Arab territories, the acts of piracy against Lebanon,  and its continued attempts to implement plans for hegemony and  tutelage over the region.    TISHRIN concludes: Separate solutions will not bring  security, peace, or dignity to the Arabs; nor will they return  to them their usurped rights. That is why Israel adopted such  solutions. That is also why Syria opposed them and adhered to  the comprehensive solution that will allow the Arab parties to  negotiate from a position of strength and force Israel to make a  full withdrawal and recognize the Arab rights in full.    Under the headline "Christopher's Tour And What Is Required  From The United States," AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher will be returning to the region and we do not  know if he will be carrying anything new to deal with the  conditions for a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace.  However, Secretary Christopher knows that the obstruction comes  from Israel, and not the Arabs. It is Israel which is occupying  the Arabs' territory, staging aggression against them every day,  and defying the international will.    The paper notes that the new endeavor must have new  determination, not less than that displayed by Foster Dulles and  the late U.S. President Eisenhower during the tripartite  aggression against Egypt.    The paper adds: We do not want the United States to be in  conflict with its ally, Israel, but we do not want it to be  against the Arabs, especially since it has seen the Arabs'  concern for what is right.    The paper stresses that the Syria of Hafiz al-Asad does not  bargain, nor does it gamble with its national and pan-Arab  principles as some people have done and are doing.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Before Christopher's departure  for the region, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said that he sticks  to occupation and refuses to withdraw from the Golan Heights.  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres also played down the  significance of the U.S. secretary's visit. We therefore feel  that Israel is seeking to foil or call off the event. This  shows the extent of Israel's obstruction of peace and the peace  efforts.    Under the headline "The Israeli Obstruction," AL-THAWRAH  says: If it was not for Israel's intransigent conduct, the peace  process would have made great strides toward achieving its  objective. Israel's insistence on depriving the peace process of  its substance and diverting it from its correct course prevented  any progress.    The paper feels that effective pressure must be applied  against Israel to force it to change its policy into a serious  policy that agrees with the international will and responds,  without any hesitation, to the requirements of peace,  particularly complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab  territories.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The United States is the  only party that can apply such pressure on Israel since it is  one of the peace process sponsors and the source of the  unjustified support for Israel. Will the United States start  exercising its responsibility in showing concern for continuing  the peace process until it achieves its goal of a just and  comprehensive peace?    In another commentary entitled "Who Rejects Peace,"  AL-THAWRAH says: Israel's attempts to cast doubts on Syria's  intentions toward peace constitute an aggression against the  international legitimacy, which acknowledged that there can be  no peace in the Middle East without Syria.    The paper stresses that Syria will not allow Israel to  deprive peace of its just substance.</p>

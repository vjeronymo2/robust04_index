			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Ukraine turns its back on racial origins: Ethnic Germans are being urged to settle THE dusty village of Chervona Volodymyrka, 100km north-east of Odessa, has become a test of Ukraine's efforts to create a multi-cultural nation. In contrast to the 'ethnic cleansing' being conducted in the former Yugoslavia, the Ukrainian government is encouraging ethnic Germans expelled by Stalin to return to Chervona Volodymyrka and other villages in southern Ukraine. In the two-and-a-half months since 34 ethnic German men arrived from northern Kazakhstan, a new neighbourhood of blue, red and white caravans, provided by the German government, has sprung up on a hilltop overlooking Chervona Volodymyrka. Sitting at a kitchen table in one of these spartan but immaculately clean caravans, Mr Alexander Grep, leader of the community, said that as soon as the water and electricity were connected 250 German families now in Kazakhstan would move in. The resettlement is a vindication for President Leonid Kravchuk. When he enlivened a state visit to Germany last February with the announcement that Ukraine was willing to absorb up to 400,000 of the estimated 1.1m ethnic Germans in central Asia, the proposal seemed to be little more than a way to upstage the offer by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to create an autonomous republic for ethnic Germans on the Volga river. But Ukraine has granted citizenship to all residents, regardless of ancestry. He recently said 'history has shown that ethnically-based nations are unstable. . . . whereas a state in which all citizens are equal is a guarantee that we will avoid the sort of ethnic wars being fought in Yugoslavia. Thousands of ethnic Germans, worried by mounting antagonism toward Russian-speakers in central Asia, have taken Mr Kravchuk at his word. They are making plans to trek across the former USSR to the fertile steppes of southern Ukraine, where Germans have lived since the 18th century when Catherine the Great recruited them as colonists. A few thousand descendants of the original colonists remain in the area, having survived Stalin's purges. The Germans in Chervona Volodymyrka said they left Kazakhstan because of discrimination. Bonn confirmed this when it said this week that religious fanatics and nationalists were causing difficulties for ethnic Germans in former Soviet Central Asia. But ethnic tension there is clearly a two-way street. 'We want to live with whites,' explained Mr Edward Ginsfator, a 25-year-old strapping long-haired, blue-eyed settler in Chervona Volodymyrka from Kazakhstan. His leader, Mr Grep, visited the Volga region of Russia before choosing Ukraine. 'The Volga republic is no homeland for me,' he said. 'It is a place where a man tells you to leave if he discovers you are German. I don't want to fight them.' By contrast, Ukrainian regions are competing for the privilege of providing a new home for ethnic Germans. Initially aimed at the three southern administrative regions where Germans have the deepest historical roots, Mr Kravchuk was forced to expand the programme to include three other regions after local government officials protested that they, too, had the right to play host to the Germans. Villagers in impoverished Chervona Volodymyrka, where horses are more common than cars, seemed remarkably willing to accommodate the Germans. Mr Grep described the local collective farm chairman as 'a golden man' who has provided the settlers with everything from sheep and blankets to three hot meals a day. Conflicts could develop when the time comes to allot the Germans the lands they have been promised, but for now the local farmers do not seem to resent the work they are doing to help the Germans move in. One man, seconded by the collective farm to help connect the water lines to the German caravans, says that his sympathy had a personal thought; he is a refugee himself, forced to flee the war-torn Trans Dnestr region and return to his native village. Mr Volodymyr Becker, deputy head of the collective farm and coincidentally an ethnic German, is frank about another motivation of this hospitality. 'We are planning to move into food processing,' said Mr Becker. 'We hope that now the German government will come and invest in our village.' That could be the rub. Mr Ivan Hoffman, head of the German-Ukrainian Foundation, which is co-ordinating the resettlement from cramped quarters in a Kiev hotel, would like Germany to lend the foundation DM2bn-DM3bn to supplement the Rbs500m already contributed by the Ukrainian government. Although Mr Hoffman's price is a bargain compared with the cost of absorbing new immigrants in Germany, Bonn has set aside only DM20m for the project in 1993.</p>

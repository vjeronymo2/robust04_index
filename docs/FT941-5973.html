			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Interest rate worries leave Nikkei 2.3 per cent down Investors were discouraged by Tuesday's fall on Wall Street and the rise in long-term interest rates following a plunge on the government bond market, and the Nikkei 225 average lost 2.3 per cent on arbitrage selling, declining for the first time in five days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average dropped 471.85 to 19,744.77 on index-linked selling and profit-taking by securities dealers. It opened at the day's high of 20,159.02 and hit its low of 19,724.27 just before the close. Expectations of a bottoming out of the economy prompted a sell-off in the bond market. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark gained 19 basis points at 3.94 per cent, after briefly moving above the 4 per cent level in the morning session for the first time since August 30 last year. Some Japanese traders said that after their recent rise, share prices 'needed a breather'. Meanwhile, foreign investor buying orders failed to counter arbitrage selling and profit-taking by institutional and corporate investors. Volume totalled 400m shares, down from Tuesday's 518m. Declines led rises by 823 to 234, with 131 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 29.54, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,615.94, while the Nikkei 300 receded 6.18 to 298.07. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 15.82 to 1,318.73. Retailers lost ground on profit-taking by dealers, who had been actively buying the sector recently on hopes of a recovery in consumption. Mitsukoshi, the department store, shed Y30 to Y930 and Daiei, the country's largest supermarket chain, slipped Y50 to Y1,850. Arbitrage selling depressed bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y40 to Y3,290 and Bank of Tokyo Y50 to Y1,580. High-technology issues, which have climbed recently on the multimedia theme, declined. Hitachi dipped Y13 to Y944 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone plunged Y32,000 to Y947,000. Alps Electric rose Y50 to Y1,490 on reports of a smaller than expected loss. Hopes of an economic recovery supported machine tool shares, usually beneficiaries of an increase in capital spending by corporations. Tsugami gained Y20 at Y495 and Ikegai Y23 at Y415. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 279.47 at 22,044.49 in volume of 108.4m shares. The index declined for the first time in nine trading days, but profit-taking ahead of the year-end book closing boosted trading volume. Roundup Interest rate worries preoccupied many of the Pacific Rim's markets. HONG KONG made little immediate response to what was widely seen as a favourable budget: instead it fell 2.7 per cent amid fears that local interest rates will rise soon. The Hang Seng index was down 270.93 at 9,877.43, after a day's low of 9,819.76. Bank and property counters were big losers, extending their slide to a second day. Sino Land tumbled 50 cents to HKDollars 8.90 after it paid record prices at Tuesday's government land auction. Cheung Kong receded 75 cents to HKDollars 43 and Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 46.25. SINGAPORE was unnerved by the outlook for US long-term interest rates and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 29.19 to 2,284.49. Weakness in Sembawang Shipyard, 60 cents lower at SDollars 12.10 ahead of its corporate results released after the market had closed, also dragged the index down. AUSTRALIA took its lead from the bond market and the All Ordinaries index finished 27.7 lower at 2,154.0. NEW ZEALAND closed sharply weaker, the NZSE-40 index falling 42.5, or 1.9 per cent, to 2,227.66 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 41.0m. TAIWAN gave up early gains to end moderately lower after dull, gloomy trade. The weighted index lost 23.07 at 5,429.37, after an initial rise to 5,497. Turnover was modest at TDollars 48.21bn, after TDollars 52.96bn. China Development, the most active stock, finished TDollars 3.50 stronger at TDollars 120 after proposing a big TDollars 3.15 stock dividend for 1993. This sparked an early surge in the overall financial sector but it soon ran out of steam. MANILA eased but finished off the day's lows, amid a return of selective bargain hunting. The composite index slipped 55.90 to 2,699.75. SEOUL ended lower in weak trading as investors, including institutions, stayed on the sidelines. The composite index shed 12.22 to 906.66. BOMBAY declined in dull trade as most buyers preferred to await for clearer trends to emerge from the national budget presented earlier in the week. The BSE 30-share index closed 81.50 off at 4,066.20. KARACHI finished at a record high, continuing Tuesday's rally which was led by institutions and funds encouraged by cuts in key interest rates. The KSE 100-share index rose 29.43 to 2,534.67. Gains led falls by 167 to 130.</p>

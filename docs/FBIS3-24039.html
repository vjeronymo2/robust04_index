			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Constantin Antoci, Lt Gen of Police and </F> Minister of internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova,  conducted by Boris Marian and Igor Kondrashkin, time and place  not specified]    [Text]    [Interviewer] A traditional question, mister minister, or  rather a suggestion. Let us summarize the results of the last  year in your department. First the pleasing ones, and leave the  unhappy ones for later.    [Antoci] Permit me to give a somewhat untraditional answer  to  your tradition question about "pleasing results." Needless to  say, there is nothing simpler that to select the very figures  that would satisfy you out of the enormous mass of statistical  data and offer them to the public. But I would like to draw  attention to those details which define the essence of the  criminogenic situation and are fundamental.    The reader should not be intimidated by the significant  number of statistical layouts that we resort to; you can judge  the results of our work by them, and so we cannot get along  without them.    In 1991 the level of crime per 10,000 population was 102.1.  In 1992 it was 90.1. Last year it was 85.1. So we can say with  full certainty that the trend is positive, there is some decline  in the crime rate. All this contradicts the common opinion that  crime is constantly growing in the republic.    One more important aspect is the situation and trend in the  crimes that are classified as serious. In comparison the 1992  this indicator dropped by 1.4 percent. This might appear to be a  very insignificant reduction, but if you consider that serious  crimes in the republic as a whole have shown a consistent  tendency to grow in recent years, the positive changes and the  effectiveness of the measures we are taking in this area must be  recognized.    The activism and labor productivity of our employees has  risen in an absolute majority of the city and rayon police  divisions.    The percentage of crimes solved is properly considered the  main criterion for evaluating the activity of internal affairs  organs. Last year this indicator (I will add, a very important  one) rose from 35.3 to 46.6 percent. But it still does not  satisfy us.    [Interviewer] And us, the inhabitants of Moldova, even less.  Numbers are well and good, but the social terror is more real  than statistics. It results above all from the sharp growth in  crime, especially among young people. Drug addiction,  prostitution. How are police organs fighting this social evil?    [Antoci] In 1993 our police recorded 1,972 crimes committed  by adolescents. Unfortunately, growth of crimes among young  people in recent years is raising its own "goals." It is  especially bad in this sense in Belts, Bender, and Ryshkan. And  in Ungen the increase was some 350 percent!?    Unfortunately, the number of serious crimes committed by  adolescents has also increased. There were 125 percent more  homicides, 40 percent more cases of serious bodily injury, and  19 percent more rapes.    The figures are very alarming. The socioeconomic condition  of  the republic, the sharp reduction in jobs, and the closing of  numerous educational institutions are significant factors in all  this.    As for drug addiction, the main efforts of the republic's  internal affairs organs have been directed to prevention and  quickly solving crimes committed by addicts. But meanwhile drug  addiction and illegal trade in psychotropic substances in the  republic are growing in scale. It is becoming a serious social  evil. In 1993 police organs recorded 265 crimes related to  illegal trade in narcotics (248 of them or 93.6 percent were  solved). But in 1992 there were just 120 such crimes. Such a  rate of growth puts you very much on guard. Ten of "our"  Moldovan citizens were arrested for trade in narcotics in  Romania, and two in Ukraine. On the other hand, we have plenty  of "visitors" from other regions. For example, in September of  last year our people arrested a certain P. Portnov from Samara,  a shipping agent of the Samaramebel Joint-Stock Society, in the  Oknitsa hotel, and found that he had 8 kilograms of poppy heads.  A more recent example occurred on 12 January when S. Grishin, a  Russian citizen, was arrested in Oknitsa in possession of 8.7  kilograms of this toxic substance.    Another problem is also alarming--the decline in morals,  especially among young people. This has led to the formation of  a specialized division, the morals police within the Ministry of  Internal Affairs system, by Decision of the Presidium of the  Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. The division engages in  preventing and stopping propaganda for pornography, sadism, and  the cult of violence and fights the spread of AIDS and venereal  diseases, prostitution, and other offenses against public  morality.    [Interviewer] A new generation has joined police organs  recently. Police work is complex. They deal with people.  Crudeness, lack of tact, and insensitivity are intolerable here.  Probably many moral qualities of the future guardians of order  and legality must be taken into account in recruiting them. In  general, how is personnel selection organized in your  organization, and how do you fight for the honor of the uniform?  This question also ties in with the fact that, alas, among the  police there have been extortionists, thieves, and many other  violators of the law. Our journalists sometimes write about them.    [Antoci] It should be clear to everyone that with the  transition to market relations, unrestrained inflation, and  unemployment, which have separated people into prosperous and  needy, police work has become much more complicated.    Based on this the 1 December 1992 Decree of the Government  of  the Republic of Moldova reorganized the structure of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and police subdivisions  fundamentally. The number of municipal, criminal, economic, and  highway police and investigators was brought into line with  present-day requirements.    The Ministry of Internal Affairs is working seriously on  selection of new, qualified employees to fill vacant positions.  The moral and work characteristics of the candidates are  necessarily considered in selection. They undergo  psycho-physiological testing at the military medical commission.    In 1993 more than 2,500 people were admitted to the service.  Among them were 756 in leadership positions. Unfortunately, only  191 of the persons admitted into the service had specialized  legal education (at present the capacities of the specialized  educational institutions are very limited).    It should also be acknowledged here, unfortunately, that  accidental people, violators of discipline, and even people who  have taken up the path of crime do get into our ranks. In 1993  668 persons were discharged from internal affairs organs for  committing actions that discredited the title of police officer  and 95 were discharged for service unsuitability.    People also leave our ranks for other reasons. The level of  pay is inadequate, and domestic conditions are hard. It is a big  mistake to think that police have an easy life. We have many  purely domestic concerns.    [Interviewer] If it is not a secret, how many members are  there in the Moldovan police and what does the rank-and-rile  police employee earn? Ordinary people are jealous of them and  believe they get fantastic amounts. But in talking with police  employees you also hear complaints. Arbitrary leveling occurs,  they say. Detectives receive about the same as police employees  sitting in warm, comfortable offices. The one is constantly on  the brink of danger and may get a bullet or a--excuse the  term--"pen" [criminal slang for "knife"] in the stomach, while  the other takes no risks.    [Antoci] Overall the number of police employees relative to  the population of Moldova is no higher than in the republics of  the CIS or other countries and it has not changed in the last 3  years. Military servicemen of the carbine troops are also used  to patrol and guard certain sites to fight crime in many cities  and populated points.    As for pay, it depends of the employee's years of service in  the police and ranges from 40 to 150 lei. You must agree that  that is not so much. At some enterprises and companies, for  example, people receive much more just for services in guarding  a site. You should not forget about the extreme conditions in  which most of our police personnel work.    About "leveling." Indeed, the pay system that exists today  does not, unfortunately, permit a differentiated approach to  defining the labor of each individual employee. But the Ministry  of Internal Affairs is preparing appropriate proposals on this.  It is true that at present employees of the operational  services, investigation, and other subdivisions with especially  difficult working conditions receive pay supplements (from 15 to  50 percent of their salaries) depending on results achieved, and  preferences in acquiring the next rank have been established in  the operational services to retain our primary core group of  professionals.    [Interviewer] Is your system experiencing what is called the  "brain drain"? There was a time when outstanding specialists  were forced to look for work outside the republic or in  profit-making structures here.    [Antoci] I have already answered that question in part when  I  spoke of the very difficult period in which we are all living.  The sharp decline in the economy could not help but be reflected  in what you call the "brain drain." Unfortunately, outstanding  specialists, top-quality professionals, are abandoning our ranks  today too, even before reaching the desired pension age. But  only a few find work outside the republic. Most of them,  dissatisfied with the pay and working conditions, leave and find  work in profit-making structures within the republic. This  continues to be a sore spot for us.    [Interviewer] There is an economic police force. In addition  the Moldovan Ministry of Finance formed a financial guard. Isn't  there duplication of work here, unnecessary activity and waste  of money?    [Antoci] That is a timely question. In fact, in the initial  stage of transition of the economy to the free market with its  companies, concerns, commercial banks and so on, other control  organs were formed in the republic in addition to the economic  police, among them the financial guard. But experience confirmed  your fears and ours: duplication started and dispersion of  funds, and it became necessary to review the staff of the  control organs. Substantiated proposals on this matter have  already been submitted to the Government of the Republic of  Moldova. The essential point of them is that for purposes of  more effective crime fighting it would be advisable in this  sphere to form a single professional control organ on the basis  of the economic police and the financial guard.    [Interviewer] Our last question, with hopes for an  optimistic  answer. Will the mighty detachment of Moldovan police be able to  significantly reduce the level of crime in the coming year? Will  we be able, suppose, to go for peaceful family walks in the  evening in any remote part of the city, places where today--why  hide it--you will not find any police patrols?    [Antoci] I think that we have grounds for cautious optimism.  Let me repeat, cautious. The time of mindless "deadlines" for  eliminating crime and posing the challenge of "sharply reducing  it" has passed. Everything is much more complex than that.    The criminal world reacts quickly to the various changes in  society. It is extremely dangerous today. It is well organized,  corrupt, very well armed, and unrestrained in its choice of  means.    General success in the struggle to root out the criminal  world will come only with a general normalization of the moral  climate of society. But the police must oppose the criminal  world and they can do it.    Yes, it is the duty of the policy to guard order and the  lawful interests of our people, but the people themselves can  actively help the police.    [Interviewer] Thank you, mister minister, for your answers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two servicemen who stood guard on the weapon depot  of the Russian Pacific Fleet air force have been arrested on  suspicion of causing a fire there on May 14.    A spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor General's Office told  Interfax that the men had been found to enter the store and try  to extract certain parts from a missile. As they were doing  this, there was a short circuit and the missile caught fire.  They could not extinguish the fire which spread over the depot.    The military prosecutor's office is investigating the case  under the Prosecutor General's Office supervision.</p>

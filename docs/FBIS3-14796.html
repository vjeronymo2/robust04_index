The initiators of "political amnesty made a fool" not only  of  themselves but also of those they supported; "Both the August  1991 putsch plotters and participants in the bloody October  developments should plead guilty in order to become free," said  Poltoranin.    In the opinion of Poltoranin, the opposition worked most for  the liberation of Aleksandr Rutskoy as a "national leader". But  the situation will also be used by people who fired at unarmed  people.    The amnesty resolution is an act of humiliation and  discrediting of the authorities, not only those executive, said  Poltoranin. "It is a blow on the law-enforcement bodies and the  legal system of the state," he noted.    Intruding into competence of the court bodies, the State  Duma  did not think about consequences. The latter may not only occur  in political life but also affect the interior bodies, which  fight against crime risking the lives of their staffers.    Poltoranin said he is against "global amnesties". In his  opinion, some 20,000 people will be freed from prisons and  penitentiaries to make the life of law-abiding citizens even  more dangerous.</p>

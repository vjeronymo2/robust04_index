			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Mind the quality: UK consumers may be willing to pay more, but they are also more cynical Land Rover unveils its new-generation luxury Range Rover, while Jaguar invests heavily in a new range of luxury saloons. At the same time, Louis Vuitton rations its customers to one of its prestige handbags each, and supermarkets fill their freezer cabinets with Haagen-Dazs and other expensive 'adult' ice creams. These are all signs that manufacturers believe that, now the recession is over, demand for premium-priced products will mount. Their confidence, according to the Henley Centre, the forecasting specialist, is not misplaced. However, they cannot relax completely: Henley also reveals the emergence of the 'cynical consumer', who is wise to marketing ploys and in relentless pursuit of value for money. For the time being, consumers in the UK seem willing, once again, to seek out and pay for quality, according to Henley's annual consumer attitudes survey* of 2,000 adults in Britain, published this week. This should cheer up the owners of big-name consumer brands, which have seen their margins eroded by cut-price and own-label rivals. The responses to one question - 'Do you agree that highest price usually means you get the highest quality?' - show how attitudes have changed. 'In the boom years between 1985 and 1989, there was a strengthening association between high price and high quality,' says Henley. 'Then, as the recession bit, this association weakened. 'A low point was reached in either 1991 or 1993, depending on the market, but since then a recovery has taken place such that in most . . . markets, the strength of the association has reached, or surpassed, the levels of 1989.' This sounds like good news for manufacturers. Less encouraging, however, is what appears to be a contradictory finding in the report. When asked whether they agreed with the statement 'When shopping always look for the cheapest items', 35 per cent of Henley's sample said yes this year - up from 32 per cent in 1993 and 29 per cent in 1989 - and Henley forecasts this price pressure will continue. Henley says the two findings are not inconsistent. Consumers are prepared to pay a premium for quality - what is at issue is the size of that premium. In the past, some brand owners 'allowed unsustainable price differentials to develop to the point at which the consumer (prompted by recession) revolted', it says. The lesson is that price premiums can be charged, but their size needs to be monitored by manufacturers alongside quality. Not everyone agrees with Henley that consumers' increased awareness and insistence on value for money are here to stay. Winston Fletcher, chairman of the Advertising Association, which represents both brand owners and advertising agencies, is sceptical. 'The changes may be more temporary than many now think. There is always a tendency to overestimate the significance of contemporary moods. It will all depend on whether the economy continues to be buoyant for any length of time.' Three to five years of growth would see consumers giving a lower priority to price, in his view. For the present, however, consumers are demanding quality and value - as well as higher standards of service and wider choice. Henley's data suggest that, even in the depths of the recession, pressures on manufacturers and retailers to provide better service and choice continued to grow. Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the retail group, agrees: 'We've had an explosion in consumer choice. Customers have been shopping around and they're aware of the differences. 'That doesn't just mean they're more price conscious - they're more value conscious. I think that is a permanent change. They'll pay a premium for better value, but they won't pay a premium for nothing extra.' In the past, brand owners' strategy for attracting consumers to expensive goods was to throw money at an advertising agency. Henley suggests this may no longer be so successful, owing to the emergence of what it terms the 'cynical consumer', who is sceptical about advertising claims and 'unwilling to accept the messages of the marketing community at face value'. Those born since the war have grown up surrounded by mass-media advertising and can spot overblown claims and the hard sell. Experience means they know, says Henley, that 'the real message of all advertisers is, crudely put, 'we want your money' '. Fletcher, of the Advertising Association, says: 'People understand the wiles of the advertiser very well. The average 35-year-old has seen 150,000 different commercials and seen most of them more than six times. It has been shown that infants can differentiate between commercials and programmes from the age of about three onwards.' Overall, the message to brand owners is that, as Henley says, consumers will retain 'a willingness constantly to reappraise the price-quality equation'. In spite of economic recovery and a reviving interest in high quality, the 'cynical consumer' is likely be a fixture for some years to come. *Planning for Social Change, Henley Centre, 1994/95, part of a syndicated programme for Pounds 9,000 a year. 071-353 9961</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Register aimed at foreign ships Plans for an open register of British shipping to tempt international shipowners to base their operations in London have been put to the government this week by the Baltic Exchange. A key attraction of the register would be less stringent rules on the use of UK officers. It is designed to attract foreign shipowners to the UK and to persuade UK shipowners using offshore shipping registers to resume flying the UK flag. Many shipowners have switched to flags of convenience in recent years because of the costs of maintaining UK crews and meeting the conditions of the existing UK mainland register.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN ALLEGEDLY SHOOTS DAUGHTER  </P> <P> A Gardena woman will be arraigned today in South Bay Municipal Court for  allegedly shooting her teen-age daughter in the chest with a shotgun Monday  during an argument, authorities said.  </P> <P> Valerie Mitchell, 36, allegedly called to her 17-year-old daughter, Tanya  Copes, from outside the girl's bedroom window at 10:17 p.m. When Copes  appeared, her mother fired at her with a 20-gauge shotgun, according to Gardena  police.  </P> <P> "We're at a loss of words as to why this occurred," Sgt. Garry Garrett said.  </P> <P> Copes, a student at Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles, was in  critical condition Wednesday after undergoing surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical  Center.  </P> <P> After the shooting, Copes called 911 and said she was having trouble breathing.  She then ran to a girlfriend's house a block away, where she collapsed, police  said.  </P> <P> The mother, who police said did not have an arrest record, is being held in  Sybil Brand Institute for Women on suspicion of attempted murder.  </P> <P> Neighbors described Copes as "sweet" and "friendly" and said they had no  indication that there were tensions between the mother and daughter. They said  the mother had been depressed since her husband died late last year.  </P> <P> "Tanya was a good kid," said one neighbor who asked not to be identified. "She  was one of the most well-behaved kids on the block."  </P> <P> Police said they are investigating whether the mother had been despondent since  her husband's death but said they do not know what led to Monday's shooting.  Details of the incident are sketchy because Copes is unable to communicate and  Mitchell has not cooperated with authorities, police said.  </P></p>

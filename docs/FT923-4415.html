			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / TUC may face hitch with plan to readmit electricians PLANS BY the Trades Union Congress to readmit the maverick EETPU electricians' union appeared to be running into difficulties last night as delegates gathered for the start today of the 124th annual TUC congress in Blackpool. Several large unions decided they were willing to back a resolution imposing tough conditions on the readmission of the electricians. Both the EETPU and the Amalgamated Engineering union, with which it merged earlier this year, have said the conditions are unacceptable. Failure to agree terms for the EETPU's readmission would lead to a damaging split among trade unions, with the possibility that the AEU could join its partner outside the TUC. Although Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was last night trying to persuade the National Union of Journalists to withdraw the motion, the likelihood was that he would fail. Unions deciding to support the resolution, if tabled, include the MSF general technical union and the Nalgo public services union. The resolution, due for discussion on Thursday, seeks to exclude from membership anyone or any organisation recruited from other unions since 1988. Approval of the NUJ resolution by congress would not necessarily lead to the end of TUC talks with the EETPU. Last week the TUC general council approved a resolution which would restrict negotiators far less than the NUJ resolution seeks. Even if the NUJ motion were carried, congress would be likely to adopt the general council's policy. Nonetheless, the NUJ resolution would considerably sour the talks. Leaders of the EETPU have indicated that they are unsure about whether they want to reaffiliate. In a pre-congress press conference, Mr Willis failed to damp speculation that he was preparing to step down, either on his 60th birthday in January or when, and if, the electricians are readmitted. He said he was extremely engaged in his job. He repeated that he had made no decision when to leave, although he would be stepping down before his 65th birthday. Mr Willis said he was confident that outstanding issues with the EETPU could be dealt with. The union's reaffiliation would be the 'best thing that has happened in my eight years as TUC general secretary'. Divisions between unions in the future almost certainly guaranteed failure, he said.

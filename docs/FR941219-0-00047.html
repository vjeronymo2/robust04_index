			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural and Legal Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 27:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned that efforts by the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to manage the Bay/Delta were uncoordinated. On the other hand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one commenter presumed that the Service adopted EPA's water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards wholesale, and thought the Service had no authority to do so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the Service designates critical habitat under the narrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the Act, while the EPA promulgates water quality standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the framework of the Clean Water Act. Similarly, another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter thought the Service would, in effect, be interposing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituting EPA's regulatory judgment for its own if the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated EPA's water quality standards in its designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not incorporate EPA's water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , although implementation of these standards may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a means to promote recovery of the delta smelt. The January 6, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised critical habitat proposal for the delta smelt included a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat conditions and a description of water quality primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent elements. These elements were developed in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of the Act and its regulations. The Service's proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also reflects the coordinated approach provided by the Club Fed process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service participated with the Bureau, NMFS, and EPA in guaranteeing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the January 6, 1994, critical habitat and water quality proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were based on the best available scientific and technical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another priority was for the proposals to take into account the goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and concerns of the agencies and public and private interests affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the agencies' programs and activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preservation of rare and endangered species is a substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> link between the proposals of the Service and the EPA. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated the Bay/Delta standards because they disapproved provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the 1991 Bay/Delta plan developed by the State Board. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the State had not adopted criteria sufficient to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated uses of the Estuary, including the ``Preserv[ing] Rare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Endangered Species'' designated use. Similarly, in discussing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions,'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service wrote_``*&blank;*&blank;* [T]he Clean Water Act requires protection of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most sensitive use within each category of designated uses. `Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Endangered and Threatened Species' is considered a designated use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Endangered Species Act provides one method to identify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body.'' (59 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 854).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the salinity criteria that constituted EPA's proposed water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are directly related. ``*&blank;*&blank;* EPA's proposed water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, therefore, address both critical habitat requirements for delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that rely on estuarine habitat.'' (59 FR 854) Based on the common legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and biological underpinnings of the critical habitat designation and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed water quality standards, the Service's treatment of salinity as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a primary constituent element and the textual references to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinity standards were appropriate and fully consistent with the goal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of assuring substantive consistency between the two proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the designation of critical habitat and EPA's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bay/Delta standards have common elements, the critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation must address the standards, and, at a minimum, must not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with them, and vice versa. The January 6, 1994, critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat proposal did not incorporate specific salinity standards into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulatory designation of habitat, as was the case with the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat proposal published in 1991. Rather, the 1994 proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated water quality as a primary constituent element, stating_``salinity concentrations [as] required to maintain delta smelt habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migration.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinated Federal effort and the substantive consistency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA and Service proposals are a direct reflection of the agencies'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent to address Bay/Delta issues in an effective and responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner. The coordinated Club Fed process is intended to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns expressed by the State of California of a perceived lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination among the Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

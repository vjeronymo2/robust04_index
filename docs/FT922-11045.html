			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (20): A race against time - A privatised brewery 'IT'S GOOD to see people drinking Zywiec,' Mr Adam Loewe says sitting in the bar in Warsaw's Holiday Inn hotel and watching guests ordering his brewery's beer. A quiet satisfaction beams from the 33-year-old managing director as he says it but the feeling is matched by the evident responsibility he feels for the brewery privatised through a public share offer last summer. The sale was a success with the 1.5m shares offered to the general public as well as to larger investors snapped up within days. The offer price of 100,000 zlotys soon rose once the brewery came on to Warsaw's fledgling stock exchange to its present 178,000 zlotys or so level. Down at Zywiec in southern Poland where the brewery was founded 136 years ago by one of the Habsburgs the benefits of privatisation soon came to be felt. Wages rose freed of the controls in force throughout the state sector, management was streamlined and, as Mr Loewe says, people began to see money in quite a different light. 'Now every zloty invested has to generate profits,' he says comparing the present favourably with an accountant-free past. Privatisation saw the plant freed of several taxes still in force in the state sector and net profits last year soared to 133bn zlotys from 1990's 51.8bn zlotys. This year the first two months' results suggest that net profits could hit the 180bn zlotys mark. But the benefits of privatisation have already been discounted and in a sense Mr Leowe's problems are now beginning. He has inherited outdated equipment that is more labour, energy and raw materials intensive than in breweries in Germany or Denmark. His costs are higher than theirs making him vulnerable to competition from imports. The threat will be greater if it were not for a 30 per cent customs tariff which Mr Leowe is hoping that the government will keep in place. His longer-term response is to invest in modern equipment enabling him to cut labour and other costs. This year his investment budget is set at 120bn zlotys eating up much of last year's profit. Some of the capital investment will be financed by loans from abroad but in any event shareholders' dividends this year will be squeezed, threatening a drop in the share price on the stock exchange. That, in turn, makes Zywiec vulnerable to a take-over from foreign competition. At one point in 1990 Heineken expressed an interest in buying 51 per cent of the company. Then the government decided to float it on the domestic market. Mr Leowe agrees this was the right thing to do. Even though he comes from the industrial district of Silesia where he originally worked for Weglokoks, the state coal trader, he fully identifies with the Zywiec century-old tradition. 'I wouldn't like to see the name disappear and that could happen if we were bought up now,' he says. At present the Zywiec p/e ratio of 2.7 makes the company easy prey should anyone want to take it over. Mr Leowe, though, is looking to the 20 per cent of the equity held by management and workers as well as another 10 per cent held by Invesco Central Europe, a UK-based investment fund, to guard against such an eventuality. He sees himself as being in a race against time. He wants to bring the plant's annual capacity up from the present to 1.2m hectolitres to 2m hectolitres brewed on modern equipment within the next few years. Then, he says, he will ready to go into a joint venture with a foreign partner on more equal terms and retain the Zywiec identity. 'After all,' he says, 'GM bought Adam Opel before the war but the name remains to this day.'</p>

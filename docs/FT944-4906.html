			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Spain launches DM2.5bn fixed-rate offering The Kingdom of Spain yesterday launched a DM2.5bn offering of five-year eurobonds, the largest fixed-rate D-Mark issue this year. The bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points over German bunds of the same maturity and met demand from central banks and investment funds across Europe and in the Far East, said joint lead manager Commerzbank. Commerzbank said pricing compared favourably with other recent five-year D-Mark issues trading in the market, such as those by the World Bank and Belgium. These are currently trading at around six and five basis points respectively above US Treasuries. Commerzbank reported some switching by investors out of the latter issues into the new Spanish offering. However, dealers said the bonds were expensive compared with domestic German bonds, which are currently trading at around 35 basis points over bunds. 'With that pricing, it is difficult to see a strong (German) bid for the paper,' said one dealer. However, Commerzbank said that it had kept the main part of the offering to place itself and a third of that 'is already in firm hands'. Spain last came to the D-Mark sector in February 1993 with a DM4bn 10-year offering. In the dollar sector, Nordic Investment Bank launched a Dollars 250m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 12 1/2 basis points over US Treasuries. Lead manager Nomura said the bonds met the strongest demand from central banks and institutional investors in Asia and Europe. Market sources said the proceeds were swapped. In the Canadian dollar sector, GECC launched a CDollars 100m offering targeted at retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries. Wood Gundy, the lead manager, said it had seen significant interest in the short-end of the Canadian dollar sector recently and pricing spreads on existing bonds of a similar credit had narrowed sharply. The issue was priced to yield 12 basis points over Canadian government bonds. Wood Gundy said significant demand came from investors switching out of longer-dated bonds. Midland Bank launched a Dollars 400m offering of 10-year yankee bonds, in a deal lead-managed by J. P. Morgan. All eyes in the market today and tomorrow will be on the expected launch by South Africa of its long-awaited Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds, with a December payment date and expected pricing of 170 to 200 basis points over US Treasuries.</p>

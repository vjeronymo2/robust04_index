Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VAN NUYS MAN SERIOUSLY BURNED IN ACID ATTACK, MOTIVE UNKNOWN  </P> <P> A man was seriously burned when an assailant threw acid in his face on a street  in Van Nuys and then stole his car, Los Angeles police said today. No suspect  has been arrested.  </P> <P> Andres Chaidez, 22, of Van Nuys suffered chemical burns over his face and 40%  of his body, police said. He was taken to an undisclosed hospital after being  found at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday lying on a driveway in the 6900 block of Gloria  Avenue.  </P> <P> The nature of the chemical was unknown but, according to police reports,  paramedics who treated the victim said he had suffered severe acid burns.  Police obtained samples for analysis.  </P> <P> Lt. Dennis Dunn said the motive for the attack was unclear. He said a witness  told police that he thought he saw Chaidez and the assailant arguing shortly  before the attack. But Chaidez said he did not know his assailant.  </P> <P> Chaidez told police he was sitting in his parked car on Vanowen Avenue near  Haskell Street when a man carrying a plastic container walked up and asked for  money so he could buy gasoline for his car, Dunn said.  </P> <P> "The victim said, 'I don't have any money,' and this guy threw a white liquid  from the container in his face," Dunn said.  </P></p>

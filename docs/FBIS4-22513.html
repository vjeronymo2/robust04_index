			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Ovcharenko: "`Telepaths' at Ostankino </F> Television and Radio Company Accused Irina Mishina of `Negative  Vibes' and Removed Her From Broadcasts. Jurists See This  Escapade As Arbitrariness and a Violation of Human Rights"]    [Text] Fragile, with huge green eyes--truly a  "creature of air," as newspaper reporters nicknamed her--she  asked for the third time: "If a television anchor disappears, it  means somebody wants it, does it not?"    The history of her excommunication from live  broadcasting is so incomprehensible, paradoxical, simply stupid,  and mean that it all looks like the theater of absurd.    For the uninitiated, I will recount the chronicle of  the scandal.    On 4 October of last year Irina Mishina, an ITA [Independent  Television Agency] commentator and "Novosti" program anchor, was  hit on the head by a truncheon brandished by a man in field  fatigues: Either he did not recognize the "creature of air" or  he was so stoned from the blood spilled the day before that he  was no longer aware who he was hitting. Despite the pain, Irina  covered the cuts with makeup and the next day broadcast live,  anchoring the "Novosti" as precisely and professionally as usual.    The trauma turned out to be more serious than the journalist  had suspected, however. A week later she fainted in the middle  of the street. Only on 8 December did doctors permit her to  resume work. Returning to Ostankino, however, she learned that  during her illness ITA Director Boris Nepomnyashchiy and  Editor-in-Chief Oleg Tochilin had decided to remove her from  direct broadcasting and the anchor job at "Novosti." At first  she did not believe it, especially considering that the decree  (which, by the way, nobody has seen to this day) was not made  available to her. She attempted to explain. Nepomnyashchiy told  Irina in the presence of witnesses that she allegedly exuded a  "bad aura and negative vibes, which negatively affect her work."  The director also blamed Mishina for a large number of newspaper  materials about her: She was making herself a "star," he said.    That the accusations are laughable is obvious. Can someone  please tell me according to what parameters and instruments does  Nepomnyashchiy determine the aura of his subordinates? And what  this has to do with the work of a television commentator  altogether?    Meanwhile, according to Ostankino's sociological services,  Mishina, with her "bad aura" and "negative vibes," even after  not doing live broadcasts for four months, securely maintains  her rating among the best anchors of information and political  programs. I personally saw the results of the poll in which  television viewers rated Irina fourth, placing her ahead of A.  Lyubimov, A. Politkovskiy, S. Medvedev, and other popular names  in television. "When Irina Mishina is on the air, it is like the  sun comes out in the apartment," a cable from one of her viewers  read. Such is the aura of this anchor removed from live  broadcasts.    But perhaps the "creature of air" has indeed been struck by  "star syndrome" and her colleagues refuse to work with her? Why  then are they, of all people, calling the newspaper and asking  that Irina be protected from bureaucratic arbitrariness?    No, no matter how you look at it, there are loose ends in  the  statements of the high-ranking amateur telepaths from ITA. But  there has to be a real reason why Mishina has been  excommunicated, does there not? Together with her, I attempted  to validate several of my own versions.    The first: political motives. As long ago as 23 September,  out of the blue, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS called Mishina an  "anti-Yeltsin commentator" and predicted that she would soon  part with television viewers.    "Nonsense!" Irina rejected this version outright. "I have no  political preferences. A journalist can have only one  conviction: the truth, and only the truth."    This, by the way, was confirmed by the weekly SOBESEDNIK,  which said this about Mishina: "She is not a flaming democrat  but certainly not a conservative. She takes a  middle-of-the-road, calm position that is shared by the majority  of the population." But perhaps this is precisely the position  that is not to the liking of the ITA leadership?    Second version: an unsociable, quarrelsome personality.    "Translated from Greek, Irina means peace. This is the way I  am in real life," says Mishina. Then, after a pause, she  confesses: "When it comes to work, however, I have rather strict  criteria, and when I see unprofessional work I do not keep my  mouth shut."    That, of course, is true. The crisis Ostankino television is  going through is painful for Irina. In her opinion, Ostankino is  currently taking a back seat to NTV [Independent Television] and  the Russian Television Channel; the quality of the "Novosti"  program has also declined. She is not keeping her opinion  secret: In summer last year she published an article on this  topic in SEGODNYA under the eloquent title "News Inside Out."  Her opinion was shared by many television viewers: While in the  fall the "Novosti" rating was 70 percent, by spring it had  plunged to 23 percent. What boss would tolerate a subordinate  whose public criticism may cost him his job?!    In the conversation with Irina, however, another version  came  out, which seems most convincing to me. ITA director Boris  Nepomnyashchiy once suggested three stories for "Novosti" which  were a poor disguise for hidden advertising. In her habitual  manner, Mishina told the director her opinion on the subject  after the broadcast. Moreover, she gave an interview to  MEGAPOLIS-EKSPRESS. This probably was the beginning of her  troubles with the ITA leadership.    [Ovcharenko] Irina, have you tried to see Aleksandr  Nikolayevich Yakovlev, who is acting chairman of the Ostankino  television company?    [Mishina] Of course. I wrote a memorandum to him, but he has  not found the time to see me.    [Ovcharenko] Do you go to work?    [Mishina] I do. I have not been fired--only removed from  live  broadcasts. I do voice-over commentary; a few days ago, for the  first time in the last two months, I was assigned to film a  story for Consumer Rights Protection Day. [end Mishina]    An interesting detail: This story was first assigned to a  20-year-old student-intern who, unlike the commentator Mishina,  has a permanent desk and a telephone. The student's name is  Konstantin Tochilin. As the reader may already have guessed, he  is the son of the editor in chief. Vladimir, B.V.  Nepomnyashchiy's son, has also found a home at ITA.    [Ovcharenko] Were you insulted by this assignment?    [Mishina] What do you think? I miss the work, though, and I  will do the story. Probably no worse than Kostya would have.    [Ovcharenko] You now have a lot of free time. How do you  spend it?    [Mishina] I work. Conceive new programs. One is practically  ready. It could be a program unique for our television. Together  with Andrey Plakhov, the producer of "Before and After  Midnight," we thought it through down to the smallest detail.  There is a team that sees only me as the anchor of this program.  But nobody listens to us; nobody needs my know-how. You see, I  wanted to see Yakovlev not to cry on his shoulder but to offer  him an innovation. After all, he did give Politkovskiy and  Lyubimov a chance, did he not?! Me, however, he did not want to  talk to. A pity!... [end Mishina]    She is indeed a "creature of air." But not because she  weighs  48 kg and resembles the Snow Maiden in appearance. No, it does  not look as if she would "melt" in the hottest situation. Irina  has been an independent being since childhood; she has always  earned her own living, and she is considered a strong  personality. N. Tarayan's material in the weekly TV-REVIEW,  which stated that Mishina had attempted to commit suicide, is  slander, according to Irina. She is a "creature of air" because  live broadcasting is not a narcotic for her--it is the air  without which she cannot live. So she carries in her purse a  sizable notebook which is already bursting with ideas and  proposals nobody wants.    It is an absurd situation. Irina is loved and supported by  television viewers; she wants to, and can, do highly  professional work; but she is not even given a chance to present  her side. After recovering from her illness, she spent three  hours waiting in Oleg Tochilin's reception room for the sake of  a three-minute conversation which resulted in nothing. Perhaps  the court may change the ITA leadership's position?    No, Mishina herself was not appealing for court justice.  Tatyana Kofanova, director of the De-JureK company, found her  after reading the press materials and literally pushed Irina  into signing a contract on protection of her rights and dignity.  This is how the court complaint "in the interests of citizen  Irina Anatolyevna Mishina" on the "unwarranted actions of  officials" came about. In Kofanova's opinion, everything that is  happening to Irina is pure arbitrariness, a violation of labor  laws and human rights. But is it worth elevating the conflict  all the way to the court?    I pose this question to you, Aleksandr Nikolayevich. You are  known as a man of truly democratic convictions. Perhaps it would  make sense to first listen to the person? After all, Irina is  longing to work, not complain...  <H8>  * * * </H8>   P.S. By the way, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, you may also  invite Tatyana Vedeneva to come over at the same time. Yes, she  left Ostankino of her own volition. But only after an action had  been initiated to move her to a position as editor-consultant  without the right to work on live broadcasts. In essence, she  was forced to leave, as was Irina Mishina. Also because of a  "bad aura?"</p>

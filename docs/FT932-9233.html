			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland jumps to IPounds 124m BANK OF Ireland, one of the Republic's two main clearing banks, increased pre-tax profits by 76 per cent from IPounds 70.3m to IPounds 124m (Pounds 122m) in the year to March 31, due primarily to reduced losses in its UK and US divisions. Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said FNH, the New Hampshire subsidiary which has cost the group about Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m) in write-offs and cash injections since 1988 when it ventured into the US market, had now had its balance sheet 'substantially cleaned up' and was producing an operating profit. Loan loss provisions in the US were IPounds 66m in 1992, resulting in a reduced pre-tax loss of IPounds 45.4m (IPounds 76.6m). The Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio slipped from 7 per cent to 6.6 per cent. The group's core business in Ireland has continued to perform well, despite reduced economic growth in 1992 and the currency crisis last autumn. Pre-tax profits in the retail arm rose 2 per cent to IPounds 135m. The corporate finance and treasury division increased profits to IPounds 65.1m (IPounds 58.4m), despite a loan loss provision of IPounds 32m. Mr Molloy said the treasury arm 'benefited from the extraordinary volumes of business during the currency crisis.' The group suffered embarrassment last week, when its Davy Stockbrokers subsidiary - the largest broking firm in Ireland - slipped up on the placement by the government of 30m shares in Greencore. The placement nearly had to be scrapped after Davy revealed that it had sold shares to groups with which it was closely connected. The placement was saved when the Bank of Ireland stepped in to buy 9.6m of the shares at a cost of IPounds 26m. Davy is under investigation by the Irish Stock Exchange for having provided 'misleading information' during the placement. Mr Molloy defended the move yesterday saying: 'It was a correct and appropriate decision to stabilise the situation.' He added, however, that the group was not carrying out its own investigation into Davy's handling of the placement and was not planning any management changes at the subsidiary pending the outcome of the investigation. 'I am not going to prejudge their findings' he said. Earnings per share jumped to 13.7p (4.5p). The final dividend of 6.5p makes an increased total of 9.83p (9.17p). COMMENT The bank's first dividend increase for three years has been good news for shareholders who have suffered patiently as the management wrestled with its calamitous ill-timed decision to follow its arch-rival, Allied Irish Banks, into the US banking market in the late 1980s. The group's US loan book has been largely sorted out, the non-performing property portfolio mostly disposed of, and is now showing the first real prospects of showing some return for the Dollars 700m it has thrown at its US division since 1988. Brokers are now revising upwards their earnings forecasts for the current year to about 23p. Although the corner has been turned, institutions will not be eager for a rights issue this year to shore up the equity base, expecting that to be generated from improved cash-flow. Neither can the group afford further problems such as has been created by the Greencore share placement, and suggests that management reins could be tightened further in some operations.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALCOLM FORBES  </P> <P> For all those critics of the late Malcolm Forbes' birthday bash of last year:  He celebrated his life on his last birthday in the grand fashion that he  wanted.  </P> <P> Who said that he was going to deduct his expenses anyway? He'd only have been  following the legal guidelines set by our Congress.  </P> <P> Forbes at least got twice the monetary value from the publicity throughout the  world for his celebration.  </P> <P> Forbes will be sorely missed by those who realize that he did what everyone  with or without a lot of money wishes he could do. He did what he loved.  </P> <P> Don't let anyone speak against those who know that life is for living and not  just working.  </P> <P> CHRIS CONSIDINE  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

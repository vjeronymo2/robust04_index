			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Less than half MFI's offer shares taken up APPLICATIONS were made for less than half the public offer of shares in MFI Furniture Group, the retailer of kitchen and bedroom furniture. Counting had not been completed yesterday, but bankers involved reckoned the level of applications would not be far below the 50 per cent mark. The company and its advisers had set the offer price at 115p, well below earlier hopes, when it became clear that market conditions were not favourable. The offer, which closed yesterday morning, was of 136.97m shares, a quarter of the total number of shares sold by MFI and its existing investors. The rest were placed with institutional investors or financial intermediaries. Shares not taken up in the public offer will be bought by underwriters. Most of the institutions which took shares in the placing also took underwriting in the same proportions. However, underwriters were able to offset any shares they applied for through the public offer against their underwriting commitments. A number of underwriters did this, making the true level of applications for the public offer lower. Dealings in the shares start next Friday, July 17. Analysts are hoping that the shares will not open at a big discount because the price was set low in the first place.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mara Rivera; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Foreign Ministry is waiting for the U.S. reply  to the protest note it has sent in connection with the charges  money is being laundered in Panama.    Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has said a protest note  was  sent due to the U.S. charges the Panamanian Government has links  with drug traffickers. He has said although the note was sent  last week, there has still been no reply, but he excused the  United States by saying it is possible the letter is being  studied.    [Begin Mulino recording] As I have said many times, I have  not said no crimes are committed. An economy such as ours, due  to the openness with which the service and banking sectors are  handled, could well be used for criminal acts. What I cannot  accept is to say the authorities are behind this.    In the cases where crimes have been detected, we have taken  action according to the law. If there are other cases about  which someone knows or if some government has information a  certain bank might be involved, it is their duty to report this  at the highest level--like, check this out; this is what is  happening; correct it. Briefly, this is what the note I have  sent the United States says. [end recording]    Mulino expressed his desire to hold a meeting in Panama,  which he requested in the note, to speak broadly about the topic  and at the highest level.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Fears of Rosyth closure are renewed Fears that the closure of Rosyth naval base will be announced when the outcome of the latest defence expenditure review is revealed in July were heightened by government ministers yesterday. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told MPs in the Commons that while the Royal Navy now had fewer ships, there had been no corresponding reduction in the support facilities provided by four separate bases. He said: 'We will have to look carefully at the size of the infrastructure as well as at the size of the fleet.' Mr Aitken accused Labour MPs of seeking to exaggerate 'promises which were never made' by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Aitken said assurances given by the prime minister that the employment implications of closing the Rosyth base in Fife would be taken into account fell short of the kind of promise which Labour MPs inferred he had made. Mr John Reid, a Labour defence spokesman, called for an assurance that before any decision was announced all the alternative costs would be made available to MPs. Mr Aitken said Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, would be among ministers consulted before any final decision was taken. After the proposals were announced the government would publish the information on which decisions had been based. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, reaffirmed that the government had no intention of making any further reduction in the 'fighting capability of our forces'.</p>

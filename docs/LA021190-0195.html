			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 INJURED IN CRASH AT LONG BEACH AIRPORT  </P> <P> A twin-engine plane crashed and skidded off the runway while aborting a landing  at Long Beach Airport Saturday, injuring four people and temporarily closing  two of the airport's five runways.  </P> <P> The pilot and three passengers were only slightly injured in the accident,  which happened at 1:06 p.m. when the Piper Apache was coming in for a landing  behind other aircraft.  </P> <P> Art Morriston, a Federal Aviation Administration duty officer in Hawthorne,  said the control tower had ordered the pilot to "go around" because the plane  was following too close behind another aircraft.  </P> <P> "He started to climb and it appears the pilot lost control and he went left  wing down . . . until he hit the ground," Morriston said.  </P> <P> Airport officials said the plane, which was heavily damaged, came to a stop in  a grassy area but did not catch fire.  </P> <P> Two of the injured, identified as Richard Houston, 37, and his wife, Ella, both  of Lakewood, were taken to St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach where they  were both in stable condition. Houston was cut on his leg while his wife  suffered a possible concussion, a hospital spokesperson said.  </P> <P> The other passengers, Brian E. Beamer, 27, of Garden Grove and James A. Michel,  35, of Huntington Beach, suffered minor injuries and were treated and released  at Long Beach Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> It was not immediately known who was piloting the plane during the crash or  where the flight originated.  </P> <P> Lonnie Mitchell, an airport spokesperson, said two of the airport's runways  were closed for several hours after the crash.  </P></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Nice keeps a place in its heart for Medecin: The return of the fugitive former mayor Anyone walking into the shop-front office of the Moral Support Committee for Jacques Medecin in Nice might be forgiven for thinking they were in the headquarters of a political campaign rather than of a group lobbying for the liberty of the disgraced former mayor of France's fifth largest city. A flashing pink neon sign outside, the 'Free Jacques Medecin' banners and smiling photos on the walls and the phones answered by a team of volunteers belie an organisation supposedly created to uplift the spirits of the politician who returned from self-imposed exile yesterday. After more than four years in Uruguay - and most of the last 12 months in a Montevideo jail - Mr Medecin had no choice but to return to Paris yesterday in compliance with an extradition order, on his way to interrogation in Grenoble. He comes back to a country sharply transformed in its attitude to, and exposure of, allegations of corruption ensnaring political parties, businesses and a growing network of individuals alike. While Mr Medecin has already been tried and sentenced in his absence to a year's imprisonment and also faces large tax bills and demands to repay more than FFr41m (Pounds 4.9m) to the city's treasury, his reputation in Nice is far from universally tarnished. Mr Robert Bagat, who founded the Medecin support committee over the summer, confidently predicts that a welcoming convoy of 50 cars stuffed with flowers and fans will be heading to Grenoble this weekend. The owner of a lighting shop, Mr Bagat says he started the committee because it was 'unjustifiable' to incarcerate a Frenchman without trial in another country. He says he has collected some 15,000 signatures of support - albeit many from foreign visitors. A second committee of local merchants has dubbed itself the 'Liga Nissarda' and used the mayor's image to launch a range of publicity stunts in recent weeks. There is also a ready bandwagon of supporters - including Mr Medecin's first wife, daughter and sister - ready to speak up for him. There are regular weekly meetings, a Radio Jacques Medecin provides regular updates on its subject, and his book, 'An exemplary lynching', published in April, is turning into a local bestseller. Mr Medecin is threatening to cause plenty of trouble for his opponents, before running for office again in Nice - and even for the presidency. His supporters argue that Mr Medecin had the misfortune to be among the earliest victims of the intensifying public campaign now gripping the country against allegations of corruption. They also claim he is the victim of a plot by Socialist rivals. His book is even sub-titled 'Mitterrand killed me'. The list of his alleged activities is impressive. The Cour des Comptes in Marseilles, which scrutinises public expenditure, has already issued judgments against him in connection with three 'dossiers' involving the misuse of public funds totalling over FFr600m. 'This is by a long way the champion case since the (second world) war,' says Mr Alain Serieyx, the Cour's head. The warrants from prosecutors in Nice and Grenoble that led to Mr Medecin's extradition charge him with corruption and improper receipt of funds in connection with several 'para-municipal' organisations. No surprise that the local Communist party demonstrated outside the city hall earlier this week calling for the courts to make an example of him. The puzzling question for many observers north of the Mediterranean city is why there is not more such opposition to the former mayor. One explanation lies in his ambitious projects for the city: an art museum, a theatre complex, the Acropolis conference centre. 'He made Nice,' says Mr Bagat simply. Like many politicians of the era, Mr Medecin has been able to claim credit for grand schemes at a time of relative economic prosperity (leaving the city with debts of FFr4.7bn) while evading responsibility during the more recent downturn. He was also able to benefit from considerable decentralisation of power and money that was government policy in the early 1980s. Another clue comes in the old town of Nice. The narrow, winding streets and overhanging balconies, reminiscent of the Middle Ages, seem fitting for a city which treated Mr Medecin more as monarch than mayor. He and his father Jean, after whom he renamed one of the main streets, ruled the city in an almost uninterrupted reign since 1928. 'Jacquou' also brought glamour and charisma to the place. 'If you spent half an hour with him you would be charmed,' says Genevieve, his sister. His former wife, Claude, adds: 'Nice was dynamic. Now it is sleeping.'</p>

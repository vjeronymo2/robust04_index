			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Canal Plus has 18.8% gain - lifts dividend CANAL PLUS, Europe's leading pay-television station, increased its 1991 consolidated net attributable profit by 18.8 per cent to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 190m) from FFr910m a year earlier, agencies report from Paris. Operating profit increased to FFr1.91bn from FFr1.66bn. The figures allow for a loss from affiliated companies of FFr354m against a loss of FFr194m in 1990. Turnover amounted to FFr7bn, up from FFr6.13bn. The net profit figure was in line with the company's own estimate. Earnings per share rose by 16.9 per cent to FFr58.7 from FFr50.2 and Canal Plus said it intends to raise its net dividend to FFr23 a share from FFr20. Canal Plus said the strong rise in net profit last year occurred despite provisions of FFr115.5m for TV South, a UK TV station in which the French company has a 12 per cent stake, and for Carolco, a US film production company in which a Canal Plus unit has a 10 per cent interest. Last year's earnings were also affected by Canal Plus's share of the cost of new ventures, which almost doubled to FFr290m from FFr150.2m. Looking ahead, Canal Plus said it expects to maintain its growth momentum in France, while subsidiaries are expected to grow at an even faster pace, especially outside France.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Idyll spoiled by customers - Nick Garnett visits a family working hard down on the farm THE SETTING of the main house at Keynston Mill food farm is as close as you can get to a real version of Wind in the Willows. Resting on the banks of a small rivulet trickling off the river Stour in Dorset, the tree-decked land forms a creek which the Partridge family, owners of Keynston Mill, use as a swimming pool. At the side of the 18th century house a wooden bridge spans a narrow brook, by the disused mill wheel. The grassed promontories jutting out into the reaches are mowed by Richard Partridge like any back garden lawn. In this idyllic English landscape, the only unpleasant intruder is what is known locally as the Blandford Beastie. This tropical fly, named after the nearby town and brought in by a local schoolteacher before it escaped into the wild, occasionally leaves wounds as big as golf balls on the faces of Keynston Mill's fruit pickers. Tranquil it might be but running the food farm has not been easy since Richard Partridge and his wife Nicky bought the 50 acre property in the early 1980s. Keynston Mill incorporates six acres of commercial vines, more than 30 acres of other fruits and vegetables, a licensed tea room and a shop selling kitchenware and gifts as well as food and wine. Turnover for the whole business last year was Pounds 202,000 on which it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30,000. This formed the relatively modest income for the couple and for daughter Anni, who also works on the smallholding. 'It is kind of a mad business to be in.' says Nicky. 'You are so dependent on the weather.' However, the business has given the Partridges a great deal of capital growth. Former tenant farmers in Gloucestershire, the couple came to Dorset in 1969 when Richard worked for a local agro-chemical company. They started renting the land at Keynston Mill and bought it in 1984 for Pounds 1,000 an acre, including the five bedroomed farmhouse. For an outlay of Pounds 50,000, paid off over five years, the Partridges own an asset worth probably Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 if it were sold. But then it could not be kept in the family. The shop generates half of Keynston Mill's turnover. The Partridges spent Pounds 16,000 converting an old building on the site, doing a lot of the work themselves. 'It was a revolting remains of a barn,' says Richard 'It was deep in mud, generations of uncleaned out manure and a lot of diesel fuel. All the wood was rotten.' The shop sells Italian salad bowls at Pounds 37, tea mugs at Pounds 7, local produce such as Dorset bread biscuits known as 'knobs', muesli from Dorchester and Childhay Manor ice cream as well as more unusual food products including balsamic vinegar and walnut oil. 'There is no point in competing with Safeways in Blandford,' says Anni, who runs the shop. 'Some of this we stock for weekenders from London. The biggest margins are on hardware at about 100 per cent. We make 30 per cent on books and 25 to 35 per cent on food.' While the shop has been a success, the licensed tea room has proved more of a headache. It cost Pounds 20,000 to convert the building and meet hygiene regulations but turned over Pounds 13,500 last year. 'It has been a bit disappointing and we'd be pushed to say it makes a profit,' Richard says. Fruit and vegetable sales amount to about Pounds 80,000 yearly. Keynston Mill produces more than 40 types, from cooking apples and blackberries to courgettes and dwarf beans. 'This is in a way far too many but we have taken the view that to attract people here and therefore to use the shop and tea room we have to offer such a wide range.' Strawberries generate by far the biggest profit margin. 'It is the only fruit whose prices have increased at a reasonable rate. The cost of growing fruit must have gone up 200 per cent since the late 1970s but the sale price of, say, raspberries, has on blackcurrants and gooseberries is only marginal. You can make a lot of money just doing strawberries but you need better land. This here is third quality barley and sheep land, not good enough for high output cropping.' British vineyards have had a difficult time recently. 'There won't be many left the way they are falling, left, right and centre,' Richard says. He concedes, though, that a six acre vineyard is a 'mad enterprise.' Growing grapes, he says, is 'an emotional thing, a very strong feeling you get for vines.' Keynston Mill produced 12,000 bottles last year compared with 23,000 two years earlier. Some of that drop was caused by the weather but there is little pressure to make more wine as Pounds 80,000 of wine stocks wait to be sold. The wine, for which Keynston Mill does hardly any wholesaling, is made by a company in Somerset from Keynston Mill grapes and another wine maker in Sussex produces sparkling wine. 'Quality sparkling wine selling at Pounds 10 a bottle gives us a profit margin of Pounds 3. That compares with a margin of Pounds 1.50 for our best table wine and just 50p for the cheaper bottles.' Keynston Mill's most expensive non-sparkling wine, Dry Bacchus, sells for Pounds 5.95. Richard employs one man full time on fruit growing and himself often works from 6 am until late evening, seven days a week. Three or four others work part time through the year while fruit picking raises the number of temporary workers to about 40. Partridge says he loves growing but not selling. The Partridges love privacy but must attract as many customers as possible to the farm. 'By the end of the year I want to shoot people,' says Richard.

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> 2 UCI TEACHERS MAY PROTEST REPLACEMENT  </P> <P> Two UC Irvine instructors of Chinese language are expected to file formal  grievances this week to protest their replacement by three professors hired  from outside the university.  </P> <P> Jennie Hu and Richard Liao, who were on year-to-year contracts, are upset over  the hiring of three new instructors in the East Asian languages and literatures  department, according to Daniel Tsang, a representative of Local 2226 of the  American Federation of Teachers.  </P> <P> Tsang said Hu and Liao were not given fair warning before the university  decided against renewing their contracts. He said they were notified March 27  that the university was interviewing applicants for the department, and both  indicated their interest in the positions. However, neither was contacted nor  interviewed, Tsang said.  </P> <P> "We're saying they didn't evaluate them (for reappointment) in the correct  manner," Tsang said. "To be fair, they should have interviewed the two people  that were here."  </P> <P> University spokeswoman Linda Granell disagreed. "They had the opportunity to  apply," she said.  </P> <P> Granell declined to comment specifically on the qualifications of those who  were hired. But she said that one had a doctorate degree and that all were  natives of China.  </P> <P> Liao, who taught at the university for five years, holds two master's degrees  in the area of Asian studies. Hu, who has taught at the university for three  years, is a native of China and holds a bachelor's degree in Chinese  literature.  </P> <P> Granell was unable to give the names of the recently hired professors, saying  that their names are kept confidential until they become employees of the  university. She did say, however, that the candidates came from Cornell, the  University of Vermont and the University of Utah.  </P> <P> The UCI student newspaper, the New University, reported that petitions were  circulating on behalf of Hu and Liao.

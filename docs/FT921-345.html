			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Tough line on convergence 1992 is only a quarter gone; but already the Italian budget deficit is expected, as usual, to overshoot its target. This is not the only unfortunate Italian tradition that will be continued this year. Next Sunday's general election is expected to produce yet another weak, multi-party coalition government, unable to take tough measures to cut spending and raise taxes. Italy looks less likely than ever to be able to meet the convergence criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, and qualify on that basis to join a European monetary union. Unless, that is, the convergence criteria are weakened. The potential for such a fudge exists. The convergence rules for inflation and long bond interest rates are relatively straightforward and should pose few problems for most potential members. But the more important rules concerning government deficits and debts are much more vaguely specified. The treaty appears, at first sight, to prohibit from membership any country with a deficit greater than 3 per cent of gross domestic product or outstanding gross public debt above 60 per cent of GDP. If applied to the letter, these rules would keep Belgium, Ireland, Greece, Italy, and probably the Netherlands out of Emu for the rest of the decade. But these ceilings can be waived if a country's deficit is deemed to be 'only exceptional and temporary' or if the debt stock is approaching 60 per cent of GDP 'at a satisfactory pace.' 'Excessive deficits' The European Commission, responsible for policing these 'excessive deficits', is likely to interpret the fiscal rules in a relatively soft way. The 60 per cent debt ceiling has effectively been dropped - Commission officials argue that it was only ever intended to be a 'a directional criterion'. Thus the fiscal convergence plan drawn up between the EC and the Italian government is intended to reduce the Italian budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996. That would produce a primary budget surplus, excluding interest payments, well above the 2 per cent needed to stabilise the debt stock, but the stock of outstanding government debt would still far exceed the Maastricht debt rule. Slow economic growth might also produce a 'temporarily' excessive deficit. Italy would then apply to join Emu while strictly failing both fiscal rules. The Maastricht Treaty was, of course, always intended to be interpreted by politicians and economists rather than statisticians. A rigid numerical application of the convergence criteria would make little economic sense. It might seem strange to require countries to reduce their inflation or nominal interest rates to best European levels before they are allowed to join a monetary union the aim of which it to force inflation convergence. And there is no compelling economic logic behind the precise deficit or debt ceilings. Profligate countries Yet heavily indebted governments with unsustainable budget deficits or high inflation should be prevented from joining. There is no reason why the rest of Europe should bear part of the cost of their profligacy. The fiscal rules are also politically important. Only a high, if arbitrary, hurdle over which presently profligate countries must jump will reassure the rest of Europe, and Germany in particular, that these countries will not be allowed to destabilise Emu. In Italy, the fiscal rules are also needed to force the institutional reforms required to bring the budget under control. Italy's constitution is not up to the task. Last year the deficit overshot its original budget projection by 16 per cent. For 1992, the finance ministry already expects an overshoot of 25 per cent. Even to jump the fiscal deficit hurdle by 1996, a reduction equivalent to 7 percentage points of GDP, will require tougher choices than its politicians are currently able to make: to cut public spending, reduce industrial subsidies or embark on an ambitious privatisation programme. Without some form of constitutional reform, Italy's budgetary impasse will remain. The stick of the convergence criteria and the carrot of Emu together may provide the necessary incentive for reform. It is not in Italy's interests for it to be offered a soft option. Attempting to provide one would risk breaking the already shaky political consensus on which the success of Emu depends.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW MART  </P> <P> Mention Baghdad by the Bay, and visions of cable cars, steamed crab legs and  the Golden Gate Bridge pop readily to mind.  </P> <P> But trend-setting fashion? Unlikely in this bastion of liberal thinking but  conservative dressing. Not since flower children donned bell-bottoms and  tie-dyed T-shirts in the heyday of Haight-Ashbury has San Francisco fomented  anything close to a fashion rebellion.  </P> <P> Two developers, based in San Francisco and Atlanta, have joined forces in an  attempt to change all that. To showcase the Bay Area's growing cadre of  contemporary designers, as well as established names, they've plunged ahead  with a gleaming new $90-million wholesale Fashion Center in the city's funky  South of Market district. For now at least, it is open only to the trade.  </P> <P> At its first show this week, the center was host to about 3,000 department and  specialty store buyers -- mostly from Northern California and the Pacific  Northwest -- who flocked to the six-floor, 740,000-square-foot building. The  center -- complete with atrium and tiers of inviting, glass-fronted showrooms  -- is slated to open officially in August with a holiday/cruise show.  </P> <P> "What the Fashion Center will provide is . . . a recharging of the apparel  industry in San Francisco," said Tom Mitchell, general manager of the facility,  two-thirds of which has been leased.  </P> <P> After all, Mitchell noted, San Francisco is no slouch in the garment trade,  despite its unintentionally low profile. With apparel manufacturing worth $5  billion a year, San Francisco is the country's third-largest garment center,  after New York and Los Angeles. And the Bay Area weighs in with $6 billion in  annual retail sales of clothing.  </P> <P> To be sure, the region is already widely known as the home of such veterans as  Levi Strauss, Esprit de Corp, The Gap and Jessica McClintock. But some  less-established names -- including Lilli Ann, Fong Chong, Suzanne Hanley,  Oblong Rhonda and Q Rolo -- are hoping the new center will give them needed  exposure.  </P> <P> As Mitchell sees it, creating a wholesale "shopping mall" will make it easier  for store representatives from the nation's 11-state Northwest region to spot  hot designs and get them quickly to their shelves.  </P> <P> Until now, San Francisco has not had a dependable one-stop-shopping place for  displaying lines and holding fashion markets. For the last eight years, shows  were held in an exhibition center that also was used for a variety of other  trade shows. And the Pacific Apparel Center, where many designers had their  showrooms, recently filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> Many stores have sent their buyers instead to Los Angeles, where the  26-year-old California Mart has more than 3 million square feet with 2,000  showrooms occupied year-round. (San Francisco's center has 550 permanent  showrooms.)  </P> <P> One fashion consultant expressed concern that the Fashion Center could face a  rough road as it tries to lure store buyers, given the general debt-related  shakiness among retailers and the close proximity of the more powerful Los  Angeles mart.  </P> <P> "At a time of total confusion in the fashion business," said Marjorie S. Dean,  chief executive of New York-based Tobe Associates, "this just adds to the  perplexities."  </P></p>

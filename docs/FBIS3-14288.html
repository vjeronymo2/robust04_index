Suffice it that we point to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  and the subsequent decision to set up a new settlement  neighborhood in holy Jerusalem, then to the United States'  abstention from the Security Council vote on the status of  Jerusalem, and to what is happening now in Hebron -- from the  destruction of buildings by rockets to the endless falling of  martyrs by official bullets!    Undoubtedly, the decisionmakers in the Palestinian  negotiating side have heard about all these things, but that did  not prevent them from agreeing to resume the talks and accepting  to play the game of "technical" details, without drawing the  appropriate conclusions about the meaning of the continuing  Hebron massacre and about the U.S. position on Security Council  Resolution 904. [passage omitted]    Amid this amazing urge to negotiate, without taking into  account the bloody developments in the occupied Palestinian  territories and without paying attention to the calls by the  majority of the territories' residents to stop the talks until  the conditions for the Palestinian people's protection are met,  the PLO's leadership crisis is intensifying. Half of the  Executive Committee members did not attend its recent meetings.  The half that did attend were not harmonious. Negotiating  decisions are adopted even before those members are informed  about them. The Israeli and U.S. sides are aware of this fact.  They are also aware that among the nine members attending the  current Executive Committee meetings, three did not agree to the  Oslo accord. In addition, other members are opposed to the way  in which decisions -- if they are decisions -- are being adopted  by the Executive Committee.    This situation must not continue. It undermines the PLO's  status as the Palestinian people's sole legitimate  representative and has a negative effect on its credibility as a  negotiator on behalf of these people as well as on its  negotiating power.    Once again we call on all those concerned about the PLO's  status and credibility to meet and consult in a bid to assess  the situation and agree on measures that at least ensure the  minimal national unity.    The Oslo road is no longer passable. It is full of  settlements and calamities that have befallen our people through  the long lists of martyrs, confiscations of land, and daily  violations. It is no longer possible to jump over what has  accumulated on the Oslo road. If anyone is thinking of doing so,  it will be a dangerous jump and his fall will be so hard that we  would not wish it on any of our people.</p>

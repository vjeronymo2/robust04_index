			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil on the slide as Opec chief rules out 'miracle' The oil market's tentative rally was brought to an abrupt halt yesterday after it was warned not to look to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a 'miracle solution' to the oversupply that was weighing down prices. 'If others wait for Opec to have a miracle solution, I don't think we have it,' Mr Abdullah al-Attiyah of Qatar, president of the oil producers' group, told reporters after informal talks in Damascus with other Opec ministers, including Mr Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter. He also suggested that it was time for non-Opec exporters to shoulder their share of the burden of supporting oil prices. Opec could not be the world's 'swing producer' of oil and make way for others to take its market share, he said. Mr al-Attiyah's comments appeared to have extinguished any lingering hopes that Opec producers might yet rally round to bolster prices by cutting the organisation's production ceiling from the 24.52m barrels a day set in September and left unchanged after last month's ministerial meeting. On the European spot market Tuesday's 11 cents rise in the January delivery price of Brent blend, the North Sea marker crude, was quickly wiped out, and the price slumped 60 cents to a fresh five-year low of Dollars 13.27 a barrel before buyers were attracted into the market. In late trading January Brent was quoted at Dollars 13.63 a barrel, down 25 cents on balance. Also contributing to the bearish mood were American Petroleum Institute figures published overnight showing a 5m-barrel increase US crude oil stocks. And yesterday the Paris-based International Energy Agency said October demand in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development fell by 500,000 b/d over the past month, against the normal seasonal trend. The decline was mainly in European gasoil (heating oil) deliveries. The Opec president's statement in Damascus signalled that 'the cartel is pushing hard for a serious effort by non-Opec producers to accept the responsibility for oil output restraint', says London trade house GNI in the latest issue of its Oil Graphical Supplement, published today. 'Some countries are already indicating their willingness to join forces with the cartel,' GNI says, 'but the question is: How low do prices need to fall before North Sea producers agree to cut output?' Although it says most analysts believe a protracted period with prices below Dollars 5 a barrel would be needed for production in the North Sea to be shut down, GNI suggests that a degree of co-operation may be seen much sooner - 'but even that would probably require a fall in price below Dollars 10 a barrel (for Brent crude)'. Following the Opec ministers failure to reduce the output ceiling 'the oil market now has to cope with a perpetuation of the excess stocks situation', GNI says. 'While stock levels may not look excessive on a historical basis, the general view that Opec will not do anything to tighten supply this winter means that oil refiners can reduce contingency reserves to a bare minimum. The additional prospect of Iraq's return to the world market, now a virtual certainty by the end of 1994, means that it will be difficult for the cartel to raise prices for the next two years.'</p>

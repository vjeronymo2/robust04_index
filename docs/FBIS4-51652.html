			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yuki Nagamochi] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr -- "An agreement on cooperation in  ensuring the safety of nuclear power generation" will be  concluded between the Japanese and Chinese governments. It is  expected that in China, where the demand for energy supply is  increasing, atomic power plants will increasingly be built in  coastal areas. But there is concern about the possibility that  if accidents occur there, neighboring nations including Japan,  will be affected. To prevent such a possibility, a clause on  the promotion of government-level exchanges on safety  regulations and of information in emergency cases will be  included in the agreement.    The agreement will be concluded on 3 May between the Agency  of Natural Resources and Energy placed under Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, and China's Nuclear Safety  Administration [NSA], which manages licensing systems for  building atomic power plants and safety regulations for power  plant operation.    The two governments are expected to launch periodical  exchanges in accordance with the agreement. During the  exchanges, the Japanese government plans to present concrete  safety measures designed to prevent nuclear accidents in  addition to a report analyzing causes of past nuclear accidents  in Japan, with recommended after-accident action. Thanks to the  agreement, information on the details of nuclear accidents --  which is usually closed to the public because of "state secrets"  -- is expected to be open to the public.    Changing its energy supply policies last year, China decided  to promote the construction of nuclear power stations -- which  were placed in secondary importance compared to thermal-power  and water-power generation -- in locations centered around  coastal areas where the economy is developing remarkably. This  is because China urgently requires replenishment of a shortage  of electric power which is said to be 20-30 percent below total  needs. New power plants are scheduled to be built on the  premises of the Qinshan nuclear power plant (in Zhejiang  Province) and the Dayawan nuclear power plant (in Guangdong  Province).</p>

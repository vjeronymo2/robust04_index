			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Staffordshire bypass development plan Four contracts, worth a total of Pounds 32.5m, have recently been awarded to ALFRED McALPINE CIVIL ENGINEERING. The largest of the three, worth Pounds 26m, is the A5 bypass at Tamworth in Staffordshire for the Department of Transport. The 8km long dual carriageway bypass will diverge from the existing A5 at Bangley, taking a route to the north and rejoining the original A5 again at the junction with the M42. The work also includes 2km of single carriageway at Kettlebrook to replace part of the A51. The project involves a total of 20 structures including a 180 metre long viaduct over the A4091 and the River Thame. The bypass is believed to be the first trunk road to be constructed using porous asphalt surfacing which reduces noise pollution and spray. The second contract, worth Pounds 11.8m, also for the DTp, is for the widening of the M56 at Wythenshawe, Manchester. The work involves the conversion of 3km of motorway from dual three lane to dual four lane standard and also includes the demolition and replacement of several bridges and construction of 3.5km of mass concrete retaining wall of up to six metres high. Completion is set for July 1994. The two remaining contracts concern coastal protection for Colwyn Borough Council at Rhos-on-Sea, Clwyd, worth Pounds 3m, and the renewal of training walls on the River Crane at Hounslow for the National Rivers Authority, worth Pounds 1.7m.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer RATES in the sterling interbank market were slightly firmer yesterday as the market took most of the day to remove a Pounds 750m shortage forecast by the Bank of England. After several days in which money had been relatively cheap, the short dates in the cash market moved up yesterday. The overnight rate moved between much narrower ranges of 9 3/4 and 10 1/4 per cent, having hit a low of 8 1/2 per cent the previous day. 1-month money moved up to 9 15/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 7/8 per cent. However, everything from 2-months out ended the day at the same rate of 10 per cent. Traders said that the firming of shorter-dated rates was due purely to supply and demand factors in the market. After forecasting a Pounds 750m shortage, the Bank purchased Pounds 11m of bills for resale to the market on 29 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then purchased Pounds 387m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 143m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 25m for resale to the market on 29 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the market in the afternoon, but issued late assistance of around Pounds 35m. Despite these technical factors, the longer-dated rates reflected a bearish view on a possible rate cut. They were unchanged, despite sterling's  1/2 pfennig rise against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday. Traders said that the bearish view still dominates in the cash market on a possible base rate cut. That was the prevailing view among traders in sterling futures. September short sterling ended up one tick on the day at 90.23. This assumes that 3-month sterling libor in September will be at 9.77 per cent, less than  1/4 per cent lower from yesterday's rate. December short sterling was also only a tick higher at 90.47, implying that 3-month sterling libor at the end of the year will be at 9.53 per cent. In other words, the market is assuming that another  1/2 percent cut in rates this year is unlikely. German call money rates were quoted unchanged at 9.60-9.65 per cent yesterday after the Bundesbank held rates steady in its weekly tender for securities repurchase funds. The Bundesbank allocated DM38.3bn in a 28-day tender, mostly at 9.65 per cent.</p>

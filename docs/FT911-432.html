			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Threat increases of Post Office strike THE THREAT of Post Offices throughout the UK being hit by industrial action increased yesterday as the Union of Communication Workers said there were early signs from a ballot that its members had voted for strike action over pay. The ballot of 14,500 Post Office counter and clerical employees followed rejection by UCW negotiators of a 6.8 per cent pay offer. A strong vote in favour of action would strengthen the union's hand in further talks with management. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, said: 'The im-proved finances and productivity of the Post Office Counters business allows them to make a much better offer than that.' Voting on industrial action does not finish until today, and the full ballot result is not due to be announced until the start of the union's annual conference in Blackpool tomorrow. However, the UCW said early reports from branches indicated a 'substantial 'yes' vote' from members. Separately, the union claimed it had achieved a victory in the High Court by getting an injunction lifted in a dispute in Liverpool involving postal engineers. Individual UCW members had refused to cross National Communications Union picket lines and Royal Mail management claimed the UCW had taken industrial action without holding a ballot. The UCW claimed throughout that it had taken no part in stopping members of the union attending work and now says it wants to see the issue dealt with fully in open court. The dispute itself, which arose after the dismissal of two engineers employed by Royal Mail Engineering and Construction, who went home early after completing a job, has been concluded with both sides agreeing to abide by the decision of an industrial tribunal.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ballet in classical spirit Sir, Notwithstanding that I hold Clement Crisp's ballet reviews in very high esteem, I cannot subscribe to his judgment on David Bintley's Sylvia ('A sadly misconceived Sylvia', March 31), which, in a way, is in line with his vigorous attack on last year's Royal Ballet staging of Don Quixote. Undoubtedly, both productions diverge substantially from their respective original texts. Remembering their present state of funding, however, classical ballet companies unwilling to perform Swan Lake for the umpteenth time sometimes have to be bold and provide fun as well. A short look at the ballet's history could be helpful. From the score it can well be considered superior to its sister ballet, Coppelia. Still, it had always been that popular for one obvious reason: for most of the time it served as a perfect vehicle for the leading ballerina to excel at her technical dancing abilities. But, as the story was rather poorly received by most audiences, the other part of the art of ballet, ie understanding a role with the body, couldn't be honoured either. Note that its original run effectively ended when Rita Sangalli, the first Sylvia, withdrew due to injury. Later on Sir Frederick Ashton reduced his much acclaimed 1952 production to just one act. It now seems that David Bintley has proved to be the catalyst Sylvia longed for in more recent times. His choreography leaves ample opportunities for all roles to be intelligently used. On the two nights I attended Sandra Madgwick and Miyako Yoshida, as Sylvia, gave stunning performances. Though their interpretations differed considerably both were in a truly classical spirit. All the other artists - and without disparaging anyone I would mention Jessica Clarke and Karen Waldie, both as Diana - were fine. The corps de ballet was exemplary. There are certainly other ways to read the text. But on both nights Coven Garden was all smiles. Good fun, wonderful dancing. Jorg Schimmelpfennig, Natruper Str. 109, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany</p>

"Constructive relations between Greece and the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are certainly essential to  regional stability," State Department spokeswoman Christine  Shelly said.    Meanwhile, a senior administration official was quoted as  saying that the U.S. ambassador to Athens would submit a  diplomatic note to the Greek Foreign Ministry Thursday [17  February] and the Greek ambassador to the U.S. might also be  summoned to the State Department.    The remarks came after Greek prime minister's announcement  earlier that Athens would stop the flow of goods from the  Salonika port to the land-locked Macedonia, except humanitarian  supplies.    Washington recognized Macedonia on February 9, but using the  name of "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in order not  to anger either side.    "We would certainly hope that every effort could be made to  try to avoid any particular actions which might aggravate the  situation or lead to some kind of an increase in tensions,"  Shelly said.    Greece has been trying to block international recognition of  Macedonia, saying the name "Macedonia" could be exploited for  territorial claims against its province with the same name.    About 50,000 Greek citizens protested Tuesday against the  U.S. recognition of the Balkan republic.    Macedonia, with a population of some two million Slavs and  ethnic Albanians, declared its independence in 1991.</p>

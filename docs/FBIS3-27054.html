At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, the  spokesman said China is a country that pays great attention to  the rule by law.    He said the regulation fully shows that the Chinese  Government respects the freedom of religious belief of  foreigners in China and of Chinese citizens, protects their  normal religious activities, and preserves normal friendly  contacts and cultural and academic exchanges between foreign and  Chinese people in the religious field.    Meanwhile, he said, the regulation also demonstrates the  principles set forth in China's constitution that China's  religious bodies and religious affairs will not be subjected to  any foreign domination.    The spokesman said foreigners in China should abide by  Chinese laws and should neither harm the country's public social  interests nor interfere in its religious affairs.    When asked to confirm whether the Chinese Public Security  Department had arrested foreign Christians, the spokesman said  three American citizens and two citizens from Indonesia  conducted illegal religious activities between February 9 and  11, 1994, in Henan Province of China, thus violating the  regulation on the maintenance of social order of the People's  Republic of China and the regulation on the management of  foreigners' religious activities in China.    On February 11, the local public security bureau, in  accordance with Chinese laws, conducted an investigation,  instructing and giving warnings to these people, and shortened  the term of stay in China for one American citizen among them,  the spokesman said.    These people acknowleged that they had violated Chinese  laws,  made guarantees that they would no longer conduct such  activities and left for Hong Kong on the afternoon of February  15, he said.</p>

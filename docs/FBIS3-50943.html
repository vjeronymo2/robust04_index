			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilfred Alayon from Matanzas for the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] Petroleum production in the country during 1993  amounted to 1.1 million tons, 70 percent of which came from the  oil fields in Matanzas Province.    The total amount produced in Matanzas was 814,000 tons,  which  is equal to 7.15 million barrels. All these amounts are  records, both for Matanzas and on a nationwide level, despite  the fact that it is still not enough to meet the country's  requirements. That is because approximately 90 percent of the  electricity in Cuba is produced by thermoelectric generators,  which have been adapted to use domestic heavy crude oil, and  this represents slightly more than 30 percent of the fuel  consumed.    It is therefore important to understand the enormous  responsibility of the Central Petroleum Extraction and Drilling  Enterprise, which is in Cardenas Municipality in Matanzas  Province, 150 km east of the Cuban capital. That enterprise  makes the largest contribution to the country's oil production.    The enterprise of the Yumuri area is made up of  approximately  2,000 men, including specialists, workers, and administrative  personnel, all highly qualified and experienced people.    This year the development of the gas-oil program will be  subject to the conditions of the current financial situation,  which is why a slight increase in the extraction of the  so-called black gold is foreseen.    However, in light of the financial problems, the country's  directorate decided to take measures to provide more facilities  for the producers of Matanzas Province. This, together with the  solution of the technical problems that kept the foreign  associates from attaining the production goals estimated for the  oil wells directly operated by them, will allow us to maintain a  sustained annual increase in the extraction of hydrocarbons.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] China is planning a wide range of retaliatory  measures against the United States should Washington fail to  renew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status next month,  senior Chinese officials said yesterday. Selective trade  sanctions against state sector enterprises -- a compromise  solution that has been mooted in Washington -- would be  "impossible" to implement, they said.    The retaliatory measures would apply mainly to trade, but  would also include foreign investment and imports as well as  other non- economic areas such as culture, said Jiao Sunfen,  director-general of the foreign investment department of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. "The  actual measures are still a secret, but you can be sure our  retaliation will be no lighter than the US measures against  China," she said.    In the area of foreign investment, restrictions would be  placed on the mainland investments of US enterprises which  approved of the cancellation of MFN, she said. "When approving  projects, we will approve other (countries) first and then take  differing treatment for different US companies," she said. "If  the US company opposes (the cancellation of MFN) we will give  them some encouragement," she said. "Others will face some  restrictions." Asked whether every US company investing in  China would have to state publicly its attitude on the issue,  Jiao said her department would "investigate and learn about"  each company instead.    The proposed countermeasure strategy is consistent with the  Chinese Communist Party's "united front" approach to foreign  affairs, in which friendly forces in foreign countries are  invited to stand with Beijing in return for certain rewards.  Jiao said every department of the Chinese government would be  asked for suggestions on retaliatory measures.    Jiao had just returned from the US as a member of the  delegation to New York and Los Angeles led by the Foreign Trade  Minister, Wu Yi, to drum up support for MFN extension. She said  most of the 750 companies that attended seminars in the two  cities opposed the linking of trade and human rights. "This  feeling is clearer this year than last. Even the US Treasury  Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said the two should not be linked,"  she said.    China's foreign investment -- about 7 per cent of which is  from the US -- would feel "some effects" if MFN were denied, but  the losses would mainly be felt by US companies already in China  which exported mainly to the US. Jiao said steps to improve  human rights in China were "necessary", but that this was a  matter for senior leaders to decide. "But these steps are not  to say the human rights situation in China was bad before, or  that because of the unreasonable US pressure we are taking  measures to improve human rights."    Also speaking in Guangzhou yesterday was the president of  Citic Trading, Xu Shiwei. Xu said China's purchases of large  high-technology items from the US including Boeing aircraft  would be curtailed if MFN were not renewed. "We certainly would  take this step. It would mean the US would lose the market"  said Xu, who was formerly commercial counsellor to the European  Community.    Xu said the proposed targeting of state-owned companies  would  be "impossible" to implement from a political and a practical  point of view. "Not giving MFN to state enterprises is  tantamount to saying no to China, because state enterprises are  the mainstay of our economy," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Felix Salazar in Oruro] </F>   [Text] Heavily armed military troops have prevented several  attempts by peasants and rural teachers to block roads. Traffic  on the Oruro-La Paz road was maintained although the flow  dropped considerably because bus drivers suspended services to  safeguard their buses.    In Caracollo, 37 km from Oruro, peasants and students were  prevented from blocking the road toward the south. After being  briefly blocked, a military presence now guarantees the free  flow of traffic.    Peasants blocked the Oruro-Cochabamba road, suspending all  traffic. The traffic police have reported that the peasants  broke the windshields of three buses and demanded money to let  them pass. It has been announced that inter-department bus  services will be totally normalized today.    While there was military presence on the roads yesterday,  the  situation in the cities was totally calm, contrary to previous  days when many demonstrations were held.    Railway services are working normally but under military  custody. Yesterday peasants had to lift their blockade in  Banderani and Cona Cona stations on the Oruro-Cochabamba railway  stretch due to the presence of military troops.    The national railway service operations manager reported  that  services are being provided normally, although every train is  guarded by military troops.    Private school classes were suspended today for 24-hours as  determined by the Private School Teachers Association in support  for the urban teachers' demands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susana del Calvo; from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The Havana workers' parliament has just been held  and we will now speak with Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister  president of the State Committee for Finance, who refers to the  budget deficit.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] Generally speaking, the country,  as well as Havana Province, should substantially reduce its  budget deficit -- particularly at the national level -- this  year. However, a certain level of deficit will nevertheless  prevail because we cannot possibly reduce last year's figure,  meaning $4.2 billion, to zero in a single year. The government  has yet to approve the budget but we will have a deficit.    Generally speaking, the measures adopted in the assembly to  reduce the deficit have a lot in common with what is being done  in the rest of the country. The measures are mainly aimed at  reducing subsidies to the enterprises, which is one of the  essential elements of the country's deficit, and seeking a  greater effectiveness in the production sector. This is a  short-term element on which work can be readily carried out to  cut losses, increase reliability, and achieve profits -- as much  as possible -- in enterprises that are currently unprofitable.  [end recording]    Workers propose measures during the parliaments. Some of the  measures will be popular but others will not. Jose Luis  Rodriguez refers to these measures:    [Begin Rodriguez recording] Certainly, as we have explained,  the National Assembly of the People's Government is trying to  adopt a series of measures that, although they will strive not  to leave unprotected any citizen in the country, certain  measures imply -- as our commander in chief explained --  sacrifices for the population. The people should rest assured  the measures will be implemented with the greatest criteria of  social justice possible and they will bear in mind the working  people's interests. They will also include measures against  those who violate the working people's interests. [end recording]    The consultation with the Cuban workers, called the workers'  parliament, will end on 15 March.</p>

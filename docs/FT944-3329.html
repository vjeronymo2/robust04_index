			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Salary upturn seen for managers Salary awards for managerial and professional staff averaged 3.4 per cent in the three months to October compared with 2.7 per cent in the same period last year, says a report by Incomes Data Services published today, Richard Donkin writes. The report, in the December issue of the IDS Management Pay Review, cautions against interpreting the salary upturn as evidence of new wage inflation. It says the salary average has been pushed up by the disappearance of pay freezes for the first time since 1990. The report also highlights signs in some areas, particularly information technology, that the recovery is beginning to push up salary awards for managers and specialists.

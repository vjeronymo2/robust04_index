			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The 2nd economic committee  of the Worker's (Nodong) Party, which is directly controlled by  North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il, is  managing Pyongyang's nuclear development through enormous  expenditures, a former North Korean worker at a uranium  refinery, who defected to the South early this month, told a  Japanese vernacular newspaper Friday.    "North Korea succeeded in extracting 12 kilograms of  plutonium in 1988," 35-year-old Kim Tae-ho said in Seoul in an  interview with the YOMIURI SHIMBUN.    On the surface, North Korea's nuclear program is seemingly  under the control of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry, but in  fact it is managed by party Secretary Chon Pyong-ho, chief of  the 2nd Economic Committee, Kim said.    The 2nd Economic Committee commands the logistics and atomic  energy industries and the nuclear program is managed by its  subordinate agency, called the 5th General Machinery Industry  Bureau, he said.    All facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex are  administered by the 5th Machinery Industry General Bureau and  Economic Committee Chief Chon are operating them under direct  instructions from Kim Il-song and his son.    Saying he had heard stories from several of his friends  working as nuclear researchers, Kim told the YOMIURI that North  Korea first succeeded in withdrawing plutonium from spent fuel  in the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of  1988.    "Kim Il-song and his son were so happy that they went down  to  the reactor and gave each of the researchers and engineers a  color television receiver," he said.    The extracted plutonium was estimated to weigh 12 kilograms,  sufficient to produce two nuclear bombs, Kim pointed out. "In  light of North Korea's technology, they (North Koreans) have yet  to produce nuclear bombs, but I think they are near completion,  he said.    He said a military coup was attempted in a bid to overthrow  the Kim Il-song regime early last year. It was led by Vice  Marshal Kim Pong-yul and several generals who studied in the  former Soviet Union. They were all captured after their coup  plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director Yi  Pong-won, Kim said.    Before fleeing to South Korea, Kim worked at a uranium  refinery in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province, which sends ore  to a processing factory in Yongbyon. The ore is known to be  processed into fuel rods for use at nuclear reactors.</p>

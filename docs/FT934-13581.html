			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Engineering chief reopens attack on Treasury policy THE Treasury was again attacked yesterday by Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, for being 'isolated from the real world' and 'not too knowledgeable about wealth creation'. Speaking to a conference on manufacturing organised jointly by the federation and the AEEU engineering and electrical union, he complained that Britain continued to have 'an overwhelmingly anti-industrial culture'. Mr Johnson, who is to leave the federation at the end of the year, first attacked the Treasury last week. Yesterday he said the lack of a 'national industrial strategy' was the 'missing link'.

Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, said the 'green shoots of recovery' had been 'caught by an early frost'. He called for long-term, quality skills training at all levels with all new manufacturing employees given training to national vocational qualification level 2. He said there should be worker representation for individual and collective grievances to be embodied in law. He said: 'The present position makes a mockery of the assertion of individual rights at work. 'As long as we have the position where employee rights to representation and union recognition can only be guaranteed by the exercise of industrial muscle, you have the permanent seeds of industrial unrest and uncertainty.'

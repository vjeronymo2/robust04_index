			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reflections" commentary by Fernando Davalos] </F>   [Text] A few days after the historic May Day session of the  National Assembly of the People's Government, as the next step,  a meeting of presidents of People's Government Administrative  Councils from all the provinces and the special municipality of  the Isle of Youth was held. The meeting, chaired by Lage,  Machado Ventura, and Alarcon, discussed the budget,  self-employment, local industries, the illegal sale of homes and  vehicles, and other issues. As you can see, some of these issues  are very current and of great interest. Nevertheless, I would  like to focus on the budget alone.    Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave good  news at the meeting, although right now it consists only of  promising indexes. Rodriguez stated that in general, the  management of the budget in the provinces in the first two  months of 1994 shows encouraging signs. It is only a two-month  period; nevertheless, it undoubtedly reflects that the imbalance  -- which, as is often stressed hurts the country greatly -- is  being corrected.    Fifty-one percent of the nation's budget is managed in the  provinces -- in other words, administered by the local People's  Government. The Administrative Councils are in charge of  controlling it, ensuring that only the amount budgeted is spent  and that revenues match anticipated income in order to reduce  the imbalance between revenues and expenses, which surpasses 4.2  billion pesos nationally and contributes to rarefying the  national economy.    Jose Luis Rodriguez also stated that calculations showed  that  fewer expenses and greater revenues were being registered. This  is even more healthy. Rodriguez pointed out that irksome  subsidies were on the way out, and that in general terms, a  reduction of 6 percent has taken place in the deficit.    Good news, just like hearing someone's fever is dropping. We  cannot forget that this process has been called a healing of the  internal finances. With an elevated budget deficit and an excess  of currency nearing 12 billion pesos circulating, we have to  admit that the national economy is experiencing problems similar  to an illness.    Rodriguez announced that so far Holguin, I might add, is the  only province in the black in terms of revenues. In other words,  it spends less than what it contributes to the budget. He also  mentioned Cienfuegos, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba  Provinces as having a similar situation, but being supported by  state subsidies.    Another bit of news was that billing and payment management  has improved. Minister Rodriguez stated that unsettled accounts  diminished by 440 million pesos during the first quarter of  1994. Even better. However, the most important thing is that on  this occasion guidelines were drafted to ensure that financial  indiscipline does not make a comeback, because it would be  unacceptable for this to reoccur in the provinces, where the  finances are blooming much taller and stronger.</p>

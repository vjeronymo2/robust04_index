			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPEAU MAY SELL BLOOMINGDALE'S TO REDUCE DEBT LOAD  </P> <P> Campeau Corp., the troubled Canadian owner of the largest collection of  department stores in the United States, on Friday proposed a major overhaul  that would include selling off its crown jewel, the Manhattan-based  Bloomingdale's chain.  </P> <P> Campeau, which has struggled with tremendous debts since its $6.6-billion  acquisition of Federated Department Stores last year, said a management group  led by Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub is putting together a buyout  offer. The company noted that in the past there have been many expressions of  interest in the glamorous chain, whose 17 stores from New York to Texas had  sales of $1.19 billion last year.  </P> <P> The restructuring, Campeau said, may involve a $250-million loan from its  important minority shareholder, the Olympia &amp; York commercial real estate  firm. Olympia &amp; York would hold just under 25% of the voting stock if it  converted all of its debt securities to common stock; the chairman, Robert  Campeau, controls 50% of the voting shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Convertible Loan Sought  </P> <P> The money would come in the form of a convertible secured loan, which means it  could be turned in for stock in the Toronto-based Campeau. The proceeds would  be used to pay debts that come due Thursday for its two big retail companies,  the Federated and Allied Stores chains. The restructuring plan will be taken up  by Campeau's board at a meeting on Tuesday, the company said.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the restructuring should not be interpreted as a  sign of worsening financial trouble "because it is designed to forestall  trouble." She said the restructuring would also create "an active new  management role" for the Reichmann family, owners of Olympia &amp; York.  </P> <P> Sanger would not say how large Olympia &amp; York's stake in Bloomingdale's  would become if the company converted all of the debt into stock.  </P> <P> On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Campeau's stock slid Friday by $2.75 ($3.25  Canadian) to $15.90 ($18.75 Canadian) as investors worried about the company's  financial health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Analysts Surprised  </P> <P> Several analysts expressed surprise that the company would elect to give up  Bloomingdale's, recalling that Robert Campeau has often said the store was a  central reason that he battled R. H. Macy &amp; Co. for Federated.  </P> <P> "This is a jewel of a company, the part Campeau always said he wanted," said  Walter Loeb, analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. "If he's  selling it, this is a fire sale."  </P> <P> Loeb said he expected to see wide interest in the sale, perhaps including bids  from Japanese retailers. Loeb said it would make "good sense" for Traub to buy  the company since he has been so central to its operations. Loeb said  Bloomingdale's could fetch $1.2 billion, and speculated that Campeau might  decide to seek other department stores in the restructuring.  </P> <P> Campeau said it decided to sell Bloomingdale's because as a "highly valued  franchise" its sale offered the best chance of sharply reducing Campeau's debt  in a single transaction. Bloomingdale's has the least in common with the  company's other big chains and would be best able to function independently,  the company said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5,000 Jobs Lost  </P> <P> Campeau's battle for Federated, which included Bloomingdale's, rocked the  retail industry, and about 5,000 jobs have been eliminated as Campeau has  sought to cut his $8-billion debt. As part of the Federated deal, Campeau sold  the company's Bullock's, Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin chains to R. H. Macy  &amp; Co., its rival in the bidding for Federated.  </P> <P> Campeau's 240 other department stores include those of Abraham &amp; Straus,  based in Brooklyn; the Bon Marche in Seattle; Jordan Marsh in Boston, and  Burdine's in Miami. None of the company's department stores are in California,  although Campeau owns the 137-store Ralphs grocery chain.  </P> <P> In the New York retail community, there was speculation Friday that Traub might  be joined in his bid by Estee Lauder, the cosmetics company that has long done  business with Bloomingdale's, and by Ralph Lauren, the fashion designer who got  his big break at Bloomingdale's. Traub was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Announcement of the sale came three days after the leading trade publication  Women's Wear Daily carried a long and flattering profile of Traub. In one  section, the article said: "Robert Campeau and his bankers may hold pieces of  paper indicating ownership, but Bloomingdale's belongs to Traub."  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines afresh as data disappoints Wall Street THE LATEST batch of disappointing economic news left US share prices lower for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.72 at 3,466.81. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 2.74 lower at 443.19, while the Nasdaq composite dipped 1.98 to 684.79. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 278m shares. Yesterday's economic data was bearish for equities. The Commerce Department said that durable goods orders fell 1.6 per cent in May, the third straight monthly decline. Although the durable goods figures are notoriously volatile and unpredictable, the numbers still surprised analysts, who had been predicting a solid rise in orders. Also, the government reported that it had revised its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product growth from 0.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent - the slowest growth rate in more than a year. The data, taken with recent profits warnings from major corporations, unnerved investors who fear that stocks are overvalued relative to the current, and future, state of corporate earnings and economic growth. Among individual stocks, a sizeable group of Dow constituents ran into heavy selling, although it was difficult to identify a pattern among the losses. Du Pont fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 1/2 , Walt Disney gave up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 40 1/2 in volume of 1.3m shares, Eastman Kodak shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 7/8 and Sears Roebuck tumbled Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 . Nike, which issued a profits warning earlier in the week, dropped a further Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 54 1/2 , and rival sports shoe maker Reebok lost Dollars 1 1/4 more to Dollars 27 1/2 . Ford slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 1/2 on news that the auto maker's sales of US-made cars fell 5.8 per cent in the middle of June, the first sign of a slowdown in car sales for some time. Ford's US-made truck sales, however, remained strong. Atlantic Richfield receded Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 114 5/8 , Texaco lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 62 3/8 , Phillips Petroleum shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 and Royal Dutch Petroleum dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 91 7/8 after broking house Kidder Peabody lowered its investment ratings for the four oil companies, in part because of an expected decline in crude oil prices. Other oil issues were also lower, Chevron declining Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 86 1/8 , British Petroleum Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 and Exxon Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 1/4 . Corning eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 3/8 after announcing the acquisition of Costar for Dollars 180m. The news lifted Costar, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 23 5/8 . Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, Cirrus Logic fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 in volume of 1.6m shares after stating that it may have to add up to Dollars 10m to its first-quarter inventory reserves. Canada TORONTO continued to climb in heavy trading, boosted by a strong gold shares sector. The TSE 300 index ended 15.9 higher at a new peak for the year of 3,951.6 and advancing issues outpaced declines by 407 to 348 after volume of 73.1m shares valued at CDollars 720m. The golds index jumped 3 per cent as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 5.75 an ounce.</p>

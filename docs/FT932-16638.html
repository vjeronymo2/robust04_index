			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Management: Creating cracks in the layers - Ciba is paying more than just lip-service to the term empowerment Alex Krauer knows the gap between rhetoric and reality is nowhere greater than in the domain of organisational management. While chairmen pronounce their latest vision for their company, more often than not in the bowels of the organisation their instructions are interpreted, subverted or merely ignored. Krauer should know. Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and drugs group where he is chairman, is a perfect example. For two years, senior managers at the company, which last week reported post-tax profits up 19 per cent, have been struggling to implement a cultural revolution. Its aim is to make the organisation more flexible and responsive by giving its shop-floor employees more responsibility. The scheme, called Vision 2000, is, in current management jargon, all about empowerment. 'Everything depends on implementation,' says Krauer. 'This mustn't just be a declaration of intent. We must actively involve every employee in the process. The danger is that we create a level of expectation and then nothing happens.' The implementation of Ciba's vision has not run smoothly. Heini Lippuner, chief operating officer, admits: 'We do not have a uniform adoption of the leadership style we would like. There's a difference between the various divisions. Some are far advanced. In some others, I'm sorry to say, there is not much difference at lower levels.' The causes for the different degrees of implementation are multiple, says Lippuner. Partly it depends on the attitudes of the individuals at the top of Ciba's 14 divisions. Partly it is the cultural differences between countries. Italy is touted as one of the examples where empowerment has worked. Sergio Giuliani, corporate head of Ciba Italy, says the Italian management during the early 1980s was authoritarian, hierarchical and bureaucratic. 'By definition a successful company becomes complacent and conservative,' he says. Since then, layers of management have been ripped out and a start made in devolving decision-making down the organisation. But in Basle, at Ciba's headquarters, a risk-averse bureaucratic culture still exists, says Lippuner. There is a passion in Basle for avoiding mistakes, he says. That makes empowerment difficult, because personal initiative brings the possibility of making errors. 'The Swiss character cherishes its traditional ways,' says Lippuner. In an effort to escape the deadening hand of Basle, the company has moved the headquarters of three of its divisions out of Basle. A fourth, the eyecare division, Ciba-Vision, is relocating to Georgia later this year. At Ciba's pigment division headquarters in Paisley, Scotland, Jean-Luc Schwitzguebal, managing director, says moving divisional headquarters out of Basle is vital. 'Our performance is now our responsibility. We can't blame anyone else. We can't bitch that we are doing everything right, but Basle is screwing it up.' Krauer identifies a further key component for successful implementation. 'The critical area is middle management. If it stops there, then the whole exercise is wasted. Some fully support the changes, while others are afraid. Others refuse to delegate because they believe that by doing so they lose power,' says Krauer. Lippuner explains: 'I meet young people on the shop-floor who tell me they like the vision, they believe we are sincere about empowerment. But they complain there has been no real change. To put it pointedly, it looks as though we have a layer of clay that prevents anything going either way - up or down. That layer is middle management.' The resistance to change is sometimes unconscious, says Giuliani. 'There is often an unspoken contract between the boss and employee. They play a game,' he says. Ciba is putting immense effort into explaining the programme. 'If you don't understand, you don't believe and if you don't believe you won't take on the vision,' says Krauer. Senior management plans to crack the layer of clay by creating pressure from both above and below and through education. Questionnaires were sent to the 20,000 employees in Switzerland about their superiors' leadership behaviour. The aim, says Krauer, was to set up a level of expectation from employees and use that expectation to force middle managers into dialogue. Krauer believes 90 per cent of managers are capable of adopting the vision. 'A few, and I hope only a few, will not want to co-operate and they had better look for a job outside Ciba,' says Krauer. 'There's too much at stake for people in key positions not to be part of the process.' Lippuner says he does not want to paint too black a picture. There have been changes in small units away from Basle where leaders have been particularly dynamic and deployed private initiative. Jim McDonald says he is at the bottom of Ciba. A team leader at Paisley  - a plant cited by Lippuner as a success - McDonald says the vision has filtered its way down. 'We are now treated reasonably and responsibly,' says McDonald. Clocking in and out has been abandoned. At the start of the day workers no longer wait to be handed work slips because they know what to do. By being given responsibility, most of the workforce - and he admits there are still some from the old school - are far more highly motivated. Colin MacKay, the boss of his plant, is delighted. He explains how maintenance problems have been resolved by giving workers responsibility. 'Previously, production people waited until something broke and the shit hit the fan. They then blamed the maintenance people. The maintenance people blamed the production people for treating the machinery badly,' says MacKay. Maintenance workers have now been incorporated into the production team, helping production staff spot when machinery is likely to break down. Rather than running the plant to destruction it can be shut down for half a day for preventative maintenance, saving three or four days' down-time. 'It sounds obvious, but it took time to change the habits of a lifetime,' explains MacKay. Attitude surveys at Paisley suggest that nearly 70 per cent of employees are proud to work for Ciba. 'That includes people who spend most of their day shovelling chemicals. They're surprisingly good figures,' says Schwitzguebal who claims Paisley was the only classical pigment producer making money in western Europe last year. McDonald agrees that management is now far more effective, allowing the possibility of avoiding problems before they happen. But in spite of Paisley's model status, he argues there are still difficulties. Team leaders wanted to meet to discuss similar issues, but the middle management initially blocked their meetings. 'We should meet one another - we have plenty to talk about,' he says. In the end, permission was given. Elsewhere, employees are also enthusiastic about the changes. At Ciba's epoxy-resin plant in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, Lionel Webb, customer service centre manager, describes proudly how his department was restructured after employees were polled about the business's problems. The survey revealed the business's top problem was the telephone system which was technically good, but poorly used, says Webb. Technical, sales and order advice was handled by different people on separate lines. Both customers and employees became frustrated as more than 25 per cent of incoming calls - between 50 and 60 a day - went unanswered as calls were bounced from department to department. Staff decided to set up a customer service centre with a direct line. They were given more responsibility and retrained to handle all aspects of inquiries in a single call. A graph at the site's main entrance shows that now only a couple of calls are unanswered a day. Ciba managers admit the success of the Italian and Paisley businesses cannot be put down just to the vision. For various reasons, the cultural change started earlier than the programme. Many other divisions still have a long way to go. 'I have no illusions about inertia - I've worked in this organisation for 35 years. But that does not mean we will capitulate,' says Lippuner.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General CIBA                Strongly  Agree   Unsure  Disagree  Strongly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I feel my boss recognises     my work's importance      11.1     32.2    16.3     21.3      19.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I need more training to     do my job                 17.5     21.6    12.9     29.7      16.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I feel very much left     on my own                 15.4     20.3    17.6     30.3      16.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I enjoy the challenges     of my job                 23.6     44.8    12.5     10.6       8.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I feel proud to work     for Ciba                  22.9     46.4    20.2      5.0       5.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I can't wait to leave and     find a better job          9.3     13.3    14.4     27.0      36.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CIBA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

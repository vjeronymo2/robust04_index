			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol June 1 TASS -- Naval officers and sailors  serving at the Black Sea Fleet base in the Crimean settlement of  Donuzlava filed a protest today against the planned transition  of the base to the Ukrainian Navy.    The written protest was handed over to Admiral Feliks  Gromov,  commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, who is now on an  inspection tour in the Crimea.    TASS has learnt that according to the document, over seven  thousand naval officers and sailors, servicemen of the base's  garrison, as well as their families will find themselves without  means of subsistence and will have to leave their homes looking  for new jobs and housing in case the base in Donuzlava is put  under the Ukrainian command. Moreover, the protesters are sure  the base and the settlment will inevitably fall into decay.    During the Moscow talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division  between Russia and Ukraine, the Donuzlava base was named among  possible locations of the Ukrainan share of the disputed fleet.</p>

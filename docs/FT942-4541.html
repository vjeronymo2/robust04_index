			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commission's aim on contracting out is clarification Sir, In his article, 'Government near victory on contracting-out reform' (May 31), David Goodhart seems to have swallowed a heavy dose of Department of Employment propaganda in arguing that the UK government is 'near victory' in securing the exclusion of contracting out from the EU Acquired Rights directive (Tupe). Although the government has been lobbying vigorously in Brussels for an amendment to this effect, the revisions proposed by the Commission are not geared to any such objective. Indeed, the Commission's purpose in revising the 1977 directive is not to reduce the protections that it provides, but to clarify its operation. The new definition of a transfer set out in Article 1 does not exclude contracting out. It simply codifies recent decisions of the European Court of Justice in the leading cases of Sophie Redmond, Spijkers, and Schmidt, among others. In each of those cases the ECJ explained that the key test of whether a transfer had taken place was whether an economic entity which had retained its identity had been transferred. Identical words are to be found in the new Article 1 of the 1977 directive. It is also worth noting that both the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry have been consulted on the most recent proposal from the Commission through their European organisations, the ETUC and UNICE. We would not have been happy with a text which reduced the existing protections, and in my view there is nothing in the new Article 1 which will cause difficulties for the trade union movement. The revision does have several further stages to go through before it is finally adopted, and it therefore seems premature to suggest that the government is 'near victory'. Far from indicating that the EU 'is moving to accommodate the UK's deregulatory approach' the proposed revision of the directive demonstrates the Commission's determination to defend high standards of social protection against sustained ideological assault. Nor is it the case that the amended directive will assist the government at national level. The controversy surrounding the application of the directive and Tupe 1981 to compulsory competitive tendering and market testing looks set to continue. However, with each new decision of the UK courts and the ECJ it is becoming clearer that most forms of competition in public services are caught by both Tupe and the directive.

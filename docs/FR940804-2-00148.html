Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to achieve a certain degree of transparency in the municipal securities market in a cost-effective manner by collecting and disseminating information on inter-dealer transactions. Under the proposed rule change, aggregate data about market activity and certain volume and price information about frequently traded securities would be disseminated to promote investor confidence in the market and its pricing mechanisms. In addition, all transaction information collected would be made available to regulatory agencies responsible for enforcement of Board rules as a means to assist in the inspection for compliance with, and the enforcement of, Board rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is a first step to increase transparency in the municipal securities market. After gaining experience with the collection and dissemination of inter-dealer transactions, the Board's future steps would include adding institutional and retail customer information, and moving toward the ultimate goal of making available transaction information that is both comprehensive and contemporaneous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The municipal securities market has grown dramatically in recent years. At the same time, retail investors have entered the market in increasing numbers. These factors have increased the need for access to information on municipal securities trading in the market, including information which may help to establish more accurate valuation of individual municipal securities. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Recognizing this need, the Board has adopted long-term goals and priorities for action, among which is the goal of providing market participants with more information about the value of securities. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a more general discussion of the evolution of the municipal securities market,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  MSRB, Report of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on Regulation of the Municipal Securities Market (September 1993), at 19&hyph;27. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``From the Chairman,'' MSRB Reports, Vol. 8, No. 5 (December 1988), at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the staff of the Division of Market Regulation of the Commission has stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Staff believes that the degree of transparency in the municipal securities market is not adequate, and should be increased to better inform investors in their dealings with broker-dealers and to make the market more efficient. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SEC, Division of Market Regulation, Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market (September 1993) (``Staff Report''), at 36. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

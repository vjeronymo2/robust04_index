			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS FIND THE RANGE QUICKLY IN 115-66 WIN  </P> <P> East Tennessee State came to Pauley Pavilion Friday night with enough  credentials to pull off an upset of UCLA. But such prospects essentially  disappeared soon after the opening tip-off.  </P> <P> The 16th-ranked Bruins controlled the nonconference game from start to finish  and were never threatened in a 115-66 victory in front of 7,466.  </P> <P> This came against a team that less than two weeks ago defeated North Carolina  State by 10 points, at Raleigh, N.C. A team that, after finishing fourth last  season in the Southern Conference, won its postseason tournament and took a  20-point lead over Oklahoma in the first round of the NCAA tournament, only to  lose, 72-71.  </P> <P> But on Friday night, the Bruins, who have been known to squander a lead here  and there against teams with less talent than East Tennessee State, appeared  intent on finishing the decade on a positive note.  </P> <P> "We aired everything out tonight," said the Bruins' Kevin Walker, who quickly  broke out of a slump by converting his first two shots -- both three-pointers  -- and finishing with 15 points and five rebounds.  </P> <P> "I was happy with the first (three-pointer), but even happier with the second.  Anyone can make one. I needed both." said Walker, who credited a pregame talk  with UCLA Coach Jim Harrick for his breaking out of a slump.  </P> <P> Walker was one of seven Bruins in double figures.  </P> <P> True, the Buccaneers had just returned from a Hawaiian holiday, which included  three games in the Chaminade tournament over Christmas weekend.  </P> <P> The Bruins had struggled to defeat Fresno State on Wednesday night. But Friday,  they achieved their most lopsided victory of the season.  </P> <P> "They're a talented team, but one that's been on the road for two weeks,"  Harrick said. "I would be dying to get home."  </P> <P> Leading by 19 at halftime, UCLA kept the Buccaneers at bay the rest of the  game, forcing 23 turnovers and keeping the pressure on East Tennessee State's  outside shooters.  </P> <P> Largely because of that pressure applied by Trevor Wilson, the Buccaneers'  leading scorer, Calvin Talford, was held to 11 points. He had been averaging  17.6.  </P> <P> Center Greg Dennis led the Buccaneers (8-3) with 21 points.  </P> <P> Don MacLean continued his hot hand, leading the Bruins (8-1) with 21 points.  Tracy Murray finished with 14, while Trevor Wilson, Darrick Martin and Mitchell  Butler had 13 apiece. Wilson, UCLA's leading scorer until Friday night, played  only 26 minutes and had seven rebounds and eight assists.  </P> <P> MacLean and Wilson got the Bruins started offensively, teaming to open a 9-0  lead before Alvin West scored the Buccaneers' first basket 2:08 into the game.  </P> <P> The Bruin defense, meanwhile, kept the pressure on East Tennessee.  </P> <P> The Bruins opened a 30-12 lead before four different Buccaneers scored  consecutive baskets -- including a three-point shot by Talford -- to cut the  deficit to nine with 8:30 remaining.  </P> <P> Murray, who had been outstanding in recent games, stole an inbounds pass and  Keith Owens dunked the ball to spark the Bruins again. Murray played 10 minutes  in the first half, scoring just four points but grabbing four rebounds.  </P> <P> Walker was six of eight from the floor in the first half, including three  three-pointers.  </P> <P> MacLean, who was 25 for 43 in the Bruins' previous three games, was six of 12  in the first half, scoring 13 points. MacLean leads the Bruins in scoring with  a 19.8-point average.  </P> <P> The Bruins led by 15 with 5:60 left and didn't let up as they shot 57.5% in  building a 57-36 halftime lead. The Bruins finished the game shooting 60%.  </P> <P> Said Harrick: "I'm really glad we had some fun. Every game has been a nail  biter for the coaching staff."  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Reserve guard Kevin Williams did not suit up Friday night because he has flu. .  . . Tracy Murray has scored in double figures in his last five games. . . .  UCLA has shot better than 50% in each of its last five games after shooting  less than 45% in each of the first four. . . . The Bruins' 8-1 start is their  best since 1983-84 when they opened with a 10-1 record. . . . The Bruins' 60%  shooting was a season best. The previous best was 54.2% Wednesday night against  Fresno State. The Bruins are shooting 49.6% as a team. . . . The Bruins' 115  points is the most since the opening game of the 1987-88 season, when they  defeated Oral Roberts University, 119-79. . . . UCLA junior Keith Owens scored  a career-high 10 points.  </P> <P> Kevin Walker had been one for 16 on three pointers. He hit all three Friday  night. Walker had only 24 points through the first eight games. Said Coach Jim  Harrick: "He was trying too hard and that's really it. I wanted to keep  starting him because of what's coming up." . . . Trevor Wilson is the No. 10  career scorer in Bruin history with 1,406. He surpassed Walt Hazzard, who  scored 1,401.  </P> <P> Guard Jeff Bronner, who has been a member of the UCLA team since last season,  has accepted a scholarship to UC Riverside and will transfer next week. He will  have two years eligibility remaining.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Billericay slumbers on BILLERICAY Constitutional Club slumbered on as the four o'clock confidence vote drew nearer, Rachel Johnson writes. Pork chops with apple sauce, the day's very British special, had gone down a treat and the two dozen or so Friday afternoon regulars had turned to playing cribbage and watching cricket. Mrs Teresa Gorman's Essex Tories, once branded Maggie's militant tendency, knew the outcome of the vote when they saw Mr Bill Cash, one of the Euro-rebel leaders, throw in the towel on the lunchtime news. 'It's over]' shouted Mrs Mandy Almond, vice-president of the Billericay Conservative Association. 'Bill's supporting] There won't be a general election]' Mrs Gorman, who had earlier that day announced that Mr John Major's confidence motion had 'got the party by its goolies', was saved. A fleeting rumour that she had voted against the government was scotched. Though the Billericay Tories fully supported Mrs Gorman's anti-Maastricht campaign, they were against any vote that might have brought down the government. And this from some of the staunchest anti-Europeans in the party. 'I will take my objections to loss of sovereignty to the French and the Germans to my deathbed,' said Mr Ronald Turner, association president. 'Sometimes Teresa uses unladylike language but her sentiments are true,' he added. 'She's very popular here, very bubbly.' Billericay is the sort of place where Tories do not hesitate to describe themselves as very - if not extremely - right wing. The last thing they want is a general election at a time when the Conservative party is tearing itself apart. Vote won, it was back to cribbage and cricket. Mrs Gorman's loyalists were relieved that their MP, and the government, were more secure. But the bitterness over Maastricht remained as deep as ever. 'I'm not European. I'm not even British. I'm English,' said Mr Bill Lee, a Tory councillor. 'And if God had intended us to be part of Europe he wouldn't have put the Channel where he did.' At the Billericay Constitutional Club, Europe will be the cause of more Friday afternoon indigestion in the years to come.</p>

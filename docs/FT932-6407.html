			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Rite of passage for sheltered youth: Shifting economic pressures are forcing Korea to modify its growth strategies On the face of it, the South Korean phenomenon flatly contradicts the idea that the markets know best. In the period 1980-91, the Korean economy grew by 10 per cent a year. The driving force was the expansion of heavy industry, which in turn was the product of state planning on a gigantic scale. Korea can now boast the world's biggest steel mill, car plant, shipyard and TV factory. If this has a Stalinist ring to it, there are two striking differences. None of these ventures is state-owned, and all of them make money. But the Korean model seems to be in trouble. An essential element of policy under the old military regime was to screw down wages as a means of promoting exports. In the late 1980s the regime started to lose its grip, and the lid blew off. In the past five years, industrial wages have gone up by some 130 per cent. Meanwhile, the world recession has halved Korea's growth rate. The country is now in a jam. It is no longer cheap enough to compete with an emerging giant such as China, but lacking the technology to take on Japan or the US. This is a situation which old-style planning cannot easily address. To attract the technology its industry needs, Korea must relax its traditional hostility to foreigners, the Japanese in particular. It must open its markets, allow foreign control of its companies and modernise its primitive financial system. In other words, it must abandon the conditions which made planning possible in the first place. The old system also had one serious side-effect - it brought forth monsters, in the shape of Korea's giant conglomerates, or chaebol. These groups - Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and the rest - have some remarkable achievements to their credit. But for many Koreans, they have become symbols of corruption and economic inefficiency. Their business strategies, such as duplicating each others' efforts in cars or petrochemicals, are condemned by government officials as wasteful and egotistical. But in many cases they are also a rational response to market distortions caused by the planning process itself. In discussing where to go from here, Korean officialdom betrays a certain inconsistency. Last month the trade and industry minister, Mr Kim Chul-Su, assured foreign journalists that the government had no intention of targeting specific industries. At the same time, he added, there were 15 industries which it wanted to strengthen in the next few years. Again, while it is essential for Korea to develop its own technology, government economists insist that old-style methods will not be used to get there. But the Ministry of Finance has a list of 11 specific technologies in which it wants the country to be self-sufficient by 2010. 'There is an apparent internal contradiction in our industrial policy,' says Mr Young Soogil, a senior member of the government's Economic Planning Board. 'But that simply shows we're at a loss on what to do.' In formal terms, he explains, the government stopped picking sectors as long ago as 1985, when it switched to a so-called generic approach. In theory, this meant the government would confine itself to working on technological development and the industrial structure. 'But the recent economic slowdown,' says Mr Young, 'has led Koreans - rightly or wrongly - to question the wisdom of that. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy has been arguing that we should combine a sectoral approach with the generic approach. The Economic Planning Board has been resisting that.' All this is being hammered out in the context of the latest five-year plan, in itself a quaintly old-fashioned concept. 'The plan we're working on,' Mr Young says, 'emphasises a stronger role for technology, the development of small-to-medium companies, the supply of a trained workforce and the supply of industrial land, which has been in acute shortage in recent years. We're also working on the infrastructure, such as highways and the information industry.' The planners are also debating what should be done at the micro level. 'Again, the emphasis is on technology, and on technology-oriented industries such as semiconductors. The government would like to orchestrate industry-wide efforts on bottleneck technologies and core components, in which we're very reliant on Japan. And in declining industries such as shoes and textiles, the government has been helping firms shrink and diversify,' says Mr Young. If a list like that represents the laisser-faire wing of the debate, one has to conclude that the old planning tradition still has some life in it. But perhaps the most pressing issue for the planners is the chaebol. Although privately owned and managed, these groups are in a sense government creations, having been loaded with subsidies and special treatment over the years as the chosen vehicles for industrial policy. 'The chaebol issue involves two problems,' says Mr Sakong Il, a former Korean finance minister. 'One is legitimacy. People get emotional because they think the chaebol accumulated their assets by very undesirable means - by government subsidies or real estate speculation. That has to do with the process. The other problem has to do with the result of that process, which is the economic concentration of power. 'Looked at that way, the policy prescription is very clear. Get rid of illegitimate ways of making money, and you ensure future legitimacy. As for concentration of power, that can be taken care of by strengthening antitrust legislation,' says Mr Sakong. The question is how realistic this is. The new president, Mr Kim Young-Sam, has little reason to favour the chaebol, if only because the boss of Hyundai stood against him in last year's election. But, according to a western diplomat: 'The government talks of free-market ideas, but as soon as the chaebol object it backs down. The longer we wait, the less prospect there is of reform. While the government is preparing its strategy, so are the chaebol.' The broader issue of free markets is neatly illustrated by what is officially known as Korea's import diversification policy. This is a simple ban on all Japanese imports of some 30 products, the most important being cars. The memory of 35 years of Japanese occupation runs deep in Korea. 'For historical and psychological reasons,' says Mr Young, 'the feeling is that if we removed these restrictions, the dependence on Japan would become absolute. That's regarded as politically unacceptable.' As an aggressive exporter, Korea can plainly not maintain trade barriers forever. Dismantling them completely, however, would cause uproar. The car industry, for instance, is ludicrously overcrowded, with seven domestic competitors and others waiting to join. Agriculture and banking are in an even worse state. 'They have no competitive position at all,' Mr Young says. 'If they were exposed to foreign competitors, they would collapse.' But if the Korean miracle is fading slightly, it cannot yet be written off. Korea's industrial giants may have had a sheltered youth, but the best of them are now robust enough to tackle world markets head on. In 1985 the founder of Samsung decided to branch out into semiconductors. His executives, as they are now happy to tell you, thought he was mad. Samsung has since overtaken the Japanese as the biggest producer of basic memory chips, and is making money while the Japanese semiconductor makers are losing. Planned or unplanned, Korean industry deserves watching.</p>

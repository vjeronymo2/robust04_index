			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FULLBACK BYRNES ASSUMES NEW ROLE  </P> <P> Handing Tim Byrnes a playbook this season was like handing him a pink slip.  </P> <P> Byrnes put in his time at fullback for four years, redshirting his freshman  year and dutifully playing his part the next three. He had an 84-yard game once  during his junior season, but everything was building toward this, his senior  season.  </P> <P> Instead, Byrnes was out of a job. Cal State Fullerton was going to a one-back  offense, and there was no question who the one back would be -- Mike Pringle.  </P> <P> In the Titans' opener, Byrnes carried the ball twice. Seven games into the  season, he has four carries for a net yardage of zero.  </P> <P> It is not the stuff of a running back's idle imaginings, nor was it the way  Coach Gene Murphy wanted Byrnes to spend his final days as a Titan.  </P> <P> "You look at your depth chart and you see who your winners are," Murphy said.  "You've got to get him on the field."  </P> <P> But what is there to do with a 5-foot-11, 215-pound fullback who has been  rendered obsolete by a new offense?  </P> <P> Murphy has made him a tight end -- a 5-foot-11 tight end. Not exactly in the  tradition of Jim Thornton, the 6-foot-3 former Titan who plays for the Chicago  Bears, nor even in that of 6-foot-6 Bill Brennan, Fullerton's other tight end  this season.  </P> <P> Not, frankly, in the tradition of many tight ends outside of high schools and  small colleges.  </P> <P> "I'm probably the shortest tight end in college football," Byrnes said.  </P> <P> To the pleasure of both Byrnes and Murphy, it has worked.  </P> <P> "It's not the particular position I'd like to play, but as long as I'm playing,  that's what matters," Byrnes said. "At first, I was looking forward to carrying  the ball, looking forward to getting the yards. Then reality set in. . . .  After the first game I figured, hey, I can't just stand here all year,  especially after three years of playing."  </P> <P> Brennan, the starter in the first game of the season, suffered a hip pointer in  that game and was unavailable for the next.  </P> <P> Byrnes got the call.  </P> <P> "You don't put a kid who played linebacker and fullback (in high school) at  tight end," Murphy said.  </P> <P> But that's what he did.  </P> <P> Now the Titans have a tight end combination that can give defenses fits.  </P> <P> With Byrnes, they have a tight end who can run with the ball once he catches  it, a tight end who can go in motion and become the lead blocker for Pringle.  </P> <P> With Brennan, they have a lanky fellow who says his favorite sport was always  basketball anyway, and who when covered simply signals quarterback Dan Speltz  to throw the ball high.  </P> <P> Speltz lobs it, and Brennan makes defensive backs look as if they are little  kids who want something off a high shelf -- even when they jump, the ball is  just beyond their reach and just within Brennan's.  </P> <P> On Saturday against Pacific, Speltz went to Brennan, who finished with four  catches for 74 yards.  </P> <P> Brennan has lost some playing time to Byrnes, but he isn't complaining.  </P> <P> "I'm glad he's doing well," Brennan said. "If we're getting the job done, we're  doing all right."  </P> <P> Pringle's career-high 242-yard rushing, five-touchdown performance against  Pacific not only earned him Big West Conference offensive player of the week  honors, but also got him named national offensive player of the week by The  Sporting News.  </P> <P> Pringle had 290 all-purpose yards and remains first in the nation in  all-purpose running at 231.7 yards a game. San Jose State's Sheldon Canley, who  is second, trails by 19 yards. Pringle is eighth in the NCAA in rushing (124  yards a game) and third in scoring (12 points a game).  </P> <P> With 867 rushing yards this season, he needs only 133 to become the fourth  Titan to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Obie Graves gained 1,789 yards in  1978; Rick Calhoun 1,398 in '86, and Dwayne Sims 1,071 in '73.  </P> <P> Murphy was still irritated with the starters on Monday for allowing Pacific to  make a close game out of what was once a 28-point Fullerton lead.  </P> <P> Fullerton finished with a 35-26 victory only after recovering an onside kick  and running out the final 1:40.  </P> <P> "The unfortunate thing is we have other football players who practice hard all  year and don't get to play because other players do stupid, dumb things,"  Murphy said.  </P> <P> Fullerton (3-3-1 overall, 2-1 in the Big West) plays undefeated Fresno State in  Fresno Saturday, taking on a team with a 13-game winning streak, second-longest  to Notre Dame's 18 among Division I teams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Both basketball teams have begun practice, with both preparing for  regular-season openers Nov. 24 at Titan Gym. The men play Lamar and the women  Weber State. . . . The soccer team (8-5-1) plays host to UC Santa Barbara on  Friday in its final home match of the season.  </P></p>

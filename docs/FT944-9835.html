			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Multiplied pianos - David Murray attunes to a strong commercial pitch Why should six pianists want to play six grand pianos all at once? Possible answer: because doing that, in the current musical climate, might be a nice little earner. It has novelty value on a grand scale (but portable, just, with friendly help from Steinways), and promises the kind of noisy excitement that early rock'n'roll - remember the hammered piano-triplets that used to go on through every song? - shared with the popular minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the 1950s and '60s. But is there any six-piano repertoire? Well, for a start there is Reich's Music for Six Pianos; and in fact that was where Piano Circus started. Having come together to perform it, they found the experience rewarding both in personal satisfaction and in audience-response. Soon they were commissioning new works for their sextet, and adaptations for 528 piano-keys of other recent music, and they have expanded naturally into added electronics. Their preferred composers are interested in what a team of pianos can achieve best: not subtle nuances or timbrel contrasts, but tingling articulacy, contrapuntal elaboration and rhythmic acuity, in or out of phase as composers dictate. Last week they displayed their range in four well-planned concerts at The Place, along with the results of some 'dance-workshops' with Kingsway College. The Place - primarily a dance-venue - proved to be an ideal place for Piano Circus too. Big enough to let the giant rosette of pianos look impressive (slick lighting by Jo Joelson: they go in for pop-style effects, like the Kronos Quartet), airy enough for their fullest sound without cramping it nor letting it become oppressive or strident; but not so big as to reduce the individual players to faceless mechanics. In these happy circumstances they sounded very good indeed. Their collective address is vital and alert. Each plays up to and with the others, and nobody lacks his or her own dramatic instinct. (Their make-up is of course PC, three of each sex - though I fancied that their roles were sometimes assigned on grounds of gender and physical strength.) The concert I heard comprised Louis Andriessen's De Staat ('The Republic', after Plato), adapted from a score that deploys a far greater variety of instruments, and Graham Fitkin's purpose-written triptych Loud, Line and Log. In Andriessen, energy and rhetoric had to do duty for the original colour-contrasts, but at the hands of these players they really did. The Fitkin pieces, which keep a friendly toe-hold in jazz and sophisticated pop, exploit the unique medium in any number of ways, intricately and with lush resource. 'Conservative' they may be, by austere modernist standards; but the keen invention would grab any honest musical ear, and Piano Circus revelled in it.</p>

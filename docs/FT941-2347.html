			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / EU clears way for Sofia loans EU finance ministers yesterday agreed to a Ecu110m (Pounds 83m) balance of payments loan to Bulgaria. The agreement paves the way for the release of a Dollars 600m (Pounds 411m) IMF and World Bank package to help the Sofia government reschedule its Dollars 9.3bn debt to commercial banks. Ministers held back a further Ecu40m in the hope that a disbursement of Ecu150m will be matched by other members of the Group of 24 nations, including Japan and other OECD countries. Without G24 support, Bulgarian officials have warned that Sofia would have to renegotiate a new package with the IMF and World Bank. Foreign financing is needed so that Bulgaria can meet a June 30 deadline for rescheduling its commercial debt. The IMF is providing stand-by loans and funds of Dollars 400m, with the World Bank providing Dollars 200m. Finance ministers agreed to delay offering further macroeconomic aid to Romania until later this year under the German presidency of the EU. 'The (reform) situation is not yet ripe,' said one official.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Observer: Flattering philately Calling all philatelists. Watch out for a special issue from Italy on November 21 which could be very short-lived. The Berlusconi government, as if it didn't have bigger problems on its hands, has now approved a new stamp depicting the philosopher Giovanni Gentile. Nothing wrong in that, surely? Except that Gentile was hardly a gentle spirit. In fact, he joined Benito Mussolini's fascist party, serving as minister of education between 1922-24, eventually being murdered in 1944. The stamp was ordered by the neo-fascist minister of post and communications, Giuseppe Tatarella. Not surprisingly, the Italian Federation of Partisan Associations and the National Association of Italian Partisans have asked the ministry to withdraw the stamp. Gentile would no doubt have loved all the fuss. An idealist philosopher, he denied the existence of individual minds and of any distinction between past and present. QED, eh?</p>

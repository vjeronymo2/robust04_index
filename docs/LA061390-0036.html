			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC CONGESTION  </P> <P> The article "On a Highway to Nowhere" (Commentary, May 21) does a grave  disservice to government and industry partners who are willing to try a  technical solution to a severe social problem, traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The article was inaccurate: It will not cost $80,000 per auto.  </P> <P> The $8 million allocated to the smart car project in Orlando will not only  include 100 specially equipped cars, but also new traffic surveillance systems,  a beefed-up traffic management center and instrumented intersections, and  improved motorist information systems that will benefit all Floridians.  </P> <P> Also, we never said "smart cars" were the only answer. But the alternatives --  building more roads, moving employees closer to their workplace or regulating  the vehicle miles traveled -- aren't exactly met with open arms.  </P> <P> At General Motors, we're willing to invest some of our own money and  engineering know-how to try smart car projects in hopes of improving the  motoring experience for all.  </P> <P> MOUNIR M. KAMAL  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> General Motors Corp.  </P> <P> Warren, Mich.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "js": "Workers Have Their Own Party; Civic </F> Association Transformed Into Political Party"]    [Text] Banska Bystrica--The Association of the Workers of  Slovakia [Zdruzenie robotnikov Slovenska, ZRS] will contest the  early parliamentary elections as an independent representative  of the most numerous social layer of the population--workers and  farmers. This was announced by ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy  to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of  the Democratic Left [SDL], in Banska Bystrica on Saturday [12  March], immediately after delegates to the Third ZRS Assembly  approved, by an absolute majority of votes, the transformation  of the ZRS, which has until now been a civic association, into a  political party.    The delegates confirmed Jan Luptak as chairman of this new  left-wing party, which has 13,000 members. Jan Luptak stressed  that, in a public opinion survey, as many as 85 percent of 1,264  respondents said that they would support the ZRS with their vote  in the coming parliamentary elections. According to Luptak,  this optimistic election forecast is based on the fact that  workers' interests have so far been represented by political  parties only haphazardly and expediently, whereas the ZRS bases  its program on a systematic solution to the problems of people  who are the greatest victims of economic reform. After the  elections, the new political party intends to cooperate with the  SDL and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS] and  plans, among other issues, to initiate changes to legislation  that is, in the opinion of the ZRS, directed against workers.  This concerns, in particular, the Labor Code and the Law on  Wages and Supplementary Payments. Within a short period of  time, the party will address its potential voters by its own  weekly--HLAS ROBOTNIKOV [Workers' Voice]. Both the editorial  staff and the ZRS central bodies will be headquartered in Banska  Bystrica.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 14 March on page 2  carries a 300-word TA SR report on the ZRS congress, which  specifies that the "public opinion poll" referred to by Jan  Luptak was organized by the ZRS itself and that it was conducted  "chiefly among blue-collar workers."]</p>

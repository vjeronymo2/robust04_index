			<p>BFN     [Text] Atay Ahmet Rasit, minister of foreign affairs and  defense, has urged the UN authorities to stop the Greek Cypriots  from taking steps that will lead the negotiation process to a  dead end.    In a written statement issued today, Rasit charged that the  Greek Cypriot Administration first stepped up its arms buildup  within the framework of the Turkish-Greek joint defense doctrine  and increased its number of troops. Now, he added, the Greek  Cypriots are amassing troops along the borders and reinforcing  their positions.    Rasit stated that the Greek Cypriot Administration which is  leading the negotiations to an impasse is trying to divert the  world's attention by accusing the Turkish Cypriot side. The  aim, Rasit said, is to get rid of the confidence-building  measures which the Greek Cypriots claim are no longer  meaningful, and to ensure that the UN Security Council passes a  resolution accusing the Turkish Cypriot side.    The minister of foreign affairs and defense called on the UN  authorities to hold discussions with the Greek Cypriot officials  as soon as possible, to prevent the tension being deliberately  escalated by the Greek Cypriots from causing a confrontation, at  this critical stage of the proximity talks.</p>

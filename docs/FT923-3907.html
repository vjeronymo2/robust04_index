			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Yeltsin delays long-awaited trip to Japan PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday called off a long-awaited trip to Japan just four days before the visit was due to have started. Mr Yeltsin told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday morning that he had to delay the talks because of various 'domestic problems'. A Japanese spokesman said Tokyo regretted the postponement of a meeting which could 'have marked a new step in relations'. Mr Yeltsin also postponed a visit to South Korea which was to have followed the Japanese trip. The 'postponement' of the visit may, on the face of it, have been inspired by a wish on Mr Yeltsin's part to avoid a failure to achieve progress in a bitter territorial dispute over the Kurile islands which has dogged the two nations since 1945. Tokyo is demanding the return of four small islands off the Japanese northern coast that were seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japan has refused to consider large-scale economic aid to the Russians in the absence of substantial progress in negotiations over the islands. Mr Yeltsin has also been under pressure from nationalists at home demanding that Russia retains sovereignty over the territory. It was feared in Tokyo that if Mr Yeltsin were unable to make substantial concessions during the planned visit, relations between the two countries could deteriorate further. The assumption in Tokyo was that the visit was cancelled because of the intractability of the dispute. The Russians had accused the Japanese of inflexibility, but the Japanese government believed it had substantially softened its position earlier this year. Until May the Japanese official position was to demand immediate reversion of the islands to Japanese control, but this was changed to a demand that Russia merely recognise Japanese sovereignty over the islands, with details for reversion to be negotiated. A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said yesterday the issue was so politically sensitive that the Japanese cabinet could not survive if it extended large-scale aid to Russia without first solving the dispute. This position was made clear to the Russians during a recent visit to Moscow by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister. The postponement of Mr Yeltsin's trip sends a signal to Japan that there are limits to how much Moscow can concede in its bid to win billions of dollars in economic assistance. But it could make a solution far more difficult. Dr Viktor Rosin, an expert at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said the dispute with Japan could affect Russia's policy towards the rest of the world. The visit had offered Russia an opportunity to finally turn its back on its old-style foreign policy and confirm its 'active involvement in the world community'. This opportunity had been thrown away. Mr Yeltsin may also have given ammunition to his critics. Having scented blood on this issue, conservatives, joined by democrats turned ardent nationalists, would find other opportunities to demand changes in other areas of both foreign and domestic policy. A great economic opportunity for Russia may also be at risk. Although Russian leaders today have fewer illusions about the value of outside help, the task of switching to a market economy will be more difficult without substantial financial transfers from one of the few western powers with cash to spare. Japan also has a powerful voice in international gatherings, such as the Group of Seven, which is trying to co-ordinate assistance for Russian reforms, in particular a response to requests for a debt rescheduling.</p>

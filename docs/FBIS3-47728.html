Deng Nan, who is on a visit to Thailand, made the above  remarks during a meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri. Prasong agreed with Deng Nan's views.    Deng Nan said that the Joint Chinese-Thai Scientific and  Technological Commission has held 12 meetings since its  establishment. Technological cooperation and exchange items  carried out by the two countries have achieved remarkable  success.    She said that China and Thailand have their own strong  points  in the field of science and technology. They should strengthen  cooperation in this area. She hoped that the two countries will  further strengthen their cooperation in the fields of high and  new science and technology and in applied science and  technology, which will be beneficial to the economic development  of both countries.    "China carries out scientific and technological cooperation  not only with developed countries, but also with developing  countries," Deng Nan said.    During a recent meeting of senior ASEAN officials in  Bangkok,  they agreed that ASEAN will expand its scientific and  technological cooperation with China this year.    Deng Nan is on a visit to ASEAN countries to strengthen  scientific and technological exchanges with ASEAN.    Prasong said that Thailand and other ASEAN countries are  willing to conduct further scientific and technological  cooperation with China. Prasong also asked Deng Nan to convey  his regards to Deng Xiaoping. He wished Deng Xiaoping good  health and a long life. He also expressed his hope that China,  under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's blueprint, will achieve  even greater success in national construction.    Deng Nan will call on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today.  Deng Pufang and Deng Lin, Deng Xiaoping's eldest son and eldest  daughter, also visited Thailand late last year.</p>

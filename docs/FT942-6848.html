			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (3): Population grows grey / A look at how Britain compares with the rest of Europe The UK population is growing. And, like that of much of western Europe, it is also greying. But while the increase in the pensioner population may cause problems in the middle of the 21st century, there is some good news in the shorter term. The number of people of working age (defined as men aged 16-64, and women aged 16-59) is still increasing, according to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. From around 35.5m in 1992, the working population is expected to increase to around 37.4m by 2011, while the overall UK population grows from just under 58m to 61.25m over the same period. The birth rate in the UK has edged up in recent years after the lows of the late 1970s and early 1980s; live births per 1,000 people were 13.5 in 1992, compared with an average of 12.9 in 1981-85. Nevertheless, the fertility rate is still below the replacement level of 2.1. Children were 25 per cent of the population in 1971, but are expected to be only 18 per cent in 2031. It is only a low death rate, as life expectancy marches ever upwards, that keeps the population growing. (Immigration plays a small part. The UK had a net inflow of 34,000 people in 1992.) The average male born in 1990 had a life expectancy of 73 years, compared with 67.9 years in 1961; female life expectancy grew from 73.8 to 78.5 years over the same period. The UK's population profile is not too bad in European terms. In terms of maintaining a future workforce, the key is the number of those aged 0-19 as a proportion of those people of working age. Here the champion is Ireland, which has more than one child for every person of working age, while the UK ranks seventh out of 17 countries surveyed by the OPCS in 1990-91. Bottom of the league is Germany, which has only one child for every three people of working age. The number of 16-year-olds joining the UK workforce has been steadily declining from a peak of 936,000 in 1981 and may have reached a trough of 628,000 in 1993. It is now expected to rise gently during the rest of the century. The UK does not rank quite so well on the greying factor. There were 39 people aged over 60 for every 100 of working age in 1990-91, the third highest total of the European nations studied. (Sweden was the greyest with 43 people over 60 for every 100 of working age.) According to the OPCS, there were 8.93m people of pensionable age in England and Wales in 1981, 18 per cent of the total; by 1991, there were 9.45m, 18.5 per cent of the total. And within the ranks of the pensioners, the number of people aged over 75 increased from 2.93m (5.9 per cent of the total population) in 1981 to 3.62m (7.1 per cent) in 1991. The growing numbers of the elderly will undoubtedly create social costs (particularly in terms of health and pensions provision) which will probably be reflected in higher taxes for the working population. However, greying is a European-wide problem. About a fifth of the European Union's 320m citizens are aged over 60 (with 20m aged over 74). By 2010, the proportion of over-60s is projected to grow to 23 per cent and to 25 per cent by 2040. The only countries expected to have a pensioner population of less than 20 per cent in 2010 are Portugal and Ireland. Steps may be taken to alleviate potential problems by increasing the pensionable age. In the UK, the plan is for the retirement age for women to be increased to 65, to match that of men. This change will be phased in between the years 2010 and 2020. The effect, according to the OPCS, is that the number of pensioners in the UK will peak at 15.2m in 2038, compared with a total of 16.8m had the change not occurred. Within England, population rose in every region bar two between 1981 and 1991. The exceptions were the north and the north-west, which experienced a fall of 0.1 per cent per year. East Anglia and the south-west saw the fastest growth rates, at 0.9 and 0.7 per cent a year respectively. In 1992, the English region with the highest proportion of people of working age was the south-east with 61.2 per cent (64.1 per cent in greater London itself). The region with the lowest proportion was the south-west, with 59.2 per cent. In terms of the future, the region with the highest proportion of those under 16 is the north-west, with 21.2 per cent, while the south-west is the lowest with 19.2 per cent. Looking at the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has a higher proportion of children than any English region, at 25.7 per cent, while Scotland beats all the English regions in terms of the proportion of people of working age, at 62 per cent. OPCS projections show that, in 2011, the south-east region will still have the lowest proportion of pensioners and the highest proportion of those of working age in England; the south-west will still be at the opposite end of the scale on both counts. The south-east will also have moved to top the scale in terms of the proportion of children. However, a study of migration flows shows that people have been leaving the south-east for the rest of England. In the five years between 1988 and 1992, the south-east experienced a net migration outflow to the rest of the UK of 206,000. In fact, all of that and more was a loss from greater London, which had an outflow of 250,000. The region which saw the biggest inflow was the south-west, which gained 119,000. The east midlands and East Anglia both gained, while the west midlands and the north-west were net losers. Within the UK as a whole, there has been a small migration from England to the other three countries. And there has been a steady shift away from cities towards more rural areas. Perhaps as the elderly retreat from the towns to retire to 'rural bliss', this trend will continue.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        UK population (thousands)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Mid-year              UK     England   Wales   Scotland   N Ireland figures  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1961*               52,807    43,561   2,635     5,184      1,427 1971*               55,928    46,412   2,740     5,236      1,540 1976*               56,216    46,660   2,799     5,233      1,524 1981*               56,352    46,821   2,813     5,180      1,538 1986*               56,850    47,342   2,820     5,121      1,567 1987*               57,008    47,488   2,833     5,112      1,575 1988*               57,159    47,633   2,854     5,094      1,578 1989*               57,352    47,809   2,869     5,091      1,583 1990*               57,561    47,992   2,878     5,102      1,589 1991*               57,801    48,208   2,891     5,107      1,594 1992*               57,998    48,378   2,899     5,111      1,610  of which, percentages  0-4                  6.7      6.7      6.6       6.4        8.0  5-15                13.7     13.5     14.0      13.7       17.7  16-44               42.0     42.0     39.6      42.6       42.1  45-64M/59F          19.3     19.3     19.8      19.5       17.2  65M/60F-74          11.4     11.3     12.6      11.5        9.8  75 and over          7.0      7.0      7.4       6.4        5.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Projections (based on mid-1992 population estimates) 1996                58,784    49,067   2,930     5,146      1,642 2001                59,800    50,023   2,966     5,143      1,667 2006                60,610    50,814   2,993     5,115      1,687 2111                61,257    51,458   3,013     5,077      1,709  of which, percentages  0-4                  5.7      5.8      5.6       5.5        6.7  5-15                13.5     13.5     12.9      13.6       15.3  16-44               37.4     37.5     35.9      36.2       39.7  45-64M/59F          23.6     23.6     23.2      24.5       21.2  65M/60F-74          12.0     11.9     13.4      12.4       10.7  75 and over          7.8      7.8      9.0       7.9        6.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *=Estimates  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Office of Population Censuses and Surveys  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

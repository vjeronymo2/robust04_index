			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Ariel Larramendi] </F>   [Text] The year is coming to a close and according to  political and government leaders: This has been the most  dangerous and difficult year we have ever faced in the history  of the Revolution. I think, and this is my personal opinion,  that the new year will not fail to be tense, dangerous at times,  and full of difficulties. However, we observe its arrival,  having gained something like a special-period culture. We sense  or know what are the traumatic aspects of the complex picture  ahead and, above all, see our goal more clearly. However, we  still have to more clearly define the paths to reach that goal.    The deadlines set by the power centers of the empire for the  collapse of the Cuban project have passed. Here we are. The  country has not become an anarchy, nor have centrifugal forces  prevailed. What prevailed is political tradition in the face of  so many highly diverse factors of disintegration; those having  to do with our economic ties abroad are already known, and those  generated by the domestic economic crisis we had to face.  However, here we are.    One of the challenges that I see in the new year is that of  participation, either that of labor groups in the management of  enterprises or that of citizens in general in the People's  Government bodies. Anyway, what is taking place in Cuba is a  participatory democracy. I believe that previously, the  participation of diverse sectors of the population in the  decision-making process was somewhat detached due to the state's  basically paternalistic, vertical relationship, which limited  the participation of the people in the process of defining and  solving problems.    What is being advocated now is basically a different  participation. The Cuban people need a readjustment of the  so-called pattern of accumulation, based on higher levels of  efficiency and the intensive use of our human and material  resources. In order to achieve this qualitative leap, the Cuban  people must increase their participation in a more conflicting  stage, and free of the state's paternalism. The state itself is  relinquishing its role as regulator in certain economic fields  and at the same time, the people's autonomy is increasing while  becoming more complex as the result of new ideas and performers  in the life of the country. This process, which is already  taking place and will continue to develop in the future, is  supported by a certain experience and knowledge. Nothing will  startle us. We will be here.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today made  it clear that Greece will proceed with removing the measures  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] only when the government of Kiro Gligorov  gives three practical signs of goodwill, that is, on the  symbols, border, and Constitution. The spokesman stressed that  the Greek Government's positions on the issue of Skopje, which  are known and firm, will be presented to UN mediator Cyrus Vance  on 11 April in Washington by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis,  director general of the Foreign Ministry.    Venizelos said that the EU's [European Union] decision to  refer Greece to the European Court of Justice undermines Vance's  initiative and encourages Gligorov's intransigence, something  that does not contribute to stability and security in the  region. The government spokesman repeated that the EU  Commission's decision violates the Union's solidarity and shows  its contradictory character, because it cannot recognize the  political character of Greece's countermeasures and pursue a  diplomatic initiative with Dutch Commissioner Hans van den Broek  on the one hand, and decide to follow the judicial route on the  other. The positive aspect that the Greek Government has  recognized in yesterday's decision, Venizelos concluded, is that  the European Union calls on Skopje to change its flag and amend  its constitution.</p>

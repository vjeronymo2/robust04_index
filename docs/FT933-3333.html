			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark down on profit-taking THE D-MARK yesterday lost some of the ground it had made against the dollar and European currencies in recent days, as dealers took profits, writes James Blitz. The German currency's move down yesterday was sharp. It lost nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the dollar to close at DM1.6110. Against the French franc it fell about 3 centimes to FFr3.482. However, few analysts believe there has been any significant change to the market's view that the D-Mark is set on the path of short term appreciation. Yesterday's move against the dollar was accompanied by no new data in the US. Instead, several dealers said they had taken profits after the recent powerful D-Mark moves in currency markets. 'These moves do not in any way change our short term views about a strong D-Mark,' said Mr Marc Hendriks, head of international interest rate research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. 'There is some substantial economic data coming up this week, and traders have just been clearing out their positions before that.' The D-Mark's weakness was felt across the board in Europe. The Danish krone strengthened to close at around DKr4.10 to the D-Mark, while the peseta broke through the Pta80 level, closing at Pta79.28 from a previous Pta80.89. Most striking of all were the appreciations in the Belgian franc and Portuguese escudo, both of whose central banks cut interest rates. The Belgian franc finished at BFr21.23 from a previous BFr21.47 and the Escudo at Es101.58 from a previous Es102.38. Sterling was one of the few currencies to lose more ground against the D-Mark, in spite of data showing that the prices of finished manufactured goods in the UK had nudged only marginally higher in August. Dealers suggested that sterling may have suffered from the continuing need of European central banks to acquire D-Marks for pounds so that they can pay the Bundesbank for recent intervention. Sterling closed at DM2.4750, down 1/4 pfennig on the day. Yesterday's move in the dollar/D-Mark rate was echoed by another strong performance from the dollar against the yen. The US currency closed at Y106.25, up from Y104.75. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6077 and Y106.25. Dealers continue to think that the yen will be the focal point of this week's trading. Today brings the Japanese trade data for August. This should show a modest fall in the size of the surplus from the previous month: with a consensus forecast of a Dollars 7.0bn surplus from a previous Dollars 11.8bn. If the surplus is even smaller it could add to downward pressure on the yen. All eyes are also focused on the economic stimulus package due to be unveiled in Japan on Thursday. A significant stimulus appears to have been well priced in by dealers, as has some easing in rates.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices The pepper market has been quiet, mainly because of the absence of buying interest from grinder, reports Man Producten. Consequently white pepper prices came under increased selling pressure. In comparison with a fortnight ago prices declined by 4 to 5 per cent, reaching about USDollars 2,700 a tonne, cif, for Apl/May shipment and Dollars 2,600 for July/August shipment (ex-new crop). Black pepper prices, in contrast, remained steady, though here too demand remained below normal. However most origins showed little or no in cutting prices . Black pepper grade 1 was offered at Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,650 a tonne, cif.</p>

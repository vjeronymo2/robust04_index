			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazbek Gostiyev, chairman of the board of the </F> North Ossetian Fund for the Restoration of National Traditions  and Customs: "Destined To Be Neighbors"]    [Text] The Ossetian-Ingush emergency zone is still in  a state of emergency. After taking a first-hand look at the  situation there, B.N. Yeltsin signed an edict "On the Procedure  For Returning Refugees and Victims of Forced Resettlement Within  the Territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush  Republic to Their Permanent Place of Residence." The edict  evoked conflicting reactions in the two republics.    In any case, one thing is clear: Until the causes of  the confrontation between the two republics have been eliminated  and public thinking has undergone radical changes, it will be  difficult to expect these measures to have the desired impact.  The tense atmosphere has to be defused, and all of the attempts  to do this have been clearly inadequate.  <H5>  From Hatred to Tolerance </H5>   In my opinion, there is a method of paving the way for the  peaceful resolution of the conflict.    The first condition would be the identification of the group  of individuals who have committed serious crimes that are  punishable by all standards of law and morality in any country.  This could turn out to be impossible, but as long as murderers  and warmongers are not governed by the criminal code of the  Russian Federation, genuine reconciliation will be out of the  question.    The second condition is the use of the ethical factor. It  consists in the wisdom of our people, who developed a procedure  long ago for the reconciliation of conflicting parties. In  essence, until the parties in a blood feud had reconciled, they  would have to live according to the Islamic common law of the  mountain people, with strict rules governing each step they  took, even going so far as to tell them which streets they could  use, which places they could visit, and which party would have  to yield the road to the other.    These strict rules of behavior in blood feuds attest to the  use of separation as the main deterrent. This was done because  feelings of rage and revenge were so strong that the feuding  parties would kill each other when they met. It was not until  after reconciliation that mediators and the close associates of  the feuding parties would begin establishing favorable  conditions (an art in itself) for communication, contacts,  "chance meetings," and other exchanges between the reconciled  parties. The process was accomplished one step at a time.    Our leaders would be completely justified in making use of  the priceless experience of past generations in big politics.    For the sake of peace and accord, we need compromises and  mutual concessions, and in this context it is extremely  important for one nationality to put itself in the other's  place, guided by the golden rule of morality: "Do unto others as  you would have them do unto you." In this context, I am  proposing a "program of emergence from crisis."  <H5>  The Reality Factor </H5>   The stream of unsubstantiated mutual accusations and  seething  passions are keeping the two nationalities from taking a sober  look at one another and realizing that they are both victims of  the totalitarian regime.    The Ingush people have to realize that the Ossetians did not  seize a single inch of Ingush land themselves. As for the  disputed rural communities in Prigorodnyy Rayon, they became  part of North Ossetia in 1944 by a decision of the government  officials of that time, who were demanding the settlement of  these territories. The people there now are third-generation  natives with no other homeland. Their forcible inclusion in the  Ingush Republic is a new act of violence, which cannot  contribute anything, to put it mildly, to the improvement of the  situation.    In short, it is impossible to ignore the historical  realities  that took shape in Prigorodnyy Rayon over the last 50 years,  irrespective of our wishes and opinions. These realities have  much more force than emotional outbursts and mercenary  interests, and the main one is the fact that the inhabitants of  Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of people of the Ingush  nationality, categorically oppose their annexation by another  republic. Their forced annexation would put us on the road to  war, with all of its tragic consequences.    Although I wish to retain an objective view of the actions  of  both sides, I would like to say that the Ossetians should  sympathize more with the suffering of the Ingush people, the  tragedy of their forcible eviction, and the difficulties of  returning to their historical homeland and settling down there.  This applies to the past and the present.    Tens of thousands of innocent families lost their homes and  livelihood. They are victims, not criminals: No one leaves his  home, and everything he has ever worked for, by choice. We  cannot call ourselves civilized if we are indifferent to the  suffering of people to whom we are related by a common history.    By the same token, it seems to me that the Ingush people  also  should be more careful in choosing their leaders. Ambitious  extremists and mafia elements have driven their people to the  verge of ruin. Their actions and appeals for the violent  resolution of the territorial dispute have been ruinous for  their innocent and unfortunate people.  <H5>  Renounce the Blood Feud </H5>   The art of public diplomacy consists in promoting the kind  of  situation in which mutual forgiveness lies at the basis of  reconciliation. The reconciliation of the parties in the blood  feud could breach the thinking of most people and help them move  from a state of mutual hatred to a recognition of the need to  live in peace. Whether we like it or not, we were chosen by God  and Destiny to live as neighbors. The sooner we realize this,  the quicker the process of resolution will be. We have to  finally admit that we have no other choice. The only alternative  is brutal confrontation and war.    There is still a good chance that reason will prevail and  that our people will find the road to peace and accord.    [Box]  <H5>  Program of Emergence From Crisis </H5>   1. A coordinating council, elected from among national and  religious authorities with the participation of official  government agencies, will set up reconciliation commissions in  the republics of Ingushetia and North Ossetia on the republic,  rayon, village, neighborhood, street, and building levels for  the reconciliation of the feuding parties and the families of  the deceased.    2. The reconciliation commissions in the republics of North  Ossetia and Ingushetia, in contrast to conciliation commissions,  must do the following:    a) compile absolutely precise lists of the names of  individuals who lost members of their families in the armed  conflict in October-November 1992;    b) conduct meetings with victims (those who lost family  members) in North Ossetia and in Ingushetia and, after  preliminary agreement on the terms of reconciliation, seek their  approval of a declaration of reconciliation between the two  nationalities and their refusal to persecute anyone for the  bloodshed;    c) elect authorized representatives of each side at meetings  of the reconciliation commissions in the republics of North  Ossetia and Ingushetia, with mediators from the Russian  Federation and the republics, krays, and oblasts of the North  Caucasus, and the possible participation of observers from the  international community if necessary;    d) conduct an official forum of authorized representatives,  who will sign a memorandum based on the decisions of the  reconciliation commissions at a joint meeting;    e) complete the reconciliation by organizing a  reconciliation  table, where both sides will take a sacred vow--orally, in  accordance with the customs of the Caucasus--to never resort to  the use of arms again in the settlement of disagreements,  reinforcing this commitment by shaking hands and calling upon  Almighty God and all of the saints as witnesses.    3. The process of the reconciliation of feuding parties will  not apply to those who treated their victims with brutality and  savagery.    4. An essential condition for the reconciliation of the  parties in a blood feud is the payment of blood money, taking  the form of financial compensation and emotional satisfaction.    5. During the reconciliation process, conciliation  commissions will also be working simultaneously on solutions to  two major problems:    a) the search for missing persons;    b) the return (sequential) of innocent victims to their  previous place of residence.</p>

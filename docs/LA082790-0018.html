			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> KAVAKOS BRINGS FIREWORKS TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL  </P> <P> The annual Tchaikovsky Spectacular at Hollywood Bowl is thoroughly familiar,  and everyone knows what familiarity breeds. But over the years the beloved old  pyromaniac's delight has also created the cheering expectation of musical  fireworks in the pre-intermission concerto spot.  </P> <P> Such anticipation was rewarded again in the latest enactment of the ritual,  courtesy of young Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos. In his Bowl debut, he  applied rousing sound, potent technique and an interpretation of occasionally  disconcerting eccentricity to the Violin Concerto.  </P> <P> Kavakos began slowly, with the odd mixture of deliberation and dreamy eloquence  that characterized his approach to the lyrical material. In the bravura  conflagrations he proved technically precise, but his phrasing and bowing were  sufficiently idiosyncratic to lose conductor Gerard Schwarz and the supporting  Seattle Symphony at times in the first movement.  </P> <P> In all, Kavakos produced a big-sounding, emotionally engaging performance.  Schwarz backed him with generally lithe, balanced and pertinently detailed  accompaniment.  </P> <P> Schwarz and his visiting orchestra had to themselves the familiar charms of the  Polonaise from "Eugene Onegin" and the "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy. The  Polonaise danced blithely enough, and the ensemble's lean, dark sound --  illuminated by gleaming brass -- and articulate rhythmicality projected much of  the drama of the tone poem. But Schwarz somehow left "Romeo and Juliet" overall  a prosaic, unconnected experience of surprisingly low energy.  </P> <P> In the increasingly anticlimactic "1812" Overture, Schwarz's company was  enlarged by the USC Trojan Band. The orchestra dispatched the introductory  solemnities with minimal rhetoric, and the assembled throng accompanied the  fireworks diligently. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

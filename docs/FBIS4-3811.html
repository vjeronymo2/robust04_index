			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- Work teams of personnel  transferred by the State Council from the relevant departments  to conduct a general inspection of commodity prices and  investments in fixed assets will soon depart for various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. A general  meeting of personnel of these two work teams was held today,  during which Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made a mobilization speech.    He said: The current economic situation in China is  generally good, with the national economy maintaining rapid and  sustained growth momentum. However, a number of contradictions  and problems remain in the economic life, and the most prominent  one is the excessive rise of market prices and escalating  inflationary pressures. The causes of inflation and price rises  are many. An overextended scale and chaotic management of  investments in fixed assets and failure to exercise  macroeconomic control and regulation over market prices  following the lifting of price control are two very important  factors. To step up the effort to solve problems existing in  the investment of fixed assets and in price control is a top  priority task for curbing inflation and checking excessive price  rises.    He said: The purpose of organizing the two work teams to  conduct general price and investment inspections in various  localities is to help them more effectively and comprehensively  implement the principles, policies, and measures formulated by  the party Central Committee and the State Council. To ensure  the success of the inspections is of great importance for  implementing the central authorities' guidelines on the overall  interests of this year's work, and for the accomplishment of the  various tasks in reform, opening up, and economic development.    Outlining the requirements for the general inspections, the  vice premier pointed out: Attention must be paid to the key  areas as well as inspection in general in both prices and fixed  asset investments. In order to obtain a thorough grasp of the  situation, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive checks in  line with the guidelines and requirements of the State Council's  relevant documents. The key areas of the general price  inspection are, first of all, wanton price hikes and frauds  against customers on basic daily necessities, grain and edible  oil in particular; second, activities of monopolizing various  trades to drive up prices and to obtain staggering profits from  major capital goods such as rolled steel, electricity, coal,  petroleum, and chemical fertilizers; and third, unauthorized  increases in public utility and service charges and collection  of fees without authorization. The general investment  inspection should be focused on strictly controlling newly  launched projects. Meanwhile, attention must be focused on the  source of funds for construction and on concentrating funds to  ensure key projects, including screening and inventory of  projects under construction as well as progress in suspending  and postponing projects; on the availability of funds for key  construction; and on the sources of self-collected funds and  whether such sources are legitimate.    He said: In conducting general inspections, the work teams  should go down to the grass roots to analyze typical cases,  obtain firsthand information, and solve deep-level problems.  They should reflect on things as they really are without  covering up or hiding contradictions and problems. They should  perform duties honestly, seek no personal privileges, and  observe party and state discipline. They should set a good  example in fighting corruption and promoting clean government,  and should work concertedly to ensure the success of inspection.  The State Council has instructed the State Planning Commission  to work together with the relevant departments in conducting the  general inspections.    It is understood that the leading group on general price  inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of  the State Planning Commission; deputy leader Luo Zhiling, vice  minister in charge of the planning commission; and members who  are senior officials from the planning commission, the  Ministries of Supervision and Finance, the People's Bank, and  the taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration,  and technology supervision departments. The leading group on  the investment inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua,  minister in charge of the planning commission; deputy leader Guo  Shuyan, vice minister in charge of the planning commission; and  members who are senior officials of the planning commission, the  State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance,  the People's Bank, the Ministry of Supervision, the National  Development Bank, and the State Statistics Bureau.</p>

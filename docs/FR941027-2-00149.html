			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we may request the project director of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you may also wish to include a trip or two to Washington, D.C. in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. What happens during negotiations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. How do I provide an assurance? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' which must be completed, simply state in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Where can copies of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , a program's regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, most can be obtained from the Government Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] Britain today issued a stern warning to Iran that it  must have no contact with the IRA. Iran's charge d'affaires  Gholam Reza Ansari was summoned to see Foreign Office [FO]  Minister Douglas Hogg following reports that Tehran's spies have  been secretly helping the terrorists.    After the 10-minute showdown at the Foreign Office, a FO  spokesman said: "We are convinced that there have been contacts  between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We take the gravest  view of any contact which might assist or encourage terrorism.  Mr. Hogg summoned the Iranian charge to convey our concern and  to request an assurance at senior level that contact would be  immediately and conclusively severed."    Britain believes contacts have been going on for some time  and it is clear measures will be taken against Tehran if today's  warning has no effect. Relations between the two countries are  already sour following the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death order  on author Salman Rushdie over his controversial book, The  Satanic Verses. Britain and Iran do not have full diplomatic  relations, with only an Iranian charge d'affaires in London,  instead of an ambassador. But Britain is unlikely to break off  all diplomatic relations with such an important Middle East  country and will be reluctant to impose sanctions.    The Iranian embassy refused to comment on today's events.    The Government is believed to be concerned that Iran was  planning to supply money and arms to the IRA.    Later, Mr. Ansari told ITN's Lunchtime News that his meeting  with Mr Hogg was very friendly. "I was informed about their  concern. I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact  with my country -- definitely it is not right."</p>

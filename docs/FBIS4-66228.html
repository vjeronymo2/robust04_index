			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ch'en I-shen (7115 0308 3234), assistant </F> researcher, Modern History Department, China Research Institute:  "Victim, Injured Party, or Beneficiary?--Notes on What This  Year's 28 February Incident Anniversary Will Do to Li Teng-hui"]    [Text] Following the opening up of politics and society,  there have often been different themes in the anniversaries of  the 28 February Incident in the past several years. One time it  was marked by the Legislative Yuan's standing in silent tribute  for the first time, at another time it was the observance by the  Executive Yuan's study group, and at still another time it was  the observance at a grand meeting of the State Music  Department--what will it be this year? From the TZULI WANPAO  supplement one sees on the two palms of the old man Lin Mu-ch'i  [2651 2606 2630] of Keelung the scars clearly left by wires, as  well as the process in which 81 persons were formed in nine  lines and shot dead. Certainly many people are shocked into  jumping up and saying "Sure enough, it's true...." Should this  manifesation of oral history leave the most clear and lively  impression at this year's anniversary of the 28 February  Incident?    Unexpectedly, President Li Teng-hui, when receiving on 24  February the family survivors of those killed in the 28 February  Incident, said that he was a victim (injured party?) of the  incident, a statement that for several days running has been the  focus of the news media.  <H5>  The 28 February Incident and White Terror Should Not Be </H5> Jumbled Together    From the available material one cannot see a record of Li  Teng-hui's taking part in the 28 February Incident or of him  being made a victim of it. Someone then searched for an  explanation in the direction of "the victims' family members,"  but after reviewing his family tree and geneology could find no  evidence and could only describe him as a fairly abstract  "injured party." This will never satisfy the reader's curiosity.  Li Teng-hui said clearly that he himself....[as published]  Therefore, the heroic deeds of the fifties and sixties have  been completely revealed, and so has: Who joined the Communist  Party, who was familiar with Huang Wen-hsiung [7806 2429 7160],  who was the protaganist in the Chiang [5592] assassination case,  and even the experience in White Terror on the part of other  government officials who left the ranks to serve as a prop.    In my opinion, the 28 February Incident has its particular  reason, course, and result, and it should not be lumped together  with the White Terror of the fifties. Beginning on the evening  of 27 February 1947 with the occurrence of the anticontraband  tobacco incident, and going through the initial insurrection  stage, negotiation and disposition stage, suppression and  massacre stage, up to 16 May when Wei Tao-ming [7614 6670 2494]  became the provincial governor, abolished martial law, and ended  the activities to eliminate the bandits in the  countryside...this was the 28 February Incident. The White  Terror of the fifties was, after the Kuomintang (KMT) "central"  government moved to Taiwan, mainly focused on activities to  eliminate Leftists and Reds. If the two are not clearly  distinguished, how can we calculate the number of dead persons?  How can we talk about cause and effect? How can we remember the  lessons of history?  <H5>  Political Effect of 28 February Incident </H5> In the initial period after the 28 February Incident, the  residents of Taipei City staged a demonstration in which they  carried the corpses of those who had been machine-gunned to  death and shouted: "A Shan-tzu [7093 1472 0098]" killed these  people. At the side of a fountain in Chiayi City, residents  chased and beat people wearing Sun Yat-sen suits, and there was  a clear image of clan conflict. However, if there were no enmity  provoked by political rule, how could the cultural differences  or clan contradictions of that time have become such a  widespread and swift upheaval? The KMT's way of handling the  incident was not just to suppress the rebellion, but to carry  out a retaliatory massacre, which caused the death, or the  leaving or withdrawal from the political world of a large number  of Taiwan's elites. One can well imagine the quality of the  Taiwanese political figures who filled the vacancies at that  time. Over the past decades local factions "have had license to  run wild," letting the KMT divide and rule, a situation that has  a close connection to the 28 February Incident. Therefore, the  political effect of the 28 February Incident is very clear. It  settled the KMT's stable rule on Taiwan for several decades,  causing Taiwan "to have no" clan or crowd problem for several  decades. However, the KMT, under the martial law system, to  gloss over its nature as an external regime, had no choice but  to cultivate and use the Taiwanese "elites" whom it trusted.  Didn't Li Teng-hui have his meteoric rise under the  circumstances of this general trend of events? If it is said  that the KMT regime was a beneficiary of the 28 February  Incident, how can it be said that Li Teng-hui was also not one  of the beneficiaries?  <H5>  The Focus Was on How To Avoid "National Disorder" </H5>   At the time of the 28 February Incident, although there no  loud cries for Taiwan's independence, in Taipei the word "China"  on the signboards of the China Tourist Association and the China  Bank was pulled down, and many things connected with "China"  were burned in the streets. It is not hard for us to feel that  Japan, in its 50 years of colonial but modernized rule,  cultivated the people of this island--the Taiwan people's  consciousness of this should ferment. Although because time is  not short and because of the restrictions of objective  conditions, the elites who took part in the 28 February Incident  probably have not reached a common understanding about founding  a new country, the entire 28 February Incident really can be  viewed as a "national disorder" that caused "injury to members  of the same clan."    Why did Taiwan want to be ruled by Japan? Why did it also  want to be ruled by China? Without founding a new, independent  country, how can a repeat of the 28 February Incident be  avoided? Any introspection about, commemoration of, or  disposition of the 28 February Incident, I'm afraid, must be  examined with this criteria in mind.    When the "28 February Incident delegation that traveled to  America and returned home" requested that Li Teng-hui "publicly  apologize," Li Teng-hui did not make a clear reply, but rather  tried to mislead them with the emotional statement "I am also an  injured party." Actually, the entire government's handling of  the 28 February Incident may be said to one of muddling along  for the past year, that is, the measure for compensation is  stranded in the Legislative Yuan, P'eng Meng-ch'i [1756 1322  4874] still occupies an official building of more than 1,000  p'ing [one p'ing is an area six feet square], and the  modern history of Taiwan, which the provincial historical  documents society has time and again bragged about, was written  with this idea of ourselves against the enemy .... What is  strange is that recently the editorials in newspapers have  maintained that it would be inadvisable for Li Teng-hui, in his  status as a Taiwanese president, to publicly apologize for the  28 February Incident!    With regard to dealing with the aftermath of the 28 February  Incident, President Li Teng-hui--as a beneficiary of the KMT  system--has very many things that he should do but has not yet  done, and a public apology is only one of them. The Taiwanese  people should know that language group affinity is not a  necessary factor for founding a country. If people often,  because of Li Teng-hui's status as a Taiwanese president, lose  their ability to think and are perfectly happy to let him  "deceive them by playing on their feelings," this precisely  shows that they have not yet drawn the proper lesson from the 28  February Incident.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Information Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] On the third day of clashes in Chiapas, the Zapata  National Liberation Army [EZLN] once again attacked the 31st  Military Zone, very close to San Cristobal de las Casas. The  Mexican Army successfully repelled this attack, and immediately  reinforced military operations in the municipality. Meanwhile,  the Army has recovered the municipalities of Ocosingo and Las  Margaritas, although clashes continue in the surrounding areas.    According to military sources, so far there have been 86  deaths in these clashes. Altamirano municipality remains under  the control of the armed group that has begun to demolish the  municipal palace.    Commenting on the situation in Chiapas, President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said there is no time or place in Mexico for  divergence that cannot be solved according to the law. He  admits there are certain shortages and inequalities in that  state, but he warns that violence will delay a true solution of  the problems.    The Government Secretariat assured that the groups active in  Chiapas represent a mixture of interests by local and foreign  persons who are linked to violent groups operating in Central  America. Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz admitted that  the Mexican Government learned several months ago about the  existence of illegal groups in that area.    Following orders from the Executive Branch, new procedures  will be established to study the problems in Chiapas. The  Social Development Secretariat will review the work being done,  and with the social organizations of that state, it will define  the projects for the new year.    Meanwhile, Chiapas Governor Elmar Setzer has urged the  people  of Chiapas to be prudent, and he trusts the Army will shortly  reestablish peace in Chiapas. Elmar Setzer denied that he is  planning to resign.    Meanwhile, EZLN leaders reiterated they will not negotiate  with the government so long as the government does not turn  power over to the people.</p>

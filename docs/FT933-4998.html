			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Insurance It takes a leap of faith to believe that UK insurers can maintain the level of insurance profits evident from their interim results. Since investment returns are likely to be lower than in the past, and the memory of recent underwriting disasters are still fresh, good intentions abound. But even two consecutive years of underwriting profits would be an achievement not managed in the 1980s. With balance sheets restored to health by rising equity markets and rights issues, underwriting discipline will be harder to maintain. What can not be achieved by management might eventually be achieved by regulation. Prudential guidelines in the US discourage companies from backing insurance liabilities with risk assets such as equities and property. There is sense in the argument: an October storm combined with a stock market crash last year would have left more than one UK insurer exposed in the US. That the devaluation of sterling has helped recapitalise the sector is of little comfort. Similar regulations at home would mean profound change. Sun Alliance, for example, invests around 15 per cent of reserves against future claims in equities - a sum equivalent to around twice shareholders' funds. Robbed of that gearing to equities, insurance profits would assume greater importance. In theory, there is no reason why that should matter, but the evidence is to the contrary. UK insurers have lagged the stock market over the last 20 years, while their US counterparts have outperformed.</p>

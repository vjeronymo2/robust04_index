			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 5 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic and a delegation of Russian academicians  on Tuesday agreed that U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia are  unjust and counterproductive both for Yugoslavia and for  stability in the Balkans.    Kontic praised the Russian Federation for its increasingly  active role in the efforts aimed at finding a just solution to  the crisis in former Yugoslavia, said a statement released by  the Yugoslav Information Ministry.    In May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive  and mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro)  for its alleged involvement in civil war raging in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats.    Kontic briefed the Russian delegation -- which is headed by  Vice President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Nikolay  Laverev and which also includes former Soviet premier Nikolay  Ryzhkov -- about the current political and economic situation in  Yugoslavia, especially the results of the economic recovery  programme launched earlier this year.    Ryzhkov is president of the Moscow School of Business  Management and Administration founded by the Yugoslav company  Braca Karic.    The Russian academicians communicated to Kontic the  unanimous  stand of Russia's leading scientists that the impermissible  blockade of Yugoslavia should be ended, and expressed  satisfaction at Moscow's more active role in resolving the  problems in former Yugoslavia.    The Russian delegation was also received by Serbian  Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic, who expressed appreciation for  their support.    Although support from some quarters has come late in the  day,  it has nevertheless come in time to sober the international  community and make it realize that the cruel sanctions against  the Yugoslav people should be lifted as soon as possible and  never used again against any other nation, said Tomic.    Laverev said this type of contacts helped the world realize  the truth about Yugoslavia. "Your plight teaches us caution," he  underlined, and added that the Russian Academy of Sciences, the  Russian people, and other factors in Russia were supporting  Yugoslavia in its just struggle for independence.    The Russian delegation also had a meeting with the dean of  Belgrade University, Professor Dragutin Velickovic, and explored  possibilities of cooperation between Belgrade University and  Russian scientific institutions.</p>

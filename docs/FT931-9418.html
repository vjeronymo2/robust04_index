			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Stirred by a big Swiss cheese HIGH ABOVE Chateaux d'Oex, in a picture book Swiss chalet, Jean-Claud Reynaud is making cheese. Twice a day, from May to October, he goes through the same careful routine, stirring, decurdling and heating the milk from his 60 Simmental and Red Holstein cross-bred cows to produce the 25 to 30 kilo rounds of Fromage d'Alpage which will be individually numbered and stored. Each season Jean-Claud and his family make 10 tons of L'Etivaz, a hard cheese that is as far removed from factory products - usually made with lots of different milks - as is possible to imagine. After six months maturation in 'cheese caves' L'Etivaz is ready for the table. Sitting in the Reynaud's kitchen last autumn with Lia, Jean-Claud's wife, I was looking forward to trying their most recently matured product. Instead Jean-Claud unearthed a big, dry wedge, cut from a huge golden wheel, that was enough to make any self-respecting mouse tremble. 'Five years old,' he said proudly, as what appeared to be yellow wood shavings fell on to a plate beneath the strange implement used to cut cheese in the Alps. It was like no other mountain cheese I have tasted; a distillation of the most alpine tastes and smells - cut grass, flowers, thick milk and straw. Unforgettable. Not surprisingly, mountain cheeses were used for barter in centuries past. From the 13th to the 18th centuries the alpine cheesemakers were able to trade for coffee, tobacco and linen with the Italians, their neighbours on the other side of the Gotthard pass. Today, to taste a five-year old cheese such as the Reynaud's, you will probably have to go to Switzerland to buy it. Sadly, much of the stuff masquerading as alpine cheese in the UK is factory made. If you are interested in trying to obtain the real thing, the Syndicat des Exporteurs Suisse de Fromage, Case Postale 770, CH-300 Berne 14, Switzerland (tel: 031 44 26 11) should be able to help. The tourist office in Chateau d'Oex (tel 029 4 77 88, fax 029 4 77 89) will be able to give you information on the Cooperative Des Producteurs de Fromage Alpage, of which the Reynauds (pictured right) are part.</p>

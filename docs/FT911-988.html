			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Book Review: Sleight of hand over scientific method DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT By OB Hardison Jr Penguin, Pounds 9.99, 389 pages Modern man's yearning to understand the significance of science is attested by a pile of recent popular works, but even the best requires study. How convenient if it could be done in a single big bang, unifying all discoveries from chromosomes to cosmology into the framework of what the average arts graduate learned at school. Enter O B Hardison Jr, the Mephistopheles of the computer age. He reveals Everything in 400 pages, then causes it to vanish, leaving hardly a trace behind, except a pleasant feeling of superiority and some rave notices in the US and last year's Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Hardison, an expert on culture and a professor at Georgetown University, Washington, until his death last summer, certainly offers the broad view and a long bibliography. His thesis is that modern technology overwhelmed traditional cultures in a kind of game of progressive abstraction that caused them to 'disappear'. So each of his five sections is subtitled 'the Disappearance of . . .Nature, History, Language, Art and Man', respectively. This may be a complicated joke because the 'Man' section is about artificial intelligence, for example. Some of it is nonsense, Yet even at his most preposterous, Hardison sounds as if he might possibly be on to something. Take, for example, the conclusion of his first section: 'If science is a human creation, we have caught the mind in the very act of swallowing up the world, which is another way of saying that we have witnessed nature in the process of disappearing.' Is this profundity, semantic froth, or just a cry of pain? Hardison compares the beauty of Charles Darwin's prose in The Origin of the Species with the mathematics which D'Arcy Thompson, the Cambridge zoologist, used to describe the living world in 1917. Then he proceeds to the computer mathematics of Benoit Mandelbrot, who used computers in the 1960s to develop fractal geometry, a formalism for describing natural shapes such as coastlines. son thinks Darwin was imprisoned in the confusions of a 'mythic' view of nature, to which he is said to have attributed 'human motives'; his ideas were thus flawed by the 'logical nonsense' of his supposed belief that the survival of the fittest was 'tragic' (because of the extinction of the rest). Then came Thompson ('everything in biology that Darwin was not') and, later, Mandelbrot, to liberate mankind into the world of numerical abstraction. The fact that Hardison misunderstood and misrepresented Darwin, that his hero, D'Arcy Thompson, though respected by academics, no longer rates a mention in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and that Mandelbrot knew possibly even less biology than Hardison, need not detain us. A man who can say that the Ford Fiesta car 'appears to have sunk without trace' demands indulgence. Perhaps he read The Origin in a hurry. It is harder to forgive him for speculating whether Johannes Kepler, the 16th-century astronomer, would have abandoned his preconceived theory of the solar system if observations had conflicted with it. Kepler stands - with Darwin - among the giants of the scientific tradition precisely because he did abandon the theory which everyone then believed in. He discovered with much intellectual pain and prodigious analysis of Tycho Brahe's stellar observations that the planets do not move in ordered circles, inscribed on geometrical solids, as the ancients believed. Kepler deduced that they trace less godlike elliptical orbits, a fact which helped Isaac Newton to formulate the laws of motion and gravity. Yet Hardison is too intelligent to be hissed quite off the stage. The advance of scientific rationalism has left perplexing furrows in 20th-century culture. As he says: 'To many people, the world of quarks and black holes is an affront. Humanity seems to have leaked out of it.' He is at his best describing this loss of vital fluid, for example in modern and post-modern architecture. This section is full of fun and insights. So who cares if it is sound? His celebration of the poetry of nonsense and the reduction of language to incantation or pattern is also instructive - provided one ignores the dismissal of Eliot, Pound and Yeats as 'modernist' (ie: tied to the past). Then his survey of computer brainpower is racy and comprehensive, even though he sows confusion about Alan Turing's test for whether a machine is truly 'intelligent'. He suggests wrongly that Joseph Weizenbaum's famous psychoanalytic programme, ELIZA, passed this intelligence test 'for some users' back in 1963. But, as Weizenbaum explained in his powerful book, Computer Power and Human Reason, ELIZA was as much a fraud as Coppelia Hardison means the programme sort of seemed a bit intelligent. But where does that leave his apocalyptic vision of a world dominated by machines, in which 'silicon life will be immortal . . .for silicon beings, 100,000 light years will be as a day's journey . . '? The danger of this readable and provocative book is that it will be taken as a bona fide exposition of scientific thought, even as a bridge between the two cultures. But although Hardison is awed by science, he shows little understanding of its method, preferring metaphors, dextrous conceits and, sometimes, innuendo or sleight of hand. So, he perversely analyses passages from Darwin as if he were a flawed nature poet, rather than a theorist who changed the history of ideas. He fails to see how theories which seemed at first repugnant to common sense stripped away the illusions of mankind. Nor does he understand the central source of science's power and authority: successful prediction. Caveat Emptor]</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DEBT-RIDDEN IMPERIAL, MERCURY SEIZED BY U.S. REGULATORS  </P> <P> Federal regulators on Friday seized two California savings and loans, including  Imperial Savings Assn. of San Diego -- the industry's second-largest holder of  junk bonds -- and Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision turned over both  institutions to the Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency created in August  to dispose of insolvent S&amp;Ls. In all, the agency seized 12 S&amp;Ls Friday.  </P> <P> At the end of the year, Imperial had $9.7 billion in assets, the thrift office  said. High-yield, high-risk bonds represented more than 10% of its portfolio.  The institution was $60.1 million in the red, regulators said.  </P> <P> Mercury Savings &amp; Loan had $2.16 billion in assets and was $33 million in  the red, the thrift office said.  </P> <P> Mercury operated more traditionally than Imperial, but had invested in several  large hotel projects that went sour.  </P> <P> Like several other large institutions before it, Imperial ran afoul of  provisions in last summer's savings and loan bill requiring it to value its  securities at market value rather than the purchase price.  </P> <P> It was forced to recognize $200 million in junk-bond losses in the last quarter  of 1989 and had indicated that it expected to take a writedown of at least $50  million more in the current quarter.  </P> <P> At the end of September, Imperial was the 16th-largest S&amp;L in the nation  and had the second-biggest junk-bond portfolio, behind only Columbia Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. of Beverly Hills, according to Sheshunoff Information  Services.  </P> <P> Of the top four junk-bond holders in the S&amp;L business, only Columbia, with  $4.1 billion in the bonds, remains out of the government's control. Analysts  speculate, however, that it may be one of the next takeovers. Its debt has been  downgraded by Moody's Investors Service and regulators have restricted its  activities since November.  </P> <P> "I think that Columbia has to be real close to the margin," said Bert Ely, an  Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst. "I wouldn't be surprised to  see Columbia popped (into the RTC) fairly soon."  </P> <P> CenTrust Bank of Miami, No. 3 in junk bonds, was seized earlier this month, and  City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., No. 4, toppled in December.  </P> <P> The seizures make the government, through the RTC, the largest owner of junk  bonds.  </P> <P> Imperial, the chief subsidiary of Imperial Corp. of America, had 80 branch  offices in California, which will remain open during normal business hours. It  had $7.6 billion in deposits in 387,000 accounts, the RTC said. All accounts up  to the $100,000 federal insurance limit are guaranteed.  </P> <P> Founded in 1950, Imperial grew as it helped finance the post-World War II  housing boom in California. However, under former Chief Executive Kenneth J.  Thygerson and investor Victor Goulet, it took advantage of California's liberal  regulations to venture into risky investments. It became a major customer of  indicted financier Michael Milken, who was head of Drexel Burnham Lambert  Inc.'s junk-bond operation in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Junk bonds have declined 15% to 20% on average since the summer. Earlier this  month, Drexel Burnham's parent company sought protection under federal  bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> Thygerson, who had joined the thrift in 1985, resigned last July. His  successors were trying to save the institution by shrinking it to half its peak  size of $12 billion and returning it to more traditional practices.  </P> <P> But the thrift office said in a statement, "There was no possibility of  replenishing capital without federal assistance."  </P> <P> In addition to junk bonds, Imperial had purchased a troubled portfolio of car  loans from Grand Wilshire Finance Corp., a now-bankrupt Los Angeles-area firm.  It was also suffering from problem loans it made to a now-bankrupt New Jersey  firm that sold Yugo automobile dealerships in the United States.  </P> <P> Among the other S&amp;Ls seized Friday was First Atlantic Savings and Loan  Assn. of Plainfield, N.J., with $1.3 billion in assets.  </P> <P> The RTC has more than 330 S&amp;Ls under its control with about $180 billion in  assets.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gazis Yesmukanov by Viktoriya Nartova; place </F> and date not given: "The Main Cause of Emigration Is Economic  Instability"]    [Text] Problems of the migration of the population  have become very urgent for Kazakhstan. The migration processes  occurring in the republic today and their prospects are  described for PANORAMA by Gazis Yesmukanov, chairman of the  republic Migration Department.    "The Emigration Act was adopted in the republic in June  1992,  and the need for the creation of a department to execute this  law arose. Originally the department was called upon to assist  the resettlement of those compatriots that were living abroad  and that wished to return to their historical home.    "Today, when the process of population migration is becoming  a most urgent problem of the state, the department is dealing  with problems of population migration as a whole.    "The departure of significant numbers of the population from  Kazakhstan had been observed as of the 1960's. But, this process  has assumed considerable proportions in recent years. The  migration result last year swallowed up, it may be said, the  natural population increase and the influx of population into  the republic: The population of Kazakhstan declined by 60,000.  This phenomenon cannot be called normal, and it is with good  reason that it is causing concern in the leadership of the  republic.    "The greatest outflow of the population is observed in such  oblasts as Almaty, Mangistau, Pavlodar, and Karaganda, that is,  in oblasts where industry is most developed. The population of  German nationality, in the main, is leaving oblasts with a  developed agriculture--Kokshetau and Akmolina."    [Nartova] What, in your view, is the main reason for the  population's departure?    [Yesmukanov] Officers of the department conducted a special  opinion poll in this connection. The results showed that the  main reason for the departure of the majority of families is the  economic instability, the uncontrolled prices, and the decline  in the living standard. Practically all the people see no  prospect of the situation improving. In addition, many are  leaving to reunite with relatives that live outside Kazakhstan.    According to the poll data, 25 percent of Russians and 70  percent of Germans are contemplating leaving Kazakhstan.    Some 369,000 persons left Kazakhstan in 1992. But I should  mention that a certain reduction in the numbers of those leaving  was observed in 1993. A program with which we hope to contain  and regulate the spontaneous process of population migration and  to ascertain the reasons for the outflow of population, of the  able-bodied population with higher education particularly, is  being devised in the department at this time.    [Nartova] You took part in the international conference on  the problems of refugees in Moscow, tell us about it, please.    [Yesmukanov] The conference was held during 6-10 June, and  problems of refugees and involuntary resettlers on the territory  of the former USSR and also the prospects of an alleviation of  their position were discussed. It took place under the aegis of  the International Peace Foundation, it was opened by Anatoliy  Karpov, president of the International Association of Peace  Foundations, and representatives of the UN High Commission for  Refugees and also leaders of migration services of all 15 former  republics of the USSR were present. As I have mentioned, the  problems of the refugees are connected primarily with a  violation of human rights and infringement of the rights of the  individual on national grounds. Attention was paid to the flash  points and the various conflicts flaring up increasingly on the  territory of the former USSR and also to the significance of UN  peacekeeping missions in these regions.    The summary document was an appeal to the heads of all  states  for the adoption of all measures to ensure human rights and  liberties and suppress all manifestations of aggressive  nationalism and racial and religious enmity.    [Nartova] Speaking of the containment of migration  processes,  were any agreements reached with Russia for it is there, after  all, that the main flow of emigrants from Kazakhstan heads?    [Yesmukanov] Truly, Russians constitute 52 percent of those  leaving the republic. And much will depend on our relations with  Russia. I visited the Migration Office in Moscow. It has  accumulated much valuable experience, and we hope that contacts  between our departments will develop successfully.    In March 1994, Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed a  memorandum on the basic principles of the solution of questions  connected with citizenship and the legal status of citizens of  the Kazakh Republic living in Russia and Russian citizens living  on the territory of Kazakhstan. The document specifies a number  of measures whose preparation and elaboration are geared to the  resolution of problems in this sphere. Work in this area is  being performed currently both in Russia and in Kazakhstan.    [Nartova] What, in your opinion, does the republic  government  need to do to reduce the number of emigrants?    [Yesmukanov] Primarily, to improve the economic situation in  the state and to stabilize prices first and foremost. It is then  essential to make a number of amendments to the Language Act,  including to adopt a provision on development of the Russian  language.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luiz Longo in Sao Paulo] </F>   [Text] A Workers Party [PT] document on the current  situation is urging PT members, union leaders, and supporters to  mobilize against the salary shrinkage provoked by the Real Plan.  The drafters of the document believe the PT should promote a  national movement calling for structural reforms in the country.  They thus consider it essential that the party, its economists,  and congressmen launch an offensive to publicly fight the plan.    The call for a mobilization against the economic plan is  made  in a document entitled "The Current Situation and Our Campaign  Strategy," which was drafted by a committee appointed by the PT  national executive board and approved at the PT national meeting  in Brasilia on 1 May.    Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign believe  that unfulfilled social and salary demands at this time will  later result in a wave of demands on the future government.  They deny, however, charges that they are instigating political  strikes to benefit Lula's campaign.    Economist Joao Machado, who is the deputy coordinator of the  PT program, said: "The fact is that the PT is urging all those  who are unhappy with the government's plan to vent their  dissatisfaction. It is ridiculous, however, to charge us with  instigating political strikes."</p>

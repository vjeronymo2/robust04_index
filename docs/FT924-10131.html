			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Leading Article: A vote for Europe MEMBERS OF parliament from all of Britain's political parties should vote for the government at the end of Wednesday's debate on the Maastricht treaty. The motion before the House sets out what has happened to date in Parliament's consideration of the bill to ratify the treaty and proposes to continue that process. But the emollient phraseology cannot disguise the primary purpose of the debate. This is to establish, once again, that there is a majority in the British parliament for proceeding in good faith with arrangements made after difficult negotiations with the other 11 members of the European Community. Those who propose to vote against must disagree with this. The Labour party, which has worked itself into a lather of unrealistic expectations of a fruitful alliance between itself and Tory Europhobes, maintains that the time to proceed is not now. Discuss ratification after Christmas, says Labour, or after the Danish question has been finally resolved. When that sophistry is exposed, Labour apologists, some of them rather shamefaced, burble on about how it is their duty to vote against the government on what, they insist, is patently a vote of confidence. If that is so, why not put down a confidence motion? The opposition has the right to do that, but Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, knows that it would be blown out of the water. Playing games The truth is that the party is allowing itself to be diverted by the sight of a government in disarray. If it is to have the slightest hope of forming an administration once again it should be fixing its sights on 1996-97, when it will fight another general election. It should be showing that it has learned the lessons of its defeat in April. Whatever the opinion polls say now, they are irrelevant to the next big contest. The outcome of that will in large part depend upon whether Labour, which has proved to be unelectable four times running, has by then shown itself to be trustworthy. In playing games with Wednesday's vote, Mr Smith is indicating a willingness to abandon his own long-held European convictions. Has he forgotten the damage done to his predecessor by a reputation for U-turns on matters of deep principle? Distracted by the passing show, Mr Smith is revealing a lack of confidence that his own party can indeed be led towards reform and unity. No alternative His allies on the Conservative benches stand for everything the Labour party says it does not. Some are English nationalists, tending, in some cases, to xenophobia. Some are unreconciled Thatcherites, unable to forgive Mr John Major for not being the clone of the former prime minister that they thought he was when they voted for him in November 1990. Others are merely disgruntled ex-office holders. What they have in common is an inability to answer the simple question - 'if not Maastricht, if not Europe, what then?' Acolytes of a lady whose proud motto was that there is no alternative, they now have no alternative to offer. Mr Paddy Ashdown will ask his Liberal Democrats to support the motion, even at the cost of Labour taunts that he is keeping the government in office. That is not what he is doing: the Conservatives would not abdicate if Maastricht was scuppered. Mr Ashdown is simply sticking to principle and emerging with more credit than the leaders of either of the larger parties. If Britain allows itself again to be exposed as half-hearted about the Community or even, as some Eurosceptics fantasise, as the principled wrecker of a treaty too far, defeat for the government on Wednesday will be a stunning setback in the country's tortuous progress in coming to terms with its viable place in the world. At odds with its EC partners, Britain would pay dearly in lost inward investment, long-term economic growth foregone, higher unemployment and a place in the counsels of Europe denied. Those who resist a positive vote on Wednesday are declaring their willingness to pay this price.</p>

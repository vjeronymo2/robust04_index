			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'THE FRIDGE' IS OVERLADEN, MAY ENTER EATING DISORDER CENTER  </P> <P> Bears defensive lineman William (the Refrigerator) Perry is back up to about  360 pounds and may return to a center for eating disorders, Coach Mike Ditka  says.  </P> <P> "Perry is trying. . . . He's working out and we're checking his progress,"  Ditka said Wednesday. "It is not going as good as he wants it to go and it is  not going as good as we want it to go."  </P> <P> Ditka, attending the National Football League owners meetings in Palm Desert,  Calif., said a decision on the chronically overweight Perry could come as early  as next week when the staff returns to Chicago.  </P> <P> Ditka said an understanding exists between Perry and the Bears about what will  happen if Perry is not in shape by training camp. In January, Ditka said Perry  would be released if he did not get in shape in the off-season.  </P> <P> One possibility is returning him to a clinic for eating disorders, Ditka said.  </P> <P> Perry probably will have to get down to 320 again in order to be invited to  training camp July 28, Ditka said.  </P></p>

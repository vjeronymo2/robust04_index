			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: FCC plans CDollars 248m rights issue FLETCHER Challenge Canada, which is 72 per cent owned by New Zealand's biggest company, plans to strengthen its balance sheet with a CDollars 248m (USDollars 210.1m) rights issue. The Vancouver-based forestry group said it would issue 16.8m common shares at CDollars 14.75 each. Its shares were trading at CDollars 15.75 before the announcement. FCC expects the issue to be completed by May 21. The New Zealand parent will buy sufficient shares to maintain the current level of its shareholding in FCC, leaving 4.8m shares for the public. FCC has a debt load of CDollars 626m, equal to about 40 per cent of total capital. The company said it was keen to reduce its debt-equity ratio, but had no expansion plans.</p>

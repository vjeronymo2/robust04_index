			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Retreat on Welsh colliery closure British Coal has reprieved Tower Colliery in Mid Glamorgan, which it had sought to close yesterday with the loss of 250 jobs, Roland Adburgham writes. Members of the NUM mineworkers' union at Tower, the last deep mine in south Wales, voted yesterday to continue their opposition to the closure and reject the redundancy terms. After the vote, British Coal withdrew its proposal 'in light of the strength of the NUM's feeling and the union's optimism for the future of the colliery'. British Coal announced last week that it planned to close the pit yesterday. It is now intended to carry on production at the present rate, although there are 420,000 tonnes of coal on the surface at Tower.</p>

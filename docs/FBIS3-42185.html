Sun Xianlu, 25, an ex-employee of Tianjin No. 2 steelworks,  attempted to hijack the Boeing airliner to Taiwan on November 28  last year. He claimed to be carrying explosives, but was  overpowered at the airport after the crew adopted measures.    The plane landed safely at the airport in Nanjing, capital  of  east China's Jiangsu Province, Liu said.    The Nanjing Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to  life  imprisonment with deprivation of political rights on January 13.  The verdict took effect today.    Liu said that several cases of hijacking occured in China  over a period, and some of the culprits were debtors, some  attempted to "seek fortune" overseas, and others have had  criminal records.    China has been consistent in severely cracking down on the  crime of hijacking, he said.    According to the country's criminal law and the decision on  punishing hijackers of aircraft issued by the Standing Committee  of the National People's Congress, hijackers must be severely  punished, with the death penalty in the most serious cases.    At the end of 1993 an agreement was reached between the  mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation. Both  sides came to a common understanding that hijacking is a serious  crime and hijackers should be severely punished.    They agreed in principle that all hijackers will be sent  back  to where they came from, Liu noted.</p>

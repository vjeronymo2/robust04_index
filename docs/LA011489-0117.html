			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 30TH YEAR FOR 'FRIENDS'  </P> <P> The Fullerton Friends of Music is celebrating its 30th year of sponsoring  professional chamber music concerts, making it the oldest such organization in  the county.  </P> <P> It is supported primarily by member subscriptions and has maintained a policy  of admission-free concerts since its inception.  </P> <P> Its artistic level is splendid. In addition to the best Southern California  artists, the series presents international musicians. As an example, the  current season opened with the Talich String Quartet and will continue with,  among others, harpsichordist Igor Kipnis and lutanist James Tyler.  </P> <P> The Times is to be commended for its coverage of cultural activities --  coverage that has done much to rectify the view that Orange County is a  cultural wasteland. We look forward to being a part of your reportage.  </P> <P> ROBERT R. GATES  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P>  Gates is president of Fullerton Friends of Music.  </P></p>

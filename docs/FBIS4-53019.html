			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il sent a centennial birthday table to Pak Yong-sun,  an old woman residing in neighborhood unit No. 24 in  Toksong-tong, Tokchon City, South Pyongan Province.    Born into a poor peasant's family in Kongju County, South  Chungchong Province, she underwent all hardships as a nurse-maid  at a landlord's home from early years and then a tenant farmer.    It was not until she was embraced in the bosom of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the country's  liberation that she could enjoy a worthy life of humanity. She  actively participated in assisting the front in the period of  the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953) and afterwards  devotedly worked for the strengthening and development of the  socialist motherland.    She is now the oldest woman in a big family of 50 members  including her sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters.    All people in the DPRK are now living a happy life with no  worry about food, clothing and housing, singing the prime of  youth in the sixties and the first step into old age in the  nineties, benefitting by the free health care system.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL'S RETAIL BROKERAGE OPERATIONS PUT UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> Moving swiftly to reorganize in the wake of its recent legal problems, Drexel  Burnham Lambert said it will sell its retail brokerage operations and focus  exclusively on its core businesses, including "junk bonds," general investment  banking services and bond and stock trading for institutional investors.  </P> <P> The decision was discussed in a weekend meeting of Drexel's board of directors  and disclosed for the first time Tuesday when Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's  chief executive, went on Drexel's public address system.  </P> <P> Joseph said the firm wants to sell the entire retail brokerage to a single  securities firm with a larger retail operation. In a written statement, Drexel  said it hoped to conclude a deal by next week. The firm said it hasn't reached  agreement yet with any potential buyer.  </P> <P> The retail unit, which mainly serves individual investors and employs 1,100  brokers in 42 offices around the country and in Puerto Rico, accounts for only  about 10% of the firm's revenue. One source at the firm said the retail  operations recently haven't made a profit.  </P> <P> The decision to sell the retail business wasn't unanimous, and sources said  more than one member of Drexel's board voted against it.  </P> <P> The firm also said it plans to "curtail" its activities in municipal  securities, over-the-counter stocks and market-making and research in foreign  stocks. A spokesman said it hadn't been decided yet whether these units would  be closed or just reduced in size.  </P> <P> The announcement of plans to sell the retail unit infuriated many of Drexel's  brokers, some of whom said in off-the-record interviews that they felt betrayed  by the firm. A broker in one of the firm's West Coast offices said Drexel in  recent months had repeatedly reassured brokers that it was committed to  maintaining the retail business despite the firm's problems. The broker, who  asked not to be identified, said that on Tuesday "Fred Joseph came over the  (intercom) system and knocked brokers over the head, unconscious." He added  that, as a result, "There are a tremendous number of very disgruntled people  here."  </P> <P> Drexel's retail brokers have long been overshadowed by the firm's main  money-making operation, the high-yield junk bond trading and underwriting based  at the firm's Beverly Hills office.  </P> <P> It was also disclosed Tuesday that Drexel's board decided for a second time in  the past two years to scrap plans to move its headquarters. The firm announced  that, because it will have fewer employees as a result of the sale of the  retail operation, it is abandoning plans to build a new building in lower  Manhattan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Above-Average Revenue  </P> <P> There were rumors Tuesday that several potential buyers were interested in the  retail operation, including Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and Merrill  Lynch &amp; Co., among others. But Merrill Lynch declined to comment, and a  Smith Barney spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Although the Drexel retail unit may not have been profitable, its brokers  specialized in dealing with wealthier customers and are said to have produced  gross commission revenue per broker of over $300,000, well above the industry  average. Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said this makes the unit  attractive to potential buyers.  </P> <P> The unit is believed to have been unprofitable because of the relatively small  number of brokers compared to the operation's overhead costs.  </P> <P> In explaining the decision to sell, Drexel cited both the adverse publicity  that the firm has received and the weakness that all Wall Street firms  currently are suffering in their retail business. Because of these factors,  Drexel said the growth prospects for its retail unit weren't good.  </P> <P> Drexel has announced plans to plead guilty to six federal felony counts and pay  $650 million in penalties in connection with allegations of securities fraud  and insider trading. The firm also reached a settlement last week of civil  charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement with the  SEC subjects Drexel to the most stringent outside supervision ever imposed on a  major securities firm. In addition, Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's  junk bond department, recently was indicted on racketeering and other charges.  </P> <P> Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, said  the publicity about Drexel's legal problems probably has made it difficult for  Drexel brokers to attract new customers and keep existing accounts. In  addition, he said, "It could be a stigma over the next few years with the  Milken trial going on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Depressed State' of Industry  </P> <P> A broker at another of Drexel's West Coast offices confirmed that the constant  press reports about the firm's legal problems worried customers and made it  especially difficult to attract new customers. Brokers also speculated that  selling the unit may greatly reduce the legal problems Drexel is expected to  have with state regulatory authorities. Many state government securities  regulators are expected to take action against the firm, with charges similar  to the federal ones.  </P> <P> But in its statement, Drexel emphasized the industrywide softness of retail  stock and bond trading as the main reason for its decision. Stock trading by  individuals has fallen off sharply since the October, 1987, crash.  </P> <P> "Clearly, given the depressed state of the securities industry, the anticipated  lack of participation by individual investors and the mounting competition that  can be expected as commercial banks become more active due to the recent easing  of restrictions on their securities activities, the plan is a necessary step to  ensure our firm's future vitality," Drexel said.  </P> <P> The firm said by concentrating on its core businesses, "Drexel will be able to  maintain its role as the major factor in the underwriting of securities of  industrial companies." The firm also said it expects its financial condition to  remain one of the strongest in the securities industry.  </P> <P> Drexel confirmed that it plans to continue its present operations in  mortgage-backed securities, arbitrage, commodities and as a dealer of  government securities.  </P></p>

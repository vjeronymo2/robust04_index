			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Gated So Bill Gates, Wunderkind entrepreneur, co-founder of Microsoft and the richest man in the US, is not invincible after all. His well-flagged book on the future of the information highway, titled The Road Ahead, has taken a wrong turn on the way to publication. Viking, which is thought to have paid an advance of more than Dollars 2.5m for the rights to publish Gates's musings, now says that the book's release has been postponed - from November to next March. Also delayed - again - is the launch of Microsoft's next version of Windows PC software, which was originally scheduled for release in 1993 and is not now expected until May or June 1995. Could the latter have proved something of a distraction for the first-time author?</p>

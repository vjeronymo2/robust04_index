			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Frei on course for nominationin Chile MR Eduardo Frei, leader of Chile's Christian Democrats, looks set to secure the presidential nomination of the country's ruling coalition after primary elections on Sunday, Reuter reports from Santiago. He took more than 60 per cent of the votes of some 600,000 party members and supporters, electoral officials said. His Socialist rival, Mr Ricardo Lagos, received about 38 per cent, the officials said. Under the coalition's complex selection procedure, the votes on Sunday were assigned to delegates to cast at a final convention next Sunday. However, the winner last Sunday is sure of victory at the convention, where the coalition will unveil its campaign manifesto. The winner of the primary, the first in Chile, which returned to democracy in 1990 after 17 years of military rule, will be the strong favourite to become the next president, to be elected on December 11. Opinion polls before the primary gave Mr Frei, from the same party as President Patricio Aylwin, some 49 per cent of national support, compared to 3.5 per cent for his nearest right-wing rival. The polls also showed support from the ruling coalition's left-wing parties could mean Mr Frei taking more than two-thirds of the presidential vote. From Stockholm: A group of Chilean exiles protesting against a visit by President Aylwin hurled eggs at him during a demonstration in the centre of Stockholm yesterday. Organisations representing some of the 30,000 Chileans living in Sweden have stated Mr Aylwin is not welcome because of what they see as his moral support of the coup in Chile that toppled President Salvador Allende in 1973. Mr Aylwin repeated yesterday that he had never endorsed the coup.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song's famous work "Answers to questions raised  by the general director of the Latin America News Agency `PRENSA  LATINA'" was carried by the Nepalese paper HINDU DAINIK, the  Hungarian paper SZABADSAG and the Colombian paper VOZ.    A seminar on the work was held in Karachi, Pakistan.    In his report, Abdul Rahim Baluch, political adviser to the  prime minister of the Sind provincial government of Pakistan,  said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused when  the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea.  This is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the  DPRK, he said.    The United States recently manipulated the International  Atomic Energy Agency to adopt an unreasonable "resolution"  against the DPRK, he noted, adding that pressure can never be a  way of resolving the issue.</p>

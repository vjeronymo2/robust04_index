			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Critics fear effect of streamlining proposals - National Health Service Organisational change started by the government's 1991 reforms to the National Health Service will continue with the abolition of health authorities in their present form. England's eight surviving regional health authorities will be abolished by the health authorities bill. The authorities will be replaced by regional offices of the NHS executive, which is responsible for the daily running of the service. Although the aim is to streamline the central structure now that patient services are managed locally, critics fear the end of regional authorities may increase accountability problems. The bill will create about 100 multipurpose local health authorities in England. These will replace the existing 111 district health authorities - responsible for purchasing hospital and community services - and 92 family health service authorities, which handle the family doctor service. The authorities already work closely together in many parts of the country. Ministers say the cut in the number of regional authorities and other administrative changes have already saved Pounds 30m, and they expect further substantial management savings. The government intends to tighten sanctions on doctors who underperform with the medical act (amendment) bill. At present the General Medical Council, the profession's disciplinary body, can take action only if doctors are guilty of serious professional misconduct. The bill will extend its disciplinary powers to those whose performance is consistently poor.</p>

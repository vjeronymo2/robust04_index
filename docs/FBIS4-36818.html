			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah: </F> "Questions in Yemeni Streets About Benefit of Continuing War"]    [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Aden, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, SPA --  International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi yesterday concluded his  visit to Yemen and meetings with the parties to the war there  without being able to visit Aden as a result of the northern  bombardment of it. [passage omitted]    Brahimi ended his meetings with southern leaders with a  lunch  meeting yesterday in 'Ali Salim al-Bid's house. The meeting was  attended by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]; Foreign Minister  'Abdallah al-Asnaj; and Muhsin Bin-Farid, deputy prime minister  and planning minister.    Muhsin Bin-Farid told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone  from al-Mukalla yesterday that Brahimi met the day before  yesterday with representatives of the political parties and  organizations and ulemas. He also met with al-'Attas and  al-Asnaj, stressing that "his basic mission is to listen to the  southern leadership's view in the framework of the fact-finding  process." He was provided with a detailed memorandum on the  southern position.    Bin-Farid added that the southern leaders told Brahimi "of  the need to impose the will of international legitimacy on the  party violating the cease-fire" in accordance with Security  Council Resolution 924, which stipulates "an immediate halt to  the fighting and sitting at the negotiating table."    Bin-Farid said that the continuation of the fighting in  Yemen  -- despite Brahimi's visit -- "represents an attempt by Sanaa to  use the fighting as a means to seize more land in southern  governorates, while continuing to announce cease-fire  initiatives merely to deceive foreign public opinion and impose  a fait accompli." He also called for "adopting more powerful  resolutions to force it to halt the fighting."    The southern official said that DRY leaders raised during  their meetings with Brahimi the need to dispatch international  observers "to supervise and consolidate the cease-fire." He  said that "there have to be a third party in order to ascertain  the quarter violating the resolution." [passage omitted]</p>

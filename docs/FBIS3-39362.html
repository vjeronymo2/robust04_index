It must not be weakened under  any circumstances." These were the words of the inspector  general of the Bundeswehr, General Naumann, talking to officers  of the Moscow General Staff Academy yesterday.    He was trying to make his Russian audience appreciate that  for the Europeans, the alliance is an opportunity to develop a  "European security and defense identity." The Partnership for  Peace program initiated by NATO should offer all states outside  NATO an opportunity for cooperation, including Russia. In  unmistakably clear words, Naumann said: "It is the NATO of 16  that decides on admitting new members." In his opinion, Russia  cannot join.    Talking to Russian Chief of Staff Kolesnikov, Naumann got  the  impression that the "the NATO Partnership for Peace program is  viewed increasingly positive." In Naumann's view, the fact that  the Russian military leadership seems to be taking the West's  warnings to heart and is thinking of publishing the full text of  the military doctrine adopted last autumn is almost sensational.  During the German-Russian General Staff talks scheduled to be  held in Bonn mid- March, the German side wants to show its  appreciation for the Russians' openness by affording them  unrestricted access to the Bundeswehr's secrete defense concept.</p>

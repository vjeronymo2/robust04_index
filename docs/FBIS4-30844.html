			<p>BFN     [Text] During a routine check of a UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] vehicle at the Kasindol Street checkpoint, civilian  and military police of the Serbian Republic discovered a group  of people that are strongly suspected of smuggling on behalf of  the current authorities in Sarajevo.    Among the detainees is also an UNPROFOR member. The  detainees were carrying a large amount of foreign currency, and  it has been established that the suspects were charged with  purchasing equipment for the army and the police of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and that they had set off for the airport  with this intention, from where they were supposed to fly to  Zagreb. As the incumbent offices have reported, six people have  been arrested and detained in prison, among them (Angelo  Andrea), an Italian citizen who was in charge of the liaison  with correspondents in the UNPROFOR civilian sector.    The search has established that Savcinovic, Cakovic, and  Kujic all possessed UN press cards, while, as he claims, he had  the card of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from the  Muslim government because he was in charge of control of  humanitarian cargo in Frankfurt. [sentence as heard] A letter  was also found on Halilovic, which claims that Operation  Parachute will be stopped in a month. An investigation is under  way.</p>

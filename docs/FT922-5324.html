			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Mirror Group appoints Rowe &amp; Pitman as lead broker MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has appointed Rowe &amp; Pitman, part of the SG Warburg group, as its lead broker in place of Smith New Court ahead of a planned re-listing of the newspaper group on the London Stock Exchange later this month. The appointment, which was confirmed yesterday, weakens a link with the newspaper empire of the late Robert Maxwell that went back to Smith's involvement in MGN's Pounds 245m flotation in May 1991. Sir Michael Richardson, the chairman of Smith New Court, whose close personal contacts with Mr Maxwell brought the business to Smiths is also vice-chairman of Rothschilds, the merchant bank advising the Maxwell family in negotiations with its bankers. Smith New Court was asked to remain as a joint broker but MGN wanted a fresh start with new advisers. MGN was suspended in December at 125p, leaving administrators to Mr Maxwell's private interests with a controlling 51 per cent stake in the newspaper group. The stake is effectively owned by banks such as Midland and National Westminster because they were pledged as collateral to cover Maxwell debt. 'Advisers are now looking at nursemaid crisis management for the next phase of bringing MGN to re-listing,' a MGN source said. Their first task will be to protect shareholders from a potential share price collapse on re-listing, given that at least Pounds 150m stolen from Mirror pension funds will have to be replaced and Pounds 100m is missing from the company. In the next three weeks MGN's preliminary accounts for 1991, an annual report and re-listing particulars will be prepared. Advisers will then begin the not insubstantial task of convincing existing shareholders that MGN is strong enough to attempt to trade out of its problems. Mr John Talbot, the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests, said in January that there would be no early sale of the stake and that consideration would be given to a sale 'when comprehensive information is available from the board'. Shortly thereafter three groups independently ruled out buying MGN. They were Mercury Asset Management, the venture capital arm of SG Warburg, Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times and Mr Tiny Rowland's Lonrho group, publisher of The Observer. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special envoy Aissa G. Garcia] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- In addition to  attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Cuban President  Fidel Castro has conducted an intense program of bilateral  meetings that surpasses those of previous summits.    PRENSA LATINA has learned that the Cuban president met with  the leaders of Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. For Cuba,  these meetings have been useful and appropriate.    The situation in Cuba and in other countries, as well as the  contents and purpose of the Ibero-American summits, were the  topics that prevailed during these meetings.    It was learned that the Cuban president and his Honduran  counterpart, Roberto Reina, met early this morning and that the  meeting was very good. Cuba and Honduras broke diplomatic  relations in 1961 and since then only some sports and commercial  exchanges, as well as exchanges at the parliamentary level, have  been conducted.    The leader of the Cuban Revolution, the center of attention  during this summit, also met with Paraguayan President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy.</p>

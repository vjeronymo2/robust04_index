			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment" column] </F>   [Text] In just a little over 24 hours, the first votes in  South Africa's historic democratic all-inclusive elections will  be cast. It will mark the culmination of more than four years of  negotiations, nearly a century of struggle waged by the African  National Congress and the end of a tragic past. It will also  signal the beginning of a new future as we embark on a course in  pursuance of three imperatives -- reconciliation, reconstruction  and development. Without these, we run the risk of failing in  our historic duty to deliver the country from 46 years of  institutionalised apartheid.    We must move with all haste as we set off on this course and  consolidate the victory that we have won at such great cost.  There can be no time for complacency even on day-one of our  liberation. Serious dangers lurk ahead and any procrastination  in the execution of our historic responsibility could expose our  fragile democracy to all sorts of threats from forces both  outside and within the process. These threats must not be  underestimated, despite the public commitment by almost everyone  of apartheid's partners in the electoral process.    For them, the elections symbolise their most traumatic  moment  -- it will decisively strip them of the privileges and power  they have exercised with impunity and guarded jealously and  ruthlessly for so long. We therefore must not underestimate the  temptation among these forces to grab back that power -- both  now and in the next five years. One of the surest ways of  consolidating our victory is to gives it a material and tangible  character which the democratic majority will feel committed to  defending. But we cannot guarantee that the ANC will be able to  move with the necessary haste in consolidating the victory  unless it is sufficiently empowered in parliament to fend off  opposition from its partners in the government of national  unity, who simply have no history of commitment to democracy.  Their claim that they have shed the repressive baggage  accumulated over the past 46 years is unconvincing.    If in fact the National Party [NP] jettisoned this baggage  in  1990, when it unbanned the liberation movements, there is simply  no evidence to bear this out. No new houses have been built and  grossly uneven expenditure on education and health care for  blacks and whites remains very much a feature of the country  under NP rule since 1990. Violence continued to escalate each  year since 1990 with no convincing action being taken by the NP  to bring the bloodletting under control. To suggest that it  will begin to deliver after the election when it could not in 46  years and more recently in the four years after it underwent its  conversion, is simply unconvincing.    But this is not the only argument that the NP is using to  bolster its position in a democratic parliament. It has also  asked voters to vote for it in order to curb the power of the  ANC, which if left unchecked, will resort to communist rule, it  claims. But the NP is less than sincere in making this claim  because it has as recently as four years ago pronounced the  death of communism when justifying its unbanning of the SACP  [South African Communist Party]. To now project it as a threat  is not only inconsistent but transparently dishonest. Either  that, or the NP has stopped believing its own arguments.    Whichever way we look at it, the NP must not be allowed the  space to delay the liberation by blocking the ANC's  reconstruction efforts. Nor must the Democratic Party and  Inkatha, which co- managed suppression of democracy with the NP,  be allowed to postpone the liberation. We can only block the  initiatives of these parties by strengthening the hand of the  ANC, which has behind it more than 80 years of commitment to non  racialism, democracy, accountability and transparency.    DEFEND YOUR LIBERATION AND VOTE FOR THE ANC.</p>

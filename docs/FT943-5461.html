			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities The interim results season, which started in fine form last month, went off the boil a little this week. The City had become accustomed to all surprises being pleasant and was unsettled by some disappointing figures from leading companies. Apart from Vickers and Rolls-Royce, which are somewhat special cases, the disappointments tended to come from companies close to the consumer. Ladbroke saw profits collapse at its Texas DIY chain, though the betting side held up, and while several housebuilders reported an upturn in sales in August, the week brought evidence from building products companies that housing related markets remain extremely difficult. The pattern fits the wider economic picture, with exports and investments leading the recovery while consumer spending remains sluggish. The fact that Reckitt &amp; Colman's continental household products business did worse than expected while Williams Holdings' more broadly-based manufacturing companies did better suggests the rest of Europe may follow the same path. The equity market reacted quite calmly to the disappointments, with shares holding on to much of the gain made last week. But further setbacks for consumer stocks could widen their discount against general manufacturers. With input costs rising - and no sign of the retail inflation which would allow this to be passed on - analysts' forecasts for next year are starting to look ambitious.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Brussels VAT plan to be revealed soon The European Commission is to make recommendations by the end of October on whether value added tax should be levied on goods and services sold in the EU at the rate prevailing in the country of origin, Ms Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner for customs and indirect taxation, said yesterday. Ms Scrivener reaffirmed the Commission's commitment in principle to a shift to the 'origin system' of levying VAT. Speaking at a conference discussing the existing transitional VAT arrangements, she said that agreement to the change - which must be ratified by the council of ministers - would require that the new system would simplify obligations to business and ensure that there was no additional risk of fraud. The EU is theoretically committed to introducing the origin-based system to replace the existing transitional system of VAT harmonisation across Europe by the start of 1997.</p>

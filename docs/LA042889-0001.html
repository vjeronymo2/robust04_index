			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAR, WARMER DAYS DUE TO ADD UP FOR A NICE WEEKEND  </P> <P> Should be a nice weekend for the Southland, the forecasters said Thursday, with  slightly warmer temperatures today and Saturday and no rain in sight.  </P> <P> Highs both days will probably range from the mid-70s to the lower 80s,  according to meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times. However, Cooper noted, a low-pressure system  developing over the deserts should increase the on-shore wind currents, making  Saturday a little cooler at the beaches.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said there will probably be some low clouds and  local fog along the south coast late tonight and early Saturday.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Civic Center high Thursday was 70 degrees after an overnight  low of 51. Relative humidity ranged from 80% to 40%.  </P> <P> Southern California mountains and deserts should get winds up to 25 m.p.h.  afternoons and evenings for the next day or so.  </P> <P> Surf is expected to be 2 to 3 feet from Santa Barbara to San Diego today and  Saturday.  </P> <P> With no storms on the horizon and the normal rainy period slipping away, the  total rainfall for the season is a skimpy 8.03 inches. Normal to date is 14.53.  </P></p>

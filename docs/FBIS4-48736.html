			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare May 24 SAPA -- Zimbabwe has welcomed South  Africa's admission into the Organisation of African Unity, the  ZIANA news agency reported. In a statement on Tuesday, the  Foreign Affairs Ministry said Zimbabwe welcomed the admission of  Pretoria into the OAU "as the true fulfilment of the objectives  of the founding fathers of the organisation".    The OAU commemorates its 30th anniversary on Wednesday, a  public holiday in Zimbabwe.    The statement said with the exception of Western Sahara  where  people still had to exercise their inalienable right to national  self-determination, the African continent could now be said to  have finally rid itself of colonialism and and foreign minority  domination.</p>

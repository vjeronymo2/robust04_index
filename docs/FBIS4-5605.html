			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, visiting  vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, said Tuesday he believed that North Korea could not  develop nuclear weapons even if it wanted to because of Chinese  people's opposition.    The senior Chinese official said there would be no nuclear  war nor armaments on the Korean peninsula at a lunch meeting  with National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop.    "China is strongly opposed to it (North Korea's nuclear  weapons development)," he was quoted as saying. He stressed a  peaceful solution to the problem while acknowledging the  difficulties ahead.    Speaker Yi, saying China's growing economy would be affected  if war erupted on the Korean peninsula, reiterated Seoul's call  for Beijing to play a greater role in persuading Pyongyang to  give up its nuclear program.    Wu was invited to a dinner banquet later by ruling  Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil to meet  more DLP members.</p>

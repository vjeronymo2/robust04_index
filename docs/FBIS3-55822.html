			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Melor Sturua report: "Any President Needs a Devil's </F> Advocate"]    [Text] Minneapolis -- On the eve of his departure for West  Europe and Russia President Clinton met with a group of  political observers. The discussion was not only interesting  but instructive, since it touched not only on the essence but  the psychology of the problems which Clinton will encounter in  the course of his visit.    NEW YORK TIMES observer William Safire asked Clinton whether  there is anyone within his administration with a view different  from the Clinton-Christopher-Talbott line. In particular, is  there anyone who would dare say this to the White House  incumbent -- if you do not accept the East European countries  into NATO now, when Russia is weak, you will never be able to do  so when Russia is strong again.    Clinton's reply was very laconic -- nobody in my  administration holds such a view.    Justifying this policy, Clinton described himself as a  "force  for optimism," particularly as regards Russia's future. "I  believe," he said, "that if they continue as a democratic,  market-oriented, reformist, noninterventionist nation, they will  become a great power in the traditional sense of the word, and  not an empire.... The whole history, character, and texture of  Russia confirms this."    Unfortunately, the whole history, character, and texture of  Russia not only do not confirm this but resolutely refute it.  President Clinton's above statement demonstrates the danger  posed by the absence of a "devil's advocate" among his foreign  policy advisers on Russia -- someone who could somehow balance  the influence exerted by the former TIME observer, translator of  Khrushchev's memoirs, and friend from Clinton's Oxford student  days.    It would be interesting to know whether there is a "devil's  advocate" in President Yeltsin's entourage who, despite official  policy, would recommend that he not prevent the East European  countries from joining NATO. Speaking purely logically, there  clearly is such an adviser in the Kremlin or close to it. After  all, somebody prepared Boris Yeltsin's famous visit to the East  European capitals, his meetings, and the texts of the speeches  in which the Russian president by no means objected to his  hospitable hosts joining NATO.    Of course, it is possible to cite changed circumstances  since  then -- currently defined in both Russia and the West by the  single code word "Zhirinovskiy." Admittedly, everyone deciphers  that code in their own way. Moscow claims that expanding NATO  to cover East Europe would merely be grist to the mill of the  ultraright-wingers and fascists, resurrecting the dark shadows  of the policy of containment and even roll-back. Roughly  similar arguments are being used in Washington, which has  invented the elastic "Partnership for Peace" formula. Whereas  the East European capitals, on the contrary, see the  Zhirinovskiy factor as an argument in favor of NATO membership.    There is no room in this report to provide the extensive  arguments in favor of each approach. I believe that right is on  the side of Walesa and Havel rather than Yeltsin and Clinton --  and that it is reinforced by the whole history, character, and  texture of postwar international development. It is hard even  to imagine where Yalta would have led had NATO not negated its  effects. Of course, Yeltsin's Russia is not Stalin's Soviet  Union. But NATO membership for the East European countries  would make this transformation even more decisive, if not  irreversible.    One more point. Which is more important for peace in Europe  -- Poland or Portugal, the Czech Republic or Greece? Hypocrisy  dictates the reply that they are all important in their own way.  Real politics and history -- with its rich texture -- tell us  something else. But the fact is that, as was the case before  World War II, the United States is not sufficiently mature in  moral terms to fight for Warsaw or Prague even hypothetically.  (All the more so in the nuclear era). But it was this  reluctance to fight that was one of the main reasons why it  ultimately proved necessary to fight.    Oscar Wilde claims in one of his famous paradoxes that the  best way to avoid temptation is to give in to it. In politics  such paradoxes can be catastrophic. In politics it is better  not to tempt fate, but to put the tempters in their place from  the very outset. Whatever they may be called -- Hitler or  Zhirinovskiy. After all, Clinton is essentially not making a  concession to Yeltsin but placating Zhirinovskiy. At any event,  Vladimir Volfovich is entirely capable of drawing this  interpretation from Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" lifesaver.  Any concession which Clinton makes or will make to Yeltsin in  this area strengthens both objectively and subjectively not the  Russian president but his neofascist opponent.</p>

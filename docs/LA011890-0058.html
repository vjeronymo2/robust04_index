			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST L.A. FIRM FINED FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING  </P> <P> A West Los Angeles furniture manufacturing company has been ordered to pay  $10,000 in fines and restitution for illegally dumping hazardous materials at  its facility overlooking Ballona Creek.  </P> <P> The sentence was imposed on Don Alderson Associates Inc. last week as part of a  plea bargain in which charges against company President Donald Alderson and two  associates were dropped, said Deputy City Atty. Teresa Lujan.  </P> <P> The company agreed to enter no-contest pleas to single counts of illegally  disposing of hazardous waste and failing to maintain a contingency plan and  employee training plan for dealing with hazardous materials, according to  Lujan, who is handling the case.  </P> <P> The company was accused of dumping paint, paint thinner and other debris on the  ground along a chain-link fence at the rear of the factory at 3327 S. La  Cienega Place, which sits on an embankment overlooking Ballona Creek. The  company employs about 26 people at the site, where it manufactures handmade  specialty furniture for hotels, businesses and homes, Lujan said.  </P> <P> "It appeared that the illegal dumping had been going on for some time, since  the inspectors determined . . . that the paint contamination had soaked six to  eight inches deep into the soil," City Atty. James K. Hahn said in a statement  announcing the agreement.  </P> <P> Inspectors first issued a notice of violation during a visit Jan. 20, 1989, and  discovered evidence of further illegal dumping in the same location two months  later, Lujan said.  </P> <P> Lujan said Tuesday she allowed the three people to be released from liability  in the case because they had no prior record of violations and because they  came into "reasonably good" compliance.  </P> <P> The company's attorney, Aaron Rosen, said releasing the three without charges  was fair because they had no knowledge of the laws involved and came into  compliance as soon as they could.  </P> <P> The company also was placed on two years' summary probation by Los Angeles  Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada, Lujan said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Mr. 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, the  charge d'affaires of the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo, has stated  that operations at the embassy are back to normal today. He  said that all employees and diplomats have entered their offices  and have resumed their duties after an understanding was reached  with the former ambassador, 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, to allow them  to enter.    Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, a northerner who supports  the Yemeni Socialist Party of the south, had shut the embassy  doors last Wednesday and prevented the staff from entering to  protest Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's  decision to dismiss him and appoint the charge d'affaires, a  northerner, to run the embassy's affairs.    'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id said in a statement to MENA that the  monthly allowances of Yemeni students studying in Cairo were  disbursed today. These allowances were supposed to be disbursed  last week. In addition, consular services are being provided for  the Yemeni community in Egypt.    He added that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan is  still at his home, which is located above the embassy. The new  permanent representative to the Arab League, Ambassador Luqman,  today is also operating from his office at the embassy without  any problems.</p>

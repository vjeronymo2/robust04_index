			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD </F> Bundestag group, in the Bundestag in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen; the  situation in the former Yugoslavia continues to be disturbing.  People continue to be killed, displaced, arrested, and raped in  the war there. Nevertheless, and I do agree with the foreign  minister here, there are now chances for a political solution.  What has made me cautiously optimistic are the positive change  in the situation of Sarajevo, on the one hand, and, the  reopening of Tuzla Airport, on the other; and finally also the  fact that Croats and Bosnians have agreed on a joint federation.  This agreement might become the starting point for the  restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yet, Ladies and  Gentlemen, this is only realistic if it will, ultimately, be  possible to include the Bosnians Serbs in this process, too.  However, this does not seem likely at the moment.    Nevertheless, I am cautiously optimistic today, because, for  one thing, the Russians are apparently constructively  participating in the efforts to achieve a peaceful solution. I  have said apparently because it is indeed not very easy to  understand Russian foreign policy against the background of the  insecurities in domestic policy. The most differing statements  have been made in connection with Yugoslavia, even from the  ranks of the Russian Government. Still Russia's role, which has  been positive to date, should be honored. I think it is wise to  continue to include the Russians in the political process.  [applause]    On the other hand, it is evident that America's  determination  has increased. The Americans are today quite obviously ready to  intervene more actively than in the past -- politically and  militarily. Before, they were conspicuously reluctant to act  because -- as I think quite rightly -- they regarded the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia first and foremost as a  European problem. Yet, the Europeans were unable to achieve a  European solution to the problem. Foreign minister, without  wanting explicitly to criticize anybody, my assessment of  Europe's role is far more negative than yours. I do not want to  go as far as claiming -- which is also being done, and not only  in FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE -- that through their kind of conflict  management, the Europeans have even made the conflict worse.  Whether this is appropriate and what role German foreign policy  has played, will ultimately have to be clarified by historians.  I am, therefore, not asking whether one could not have settled  the conflict through a political solution at an earlier stage.    For today, I am saying that there may be a chance for a  solution, and I say it very clearly: there is such a chance and  mainly because, led by the United States and on behalf of the  United Nations, NATO has become politically and militarily  active. [applause]    Such military intervention is always problematic because it  is dangerous. There is the danger of escalation, which was  pointed out by the foreign minister -- and I agree. At the same  time, the statement remains true that the UN/NATO ultimatum did  work in Sarajevo, and one can only hope that the active  intervention in Gorazde, which the chairman of my party  described as necessary, will help to bring the Serbs to reason,  and -- I would like to add -- that it is not misunderstood by  the Bosnians as a sign of one-sided support.    Ladies and Gentlemen; the responsible officials on the  Serbian side should now consider very carefully what they intend  to do after the very cautiously sized UN military intervention.  First reactions are rather worrying. Yet, the United Nations  is not waging a war against the Serbian people, and neither is  NATO. Both, with NATO, incidentally, acting as an agent for the  United Nations, are protecting their own people who are engaged  in the difficult attempt to save lives in the conflict areas and  to create concrete conditions for a political solution of the  conflict.    The responsible people on the Serbian side should draw the  right conclusion and return to the negotiating table. German  diplomacy should contribute to this, also for example by using  its good, also personal, relations with the Russian Government.    Ladies and Gentlemen; putting an end to the suffering of  the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the real task of  German foreign policy. The German foreign minister should make  an effort toward this; he can count on our support in this  matter.    Ladies and Gentlemen; let me make another, somewhat bitter  remark in this connection. We are once again discussing  Yugoslavia here, somewhat more optimistically than on former  occasions. The situation there worries us. One reason it  worries us is that we see television pictures from there every  day. There are also a few pictures coming from Kigali. There  are hardly any pictures from Afghanistan and none from Angola,  where far more people have been killed in the ongoing civil war  than in former Yugoslavia. I would not like to make any  comparisons, and I am not judging. The so-called CNN effect  must, however, be taken into account in politics. Public opinion  is important. It is produced, and it influences national and  international actions. This influence must, however, not be a  determining one, because this would make us ask whether our  policies are morally justified. Morals is not the only  yardstick. What also counts is one's own interests and the  interests of one's partners. We should, however, avoid double  standards. [applause]    Let me say a final word, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our friend  Hans Koschnick will go to Mostar, probably in May, in order to  help with reconstruction there. This is not an easy task, but a  difficult, even dangerous one. The fact that you are available  for this task, dear Hans, proves your courage and great  humanitarian commitment. Thank you very much, and good luck.</p>

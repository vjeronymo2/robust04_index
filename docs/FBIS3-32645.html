			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arlete Milhomen] </F>   [Text] The Portuguese-speaking countries community probably  will be created before July. The foreign ministers of the seven  Portuguese-speaking countries -- Brazil, Portugal, Angola,  Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cape Verde  -- today signed a joint communique as the basis for the  establishment of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries.  The document has 13 points that are fundamental for the group's  implementation. The main items are: social, cultural, and  economic cooperation among the countries' inhabitants; the  implementation in the short term of the Portuguese Language  International Institute; and support for an immediate cease-fire  in Angola, where a civil war is under way.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said the community  will be a great opportunity to intensify relations among the  member countries. He added that it will not prevent them from  participating in other groups:    [Begin recording] Brazil, for example, which is currently a  UN Security Council member, has been acting in coordination with  other countries. It is necessary, however, to make this  coordination and common agreement more permanent then it is in  other forums. In Latin America, for example, we participate in  the Rio Group. Portugal is a EC member. The African  Portuguese-speaking countries are OAU members. Therefore, this  association will allow us to make better use of our common  efforts. [end recording]    The community of Portuguese-speaking countries will be  comprised of more than 200 million people spread over three  continents. In addition to the language, these peoples share  historic and ethnic traits. The community will become official  during a meeting of the member countries' chiefs of state, which  probably will be held in Lisbon before July.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / IoD slams CBI on works councils The Institute of Directors has criticised its rival employers' body, the Confederation of British Industry, for accepting the principle of a trans-national European works council for talks with employees. The issue of works councils, which has been a subject of intense debate for 20 years, comes to a head tomorrow when negotiations on the subject between Unice, the European employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress are set to break down. A breakdown will make it almost certain that the European Commission will pass a directive on the issue early next year. Although Britain's Maastricht treaty social 'opt-out' means UK companies will not be hit in the UK, 70 or 80 British multinationals will be effected in continental Europe and are unlikely to exclude their UK employees. The IoD is still, however, furious with the CBI, the largest single member of Unice, for conceding in negotiations that 'minimum requirements' can be enforced in the event of companies and employees failing to reach agreement. European employers have accepted the goal of consultation but insisted that there should be flexibility about how it is delivered. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, believes, however, that the wording of the latest Unice-ETUC agreement amounts to an 'own goal' in accepting a works council-type forum. Mr Morgan said: 'We urge the CBI and other national employer organisations in the member states of the EU to rethink their position on Unice's negotiations with the ETUC and to oppose proposals which would require companies to set up union-dominated works councils.' The IoD believes that even if the ETUC rejects the Unice position next week  -because of disagreements about the level in the company at which the works council should operate - European companies will find it more difficult to argue against the idea.</p>

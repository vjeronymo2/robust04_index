It has also signed contracts to export a  300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Shanghai is  becoming China's major nuclear power equipment manufacturing  base.    In developing its nuclear power industry, Shanghai has  invested nearly 200 million yuan and has built a number of  fairly large nuclear power infrastructure projects. It has  built factory buildings with a total floor space of 93,000  square meters, including seven 100-400-tonne-class factory  buildings. Since 1988, Shanghai has allocated over 3 million  yuan in financial credits for tackling scientific and  technological projects in nuclear power development. By the end  of last year, it had defined 88 projects, of which 62 had passed  appraisal tests. Meanwhile, the relevant ministries,  commissions, and offices of the State Council have assigned to  Shanghai 11 problems for the development of a 600,000-kilowatt  nuclear power plant -- a key project to be tackled in the  state's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). They have also  allocated over 12 million yuan to improve Shanghai's ability to  manufacture nuclear power equipment.    Shanghai has earmarked another 200 million-odd yuan in the  Eighth Five-Year Plan for gradually developing Shanghai's  production capability so that it can turn out between one and  one and a half sets of nuclear power plant equipment annually  during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).</p>

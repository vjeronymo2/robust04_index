			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street swamped by orders deluge - Rush of new corporate offerings A rush of offerings spurred by the latest US interest rate cut has left the US corporate bond market suffering from a bout of indigestion. After the Labor Day holiday on September 7, Wall Street's investment bankers returned to find a deluge of orders on their desks from companies keen to take advantage of the lowest interest rates in three decades. But the heavy supply of paper has overwhelmed demand, leaving many banks with unsold stock on their books. The turmoil in European markets last week further slowed buying, as investors pondered the implications for US interest rates. In the last two weeks, the volume of new issues has totalled more than Dollars 16bn. Some of the biggest names of corporate America led the way, including General Motors Acceptance Corporation, BankAmerica, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Wal-Mart Stores and Pacific Bell. This latest stampede - there have been several similar rushes this year - followed the cut in the Federal funds rate (the interest rate banks charge on overnight loans to each other) two weeks ago from 3.25 per cent to 3 per cent. The extremely low cost of funds in the capital markets has delighted corporate finance officers at leading companies, which have been able to refinance debt issued in the 1980s at much higher rates. So far 1992 has been a banner year for the corporate bond market, with more than Dollars 220bn of new issues. After the previous Fed cut, in early July, the market enjoyed its second busiest month ever with Dollars 28.4bn of debt issued. The previous rate cut, last December, led to January's record total of Dollars 34.8bn. Issuers are now in a hurry, fearful that if they do not move fast a prolonged backlog of orders will widen the interest rate spreads over Treasuries on new issues and push up their funding costs. As Mr Richard Dubusc, a managing director with First Boston in New York, puts it: 'There's a sense that the early bird will get the worm in terms of spread execution.' It could even get busier if the Fed cuts the discount rate or continued economic weakness brings market rates down further. Some issuers appear to be holding out for such an eventuality. Mr Joe MacHale, managing director at JP Morgan in New York, says: 'There's a significant number of corporations who think that rates will go still lower, and I'm not so sure they're wrong.' The longer term outlook is cloudier. There is little chance that interest rates will rise significantly over the rest of the year - the economy is in too weak a state to envisage it - but market yields could steadily inch higher if political shock waves from the presidential election rattle financial markets. Treasury investors are concerned that if the Democratic nominee, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, wins the election, his fiscal plans for next year could lead to an increase in the budget deficit. Much of the impact of a Clinton victory has already been factored into Treasury prices, however. As one Wall Street banker put it: 'Increasingly the view here is that it's Clinton's election to lose.' That said, if Mr Clinton looks a sure bet nearer election day on November 3, the market could react by pushing rates higher. Given the uncertain outlook, many companies may decide to bring any plans for debt issues forward. Mr Dubusc says: 'The dollar's a concern to people, the election's a concern, so there's a lot of reasons to move now.' But investors, faced with the deluge of new issues, are becoming increasingly choosy. The low level of rates has increased their appetite for deals which offer sizeable margins over US Treasury yields. 'Investors face an invidious choice,' observed one investment banker. 'Mortgage products offer higher yields, but with the latest drop in interest rates, there is likely to be a wave of refinancing (which triggers the early prepayment of mortgage deals).' With spreads on corporate bonds trading at relatively tight levels, some investors have voted with their feet. 'There have been some aggressively priced deals which have not been placed, which has put spreads under pressure (to widen),' said one syndicate official at a US bank. For example, a Dollars 400m seven-year offering for Ford Motor Credit priced at 68 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield has widened to 78 basis points.</p>

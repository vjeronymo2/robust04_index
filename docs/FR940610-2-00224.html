These include paraprofessional personnel, therapeutic recreation specialists, school social workers, health service providers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, school psychologists, counselors (including rehabilitation counselors), interpreters, orientation and mobility specialists, respite care providers, art therapists, volunteers, physicians, and other related services personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projects to train personnel identified as special education personnel in the regulations in this part are not appropriate, even if those personnel may be considered related services personnel in other settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This priority is not designed for general training.

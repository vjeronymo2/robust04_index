			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Brussels 24 May -- "The aim of the Russian nuclear  policy is to eliminate the threat of nuclear war by preventing  an aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies,"  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told NATO leaders and  defence ministers today in a report on major provisions of the  Russian military doctrine.    In his words, Russia considers nuclear arms as a means of  deterrence and not combat operations. The Russian Federation  was not the first to confirm the Soviet obligation of non-use of  nuclear arms, but this does not mean a transition to the concept  of preventive uses of nuclear arms. It shows the Russian  determination to prevent a large-scale war against the Russian  Federation and its allies.    The minister refuted claims that russia can be the first to  use nuclear arms even in a limited conflict. The minister said  that the Russian Federation is striving to cut the nuclear force  to minimum that would guarantee strategic stability, and fully  eliminate these arms in future.    "The political fundamentals of the Russian military doctrine  reflect two interrelated tasks -- prevention of a war and  readiness to repulse an aggressor," said the minister.    In his words, Russia rejects any war, the use of military  force or a threat of its use as a means to achieve political,  economic or other goals. It stands for the obligation of all  states not to be the first to use military force. All  disputable issues must be settled only with political and  diplomatic means, stressed the Russian minister.    "Russia proceeds from the fact that a possibility of local  and regional wars, as well as armed conflicts in specific states  because of nationalistic, ethnic, territorial, religious and  other contradictions remains," said the Russian minister.    In his opinion, the increase of aggressive nationalism in  various areas of the world is the most dangerous challenge to  regional and international stability.    The Russian Federation plans active interaction with the  commonwealth states in collective defence and security,  coordination of military policy and defence building. This area  of cooperation is a priority of Russia, he said.    The Russian military doctrine confirms a possibility of  Russian participation in peace-making operations held on  decision of the United Nations Security Council. Russian  security may also require the location of troops and technical  means outside the Russian Federation.    Russia considers all states, whose policy does not affect  its  interests and does not run counter to the U.N. charter, its  partners in provision of peace and consolidation of  international security.</p>

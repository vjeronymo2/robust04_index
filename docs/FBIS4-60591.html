			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopefully, A New Accomodation in India-U.S. </F> Relations"]    [Text] One week ago, before he departed for the world's  second largest democracy, few people could have predicted the  outcome of the trip being undertaken by the Prime Minister of  the largest democracy. While Cassandras predicted doom and  disaster, more sober Opposition politicians mildly rebuked Mr PV  Narasimha Rao for undertaking such a venture at this point of  time. Precisely a week later, Mr Rao is returning home after  his American sojourn to thunderous applause. By all accounts,  this has been his most successful foreign trip--indeed, he has  excelled himself, providing a glimpse of a determined elder  statesman that nobody knew lurked behind his persona of a  brooding and dithering politician.    Whether at the various meetings he had with American  businessmen or in his fine speech to the U.S. Congress, Mr  Narasimha Rao exhibited a confidence that reflected the  indomitable spirit of India: He portrayed himself as the  epitome of all that modern India stands for; he carried with him  a message not from a Third World country but a developing  economy which stands on the threshold of emerging as tomorrow's  economic giant. Any residual images of India that may have  lingered in the U.S. of the PL 480 days, were wiped away by the  strength of conviction with which he spoke: He appealed without  cringing; he beseeched without pleading; and, he demanded the  attention that has been denied all these years of people who  matter. Not surprisingly, at the end of the day, he has earned  the respect and admiration of at least one section of American  society-- the business community--which also happens to be  extremely influential.    In fact, it can be said with a degree of certainty that the  immediate effect of Mr Narasimha Rao's visit will be felt in the  realm of trade and commerce between the two countries. If the  response of American businessmen and industrialists to the Prime  Minister's statements is any indication, then they can be  expected to push aside all doubts that may still exist about the  future of economic liberalisation in this country and invest in  the Indian market. Therefore, before the year is over, the  total amount of American investment in India could well be many  times over the present level of $1.1 billion. This is, of  course, a supposition that is dependent upon many variables, but  it will be extremely surprising if there is no upsurge in  American investment in the Indian economy.    However, no such certainty can be applied in the other  crucial area of Indo-American relations. For, official U.S.  Administration policy towards India will not necessarily be  influenced by a single summit meeting and it will be incorrect  to judge developments on this front on the basis of improved  trade and investment. After all, while industrialists and  businessmen have a narrow perspective and are goaded by the  profit motive, politicians have to take into account larger  issues and are prompted by imperatives that may be of little  interest to the former. This difference is best exemplified by  the fact that while American investors are loath to get bogged  down with issues like human rights violations, the U.S.  Administration cannnot but rake up such issues from time to time  despite the negative fallout this invariably has on bilateral  relations. If further elaboration is needed, it can be found in  Sino-American relations.    But neither is there any reason to believe that official  American policy will remain entirely unaffected and that White  House will persist with the status quo. American business is  known to have greatly influenced foreign policy in the past and  it is more than likely that those who dream of multiplying their  wealth with the help of the Indian market will be more than  eager to bring about pressure on policy-makers not to upset the  apple cart. To that extent, Mr Narasimha Rao has skilfully  sought to win over American businessmen and industrialists,  fully aware of the fact that at moments of crisis they can prove  to be effective allies and protect India's interests. Even  otherwise, despite persisting differences, a greater  understanding of India's position can be expected on issues like  nuclear nonproliferation, the missile programme and Kashmir. As  much was evident from the tone and tenor of Mr Clinton's  comments at the post-summit Press conference and those of  officials later.    More importantly, Mr Narasimha Rao's trip has initiated a  process that could yield rich dividends for India in the long  run. For instance, the planned visits by high-level officials  of the U.S. Administration over the next one year can only take  the dialogue for constructive cooperation to its logical  conclusion. No less important is the demonstrative value of  such interaction: The message of joint Indo-U.S. military  exercises, if they come about, to subcontinental countries  inimical towards India cannot be overemphasised. However, one  area that will continue to cause some amount of friction is  American policy on Pakistan and its fallout on the  sub-continent. Although Mr Clinton has stressed that the  Kashmir issue has to be ultimately solved through bilateral  negotiations, a point that has been reiterated in the communique  (which interestingly validates the same Shimla Agreement that  was not so long ago rubbished by the Assistant Secretary of  State, Ms Robin Raphel), he has shown an ambivalent attitude  towards Islamabad's role in sponsoring terrorism in the Valley.    Both Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton, one an elderly  politician groomed in the Cold War era and the other a  representative of the baby boomers' generation, have shown  exemplary effort to check the downslide in relations between the  two countries and start a new chapter that will be written over  the next few years. Neither of them may be in office by the  time the last line of this chapter is written, but hopefully  their efforts will ensure that it ends on a happy note of mutual  accommodation.</p>

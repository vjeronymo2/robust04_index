			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUTERS' RESISTANCE TO CAR POOLING  </P> <P> In Eric Bailey's story, he wryly noted that "car-pool prophets" are merely  waiting for people to become so fed up with traffic that they'll turn to  ride-sharing on their own.  </P> <P> Actually, we prophets know that'll never happen. The only way people will share  their work commute is if there are tangible incentives, such as time-savings  realized from car-pool lanes or cash bonuses from their employer. Without those  perks, why would anyone give up his solo commute and car pool, only to sit in  the same traffic with everyone else?  </P> <P> KENNETH TAKEDA, Manager, Commuter Network, Orange County Transit District  Ride-Sharing Division  </P></p>

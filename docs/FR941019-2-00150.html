			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Pilkington plc is not the name of the member of the Pilkington Group with whom Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor contracted in the License Agreements. Therefore, it is possible that Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor is neither a ``Licensee'' nor a ``U.S. Licensee'' because its contractual privity is with a subsidiary or predecessor of ``Pilkington'' instead of with Pilkington plc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> What is Commenting Party's and What Will Be Future Assignees'/Sublicensees' Status? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Even if a reader is to assume that the definitional flaw noted above does not exist, Commenting Party's and any other future assignee's/sublicensee's status apparently will not change because none of them will have privity of contract with ``Pilkington'' no matter how ``Pilkington'' is defined. Therefore, unless the Final Judgment is changed, Commenting Party and all future assignees/sublicensees will only be ``U.S. Non-licensees.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Why Are U.S. Non-licensees Who Enter Into Assignments/Sublicenses Under Pilkington License Agreements Not Expressly Protected Against The Enforcement of Limitations? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It appears that DOJ believes that the prohibitions involving the enforcement of ``Limitations'' will result in the assignment/sublicensing of ``Float Technology'' required to construct and operate competitive Float Glass plants. These prohibitions, however, apply only to the allegedly anti-competitive activities of the defendants against U.S. Licensees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Final Judgment Article IV.A. The protections relevant to U.S. Non-licensees are set out in Article IV.B. of the Final Judgment. Article IV.B. does not prohibit the Defendants asserting Limitations against U.S. Non-licensees! Thus, if Article IV.A. permits U.S. Licensees to assign/sublicense Float Technology, nowhere does Article IV.B. enable the prospective assignees/sublicensees who may become new owners/operators of Float Glass plants to exercise free from suit the rights they might hope to acquire in an assignment/sublicense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article IV.B.1 appears to apply only to a subclass of U.S. Non-licensees  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  employees, contractors, suppliers, consultants, etc., who, as a group, have entirely different interests than prospective owner/operators of Float Glass plants. In substance Article IV.B.1. addresses only provisions of Agreements respecting Confidentiality or non-competition. Since only the protections of Article IV.B.2. appear to apply to assignees/sublicensees, the only subjects that the Defendants can't make claims about against such U.S. Non-licensees relate to proprietary Float Technology know-how rights that Pilkington  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> has in fact disclosed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  to someone who in fact fits the definition of U.S. Licensee, and which are not bona-fide trade secrets under ``applicable law'' (as to which Pilkington may still enforce its rights under Article IV.B.2.). The protected class of intellectual property is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements under which Commenting Party and others similarly situated would want to derive rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Final Judgment is to be read these ways, the Defendants will be able to claim against assignees/sublicensees that their assignment/sublicense agreements and/or practice of Patents covered by such assigned/sublicensed Pilkington License Agreements are, among other things: wholly invalid, were obtained in breach of Pilkington's Patent rights. (Article IV.H. of the Final Judgment expressly preserves all of Pilkington's Patent claims). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Why Do the Protections Intended By The Concept of Limitations Not Expressly And Literally Include Assignments and Sublicenses? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, DOJ appears to believe that the elements of the final judgment will lead to assignment/sublicense agreements concerning Float Technology. Surprisingly, the Final Judgment does not literally say anything of the kind. We could not find any reference to assignments or sublicenses. As DOJ has noted, the License Agreements with members of the Pilkington Group contain express, literal prohibitions respecting assignment and sublicensing. The Defendants have reserved their rights respecting matters not ``expressly'' covered by the Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Article IV.I. of the Final Judgment. Institutional lenders or investors who may be asked to lend to or invest in prospective Float Glass industry entrants can be expected to look for express, literal language in the Final Judgment to counter the express, literal provisions of the License Agreements. Finding them absent, they will refuse to lend or invest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Limitations'' is defined by Article II.K. of the Final Judgment without any use of the words ``assignment'' or ``sublicensing.'' The word ``use'' appears in the definition but as Commenting Party has shown above, the word ``Limitations'' is used only in Article IV.A. with respect to U.S. Licensees and not their contracting parties,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  their prospective assignees/sublicensees are U.S. Non-licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment uses the word ``sublicensing'' but appears to do so only in connection with ``Subject Float Technology.'' As defined, ``Subject Float Technology'' appears to encompass only ``know-how'' (see above discussion). Therefore, Float Technology that is Patent technology or that was subject to disclosure by Pilkington but not in fact disclosed is not encompassed by Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenting Party notes, in passing, that Article IV.A.3.(b) curiously refers to ``transferring'' and ``transferees'' of Float Technology without thereby telling the reader what such words encompass or connecting them to other Articles of the Final Judgment. This creates further ambiguity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assignments/sublicenses and the role DOJ expects them to play are too important for the Final Judgment to treat them ambiguously or even silently. As noted above, the Defendants seem to retain important rights to sue. These rights appear to be strongest on subject relating to Patents and provisions of the Final Judgment that are not ``express'' enough. Commenting Party believes that without changes to the Final Judgment no prospective assignee/sublicensee can be given any clear assurances that the Final Judgment prohibits the Defendants from suing them for attempting to enter the Float Glass industry. Why would anyone risk investing in or lending to an entity which cannot receive or provide assurances that its ostensible assignment/sublicense under a Licensee Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group protects it from suits by the Defendants? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unfortunately, even if ``Limitations'' is changed to literally permit assignments/sublicenses, under Article IV.A. its protections extend only to U.S. Licensees. As Commenting Party has shown above, the protections afforded to U.S. Non-licensees appear in Article IV.B. of the Final Judgment. Again, the needed words of art ``assignment'' or ``sublicense'' do not appear there. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, DOJ may intend that the Final Judgment will be interpreted to permit assignment/sublicensing of Float Technology that is either or both licensed Patent technology or know-how technology, but, under the express, literal terms of the Final Judgment, the assignee/licensee clearly has protection only with respect to non-Patented know-how that was in fact disclosed by Pilkington plc to a person, company or entity that is a U.S. Licensee. In Commenting Party's case, it appears the Final Judgment is too narrow in application to encompass Commenting Party's rights under its assignment and/or sublicense agreement. If Commenting Party were to consider further assigning/sublicensing its rights under the relevant Agreements, Commenting Party could not assure any prospective sub-assignee/sub-sublicensee that the Final Judgment affords them any protection against the restrictions contained in such Agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the ambiguous phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* other than Float Technology *&blank;*&blank;*'' in the definition of ``Subject Float Technology'' threatens the entire concept. Is it intended that if the Pilkington  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Group disclosed Flat Technology to LOF, then such Float Technology is not ``Subject Float Technology'' even though such Float Technology was also disclosed to AFG, PPG or Ford? This shouldn't be the case. Presumably, the intent was to exclude  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  the Float Technology that was  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was also a Pilkington plc subsidiary at the time of disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenting Party does not believe that DOJ intended any of these unfavorable interpretations. If DOJ wants there to be assignees and/or sublicensees of License Agreements deriving from Agreements between any of the named Licensees and any member of the Pilkington Group, then the prohibitions respecting ``Limitations'' must be extended to this class of persons, companies and entities. The defects noted in this analysis can be eliminated by modest changes to the definitions of ``Pilkington'', ``U.S. Licensee'', ``U.S. Non-licensee'', ``Limitations'' and ``Subject Float technology.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Final Judgement should be changed so that the Named Licensees listed in Article II.A.2. of the Competitive Impact Statement are in fact encompassed by the definition of ``Licensee/'' This is best accomplished by expanding the definition of ``Pilkington.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article II.N. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N. ``Pilkington'' means Defendants Pilkington plc, Pilkington Holdings Inc. and their past, present and future predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. If DOJ intends to vest in prospective assignees/sublicensee of U.S. Licensees the benefits of Agreements that grant rights under License Agreements entered into with a member of the Pilkington Group, then the term ``U.S. Licensee'' should include all persons, companies or entities who derive rights from any chain of Agreements that extend ultimately to a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group. This will enable contracting parties to obtain licenses under patents whose vitality extends into the next century and protect such parties from any anti-competitive assertion of the Patent rights expressly reserved to the Defendants at Article IV.H. of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article II.I. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. ``Licensee'' means any person, company, or entity that has either (1) entered into a License Agreement with Pilkington; (2) become an assignee and/or sublicensee under a License Agreement with Pilkington; or (3) become an assignee and/or sublicensee under a License Agreement with any Licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The definition of ``Non-licensee'' contains the overly restrictive concept of privity of contract,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ``*&blank;*&blank;* not entered into a[n] *&blank;*&blank;* Agreement with Pilkington.'' The definition should merely encompass all persons, companies or entities who are not in a chain of Agreements extending ultimately to an original Pilkington License Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article II.L. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L. ``Non-licensee'' means any person, company, or entity which is not a Licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Article II.K. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K. ``Limitations'' means: (1) Any limitation or restriction, or purported restriction or limitation under any License Agreement with Pilkington or other Agreement or in any other form respecting territories, fields, markets, or customers for the design and construction, or supervision of construction, or ownership of Float Glass plants, or the manufacture and sale of Float Glass; and/or (2) any restriction or limitation, or purported restriction or limitation under any License Agreement with Pilkington or other Agreement or in any other form respecting the assignment, licensing, sublicensing or other use of Float Technology, whether the result of an affirmative prohibition or a limited authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Article II.P. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P. ``Subject Float Technology'' means Patented or Unpatented Float Technology that in relation to any given Licensee was licensed, was subject to disclosure or was in fact disclosed to that Licensee under an Agreement with either Pilkington or any other Licensee other than Float Technology disclosed by Pilkington plc only to any U.S. Licensee while such U.S. Licensee was a subsidiary of Pilkington plc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

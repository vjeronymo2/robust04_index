			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ICG to float with Pounds 100m price tag Intermediate Capital Group yesterday issued a pathfinder prospectus for a placing and intermediaries offer that will value the provider of mezzanine capital to unquoted companies at more than Pounds 100m. The flotation will raise about Pounds 30m, some Pounds 18m of which will repay existing preference holders. The size of the intermediaries offer will depend on the level of interest from retail investors. The four founding shareholders will retain about 80 per cent of their stakes and hold between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the company after the float. ICG said yesterday that Mr Eric Kinder, chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, will join the board as a non-executive director.</p>

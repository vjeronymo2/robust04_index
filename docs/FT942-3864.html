			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Haiti flights cut President Clinton has cut off US commercial air traffic to Haiti and imposed a ban on financial transactions in a bid to further isolate Haiti's military rulers and force them to step down. Canada also said that it would halt commercial flights to Haiti on the same day the US does: June 25. France, the Dominican Republic, Panama and the Netherlands also have flights to Port-au-Prince. In retaliation Haiti's military-backed government said it would close the country's airport to all flights five days before the ban goes into effect.</p>

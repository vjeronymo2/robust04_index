			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In the mid '80s Charles Villiers painted a Mr. Potato Head everyman who  wandered urban and desert landscapes with a direct and primitive appeal. His  clever Duchampian sculptures threatened a function but had none. Current  constructions merge large paintings with wood, bones, fake pears, fake fur and  rubber. His painting technique has grown in sophistication and his visual  lexicon is more complex, but the net effect is somehow less compelling and  fresh.  </P> <P> Imagery includes a large, loosely worked takeoff of one of Van Gogh's self  portraits, precious little plaques with trompe l'oeil fish and shells studded  with rhinestones ("Fish and Shell I") and a whole battery of long-necked  woman-creatures that wear fatigues, paint, contemplate archetypal shelters or  smile demurely from carefully drafted heads taken from recognizable Renaissance  and Mannerist works. Only in "Born Mammal" is there a glimmer of the personal  voice that gave earlier works their resonance. (Natoli-Ross Gallery, 2110  Broadway, to July 1.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

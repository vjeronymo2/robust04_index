			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "War Frenzies of Civilian </F> Warmongers"]    [Text] The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets  are more viciously maneuvering to provoke a new war as time goes  by. According to reports, on 21 February, the U.S. imperialists  flew an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, stationed in a  base in Okinawa, Japan, over the skies of Pochon, Yanggu,  Kansong, and other areas of South Korea and conducted aerial  photographing and electronic reconnaissance over the strategic  depth and inland areas [chollyakchok chongsimjidaewa  naeryukchidae] on the northern half of the Republic.    That night, puppet Army ground units based in Ha-ri and  Wondang-ri of Yonchon County fired approximately 50 rounds of  flare bombs into the skies, conducted a war exercise for  northward aggression, and indulged in war frenzies. Also,  puppet Army large-caliber artillery units and armed bandits  which had been deployed in Nosang-ri in Paju County; Chungsa-ri  in Yonchon County; and Chorwon-up in Chorwon County of South  Korea incited a war atmosphere, firing hundreds of bullets and  shells in the areas adjacent to the DMZ.    Also that day, the armed helicopters and transport  helicopters of the puppet armed forces, which were deployed to  the skies over Chongwon-ri in Paju County and Majon-ri of  Yonchon County, frantically conducted an exercise to support and  transport ground attack units. These war commotions by the U.S.  imperialists and South Korean puppets are very ominous  [simsangchi annun] movements that can take place only on the eve  of war. They also clearly show how frantically the bastards are  maneuvering to provoke a new war.    As everybody knows, all fellow countrymen in the North and  South and abroad who pursue to achieve reunification in the  nineties declared this year to be a year of great national unity  and are making every effort to ease tension on the Korean  peninsula and achieve national unity.    Peace-loving people from all strata of life in the world  earnestly hope that tension will be eased and that a new phase  will open for the fatherland's reunification this year.  However, the South Korean puppets' policy of doing something  about someone else by using military forces has not changed.  Rather, they turn a blind eye to the fellow countrymen's  earnest desire for peace and reunification, babble about someone  else's armed provocations, and more frantically maneuver for  arms buildup and northward invasion.    As a matter of fact, it is the South Korean puppets who  attempt armed provocations on the Korean peninsula. Talking  about preparations for actual warfare or preparations for quick  reaction, they hold confabs to prepare the regular armed forces  for combats and prepare the paramilitary forces for combat  mobilization. They also accelerate the maneuvers to increase  war budgets and bring Patriot missiles into South Korea, and  plan to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise or any  other large-scale military exercises.    As a matter of fact, even though it calls itself a civilian  regime, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique pursues confrontation and  war more persistently than the previous military dictatorial  regimes.    The war exercise commotions which the South Korean puppets  are successively kicking up in the DMZ and in its vicinity are a  deliberate provocation maneuver to further aggravate tension on  the Korean peninsula and, thus, ignite a fuse to war. They are  also a vicious challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspirations  for peace and peaceful reunification and an unforgivable  antinational, antireunification crime.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is kicking up war commotions  to pursue other purposes, as well. The Kim Yong-sam ring is  denounced and condemned and in deep crisis, because of its  antinational, treacherous opening of the rice markets; the  dirty-water scandal, which erupted early this year; a  large-scale fraudulence case, and a series of gang robberies.    The daily growing resistance and anger of the people, along  with the struggle for independence, democracy, and  reunification, are further driving the traitorous Kim Yong-sam  group to a predicament. Therefore, the puppets are kicking up  war commotions daily to suppress the people's growing struggle  and resolve an aggravating crisis facing its rule. This is  proven by the fact that by mobilizing the puppet armed forces in  downtown Seoul, the Kim Yong-sam ring conducted an exercise  involving the movement of armored personnel carriers and  military vehicles of various other sorts, paraded troops [tobo  haengjin], and fired blank shots at random.    However, the puppets' dirty plot to find an exit in beefing  up their war maneuvers against their fellow countrymen and their  fascist rule will never work. The youth and students and people  from all other walks of life in South Korea are vigorously  waging an antiwar struggle against the reckless maneuvers by the  civilian warmongers to provoke a new war.    The war maneuvers by the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique which  challenge the people's aspirations and earnest desire will  arouse great anger from the people and hasten their destruction.</p>

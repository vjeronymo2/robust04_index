			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): 'Big three' battle it out - London, Tokyo and New York dominate in their time slots A FINANCIAL market which never closes, knows no national boundaries and is beyond the control of governments; such is the popular image of the foreign exchange market. But this is only half true. It is also a market where a large proportion of the business is divided between three large centres, each striving to expand their share of business in the world's largest market. London, Tokyo and New York together account for two-thirds of total foreign exchange business. In the 24-hour market, these three dominate dealing in their own eight-hour slot. London is the major centre in the European time zone, Tokyo in the Asian and Pacific basin and New York in North America. For the big three, it is dominance in their own time zone which accounts for their success. Nevertheless, there is competition between the big three and it is at its most intense when the markets briefly overlap. The ranking of the three is one of the hottest conversation topics in the market. The last official survey was conducted in 1989 by the Bank for International Settlements. It estimated a global net daily turnover of Dollars 640bn, divided between the UK (daily turnover Dollars 187bn), US (Dollars 129bn) and Japan (Dollars 115bn). The remaining Dollars 311bn divided between another 11 centres, with Switzerland accounting for Dollars 57bn, Singapore Dollars 55bn and Hong Kong Dollars 49bn, with the others lagging behind. It is impossible to be precise about what has taken place since the 1989 survey, although some important trends can be identified. Foreign exchange managers say that since the 1989 survey, London has maintained or even increased its dominance in currency trading. But Tokyo has caught up with (and possibly overtaken) New York as the second largest centre and appears to be growing at a faster rate than London and New York. 'There is no doubt that London still remains the largest market for both inter-bank and corporate currency business', says Mr Doug McGregor, senior manager of corporate services at Barclays Bank. According to Mr McGregor, Barclays' gross turnover in foreign exchange has increased to a daily average in the fourth quarter of Dollars 19bn, compared with Dollars 16bn at the time of the BIS survey. This has taken place in spite of the dollar trading for much of the time in a steady range against the major currencies. London, after all, has built its reputation as the largest centre in which to trade dollars. In spite of the relative stability of the dollar, total foreign exchange turnover has not fallen. In fact, foreign exchange managers say it is still increasing. This points to the dynamism of the currency market. In 1989, nearly 90 per cent of deals were conducted in dollars. Foreign exchange traders have responded to the relative stability of the dollar by developing a range of different currency rates to deal in, notably the D-Mark/yen, D-Mark/Swiss franc and D-Mark/sterling. There has also been a growth of interest in the Canadian and Australian dollars. The growth in European currency trading has also been helped by the lifting of the remaining foreign exchange controls in France, Spain and (partly) Italy. London's ability to develop in this area has allowed it remain the largest foreign exchange centre. According to Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank, these cross rates can sometimes account for up 50 per cent of the day's trading, which is an important change on 1989. This has partly been at the expense of other European financial centres. Increasingly, European central banks have to monitor the movements in the London market. Currency dealers say some European central banks have become frustrated at the lack of liquidity in their own national centres. Their important interventions in the currency markets, required by membership of the European Monetary System, are beginning to take place in London. Today, a large part of the market in French francs, Swiss francs, lire and pesetas is in London. The main exception to this seems to be the yen/mark rate, which has grown in interest and is probably now in top five most actively traded currency rates. This would appear to be a truly global market, with turnover split fairly evenly between London, New York and Tokyo, although Tokyo probably has the edge. However, the dollar remains the world's most important currency and dominates the market. The dollar/mark rate is still the busiest exchange rate, closely followed by dollar/yen. Dollar/sterling, dollar/Swiss franc and yen/mark take third, fourth and fifth places. The importance of dollar/yen and the growth of yen/mark has increased Tokyo's importance. Although Japan's economy still has some way to go before it overtakes the US, its funding of US deficits and growth in exporting has given the Tokyo currency markets a tremendous boost. The next BIS survey is likely to confirm New York's relegation to third place. As currency traders know, New York is active during the morning while Europe is open, but during the afternoon the market quietens, spreads widen and rates become more volatile. Foreign exchange managers believe New York continues to grow in size. The problem is that the importance of Japanese financial institutions is allowing Tokyo to grow faster, while London benefits from the interest in European currencies. But New York lacks new growth areas which will allow it to keep up with Tokyo. New York's difficulties are compounded by weaknesses in the US financial system. Corporate and banking customers are increasingly paying attention to the credit rating of the banks they do their foreign exchange business with. For a large company wanting to hedge its currency exposure one or two years forward, this is becoming an important factor. It does not just affect the New York market. Many US banks have large foreign exchange operations in London, and dealers say there are dwindling number of players in the London market willing to deal in large currency blocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TURNOVER AND FOREIGN TRADE, APRIL 1989 (BN                           DOLLARS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country               Net turnover   Foreign trade1                        (monthly total) United Kingdom               3,740           54.4 United States                2,580          101.6 Japan                        2,300           61.5 Switzerland                  1,140           13.7 Singapore                    1,100            8.02 Hong Kong                      931           12.02 Australia                      570            9.7 France                         520           44.3 Canada                         300           25.0 Netherlands                    260           22.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1Monthly average for first quarter. 2Exports and imports of goods, April 1989.

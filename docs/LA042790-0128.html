			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT-TO-ENSENADA: SPECTACLE, THEN 125 MILES SOUTH ON THE WIND  </P> <P> About 500 boats will sail at noon today in the 43rd race from Newport Beach to  Ensenada, Mexico.  </P> <P> This year's race drew 524 entries, down by about a dozen from last year, but  usually not all start.  </P> <P> The start off the Newport jetty is one of yachting's spectacles. Boats in the  huge fleet maneuver for their respective starts, beginning at noon and  continuing at 10-minute intervals until about 1:30.  </P> <P> This year's fleet is divided among one class of Ultra-light 70-raters, two  classes of smaller ultra-lights, two classes of International Offshore Rule  (IOR) ratings, 11 classes of Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) and one  class of Ocean Racing Catamarans (ORCA).  </P> <P> The yachts should begin arriving in Ensenada, 125 miles down the coast, early  Saturday, depending on wind conditions.  </P> <P> Bidding for first to finish and an elapsed-time record will be Dennis Conner of  San Diego, the America's Cup skipper, in his 65-foot catamaran, Stars &amp;  Stripes. The record is 10 hours 31 minutes, set by the 65-foot catamaran Double  Bullet in 1983. Conner missed the record by about six hours last year when he  ran out of wind off Rosarito Beach, south of Tijuana.  </P> <P> Also fighting for first to finish will be about six of the big monohull  70-raters, which are known for their downwind speed in strong winds.

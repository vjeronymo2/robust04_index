			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: The Golden Age of Dutch drawing - Homan Potterton admires the Abrams collection, currently in New York a huge number survive - similar works on paper by his fellow Dutch artists of the 17th century are altogether less familiar. This is in contrast to Italian and French painters - from Raphael, Michelangelo or Guercino to Claude, Poussin or Watteau - whose graphic work has always been prized and appreciated. But who can recall seeing studies in pen or chalks by Hals, Steen, Cuyp, Ruisdael, Vermeer or any of the other great names which constitute the pantheon of Dutch art of the Golden Age ? Yet, as a beautiful exhibition - Seventeenth-Century Dutch Drawings from the Abrams Collection - now at the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (and already seen at the Rijksmuseum and the Albertina in Vienna) makes clear, drawing was just as prevalent in Dutch art as it was French and Italian and the results were frequently as ravishing. From the end of the 16th century, Dutch artists adopted the Italian renaissance practice of making preliminary drawings from life - for both figures and landscapes - as a means of achieving more naturalistic effects in compositions that were in fact products of the imagination. In the case of both portraiture and flower-painting, where reality was of the essence, it goes without saying that drawing also played a vital role. Contrary to one's initial impression, therefore, a substantial legacy of Dutch graphics from the 17th century exists and, generally speaking, the range of subject-matter is more varied than what one finds within the classical confines of French or Italian art of the same period. For over 30 years a Boston lawyer and his wife, George and Maida Abrams, have been buying Dutch drawings of the 17th century and in doing so they have assembled a collection of the very highest quality and distinction. It is a very personal collection with a strong emphasis on landscape. An early influence on the couple was the great Harvard teacher and connoisseur of old master drawings, Paul Sachs, who told them, on seeing their early acquisitions, that they were 'people' as opposed to 'landscape' collectors. As a result, they consciously sought out landscapes to correct their natural inclination towards figure studies so that, for example, of the three sheets by Rembrandt in the exhibition two are of landscapes; both date from about 1652 and both were bought at the Chatsworth sale in 1967. Sachs's admonition may be the raison d'etre for several of the other interesting sheets in the collection. A wonderful wash sketch of a castle on a cliff with the blasted trunk of a tree in the foreground is surprisingly said to be by Rembrandt's pupil, Nicolaes Maes; alternatively, the catalogue suggests it could be by another pupil, Samuel van Hoogstraten. The problem is that neither artist is really known as a landscape painter so that the attribution of the work remains tentative. Another Rembrandt pupil who is more familiar as a figure painter is Jan Lievens; yet he is represented in the Abrams collection by two pen and ink studies of landscape. The artist Abraham Furnerius is not exactly a household name; but he was a pupil of the great master himself and was described by a contemporary as 'very clever in his landscapes'. Typically, the Abramses have sought out an example of his work. Hendryik Avercamp, the deaf-mute painter of winter scenes, was a prolific draughtsman and notable among his oeuvre are a number of fully-finished watercolours which the artist, unusually for his time, produced (and sold) as autonomous works of art. Two of these - a view with a river and a more typical scene on the ice - are among the highlights of the Abrams collection. Not surprisingly, the pioneer masters of the naturalistic landscape - Claes Visscher, Cornelis Vroom, and Esaias and Jan van de Velde are also represented; and from later decades there are examples by well-known names - van Goyen, Jacob van Ruisdael and Nicolaes Berchem. Among the figure studies are a number of very beautiful drawings ranging from quite Mannerist (and Italianate) studies by such artists as Bloemaert, Wttewael and Goltzius to raucous low-life scenes by Adriaen and Isack van Ostade, Cornelis Bega and Dusart. The most surprising of the figure drawings are, however, a group of large black and white chalk drawings on blue paper. Two of these are by Jacob Backer, two by Govaert Flinck, and another by Lambert Doomer - all artists who worked in the immediate circle of Rembrandt. Academic in style, the drawings represent a particular tradition that seems alien to Dutch art and indeed, as the catalogue points out, they owe their inspiration to the great Flemish artists, Rubens and Van Dyck. Other large-scale figure drawings - by, for example, Berchem and Adriaen van de Velde - also display a use of chalk that is more Italianate than Dutch. The fact that there are gaps in the Abrams collection is witness more to the very personal nature of the selection than to any oversight. There is for example no drawing by Cuyp, none by Jan Both, hardly any Italianate landscape drawings (a major genre), and not a single study of shipping by Willem van de Velde or indeed any other master of seascape. Nor are there any drawings by the Dutch Caravaggisti such as Honthorst or Stomer. Lacking too are any drawings of architecture by a master such as Saenredam, who was a prolific draughtsman, while Emanuel de Witte, who is known for his paintings of church interiors, is represented by a very curious chalk drawing of a nude Medusa. This is part of a very rare album of drawings by a number of different artists that was bought from an English private collection as recently as 1967. No exhibition of Dutch art would be complete without some representation of flower painting and in this respect the Abrams collection is no exception: the watercolours on vellum of tulips by Jacob Marrel are simply sumptuous.</p>

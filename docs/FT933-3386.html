			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: FII tumbles 19% to Pounds 5.2m - Shoe maker's shares fall as sterling devaluation takes its toll THE DEVALUATION of sterling dealt a heavy blow to FII, the UK shoe manufacturer which yesterday reported a 19 per cent tumble in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.2m. The shares responded via a 15p fall to 413p. Mr Monty Sumray, chairman, said substantial cost increases of up to 20 per cent were imposed 'almost overnight' as a result of the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism in September. FII buys 25 per cent of its raw materials and components, such as leather uppers, from abroad. The decline in buying power was exacerbated by demands from FII's customers for price reductions to cope with lower demand. FII supplies some 50 per cent of its footwear to Marks and Spencer. As a result, margins fell by 2.5 per cent in the second half alone. Mr Sumray estimated the margin decline had cost the group some Pounds 1m. Pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 were further depressed by the Pounds 350,000 costs of the group's unsuccessful bid for its fellow UK shoe manufacturer C&amp;J Clark. FII was one of three contenders invited earlier this year by the family-owned group to bid. Shareholders eventually rejected all offers. Mr Sumray said the bid had been a 'waste of money, in a sense'. On a brighter note, customers' reluctance to place orders in the face of recession appeared to be disappearing. Turnover increased by Pounds 2m to Pounds 82m in the year. Mr Sumray said the group's factories were operating at full capacity, after a period of short-time working in the second half. The chairman said FII was taking several steps to repair damage done to margins last year. These included some job cuts, investment in more efficient machinery, new shoe ranges and penetrating new markets - including the US and Japan. Although these measures would not restore margins in the short term, Mr Sumray was optimistic growth would be resumed next year. FII exported some 8.5 per cent of its footwear sales, which rose overall by 3 per cent to Pounds 71m. Mr Sumray said the increase had been achieved in a declining market where imports claimed some 71 per cent of sales. Operating profits fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4.9m. FII's scientific and technical division, manufacturing medical equipment, had been steady, he said, with sales of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 11.6m). Operating profits were static at Pounds 100,000. Earnings per share fell from 30.8p to 22.7p. A final dividend of 8.75p (8.5p) makes a 14.75p (14p) total.</p>

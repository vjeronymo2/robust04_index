			<p>BFN     [Text] Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry  [DTI] pointed out that the new accord forged during the final  negotiation of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade does not exempt the United States from  tariffication of its sugar imports.    The DTI's Bureau of International Trade Relations [BITR]  clarified that the decision of the United States to maintain its  present level of sugar importation, including the substantial  amount exported by the Philippines, is based precisely on the  conversion of its quantitative restrictions on the import of  that product to tariff equivalents. This, in effect, is what  the principle of tariffication is all about. BITR Director  Antonio Buencamino pointed out that conversion of import  ceilings to tariff increases to effect the same degree of  protection for country's competitive industries.    The clarification is made in the wake of assertion of Sugar  Regulatory Administration head Rodolfo Gamboa that the U.S.  quota system, which presently employs tariffs, received an  exemption from the GATT agreement under the Uruguay Round.</p>

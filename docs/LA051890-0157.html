			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'BURNED OUT' HEAD OF HOBIE SPORTS WILL LEAVE COMPANY  </P> <P> The president of Hobie Sports, a chain of retail surf-wear shops in California  and Hawaii, said Thursday that he is quitting because he is "just burned out."  </P> <P> Tony Mardian, an executive for 12 years with the chain and president for the  past two years, said he plans to stay with the company through July to help  with the transition to an as-yet-unnamed successor.  </P> <P> "I'm just ready to move on," said Mardian, who is the son of Robert C. Mardian,  the former U.S. assistant attorney general best known for his role in the  Watergate scandal. His father was a lawyer in the reelection campaign of former  President Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> As for his plans, the San Clemente resident said, "I'm going to take the summer  and think about it."  </P> <P> Hobie Sports has seven stores in California and six in Hawaii, with about 70%  of its sales in clothing. It is one of a series of independent, separate  businesses that hold licenses to use the name of Hobie. The brand name was made  famous by surfboard and catamaran pioneer Hobie Alter in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Mardian, 38, said his proudest accomplishments as president were overseeing the  company's growth, updating the accounting systems and developing the chain's  own private line of clothing, Hawaiian Sun.  </P> <P> He came to the company's Irvine headquarters from Hawaii, where he had gone to  open a Hobie store in Kona.  </P> <P> He said that no successor has been named but that the list of candidates for  president has been narrowed to three.  </P> <P> Mardian said he leaves the company in strong financial shape. "The surf  industry in general had a very flat first quarter" of 1990, he said. "We fared  well because of our ladies' sales."  </P> <P> Since then, he said, sales in general have bounced back and "business is fine."  </P></p>

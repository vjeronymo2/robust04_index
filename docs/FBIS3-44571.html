At a routine news briefing this afternoon, a reporter asked:  Now that the British Hong Kong Government has already ruled out  the possibility of Chris Patten withdrawing the political reform  bill at the request of the Chinese side, is it still likely that  China and Britain will resume their talks in such a situation?  Wu Jianmin made the aforementioned remarks when answering the  question.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: Referendum a denial of sovereignty Sir, As one who is far from disconcerted by the result of the Danish referendum on Maastricht, I nonetheless find it odd that in the UK those who are now shouting the loudest for a referendum are those who used to be staunch defenders of the sovereignty of the House of Commons. Isn't a referendum a denial of the sovereignty of parliament? Bryan Cassidy, MEP Dorset East and Hampshire West, The Stables, White Cliff Gardens, Blandford, Dorset DT11 7BU</p>

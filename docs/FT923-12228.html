			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Public spending to be squeezed: Major backs Treasury attempt to keep to Pounds 244.5bn target A SEVERE SQUEEZE on public investment in housing, roads, the inner cities and other construction projects will be heralded this week by the cabinet's endorsement of curbs in Whitehall spending. Mr John Major will tell cabinet colleagues on Wednesday he is backing the Treasury's attempts to hold next year's public spending to its Pounds 244.5bn cash planning total, in spite of a surge in unemployment benefit payments. His stance is understood to follow a warning by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary, that the share of public spending in national income overall is likely to rise in 1993-94 for the fourth consecutive year. The government is committed to a gradual fall in that share, now 41.5 per cent. But the combination of pre-election spending commitments, a shrinking economy and higher debt service payments threatens to push it towards 44 per cent, the highest level since the mid-1980s. Senior ministers, however, are complaining that the Treasury has targeted long-term investment programmes for some of the biggest savings. They will warn Mr Portillo that cuts in capital spending by central and local government would deliver another blow to the hard-pressed construction industry. Housebuilders and other construction companies have been among those worst hit by the recession. Some of the projects under Treasury review - including a three-year programme to invest Pounds 7bn in motorways and trunk roads - appeared as pledges in the Conservative manifesto. But the Treasury is arguing that nothing can be immune from scrutiny this year because of the threat to the economy posed by soaring public debt. The Treasury wants a substantial cut in the Department of Environment's Pounds 7.5bn budget for housing over the next two years. About two-thirds of that involves capital spending. Its plans would involve cuts in funds for the Housing Corporation, which regulates registered housing associations, and additional restrictions on local authority spending. Mr Portillo is also seeking significant savings in the urban programme and spending by the Urban Development Corporation. In spite of these proposed cuts, Treasury officials remain far from confident that the government will be able to meet the overall cash target. The latest calculations suggest that high unemployment and the cost of introducing the council tax could run to about Pounds 5bn next year. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, last night urged Mr Major not to exclude 'sacred cows' such as health, social services, overseas aid and education from spending cuts.</p>

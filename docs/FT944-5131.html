			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (3): Haven of financial freedom - Bangkok's influx of foreign banks echoes the rise of Hong Kong Many foreign bankers in Thailand can reach their desks these days only after dodging through gangs of construction workers busy refurbishing their Bangkok offices, writes William Barnes. After years of watching their fortunate domestic counterparts profiting from Thailand's economic boom, foreign bankers are now manoeuvering to take advantage of the liberalisation of the banking sector. 'The truth is that the regulatory environment is already probably one of the best in Asia. It's probably the most enlightened in Asia next to Hong Kong,' says Mr David Hendrix, general manager of Citicorp in Thailand. 'There is an unbiased and fair treatment of foreign banks that doesn't exist in many other countries in south-east Asia.' Foreign banks have rapidly expanded their wholesale banking business since the late 1980s, and anticipate further liberalisation. The more vigorous of the 14 foreign banks allowed full branch licences have seen their lending grow fivefold in less than six years. Business picked up in 1992 when the Thai monetary authorities introduced the offshore banking scheme known as the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF). Foreign banks have quickly captured half the important out-in lending business (foreign loans for use in Thailand) under the BIBF. Lack of a full branch licence is clearly not a barrier to expansion: the 22 branchless foreign banks have managed to garner a quarter of the BIBF business providing Thai corporations with cheaper funds, usually in dollars. After years of making profits from the wide spreads ensured by their lucrative domestic banking cartel, Thailand's 15 commercial banks have been slower to make a mark in the offshore loan business. Much of the Thai banks' 'BIBF' lending appears to have been found by bringing existing offshore loans under the BIBF umbrella. If the liberalisation of the Thai banking industry looks as though it will be painful, then that is partly the point: the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, has long term plans for Bangkok as a financial centre and wants local institutions lean enough and canny enough to compete in the global arena. Although strong credit growth has again allowed Thai banks to report enviably juicy profits for another year, Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister and a former president of one of the country's biggest banks, has repeatedly sounded the warning bell. Perhaps the ongoing Gatt negotiations on trade in services have stopped Mr Tarrin from revealing a precise liberalisation timetable, but the outline plan seems to be to allow foreign banks to open up to two branches with restricted services outside Bangkok; to increase gradually the services in which they can compete and - perhaps by the turn of the century - to allow foreigners to extend their branch networks further. Five more foreign branch licences have already been promised for 1995. Mr Vijit Supinit, Bank of Thailand governor, has hinted that at least two of those licences are likely to go to Japanese banks because, despite the massive Japanese industrial presence, only two of the 14 foreign banks with branches are Japanese. Thai finance and securities houses are the prime candidates to pick up the handful of new licences that have also been promised to local institutions. To encourage the weaker Thai banks to merge with their stronger brethren the authorities will let them sell their surplus licences to Thai finance houses. The bigger Thai banks, meanwhile, will remain formidable competitors, led by Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest bank whose new president is the 35-year-old Mr Chartsiri Sophonpanich. Local banking chiefs have acquired a mania for 're-engineering'. The first fully automated bank branch was opened recently as an experiment in Bangkok  -a far cry from the traditional serried ranks of low-paid clerks laboriously shuffling paper. It remains to be seen if the foreign banks can wrest significant retail business from the big locals with their branch networks of up to 400 sites, when the provinces are going to be the key growth area for retail banking. Electronic banking, however, may obviate the need for a big branch network now that the government has allowed foreign banks to use local ATM networks. Most foreign banks will probably be satisfied that they can adequately service their international customers with just one or two branches. The Hongkong Bank, like Citicorp, will move into its new banking tower in this decade partly because the country's burgeoning middle class - two-thirds of the population is under 30 - will require extensive financial services. 'Thailand has been underemphasised in the past - I don't think that will happen in the future,' says Mr Sandy Flockhart, the chief executive of the Hongkong Bank. The retail sector is likely to remain a sideshow for the Japanese banks, which will continue to focus on working with Japanese companies investing in Thailand. The biggest bugbear cited by foreign bankers - aside from some minor tax wrinkles and the traffic - is the shortage, and hence high turnover, of good Thai staff who have a reputation for job hopping. One European banker said: 'It's really painful to see a young banker you have nurtured lured to a rival - but it's the same for every bank so I guess it is still a level playing field.' Foreign bankers talk of the banking opportunities in taking a lengthening list of companies to the stock market, of financing the country's multi-billion dollar infrastructure programme and helping corporations tap the capital markets for funds. Citicorp's Mr Hendrix compares Thailand with the 13 years he spent in Hong Kong: 'There's a lot that I saw in the evolutionary development of the Hongkong capital market that I am seeing here - only at a much quicker pace.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Foreign Banks' Activity in Thailand (Baht million)(1)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                          Total   Net Credit  Capital   BIBF(2)                              Assets    Granted              Total                                                             Assets  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sakura                        53,377    48,985     2,200    26,287 Bank of Tokyo                 48,202    42,042     2,000    24,338 Citibank                      44,984    30,205     2,491     9,998 HSBC                          24,525    20,457     1,500     8,169 Bank Indosuez                 18,152    14,544     1,000     6,782 Standard Chartered            17,838    11,210     1,000     2,809 Bank of America NT&amp;SA         17,084    13,750     1,000     8,339 Deutsche Bank                 16,829    12,039       892     4,246 Chase Manhattan                9,940     8,765       615     5,627 Int Commercial Bank of China   2,566     2,089       320      na Four Seas                      2,262     1,856       300       826 Bharat Overseas                1,640     1,325       180      na United Malayan Banking Corp.   1,118       627       250      na Bank of America (Asia)           510       154       300        72  --------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) figures for September 1994.

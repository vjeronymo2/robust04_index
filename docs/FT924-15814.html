			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Divisions resurface on electoral reform WIDE division at all levels of the party over whether it should back electoral reform and proportional representation erupted at the Labour conference yesterday. A heated debate showed no clear consensus over the direction the party should take. Supporters of PR, who fear Labour will continue to be denied power under the present system, clashed with those who objected to a Labour manifesto being diluted in a coalition government. Delegates approved a second 'interim report' of the working party on electoral reform chaired by Professor Raymond Plant. The working party hints that it is moving towards recommending an additional member system for parliamentary elections. But Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader and a member of the Plant committee, told delegates that any alternative would be weighed against the current 'first past the post' system - which Professor Plant himself acknowledged may yet remain under Labour's eventual proposals. 'There is no one perfect, correct, theoretically supreme voting system,' Mrs Beckett said. The Plant committee reports next spring. Mr Robin Cook, a member of the shadow cabinet and the Labour campaign for electoral reform, has called for a commitment to change at next year's conference. Mrs Jean Lord, of the Littleborough and Saddleworth Labour party, said she wanted 'a Labour government.' She said: 'I don't want a coalition. We hear that PR is fairer to smaller parties. I didn't join the Labour party to be fair to the Liberals.' Mr John Kemp, from Dundee West, said: 'The simple fact is that the present electoral system . . . has for almost a century all but marginalised the Labour party.' Deals with other parties could come up under 'first past the post' too. Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr and chair of the electoral reform campaign, pointed to the lack of representation for more than 1m Labour voters in 16 shire counties that did not elect a single Labour MP, compared with the 54 Labour MPs elected by fewer voters in the 11 largest cities. Two motions - one backing PR and another opposing it - were withdrawn on the recommendation of the NEC to avoid pre-empting the conclusions of the Plant committee.</p>

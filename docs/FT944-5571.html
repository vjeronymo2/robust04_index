			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe bids farewell to beef 'mountains' Intervention buying of meat by the European Union, which led to the creation of the infamous beef 'mountains', should virtually disappear in future, Mr Roelof Bennink, head of the European Commission's beef and sheepmeat division, said yesterday. 'Intervention will be used in future as little as possible. Its role as a market support measure has been considerably reduced and support is now given by premium payments to farmers,' he told a meat policy conference organised by Agra Europe. But Mr Bennink also said that EU beef production would have to fall by between 300,000 and 400,000 tonnes by 2000 to fit in with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Gatt limits the amount of subsidised beef exports from the EU to 817,000 tonnes, compared with traditional levels of exports of around 1.1m tonnes. Beef stocks held in intervention stores have fallen dramatically to 100,000 tonnes from just over 1m tonnes a year ago. Mr Bennink said that today marks the end of a year in which no additional beef has been bought for intervention. Intervention buying has traditionally acted as a safety net for farmers by soaking up excess supply and maintaining internal EU prices at levels higher than the world market. But reform of the common agricultural policy has progressively reduced the price at which stocks can be bought, compensating farmers by direct premium payments. Mr Bennink said the drop in EU beef production in the past two years probably had more to do with increases in productivity by dairy cows than CAP reform. Cow numbers dropped from 33m to 32m as each animal produced more milk: this led to a reduction in the number of beef calves. At the same time, imports from eastern Europe had been restricted to 425,000 animals and the absorption of more beef from the reunified of Germany has been completed. Mr Bennink believed there would be a rise in beef output of only 1 or 2 per cent next year; there were not enough cows to produce dramatic increases. He said it was too soon to determine whether CAP reform would result in the necessary reduction in beef production to accommodate Gatt but said the commission would take additional steps if required. Mr Rene Laporte, chairman of the French meat traders' federation, called on the commission to re-direct EU beef exports to lucrative markets in South-east Asia, such as Japan and Korea, and the US, instead of countries with limited means of payment such as the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe and north Africa. 'The EU cannot neglect these markets and still call itself an important player in the world market,' he said. Mr Brian Revell, senior economist at the Scottish Agricultural College, said the drop in EU subsidised beef exports would relieve pressure on world prices under Gatt. But EU poultry prices would fall by more than beef because of cheaper grain, which would cause a drop in EU beef consumption. That meant the EU would need to import less beef while maintaining exports. Mr Bennink said it was important to try to maintain a balance between different meat prices so that beef would not be allowed to rise to more than double the poultry price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The National Information Office Does </F> Not Plan Any More Large-Scale Campaigns Before the Elections"]    [Text] Not long ago the Office of the Prime Minister  published a brochure to describe the activities of the  government during the past four years. The publication, which  was prepared in a million copies, cost 26 million forints for  printing and 15 million for mailing, which was absorbed by the  budget of the National Information Office [NTI]. According to  opposition opinions, this publication is nothing more than  publicly financed election propaganda that suppresses everything  negative.    NTI head Gyorgy Varga Domokos informed us in response to our  questions that the cost of the brochures, which have so far been  published in Hungarian and will soon also appear in foreign  languages, along with the publicity connected with their  publication, has not been more than one-fifth of the office's  annual budget. (The NTI's 1994 budget was 190 million forints,  with additional funds left over from last year.) Discussing the  timing, the office chief believes that it would not have been  possible to give an accounting of four years of government  activity after only three and a half years, although he would  have preferred it if the brochure had appeared a few weeks  earlier. Nevertheless, the publishing date was postponed  because they wanted to prepare a high-quality publication that  contained correct data and was "worthy of all the effort that  had been put into it."    Another volume will soon appear in several foreign languages  and in considerably fewer copies, which will be distributed much  more narrowly, mainly to foreign embassies and libraries. This  high-quality publication--which will not cost more than 8  million--will not be an account of accomplishments but is  intended instead to give an overview of our country's 1,000-year  history and the past four years. Both publications serve the  NTI's new mission. Previously the office's main job was to  continually correct the supposedly distorted international image  of the country that was propagated by the press. From now on,  however, the NTI wants to improve our image in the long term by  providing information about our accomplishments and giving some  idea of our culture. In the period before the elections,  however, this was their first and at the same time their last  large-scale campaign undertaking (with the possible exception of  a specialized publication about the change to a market economy,  which will appear in fewer copies for a narrower audience.)  Nevertheless, according to Gyorgy Varga Domokos, much  information should be provided both at home and abroad, because  "public opinion must not be left without knowledge of our  accomplishments," and it is not even possible to begin the next  four-year period without drawing up a balance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberian People's Party [LPP] has elected Dr.  Togbah-Nah Tipoteh as the national chairman of the party. At an  emergency meeting of LPP's high decision-making organ, the  organizing committee, Dr. Tipoteh was elected by acclamation. A  release from the LPP's office says Dr. Tipoteh's [word  indistinct] comes in the wake of the former chairman, Dr.  Wolokollie's request to the organizing committee to find a  full-time chairman to prepare the party adequately for the  pending elections. The organizing committee, in the release,  commended Mr. Wolokollie for the leadership provided the party  in its most difficult period and hoped that in his new  assignment as special liaison of the party with the LNTG  [Liberian National Transitional Government], Mr. Wolokollie will  exhibit equal commitment in the discharge of his duties.    Dr. Tipoteh, in his thanks to his solid partisans for his  unanimous election, pledged continuity in the implementation of  the general policies of the party.    Meanwhile, Dr. (Joseph Volloh) has been named chairman of  the  policy council of the party. He replaces Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh.</p>

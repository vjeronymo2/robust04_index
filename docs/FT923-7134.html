			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sony drops 37.1% in first quarter SONY, the Japanese electronics company, reported consolidated operating profits of Y36.99bn (Dollars 293m) for the first quarter of the year to June, a fall of 37.1 per cent on the same period a year ago. Sales grew by 4.2 per cent to Y900bn. The company suffered a loss of Y18bn in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in Japan were flat at Y229.46bn, while US sales rose by 14.9 per cent to Y271.1bn. However, Sony returned to profitability at the operating level in the first quarter, although the company's performance remained well down on last year. The results were lifted by a strong performance in the entertainment field, where recorded music sales rose by 9.9 per cent to Y100.9bn, while income from films leapt by 45.8 per cent to Y86.97bn. Sales in Sony's traditional electronic equipment business, however, were flat at Y712.2bn. Sales of video equipment were down by 6.9 per cent and audio equipment sales were off by 1 per cent, while television sales rose by 3.7 per cent and other products by 9 per cent to Y157.4bn. Camcorder sales remained sluggish, at 900,000 units during the quarter. This was 200,000 below the level a year ago but 50 per cent up on the last quarter of the 1991 fiscal year. Sony can produce 370,000 units a month. Video recorder sales rose by 100,000 units year-on-year to 900,000 units, while compact disc player sales advanced from 2.6m to 3.4m units. Sony has maintained sales, however, by keen pricing that has cut deeply into margins. The results were also hurt by an 18.6 per cent rise in the depreciation charge to Y68.3bn. Capital spending, however, was cut sharply this year, and the quarterly depreciation charge was expected to peak later this year, promising to increase profits next year. The company estimated that the higher value of the US dollar compared with last year had cut Y21.5bn off the value of sales. Inventories at the end of June were 2.96 times monthly sales, compared with 2.68 a year earlier. The company's net income after tax fell by 36 per cent to Y14.93bn, while net income per depositary share fell by 35.1 per cent to Y37.1.</p>

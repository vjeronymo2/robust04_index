			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank in Dollars 144m purchase THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland said yesterday that it had reached agreement to buy a small Boston-based savings bank to add to its Citizens Financial Group US subsidiary. The bank, which has set a target for Citizen to contribute at least 10 per cent of earnings, said it had agreed to buy Neworld Bancorp for Dollars 144.3m (Pounds 95.4m). The deal will add a further Dollars 1.1bn to Citizens' assets of Dollars 7bn. The deal is the fifth acquisition by Citizens since the end of 1990, including the acquisition last month of Boston Five Bancorp. It will be financed by Royal Bank injecting Dollars 75m of cash into Citizens in return for common stock. Neworld, which has 22 branches, converted from a mutually owned savings bank in 1982. Its branches are concentrated around Boston, and on Cape Cod, the Massachusetts peninsula with a high number of affluent residents. Mr Larry Fish, chairman of Citizens, said Neworld was 'a wonderful, perfect fit' with Citizens' New England network, which it has been trying to extend from its original base in Providence, Rhode Island. Citizens is to pay Dollars 35 a share, or 1.6 times the book value of Neworld. However, Mr Fish said this was a lower multiple than Fleet Financial agreed to pay last month to acquire Sterling Bancshares of Massachusetts. Mr Fish said Neworld fitted with Citizens' attempt only to acquire banks with high asset quality. He said that its total non-performing assets were Pounds 14m, and these were nearly two times covered by provisions of Pounds 27m in its reserves. Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said the bank had 'plenty of cash' to finance the acquisition. He said Citizens would be able to improve Neworld's earnings through cutting overlap between processing operations.</p>

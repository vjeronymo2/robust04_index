This commenter also believed that early submission of NCUA 4012 may also speed the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal stated that the subscribers should be responsible for paying the cost of credit reports and background checks when applying for a credit union charter. Seven commenters agreed with this provision. Nine commenters believed that the subscribers should not be responsible for paying the cost of credit reports and background checks when applying for a new charter. Two commenters recommended that NCUA articulate the standards relied upon in disqualifying credit union organizers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. NCUA Board Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NCUA Board agrees with these suggestions and is hopeful that the result of all the changes made will be a significant increase in new federal chartering activity. Small, vibrant credit unions, serving their members on a first-name basis and willing to take reasonable credit risks based on personal knowledge of their members' character, are a vital part of the credit union movement. Many credit unions which used to fill this niche have through their success grown to the point where credit union management can no longer make these personal judgments on each individual member: A new generation of small credit unions is needed to fill that void, particularly in the many poor inner-city and rural areas where credit needs are now largely unmet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final IRPS provides: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That charter applicants will receive acknowledgment of the application's receipt in 10 business days <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That tentative field of membership approval will be given early in the process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That early submission of NCUA 4012 will be encouraged <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That the cost of credit reports and background checks will be borne by NCUA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NCUA Board does not believe, however, that it would be productive to establish many other absolute standards and guidelines. Each application is to some extent unique and may require somewhat different procedures and time frames. The Board believes these are best left to be worked out between the prospective credit union officials and NCUA staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ST. FRANCIS' BUSY BODY;  </P> <P> ALLEN FREEMON COMPETES IN FOUR SPORTS ONLY BECAUSE A COACH TURNED HIM DOWN WHEN  HE TRIED TO GO OUT FOR A FIFTH  </P> <P> Just when you thought Johnny Three-sport was dead, along came Allen Freemon,  who is surviving -- and thriving -- at St. Francis High.  </P> <P> During each of the past four years, Freemon has done what an increasing number  of high school athletes have found almost impossible to do -- compete in three  different sports. Before the 1988-89 school year ends, the senior will likely  play four sports and he narrowly missed playing five.  </P> <P> He's even found time to crack a book now and again. His grade-point average  (2.8) has suffered because of the athletic distractions. Still, time and  studies included, the most difficult aspect of participating in cross-country,  basketball, golf and track is talking the coaches into allowing it. In these  times of specialization and overlapping seasons, coaches -- even at the high  school level -- would prefer not to share athletes.  </P> <P> Freemon, however, is an anomaly.  </P> <P> Upon arriving at St. Francis in 1985, Freemon planned on playing basketball,  maybe golf, but cross-country Coach Mark Mitchell saw him run and quickly  snagged him for his team. Initially, Freemon was less than enthusiastic. "The  first day, they made us run five miles straight up a hill," he said. "Everyone  was getting sick, throwing up. I thought, 'That's it for cross-country.' You've  got to be some kind of fool."  </P> <P> As it was, Freemon became the first St. Francis freshman to make the varsity  cross-country team. His junior year, he won eight of 12 races for the Golden  Knights. This season, he took eight of 11 races. Freemon now says he has logged  a "foolish" 6,000 miles for St. Francis in practices and meets. "I guess it  became addictive," he said.  </P> <P> So habit forming, in fact, he also turned to track, where his quick fix came in  the form of four events -- the 800 meters, the mile, the two-mile and the  one-mile relay.  </P> <P> Jammed in between the annual cross-country and track binges were Freemon's  favorite sports -- basketball and golf. This past season, he led the basketball  team in scoring (20.3-point average), three-point shooting and averaged 7.3  rebounds a game. The 6-foot-2 forward ranked fifth in the Southern Section in  three-point shooting percentage, making 83 of 211 attempts, and he was an  All-Del Rey League selection. He scored in double figures in all 24 games.  </P> <P> Examination of Freemon's senior season reveals not only the mental and physical  stamina required to switch from sport to sport, but also an unusual level of  consistency as he did so. Freemon's schedule has been rigorous indeed. After  school ended in May 1988, he played summer league basketball with St. Francis  teammates in June and July.  </P> <P> Midway through July, he began daily cross-country workouts, running 12 miles  and 15 quarter-mile sprints on alternating days. The cross-country season began  in September and ended Nov. 14. He joined the basketball team a week late -- on  Nov. 17. While the team had been practicing together since the beginning of  school under the guise of a physical education class, Freemon hadn't touched a  ball.  </P> <P> "It takes about a month to get your quickness and touch back," he said.  </P> <P> Cross-country knocked his shooting touch so out of whack, he hit nine  three-point shots and scored 37 points in the season-opening loss at Beverly  Hills. To make up for lost time, Freemon said he took 500 shots a day during  team and personal practice sessions. In a game against Alemany, the forward hit  five three-point shots in the first half, enabling the Golden Knights to take a  49-19 lead. Against Crescenta Valley, he made six three-point shots.  </P> <P> "In some ways, running cross-country helped him," said John Jordan, St. Francis  basketball coach. "So many of his points came off the transition. I rarely saw  him fatigued. In the fourth quarter, he'd still be going all out. That helped  him."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Jordan wanted his standout shooter to drop cross-country to  concentrate on basketball. "He told me running was hurting my basketball,"  Freemon said. "None of the coaches ever really pressured me to quit other  sports, but they advised me to concentrate on just one -- and the sport they  wanted me to stay with was always the one they happened to be coaching."  </P> <P> Four days after the basketball season ended in mid-February, Freemon played in  a golf tournament and turned in St. Francis' best nine-hole score, a two-over  par 38 at L. A. Royal Vista. "To me it's unbelievable," said golf Coach Mike  Cannon. "He hadn't touched a club in who knows how long and he golfs like  that."  </P> <P> Even though St. Francis' spring golf schedule conflicts with its track season,  Freemon says he will attempt to step in and run "when the track team needs me."  But, after almost four years of juggling his sports, Freemon may now be turned  away by a coach unwilling to work with the athlete's revolving schedule. Track  Coach Duane Harris said his practices began a month ago and he has yet to hear  from Freemon.  </P> <P> "I don't know about this season," Harris said. "It comes down to the team  aspect. It's not fair for him to replace a kid who's been practicing with us  all the time. And if there's a conflict between golf and track, which meet will  he miss?"  </P> <P> For his part, Freemon has a solution: "I would want to play or run for the team  that needed me the most."  </P> <P> Freemon was turned down by a coach once before. Halfway through the football  season, the senior wrote a letter to football Coach Terry Terrazone, whose team  was struggling with a 1-3 record. In effect, Freemon volunteered for football  duty -- he would play quarterback -- pending the coach's approval.  </P> <P> It never came. Freemon insisted on continuing with cross-country in addition to  football and Terrazone found that arrangement unacceptable. Johnny Five-sport  was miffed by the reaction, finally dismissing it as "football mentality."  Harris, an assistant football coach, said Freemon would have missed too much  practice while off running the hills.  </P> <P> Harris called Freemon's other sports "a distraction problem."  </P> <P> "Being so talented, being so good at everything puts him into a bit of a  problem," Harris said. "It's always been tough for him to decide which sports  to do."  </P> <P> So he did all of them.  </P> <P> But his diluting sports agenda may have, his coaches say, cost him concrete  rewards, such as a major-college scholarship. Cannon says Freemon (who has a  4-handicap) could easily have been a scratch golfer and landed a free ride at a  Division I school had he practiced year-round. Harris says the same is true for  track and cross-country.  </P> <P> Two months before his high school graduation, Freemon basically answers the  could-have-beens with a "So what?"  </P> <P> He'll probably attend a Division II school in California and try to play --  what else? -- three sports. Looking back, he claims his only regret in high  school is not playing football and cementing his place at St. Francis as the  school's Johnny Five-sport.  </P> <P> "A lot of times I asked myself, 'What the hell am I doing this for?' " he said.  "Everyone kept telling me to focus on one sport. But I was having fun. I was  just being a kid. There's nothing wrong with that. I wanted to get my money's  worth while I was young."  </P></p>

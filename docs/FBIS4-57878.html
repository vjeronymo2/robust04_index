			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] During a meeting at the Banco de la Construccion, it  was announced that, as of Monday, the stockholders of all banks  receiving financial assistance from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee  and Banking Protection Fund] will have 15 days to underwrite the  capital needed to cover the losses incurred by the banks. It  was also announced that Fogade will take control of all  subsidized banks failing to meet this requirement.    The meeting marked the end of the financial assistance  agreement with the banks, and now the goal is for the banks to  begin operating on their own and to start repaying the funds  provided by Fogade. Here are statements by Fogade President  Noris Aguirre:    [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress] ...Fogade has simply  waived conditional ownership. We should remember that in no way  have we forfeited the rest of the shares placed under our  control as creditors as a result of the financial assistance we  provided. It is only [words indistinct] currently in effect in  those banks that can replace all of the capital due by 1630 on  15 June. If by that time the stockholders have not guaranteed  this capital, Fogade will be entitled to seize operational  control.    Nevertheless, as of today, the management of these banking  institutions remains under the control of the Venezuelan state  -- a move intended to ensure the openness of the entire process  and the beginning of a new climate of trust. To me personally,  it is a pleasure to announce that I have just received the  requirements [words indistinct] and many of the banks' clearing  houses have responded favorably. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Banco Metropolitano and Banco Barinas have  scheduled stockholders meetings for Tuesday.</p>

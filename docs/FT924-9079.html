			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The talk of 'this town': The prospect of a new Camelot-on-the-Potomac For the first time in what another politician in another country would call a very considerable number of years, there is a sense of anticipation in this town. Washington DC, the nation's capital, whose real name actually is 'this town', is ready, even overdue, for a change. For 20 of the past 24 years, the social tone has been set by Republicans. President Nixon made furtive looks and hidden tape recorders all the rage, while President Ford brought back a taste for English muffins. The Reagans, of course, were pure west coast glitz, reeking money, and the Bushes a somewhat dowdier Yankee version of the same, and this town was comfortable with both until the Bush administration began to fall apart. The only interruption was Jimmy Carter, of whom this town will only allow that he is the best former president of the lot, a testament not only to his good works but to the fact that he does not live here any more. Logically, the welcome mat should be out for the Clintons, because this is a very Democratic place. It voted for George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, and on Tuesday gave only 9 per cent to the man with the Pennsylvania Avenue address and 85 per cent to somebody whose only local connection was three years as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, which perches charmingly over the trendiest part of town. Politics may be the life-blood of Washington, but it is not the only legal substance coursing through its veins. Alongside the 'plum' book, which lists the 3,000-plus political jobs now subject to the patronage of the new president, there is the 'blue' book, a compilation of the most socially respectable people in this town. It contains lots of political movers and shakers, but it also runs to hundreds and hundreds of grand dames, lawyers, lobbyists and consultants and even, a testament to changing times, journalist types. All combine mysteriously over dinner tables and cocktail parties (though not, mercifully for the true insider, over breakfast) to pass judgment on whoever lives in the White House. Not all of the above are on the far side of 50 years old, and neither are the Clintons and Gores. There are other affinities, too. Mrs Hillary Clinton, for example, comes to this town as the first First Lady ever to possess a post-graduate degree. Washington is full of successful career women, especially in the law firms, where it is not uncommon to hear it said that she is more qualified to serve as attorney general than was Bobby Kennedy, appointed to the post by his brother. But the social arbiters would be horrified if this were to happen, simply because this is not what a First Lady is here for. This town has also begun to work out that these are not fried chicken-eating, beer-guzzling, country music-addicted 'hicks from the sticks' who are moving in from Arkansas. In fact, unlike Mr Carter's Georgian mafia, many are not from Arkansas at all and quite a lot of them already live here. The common characteristic of all the many interlocking networks the Clintons operate - covering Georgetown, Oxford, Yale, the Democratic Leadership Council, the loosely formed FOBs ('friends of Bill'), and the annual Carolinian retreat group known as Renaissance - is that they are all mostly composed of successful, professional people. Jesse Jackson once unkindly dubbed the DLC the 'Democratic Leisure Club'. Merely watching the golf bags and the expensive matched luggage sets being unloaded from aircraft at its annual convention in New Orleans last April proved the Rev Jackson's point. They might like to talk politics and policies all night, but they will do it over good wine and decent food. They also have short hair. Jean-Marc, a veteran local hairdresser as Gallic as when he came here 20 years ago, is unworried that his creative art might thus be stifled. 'With ze Republicans, a few people 'ad a lot of money. I want a lot of people to 'ave a lot of money.' Most other local business people concur. This town's economy is no longer insulated from the general malaise. Two old Washington department stores have recently gone under and the real estate market is seriously sagging. Good housing here might cost three times as much as it does in Arkansas, but if the new cave dwellers are coming from Los Angeles, Boston and New York, or if they are already here, they will not notice much of a difference. There will be high expectations in other ways for the Clintons. Some keen-eyed observers, picking up on Kennedyesque inflections in some of the president-elect's recent speeches, have begun to muse about a new Camelot-on-the-Potomac. Frank Mankiewicz, who was Robert Kennedy's press secretary, pointed out yesterday to The New York Times that Mr Clinton went to Georgetown and Al Gore to St Alban's, the exclusive local private school. In contrast to the Carter crew, 'these are not people coming to town scorning Washington, or afraid that they'll be scorned'. Probably the great single arbiter of Washington taste will not be scorning them. Mrs Pamela Harriman (born to a noble English family, formerly Mrs Randolph Churchill, formerly married to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer, and widow of that great statesman Averell Harriman) is much more than the most charming and grandest of dames. She has for years been one of the most effective Democratic fund-raisers and has been in on the ground of many important party deliberations. In Little Rock on election night, she was an early and outspoken Clinton supporter, to the extent that there is even gossip that she will be rewarded, bringing her wheel full circle, with the ambassadorship to the Court of St James. But, she was quoted yesterday, 'I haven't waited to get a president for 12 years then to leave Washington.' With friends like her, Bill and Hillary Clinton can expect a reasonable honeymoon in this town, at least until the political wheel starts grinding again in earnest.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Man in tne News: Union fielder who will need a good grip - Jimmy Knapp One of the most surprising sights of the last two annual cricket matches between members of the Trades Union Congress general council and labour journalists has been Mr Jimmy Knapp fielding in the slips. Despite his white hair, the leader of Britain's biggest rail union has twice dived to the ground to hold an apparently impossible catch in one hand. This week, Mr Knapp has been trying to repeat an equally tricky industrial task: maintaining the respect of rail passengers while threatening strikes on London Underground and British Rail that would cause them immense disruption and inconvenience. Again, he is arguing not only for higher pay, but for employers to hold back reforms of working agreements. If the threatened one-day strikes - echoing the 'summer of discontent' in 1989 - were called, Mr Knapp would need all his persuasive powers. There are signs of worry in the Labour party and the TUC that he would fail, harming Labour's chances in the coming general election. Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, met Mr Knapp last week to express concern privately. Labour has bitter experience of the damage that strikes in public services can cause. The winter of discontent in 1979 played a pivotal part in bringing down the last Labour government. The party and unions have been gingerly moving towards an understanding that workers would sacrifice some intransigence over working practices to raise the quality of services. The National Union of Railwaymen, which together with the old National Union of Seamen now forms Mr Knapp's Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, is not an obvious source for such new thinking. The RMT has called ballots on both rail networks, while its old rival, the Aslef drivers union, has been more cautious, and sought arbitration on British Rail over a 7 per cent pay offer. The years since Mr Knapp's 1983 election as NUR general secretary have seen a succession of such ballots. Several have ended in failure, notably the vote against strikes over the introduction of driver-only trains by BR in 1985. This year, the union's opposition to new flexible working contracts for 6,500 BR signals and telecommunications staff has so far been ineffective. This has led to some managers' viewing Mr Knapp as a likeable but ineffectual figure, caught between a left-wing executive and a membership which is happier than the union pretends with pay and conditions. They cite the difficulty he had in persuading the executive to call off the 1989 strikes, and the fact that signals staff have signed new contracts despite union opposition. Yet Mr Knapp is a man of deceptive qualities in more than age (he is only 50). He lacks the personal authority wielded by his right-wing predecessor Mr Sid Weighell, but has displayed persistence and a shrewd tactical strength in welding support from the public and his members in a coalition against managers. He has pursued one simple argument since his election as a left-wing candidate in 1983: that the financial strategy of BR and its attempts to reduce the public subsidy through property sales have been built on sand. He says that the level of service in other European rail networks depends on subsidies which can alone deliver cheaper fares and the pay rates for workers which make them attractive employers. The conviction with which he puts this case is helped by his immersion from boyhood in the industry. He joined the railways at 15 as a signal box lad in Ayrshire after spending his childhood watching trains on the Glasgow main line. 'I have eat, slept and breathed (railways) all my life, and I have not seen rail workers making the advances they should have,' he says. This single-industry upbringing helps his credence with the public and in talks. 'When Jimmy sits across the table from (other negotiators) he knows more about the industry than they do,' says one RMT official. It also explains his admiration for Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, despite their different styles in defending jobs in their industries, and Mr Knapp's gentler demeanour. His task in making the RMT appear more rational than the railway managers has often been tough. The unwieldy structure of the NUR, with its full-time national executive and powerful activist committees was criticised in a study commissioned by the union itself just before the 1989 action. It severely limits the freedom of manoeuvre for a democratically-inclined leader. This has not been helped by the merger with the NUS. Although this has reprieved the NUR's automatic seat on the TUC general council by keeping the combined union above 100,000 members, the poor and undisciplined NUS has proved a tough administrative challenge since the merger. 'Getting the merger was the easy bit, the hard work is now,' says Mr Knapp. Mr Knapp has increased the strength of his union in two ways. First, he has led a public campaign by the rail unions to persuade passengers that BR and London Underground managers have acted capriciously and without a sensible long-term strategy. That campaign has been pursued outside periods of industrial conflict, and backed by well-produced booklets and leaflets. His second tactic has been learned through experience. After the blow of a defeat in a ballot to resist BR workshop closures in 1986, Mr Knapp reflected that it was hard to gain broad votes for industrial action when only sections of the union's membership were directly affected. Since then, the RMT has failed to resist several changes affecting minority groups. There are signs that employers have recognised this too, with BR attempting its working practices restructuring which started with signals staff group by group. But the NUR responded sagely in 1989 by wrapping its resistance to pay bargaining changes on which there was muted membership support together with the volatile issue of pay. This time, the disputes over job cuts on London Underground and BR restructuring have coincided once more with the annual pay round. 'The issues are separate at the moment,' says Mr Knapp with the air of a campaigner who has some shots in his locker if the battle gets rough. Whether he would want it to become so is another matter: a second summer of discontent would be a risky strategy. It would not only be the Labour party that could suffer from strikes. London Underground has already said it would prefer a short fierce battle to a long one. Above all, a result would depend on whether passengers would again sympathise with a tall white-haired Scot telling them the trains are stopped. It would not be an impossible catch to hold, but it would be hard.</p>

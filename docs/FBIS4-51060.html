			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth in series of reports: "Sights and Sounds of Chinese </F> Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160):  "Transformation Through Labor and the Training of Personnel" --  Previous installments published in the 23, 24 May China DAILY  REPORT]    [Text] Beijing 24 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--When a  foreigner visited the Shanghai Municipal Prison he found the  following fact unbelievable: A police officer was watching a  group of inmates, who were working with tools such as knives,  scissors, and pliers in their hands but peacefully getting along  with each other.    For this reason, the reporter asked a young police officer  whether he had ever found such a situation scary? He said with  a smile: "When I first came to work here, I felt somewhat tense  but now, I am quite used to it."    A philosopher once said: "Labor is the most beautiful thing  in the world." What does labor mean to criminals who have been  deprived of their freedom? Having visited prisons in Shanghai  and Shandong, people found that labor has transformed the world  and men have transformed themselves through labor; those who  used to reap without sowing can see that social wealth does not  come easily; those who used to love ease and hate work now  experience the joy of "reaping what one has sown"; and those who  used to start trouble can see how precious is cooperation in  solidarity.    The Chinese Government and its law enforcement organizations  hold the view that labor is one of the basic means for  transforming criminals and has corrected their bad habits  through labor. However, China opposes the practice of penalizing  criminals by means of labor or torturing and ill-treating them  through hard labor.    Li Dezhu, now serving his sentence at Shanghai No. 7  Transformation Through Labor Unit, used to work at the Grain  Bureau in Shanghai's Jingan District. He told this reporter  that labor in the unit was mostly in mechanized operations and  it was not at all tiring to work there. If someone  overfulfilled his work quota, he would be given a bonus, to a  maximum of 50 yuan a month, and the food was not bad either.    The Shanghai Administration for Transformation Through Labor  requires all prisons to give work assignments to inmates  according to their skills when making work arrangements. The  inmates enjoy the same treatment as workers and staffers in  state-owned enterprises regarding not working festivals and  holidays as well as labor protection and allowances for  heatstroke prevention are given to them during the hot season.  Shandong Provincial Prison is undergoing experiments with the  five-day week work system; the inmates must purchase labor  protective items at some appointed stores, where products  meeting the requirements are supplied. Should an accident take  place at work, the case will not be closed until the cause and  responsibility have been clarified and problems arising from the  accident resolved.    Currently, the behavioral points system [ji fen kao he zhi  du  6060 0433 5072 2702 0455 1653] is universally implemented in  Chinese prisons. The system links the inmate's work  accomplishments, attitude in admitting his or her crime, and  conditions in transformation to increase or commute the penalty  in order to conduct a quantitative assessment. Hence, there has  been an increase in the inmates' enthusiasm for labor with  competition in labor being developed. Some inmates who are  found to be satisfactory in their transformation have been sent  outside the prison to work, engage in farming, or to study on a  trial basis so that they might be closer to the "outside world."    With social and economic development, there has been an  increase in the number of economic criminal cases of  embezzlement and accepting bribes. Most of the inmates in this  category had intermediate or senior professional titles and were  staffers in economic management. Aiming at their  characteristics of being physically weak, Shanghai Municipal  Administration for Transformation Through Labor put forward the  principle of "educating and transforming men, nurturing and  salvaging qualified people," to exploit the inmates'  intelligence and encourage them to participate in invention and  creation. In the seventh national "Spark Cup" competition for  creations and inventions held in 1993, Shanghai's prisons won  seven awards for their projects; six projects, including "Star  Wars Chess" and "Automatic Rainproof Clothes Drying Rack" were  awarded certificates for patent rights from the State Patent  Bureau. The inmates not only enjoy the rights to the inventions  but will also receive rewards from the transfer of patents; at  the same time, they will be granted commutation of their  sentence.    "We must open broad avenues for able people and recruit them  without overstressing qualifications." This has actually been  achieved in Chinese prisons. Quite a few skillful craftsmen can  give play to their skills and mental labor is respected; those  who have professional titles at and above intermediate levels  are given monthly allowances. The inmates are unprecedentedly  active in participating in technical training and studies.  Shandong Universally has developed assessment through  discussion for technical professional titles. One of the  inmates received a senior technical professional title while in  prison, creating a precedent in China's history of transforming  criminals.</p>

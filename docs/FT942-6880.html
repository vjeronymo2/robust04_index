			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Siam Cement up 107% Siam Cement, Thailand's largest domestic conglomerate, reported a 107 per cent year-on-year rise in first-quarter consolidated net profits to Bt1.44bn (Dollars 57m). Parent net profits rose 85 per cent to Bt1.07bn, and earnings per share were Bt12.1 and Bt8.96 respectively. Mr Gerard Kruithof, an investment analyst at Peregrine Nithi Finance and Securities, said: 'Profits were likely to break out. The expansion in 1992 and 1993 depressed the bottom line: the added capacity wasn't running at full steam and they have an aggressive depreciation policy.' Siam Cement, which accounts for half the cement sold in Thailand, is spending Bt5.7bn to expand its Thungsong plant in Saraburi province by 2.1m tonnes a year to maintain market share.</p>

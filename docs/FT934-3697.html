			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Blank tapes row leaves Gatt negotiators out of tune It is a mercy that the 50-minute flight from Brussels to Geneva is too short to screen films. They would without doubt be American, and for bleary-eyed US and European Union negotiators who yesterday headed for the headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after inconclusive all-night negotiations, they would have rubbed salt in already deep wounds. As officials briefed Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, and other international trade negotiators, on why they remained at loggerheads over bilateral trade reforms, the issue of US film-makers' rights in Europe's audio-visual market appears to be at the heart of their outstanding problems. Before leaving for Geneva, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, said: 'We can see the outlines of a truly historic agreement involving 110 nations  .We were not, however, able to conclude agreement in the audio-visual sector because the EU was unwilling to provide foreign companies fair access to the revenues that are their due as owners of intellectual property rights.' The irony is that both Mr Kantor, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, arrived in Geneva with 99 per cent of an immensely ambitious market-opening package already settled. Mr Kantor talked yesterday of a package that would involve EU tariff cuts for US goods of 50 per cent, with zero-for-zero cuts alone being worth over Dollars 5bn. The EU has won similar cuts from the US. The agreement paves the way to a global tariff-cutting deal that is expected to add more than Dollars 230bn a year to trade by the year 2003. Why then has a dispute over copyright and royalty payments to US performing artists - worth tens of millions of dollars at most - put so much in jeopardy? Inevitably, part of the answer lies in irrationality: US negotiators who have bowed twice in the past 12 months to strident EU pressure to amend Uruguay Round plans to liberalise farm trade - at immense political cost at home - have focused on the audio-visual issue as one on which a stand must be made. A powerful and noisy lobby at home, headed by Mr Jack Valenti, president of the American Motion Pictures Association, has kept US negotiators under pressure. The sector is of immense importance to the US. Sales to Europe of films, music and television programmes amounted to Dollars 3.6bn last year. Only the aerospace sector earned more. In spite of an EU broadcasting directive which is supposed to reserve at least half of broadcasting time to European-made programmes, US productions accounted in 1991 for 81 per cent of European cinema screenings, more than 70 per cent of box-office takings, and 54 per cent of dramas and comedies on television. Europeans - particularly the French - are demanding protection for their audio-visual sector on cultural grounds. They have insisted this must include future technologies, like satellite and cable television, multimedia, and pay-for-view films, despite knowing that it will be virtually impossible to police such protection. While scoffing at such claims as protectionism in disguise, the US has bowed to most EU demands. Mr Kantor said yesterday: 'We have fully respected the cultural identity of Europe, and agreed to their cultural specificity language.' The residual dispute hinges on French and German levies on blank audio and video tapes which are used to subsidise the arts locally, and provide funds for local copyright holders. The US says American performers and producers have a right to a share of these levies, since the tapes are largely used to record US-made films or music. The EU retorts that there is no obligation under the Gatt to treat foreign and local performing artists equally. They also complain that since the US has no such levy, there is no reciprocal opportunity to raise funds in the US for European artists. There is no exact estimate of the sums involved, but the tens of millions discussed pale into insignificance alongside the billions at stake in the Uruguay Round. Angry exchanges over this issue are also distracting attention from the immense ground covered by US-EU negotiators in recent days in agreeing a far-reaching tariff-cutting package. This is understood to include: Tariffs on wood and paper products cut to zero. 'Very substantial' tariff cuts across the electronics sector, averaging 70 per cent, with some cuts to zero. Tariffs on steel cut to zero. Tariffs on some non-ferrous metals cut to zero. Some 80-85 per cent of US tariff peaks cut on glass, ceramics and textiles. The introduction of ocean shipping to Gatt disciplines. Completing a procurement deal. The package also agrees a new, more gentle, regime for reducing Europe's subsidised food exports. This bows to French demands and allows EU farmers to export in total an extra 8m tonnes of wheat over the coming six years. US farm exporters will reap similar gains.</p>

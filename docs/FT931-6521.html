			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Crisis of confidence among business leaders: The mood of big company bosses in continental Europe Continental Europe's big company bosses have written off 1993; most expect no improvement in the economic climate until next year. That is the common theme running through conversations with leading executives in the past few weeks. Their eyes are fixed firmly on Germany, Europe's largest economy and one facing some of the most difficult problems over the next few years. German bosses have no illusions. Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, the German arm of General Motors, paints the darkest picture. Opel will still make profits this year, but they will be reduced. Beyond that, he makes no guesses. 'Business confidence is not yet down at post-war lows, but the mood trend is the steepest downward curve seen since the war.' Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, cites a similar time scale. The post-war trend of steady growth interrupted by brief slowdowns and characterised by continuously improving prosperity has apparently come to an end, he says. This has created a pressing need for change in expectations and behaviour within Daimler, German industry and German society at large. Structural change at Daimler, including harsh cuts at the core Mercedes-Benz motor business, is underpinned by efforts to persuade the workforce that today's business conditions require revolutionary changes in behaviour. 'The relationship with our people and the unions should be changed,' says Mr Herman. 'We all need to open our eyes and see things in a worldwide perspective'. In charge for only a few months, he is clearly shocked by the routine 10 per cent absenteeism for sickness. 'Who would ever have dreamed that the UK would have 50 per cent the sickness rate of Germany?' Veba, the big German energy company, also finds local costs its most pressing worry. 'It is essential for Germany to remain competitive in terms of production costs', the company says, 'in order to protect market positions against low-cost producing nations, especially in eastern Europe.' Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, says the gloom spread by the current cyclical downturn has been compounded by a revival of doubts about Germany's ability to attract investment and broader issues of structural change. However, he feels the depression is overdone. When the going becomes rough, Germany tends to labour under a sort of 'hysteria' which exaggerates the real scale of the problem, he says. Opel's Mr Herman ascribes part of the gloomy outlook to the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy and adverse exchange rates. 'But that's not an issue with me', he says, 'because I can't affect it'. If German business leaders cannot influence the Bundesbank, others feel even more impotent. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computers group, is particularly critical of the Bundesbank's policies, which he believes are stifling growth in Germany and exporting recession to other European countries. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest chemicals group, says a cut in French and German interest rates after the elections in France next month is indispensable. 'The state of the European economy is worse even that during the 1973 oil-shock. I don't expect it to improve until 1994 at the earliest,' he says. His finance director, Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, warns that without a cut in interest rates, France risks the destruction of its industrial base. Those who have escaped, through devaluation, from the strait-jacket of German interest rates bless their good fortune. Mr Bo Berggren, president of Stora, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, takes comfort in the drop in the Swedish krona. Thanks to that, and to signs that overcapacity in pulp and paper is gradually being absorbed, he feels relatively optimistic. 'If things do not get substantially better in the next two years, I would be very disappointed.' Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector company, draws comfort from the decision to take the lira out of the exchange rate mechanism. The lira's float 'is very positive for the Italian economy and for Fiat,' he says. Although it will probably take at least six months, and possibly a year, for the full benefits to come through for Fiat, 'our competitiveness has been greatly enhanced'. Demand in the Italian car market, Europe's second biggest, is a concern, however. Last year it stayed relatively buoyant, but has been falling in recent months. January's figures showed a fall of almost 14 per cent on the same month the previous year. The outlook for the European car industry is of prime concern to Mr Mauritz Sahlin, group chief executive at SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer. 'Consumer confidence is so low in Europe that people are saving money rather than spending it on cars and household appliances,' he says. 'Until consumer confidence picks up, it's not very likely that there will be any increased demand in the European market.' In Germany, Opel's Mr Herman says: 'Consumer confidence is in free fall.' If those who rely on selling consumer durables such as cars are gloomy, one man who sells lower-priced consumer goods is noticeably more cheerful. Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman of Switzerland's SMH, the world's largest watch making group, sees 'many signs' of consumer confidence recovering, especially in France, the UK and Germany. France was also singled out for optimism by Stora's Mr Berggren, who says firm French and improving UK markets are offsetting the downturn in Germany. This optimism about France from its neighbours contrasts with an almost uniformly pessimistic view from industrialists in that country. Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault since last year, was boasting in mid-1992 of the company's best sales performance for a decade. He struck a far gloomier tone two weeks ago: the group barely broke even in the final quarter, because of sluggish sales and the handicap of the strong franc. Mr Schweitzer has no doubt that Renault is on course for another difficult year in 1993. Alcatel Alsthom in electronics, LVMH in luxury goods, Pechiney in packaging and Michelin in tyres have all experienced a deterioration in trading conditions since the autumn; all have suffered from the rise of the franc. Coping with a weak economic outlook is particularly hard when an industry is undergoing wrenching technological change. Mr De Benedetti's Olivetti, like other computer companies, is undergoing just such an experience. As a result, analysts say, it is likely to report a 1992 net loss which could reach L750bn (Pounds 332m). Mr De Benedetti's one dominant concern for the group 'is to convince our large customers that we will be around in five years'. For some business people, it is the threat to society, rather than to their own companies, that is the most serious concern. Mr Josef Ackermann, new chief executive of Credit Suisse, argues that though the European economy should start to pick up next year, an investment-led upswing will not be strong enough to bring about a significant reduction in unemployment. 'This is cause for great concern,' he says. 'The danger of protectionism will increase, raising the threat of a complete breakdown of the Gatt negotiations. High unemployment in general, and mass unemployment in certain countries, regions and cities, as well as among young people, will place the social and political fabric under pressure.' SMH's Mr Hayek also stresses the social threat of unemployment. 'I just hope we will not see an extremist coming with a plan to build autobahns, as we did 60 years ago,' he says. Several of those interviewed stressed the need for government actions. Mr Jorma Ollila, president of Nokia, the Finnish consumer electronics and telecommunications, company, points to a hopeful transatlantic example: 'The fact that we have a leader in the US who is clearly trying to address the economic issues brings a certain amount of optimism about a healthy long-term development there.' Few were as positive about European governments. Daimler-Benz's Mr Reuter says there are economic policy vacuums in European capitals. He wants a framework industrial policy for the EC bound together by a common European currency. 'The roots of our problems lie in the lack of convincing European solutions,' he says. Mr Leonardo Vannotti, president of Ascom, the Swiss telecommunications manufacturer, speaks for others when he asks: 'How can I be optimistic when I do not see any concerted action in Europe to get things moving?'

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY DIDN'T BUSH FIRST GET CITIZENS OUT?  </P> <P> No one has asked Bush why he reacted so quickly in the Gulf crisis with the  embargo and show of military force and did not act first to protect and get the  Americans and other foreign people out of there.  </P> <P> Why was it such a surprise to him that they were taken hostage? Also, now this  afterthought of asking for military and monetary help from other countries.  </P> <P> During the first week of this crisis, a reporter asked Bush a question (while  he was on vacation in Maine), and his reply was a very sharp "I don't mix  business and pleasure." Who was minding the store?  </P> <P> BARBARA BERRY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

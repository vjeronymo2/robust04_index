			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan hit by setback in waste services Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan fell 22 per cent yesterday as the waste management group revealed significantly lower than expected pre-tax profits for the first half. The shares dropped 22p to 98p following a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.35m. Turnover fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 63.2m. Analysts had been looking for profits of about Pounds 13m. Shanks also warned of a Pounds 5m charge to restructure the waste, environmental, and energy divisions. The company said it planned to cut between 90 and 100 jobs from the senior and middle management levels as a result of integrating the three divisions. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the rationalisation would result in cost savings of about Pounds 5m next year. He said first half profits had been hit by a sharp decline in the higher margin waste services business and the increased costs of meeting regulation requirements. Many customers were reducing the amount of waste produced for various reasons, said Mr Waddell, including the effects of recession on trading and a general move to avoid producing unwanted materials. The worst performer was environmental services, which includes the Rechem company purchased in 1990. Operating profits fell by 29 per cent to Pounds 4.58m, on sales 3 per cent lower at Pounds 19.8m. Waste services operating profits were Pounds 6.58m (Pounds 8.19m), on sales of Pounds 34.1m. Energy services moved up from near-breakeven to contribute Pounds 746,000, with sales of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 2.18m). The profits line was also affected by losses in the construction business, for which Shanks took a Pounds 19.3m restructuring and bad debt charge last year. This division incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2m. The company said it had recovered Pounds 1.7m of the Pounds 17m in bad debts for which it had provided. None of this had been written back. The interim dividend is held at 2.24p, payable from earnings per share down from 6.5p to 3.5p. COMMENT While bad news was widely expected on the construction side, few thought to see such a sharp downturn in volume and margins in the core waste services division. Although the decline appears to have stabilised in the second half, questions remain over the extent to which some business has disappeared for good. Many sizeable customers, such as chemical companies, have been reducing or disposing of waste themselves. On the brighter side, Shanks still boasts good margins and should benefit from cost cutting. As one of the largest waste disposal companies, it is also well placed to benefit from licensing regulations set to begin next year. For those holding the shares at the moment, the yield of 7 per cent may look attractive. Otherwise, the play is on recovery, which still looks to be some way away. Forecasts were pulled back from Pounds 26m to Pounds 16m for a prospective p/e of about 8.</p>

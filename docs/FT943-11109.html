			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Data provide good omens for bulls - New York After Friday's 33-point rally by the Dow industrials, share prices could fall prey to profit-taking this morning, but the outlook for the week is decidedly bullish. Indeed, the mood on Wall Street has turned full circle in the past seven days. At last week's opening, investors were wringing their hands over the prospect of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates. When Mr Alan Greenspan warned that it was an open question whether the Fed would lift rates in the near future, most market watchers were convinced a decision to do so had already been made. This morning, with the Commerce Department's preliminary readings on second-quarter economic growth out of the way, the pundits are not so sure. 'The surprise was that there was no surprise,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany, the New York securities house, remarking on Friday's announcement that the economy grew at a 3.7 per cent rate, a shade below the consensus forecast. With Mr Greenspan's words ringing in their ears, some investors had feared growth would come closer to 5 per cent. Still, a backward view of the fundamentals usually fails to shift sentiment so radically. But Friday's data also included news of big jump in business inventories, which suggests the economy had produced goods faster than consumers could buy them. 'That's not a good omen for future growth,' says Mr Martin Regalia, chief economist for the Chamber of Commerce. It's a good omen for share prices, however. Combined with a more stable dollar, the GDP data lessened the likelihood that the Fed will tighten credit before its August 16 policy-making session. 'The report could not have come at a better time,' says Mr Johnson, assuming a contrary viewpoint. Last week, 'bearishness was becoming very widespread and embedded. That's when it's time to start thinking positive.' The First Albany analyst expects this week's economic news to reinforce the favourable outlook. The July survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management, due out today, is likely to show a decline in manufacturing activity. The index of leading economic indicators, scheduled for Wednesday, should show no change for the fourth month in a row. Friday's crucial employment data is expected to bring the most reliable confirmation of a moderating economic trend. Non-farm payrolls are thought to have grown by 200,000 last month. If so, Mr Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at AG Edwards in St Louis, sees a sustained move forward by stocks. 'There could be some resistance at the 3,800 level,' he says, 'but the market is sure to break through before long.'</p>

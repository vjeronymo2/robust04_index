			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Brascan results down heavily in first quarter BRASCAN, a key management holding company controlled by the Bronfman family of Toronto, forecasts that stronger commodity markets would bring some recovery in earnings this year. However, the company, which owns 49 per cent of Noranda, Canada's biggest resource group, earned CDollars 7.3m (USDollars 6.13m), or 24 cents a share, in the first quarter, down 37 per cent from a year earlier. In all of 1991, it lost CDollars 18m, or 60 cents, against profit of CDollars 80m, or 40 cents a share. Mr Jack Cockwell, president, told Brascan's annual meeting that better metal and lumber prices would favour Noranda later this year. However, recovery in other sectors may be slow, he warned. The company is to retain its dividend of CDollars 1.04 a common share. Mr Cockwell told the meeting the company would not bid for Union Gas, one of Ontario's two gas distributors.</p>

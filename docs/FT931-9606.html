			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho tumbles 61% to Pounds 80m - Net borrowings cut to Pounds 849m and likely to be further reduced LONRHO, the international trading group, reported a 61 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1992, in line with the forecast made before its recent rights issue. Profits before tax fell from Pounds 205m to Pounds 80m on reduced sales of Pounds 3.87bn (Pounds 4.85bn). Profits before extraordinary items fell from Pounds 90m to Pounds 8m. Net borrowings have fallen from Pounds 1.09bn to Pounds 849m because of minority investment in group businesses and the sale of subsidiaries and assoc-iates. Last year the government controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company purchased a one third stake in the Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177.5m. Without the disposals and minority investments net debt would have increased, mainly because of the high capital expenditure running at Pounds 182m (Pounds 237m). At the time of the rights issue Lonrho said net debt had risen to Pounds 947m. This has now fallen after the Pounds 124m sale of VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi cars, and the cash call. The bulk of the group's bank loans are due within one to five years. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier who was recently appointed joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, said the group was committed to further reducing borrowings through minor disposals. Net interest payable amounted to Pounds 99m (Pounds 112m). A further Pounds 21m (Pounds 27m) was capitalised during the period. The 1991 figures were adjusted to take account of the group's decision to eliminate the 'intangible' value of Pounds 117m of its remaining newspaper title, The Obser-ver. The separate businesses reported the following pre-tax profits: motor and equipment distribution Pounds 14m (Pounds 32m); general trade Pounds 14m (Pounds 35m); manufacturing Pounds 3m (Pounds 6m); mineral extraction and refining Pounds 29m (Pounds 77m); leisure Pounds 3m (Pounds 13m); financial services Pounds 4m (Pounds 23m) and agriculture Pounds 13m (Pounds 19m). The tax charge for the year fell from Pounds 63m to Pounds 38m because of the fall in profits and the sale of VAG. Net assets per share, adjusted for the rights issue and the sale of VAG, were 157p. Earnings per share fell from 13.9p to 1.2p and a recommended final divided of 2p brings the total for the year to 4p (13p). COMMENT Lonrho's only real surprise was that it published a set of figures which contained no surprises. The City has come to expect the worst from Lonrho and was therefore relieved that the group's results were no more disappointing than its own forecast of last year. This mainly explains the 7p rise in the shares which closed at 82p. But the figures are not a cause of celebration. In terms of fundamentals nothing has changed. Profit before tax fell in all the group's activities and geographical areas. It will take a significant rise in the price of gold and platinum before mineral extraction and refining profits return to previous levels. With forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100m, giving earnings per share of 3p, the shares are on a pros-pective multiple of 27, which reflects the collapse in profits.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / MPs quit cash-for-questions probe A parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Tory MPs received cash for tabling parliamentary questions was in chaos last night after seven Labour MPs withdrew in fury that it would not be open to the public. As the government faced mounting pressure over accusations of 'sleaze' the MPs - who make up the Labour contingent on the powerful committee on privileges - protested that justice had to be seen to be done. The all-party committee, which examines cases of parliamentary misconduct, is due to interview two Tory MPs over reports that they were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 in return for tabling parliamentary questions. The two MPs, Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick, have denied the allegations. Clashes erupted between members of the committee on Tuesday night after Tory MPs narrowly secured a vote to hold the hearings in private. The Labour committee members - including Mr Doug Hoyle, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, and Mr Tony Benn, former cabinet minister - said yesterday that the public deserved to witness the evidence on television. Mr Hoyle said: 'The public are extremely concerned about MPs generally and it has got to be seen that we are quite prepared to look at all these cases in public, so the public can see what we are doing about it.' He and his Labour colleagues said that they would not attend hearings 'until further discussions have taken place' between Conservative and Labour whips. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, yesterday defended the decision not to hold public hearings. He cited a 'long-standing procedure of hearing evidence in the first part of its inquiry . . . in private'. Yesterday Labour MPs pressed for the publication of details of an official investigation into claims that Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, had been involved in insider dealing. Sixty-one Labour MPs signed an emergency Commons motion 'regretting' that the case had not been taken before the courts and demanding the publication of an inspectors' report which cleared him of wrongdoing. The prime minister rejected calls for publication of the report earlier this week.</p>

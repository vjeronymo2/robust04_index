			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Former Banesto chief quizzed Mr Mario Conde, former chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), is to be questioned today by a Madrid high court judge who on Friday ordered the imprisonment of Mr Arturo Roman, the bank's former deputy chairman. Mr Roman was arrested and refused bail by Judge Manuel Garca Castellon after two days of questioning in connection with a fraud probe into the banking group, which collapsed a year ago. Legal officials said the questioning centred on about Pta5bn (Pounds 24.3m) allegedly gained by fraud from Banesto shareholders. A flamboyant celebrity symbol of Spain's booming late 1980s, when he became a billionaire, Mr Conde was indicted on fraud charges last month. He became chairman of Banesto in 1987, and was dismissed by the Bank of Spain last December, together with his fellow Banesto directors, after an official inspection discovered the banking group had overvalued its Pta7,000bn assets by Pta503bn.</p>

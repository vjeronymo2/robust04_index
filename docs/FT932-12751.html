			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: Chekhov meets the Brooklyn sisters - Broadway Theatre What a joy to pass a few hours in the company of the sisters Rosensweig, each as lovely as Wendy Wasserstein's play about them, which has transferred to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway after a sold-out off-Broadway run. They are achievers, those three Rosensweig girls, born in Flatbush, Brooklyn and now living individually exceptional lives across the globe, who come together for eldest sister Sara's 54th birthday at her home in Queen Anne's Gate, London. The clash and mingle of British and American cultures is more than the subject of this play but its formal lineage. The Sisters Rosensweig combines the wit and style of a British drawing room comedy - everyone here is clever, accomplished, wealthy, or at least good-looking, and always has a great exit line - with the inward focus of the American family drama, and spices it all with a dash of Chekhov. The play is steeped in Jewish references which lend it not only much of its humor but its deepest resonance: the Rosensweigs cannot move forward, Wasserstein suggests, until they can live with their cultural past, as Jews, Americans, and women. Like their Chekhovian predecessors these three sisters are in search of an elusive moment of happiness, but this is not a play of smouldering subtext and compromised desires. The Rosensweigs, like the women in Wasserstein's previous plays, Uncommon Women and Others, Isn't It Romantic, and the Pulitzer-prize-winning The Heidi Chronicles, are finding their way to their own personal Moscows. The Sisters Rosensweig is set during 1991, the breakup of the Soviet Union provides a symbolic equivalent to the shakeups happening between and within the characters on stage. The sister whose world needs and gets the most shaking is Sara Goode (Jane Alexander), a high-powered manager for the Hongkong Shanghai Bank who lives in London with her teenaged daughter Tess (Julie Dretzin). England is the perfect place for Sara to hide from herself: 'What a relief,' she says, 'to live in a country where your emotions are openly repressed.' Tess is less impressed with expatriate life: she is threatening to join the Lithuanian resistance with her witless working-class boyfriend (Patrick Fitzgerald). The shaking starts for Sara when Merv (Robert Klein), an American faux-furrier and passionate Zionist, crashes her birthday party. In town for the party is Sara's youngest sister Pfeni (Christine Estabrook), a restless travel writer who 'leads her life like she's on an extended Junior year abroad.' Pfeni's inability to find permanence extends to her romantic life: her lover, Geoffery, a British theatre director (John Vickery, in a wonderfully showy turn), is bisexual. Completing the trio is Gorgeous Teitelbaum (Madeline Kahn), a radio pop psychologist and wife of a wealthy Boston lawyer, who comes to London leading a tour of her temple women's group. The character, which could easily be a brassy cliche, is in Wasserstein's sensitive writing and Kahn's brilliantly understated performance, a suburban sage. Gorgeous's hilariously aphoristic yenta-ing: 'You can't judge a book by its cover,' she tells Pfeni about Geoffery, 'but it seems to me that you are in the wrong library,' masks her own secrets and deceptions. Daniel Sullivan's direction is as elegant, subtle, and attentive to detail as John Lee Beatty's set and Jane Greenwood's costumes. Jane Alexander brings just the right combination of defensiveness and gentleness to Sara; her performance is perfectly observed down to her touch of British accent. Robert Klein, best known as a comedian, is a less polished actor than the others, but his rough edges make him a wholly plausible Merv: out of place, but full of a singular charm. Estabrook seems implausibly wan for a woman who has made a career as unconventional as Pfeni's, but the problem lies as much in the writing as in her performance. Pfeni's personal journey is less satisfying than her sisters'; she wafts off at the end of the play as she entered it, still 'a wandering Jew.' Perhaps Wasserstein is leaving room for The Sisters Rosensweig II: Pfeni's Return? We can only hope.</p>

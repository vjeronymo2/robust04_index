			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Observer: Swann talk Amid all the fuss over the relationship between BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey and Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC director general, it is worth recalling the advice of a former BBC chairman, the late Lord Swann. Lord Swann, who died a couple of years ago, said that the director general should drive while the chairman be left to read the map. Many feel that the problem with Hussey is not his age but the fact that he has been doing too much driving and not enough map-reading. One of the side-effects is that not enough thought has gone into making the key appointments to the corporation at a particularly sensitive time in its affairs. Pamela Taylor, the new director of corporate affairs, is an able recruit, but John Tusa steps down as managing director of the World Service at the end of the year and there is still no word yet on his replacement. The powers that be at the BBC are thought to be keen to see a woman in the World Service job - which helps explain why the names of Jenny Abramsky, editor of BBC radio's news and current affairs, and Patricia Hodgson, head of the planning and policy unit, are frequently mentioned. However, one other name being canvassed is that of Cheung Man-Yee, director of programmes at Radio and TV Hong Kong. She also happens to be chairing a Commonwealth Broadcasting Association conference in Botswana at the moment. Perhaps Sir Michael Checkland has gone to check her out?</p>

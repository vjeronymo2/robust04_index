			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Kim Hak-sun from the </F> "International Focus" section]    [Text] The improvement of relations between the United  States and North Korea and between Japan and North Koeea which  is believed to be realized this year with the appearance of a  clue to the solution of the North Korean nuclear issue is  drawing our attention. Depending on North Korea's attitude,  there is a high possibility that North Korea and the United  States will establish their respective embassies in Washington  and Pyongyang within one to two years.    Diplomatic observers predict that if the present trend  continues as it is, the third round of high-level U.S.-North  Korean talks will be held in February to discuss the matter of  improving diplomatic relations and economic cooperation between  them, including the matter of eliminating the suspicion of North  Korea's nuclear development.    Because North Korea is the most closed society in the world  and distrust between the United States and North Korea is so  deep, there are many obstacles that should be eliminated before  diplomatic relations are realized between them.  <H5>  North Korea's Attitude Cannot Be Foreseen </H5>   In view of the present situation we can hardly foresee what  will happen in the negotiations between the United States and  North Korea even before they realize the third round of their  high-level talks. This is because North Korea's attitude so far  has made us believe so. For instance, bilateral negotiations  that we had believed to be successful have suddenly returned to  the starting point so frequently that even experts could hardly  make estimates.    At present North Korea has agreed with the United States on  nuclear inspections and the resumption of North-South dialogue.  However, many experts wonder if North Korea will sincerely  discuss detailed procedures for the inspections with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and will provide  sincere coordination to the IAEA inspections.    Diplomatic experts who are critical of North Korea's  negotiation attitude diagnose that "it is difficult to expect a  de facto dialogue between North and South Korea because North  Korea has persistently employed the policy of splitting up the  cooperative relations between South Korea and the United States  particularly in connection with the issue of North-South Korean  dialogue." Of course, South Korean and U.S. officials concerned  believe that North Korea will have to offer coordination to some  degree if it finds this necessary.    The United States thinks that if North Korea sincerely shows  its intention to hold dialogue with South Korea, the ROK  Government will not oppose the third round of U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks even before the exchange of special envoys to  discuss the North- South mutual nuclear inspection issue is  realized.    Many experts on North Korean affairs, including senior  researcher (Leonard Spector) at the Carnegie Foundation,  diagnose that because its present internal and external  realities are completely different from those of the past, North  Korea will inevitably seek even partial opening up and  internationalization within a scope that does not hurt its  present political system.    Estimating the overall situation, it is almost certain that  the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks will be  held within several weeks. The U.S. Government position is that  North Korea and the United States, which have had hostile  relations for half a century, can discuss all pending issues,  including the North Korean nuclear issue, at the third round of  talks where they are to discuss the matter of improving  political and economic relations.  <H5>  Normalization May Hardly Come </H5>   If the third round of high-level talks are held, the United  States is expected to put forward seven demands to the North  Korean side, namely, the complete return to the NPT  [Non-Proliferation Treaty], special inspection of two undeclared  nuclear sites; tangible progress in inter-Korean dialogue,  including mutual nuclear inspections; suspension of missile  exports; improvement of the human rights situation; return of  the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean war; cessation  of terrorist activities; and suspension of denunciation of the  United States. These demands were put forth also by the Bush  administration as a precondition for the improvement of U.S.  relations with North Korea.    On the other hand, the North Korean side is expected to come  up with all the pending issues it wishes to solve with the  United States--such as the normalization of relations;  assistance in building light-water moderated reactors; the  abolition of the Armistice Agreement and the signing of a peace  agreement; the disbanding of the UN Forces Command and the  withdrawal of U.S. troops from the ROK; lifting the restrictions  on trade with and investment in North Korea pursuant to the U.S.  law on trade with hostile states; lifting the ban on  communications; a promise not to wage a preemptive nuclear  strike on North Korea and not to use nuclear weapons against the  North; economic cooperation; and assistance with North Korean  entry into international economic bodies--and a call for a  package solution, according to diplomatic sources in Washington.    Will it be possible that all these problems are solved as a  package deal in the third round of talks and bring about the  normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations within this year?  To this question, even the most optimistic observers are  expressing doubts.    Both sides intend to carry through all of their demands in  the third round of talks, but it is practically impossible to  settle so many pending issues at one stroke.    Indeed, North Korea is eager to normalize its relations with  the United States, but if it fails to be so successful as  establishing its embassy in the United States, it may well try  to establish a liaison office or a trade mission within this  year to concentrate on economic cooperation, according to an  analysis of diplomatic experts.    U.S. Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis stressed on 5  January that in the third round of talks, the United States will  certainly induce North Korea to accede to special inspections.  <H5>  Flexibility for Special Inspection </H5>   The experts, however, are of the opinion that North Korea  will take a stubborn attitude of refusing to permit the first  ever special inspection of the undeclared nuclear sites by the  IAEA, thus using it as a card for negotiation.    Because of this position of North Korea, the third round of  talks is likely to come up against quite a few difficulties.  Therefore, four or five or more round of talks could be  necessary, involving many rounds of unofficial contacts for each  of them.    However, as to the method of nuclear inspections, the United  States and the IAEA hinted a flexibility of considering methods  that could bring about the effect of inspection close to the  special inspection without using the term "special inspection."  This enhances the chances for reaching compromise. There is a  high probability that the special inspection will be linked with  the inter-Korean mutual nuclear inspection including inspection  of the U.S. military bases in the ROK, thus complicating the  process for the solution of the problem, diplomatic sources said.    The officials, in particular, revealed that there is a high  possibility that the North Korean side will utilize this issue  as a means for "adjustment of speed." Diplomatic observers in  Washington believe that there was a previous instance that North  Korea suspended the mutual visits of separated families while it  was partially pushing ahead with them after having judged that  the visits were harmful to maintaining its system. Therefore, it  is highly likely that North Korea will push for the improvement  of relations with the United States while continuing the  political and diplomatic evaluation of its efforts for the  improvement.  <H5>  Dependence on Adjustment of Speed by the North </H5>   Meanwhile, the U.S. side is regarding the issue of missile  proliferation as a very sensitive issue no less than the nuclear  issue. Therefore, it is likely that the United States will not  allow the improvement of relations without the solution to this  problem. At the same time, the observers predict that the human  rights issue, to which the Clinton administration attaches as  much importance as that to nonproliferation of mass lethal  weapons, will emerge as a major pending issue when  ambassador-level envoys are exchanged, although the issue may  not be a grave obstacle at the stage of establishing liaison  offices.    A U.S. State Department official said that "one should pay  keen attention to the development of ROK-China relations before  reading the script of improvement of U.S.-North Korea  relations," thus strongly suggesting a method of step-by-step  approaches.    In addition to the U.S. Government, a diplomatic expert who  maintains close relations with North Korea noted that "epochal  steps, including the disbanding of the UN Command and  replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement,  should be taken before the two sides formally establish  diplomatic relations." He added that "it seems that this issue  will not be resolved simply in the future few months" and that  "the establishment of mutual liaison offices within this year  itself, if realized, should be assessed as successful."    He revealed that "North Korea seems to wish that the United  States will open communications with North Korea first of all,  exclude North Korea from being subject to application of the law  on trade with hostile countries, and open the door for economic  relations with it." He pointed to the great possibility that  North Korea will attach greater importance to economic  cooperation than to formal diplomatic relations, which will  rapidly accelerate its opening up, in a bid to maintain its  system.    He observed that the North Korean side's request for U.S.  support for construction of a light-water atomic reactor is  aimed at making the United States lift its restrictions on  investment and trade. Some other observers note that there is a  possibility that North Korea will, as in the past, pursue a  "package deal solution." However, North Korea is not in a  position to immediately accept all of the U.S. side's demands.    In conclusion, it is a common view of experts that the  script  concerning the establishment of diplomatic relations between the  United States and North Korea will vary in different forms  according to the degree of adjusting the speed by the North  Korean side. There is also a pessimistic view that even the  establishment of liaison offices will not be possible within  this year.</p>

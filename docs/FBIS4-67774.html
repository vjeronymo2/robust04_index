			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``(rc)''-signed report: ``The Skoda Plant Is Liquidating </F> Its Research Reactor'']    [Text] The Plzen Skoda factory is liquidating its SR  research reactor in Vochov near Plzen, including spent fuel and  unused fuel. The reactor is of their own construction and  manufacture and was used from 1970 until 1989. This information  was provided to RUDE PRAVO by Engineer Frantisek Svitak, deputy  director of the Skoda Nuclear Engineering Plant in Plzen. The  Skoda plant does not need the reactor any more. It was used to  test various measuring methods and devices, to train reactor  operators, to train students from the West Bohemian University,  and to conduct radiation testing for the republican Civil  Defense organization.    Despite the fact that the reactor is not contaminated (it  was  reconstructed in 1986, and was not put into operation after that  date), all legal standards must be met during the liquidation of  the workplace in Vochov. Regulations regarding the handling of  fuel are equally strict. The State Office for Nuclear Safety in  Prague and the International Agency for Atomic Energy in Vienna  supervise fuel handling. Moreover, any fuel handling must not  contravene the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Materials.    Currently, they have about 10 kilograms of uranium 235 in  sandwich-type metallic fuel at the Skoda plant. The Slovak  Technical university has shown interest in the reactor and fuel.  Because of the lack of funds on the part of the customer,  however, the negotiations failed. Prospective buyers in Germany  have also shown interest, but did not meet requirements. The  Nuclear Research Institute in Rez near Prague is currently  interested in the reactor. According to Engineer Svitak, The  Skoda plant is conducting the most promising negotiations with  two French firms that would like to buy the research reactor and  the fuel.</p>

			<p>Addresses   Crimean Issue at News Conference   <F P=102> LD1905224894 Kiev UT-1 Television Network in Ukrainian 1800  GMT 19 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> LD1905224894 </F> <F P=104>  Kiev UT-1 Television Network </F> <F P=105>  Ukrainian </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on the </F> Crimean situation from a news conference given for editors of  regional newspapers in Kiev on 19 May -- recorded]    [Text] Ukraine has done everything possible, and I am not  exaggerating anything at this point, to satisfy both the  political and legal problems that have arisen in Crimea, namely:  Crimea, the population of Crimea, the authorities of Crimea, at  that time the oblast council of Crimea, brought up the issue of  granting autonomy to Crimea and held a referendum, as they say,  and the Supreme Council decided to grant autonomy to the Crimean  Republic.    When the issue of delimitation of powers arose, a law,  although with a delay, was adopted. When the Crimean  authorities raised the question of broader economic  independence, this was granted to Crimea. That is to say,  Ukraine was responding, and, what is more, it was responding  sincerely and, let us say, with all good intentions to all those  political, legal, and, partially, economic issues, because not  everything is easily resolved.    When they elected the president in Crimea, I congratulated  him, invited him to visit Kiev, and here in this building, an  agreement was reached during talks, not in the documents that we  wanted to work with Crimea constructively, that we would do  everything possible so that its economic independence could be  expanded. However, the condition of the state's territorial  integrity, its, let us say, status, stipulated by the  Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, was a determining  factor. It seemed to me then that we had come to this  understanding. But right after this, they began to take steps  of an absolutely opposite nature. Each decree, at least those  that were issued on political issues, unitlaterally contradicted  not only the Ukrainian Constitution but the Constitution of  Crimea itself, not only Ukrainian laws, but Crimean laws as  well. That is to say, virtually all, as they say, enforceable  enactments were ignored.    And now, the situation has reached the point where it has  been officially announced that Crimea wants to secede, strictly  speaking, from Ukraine, and its leaders are declaring that this  is the drift, so to speak, at first toward their own state and  then toward Russia. Both the chairman of the newly elected  Supreme Council and other Crimean figures were saying this.    This is why time has come for us to declare: ignoring the  legislation of Ukraine, ignoring the realities, ignoring the  anxiety over Crimea existing in the world, and ignoring  international legal norms, stipulated both in the documents of  the United Nations Organization and the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, Crimea wants to unilaterally adopt  documents that go beyond the Ukrainian Constitution, its laws,  and the law on the delimitation of plenary powers.    This is why we have made a decision that if they do not  abide  by these fundamental provisions of principle, we shall act  resolutely and consistently to defend Ukraine's territorial  integrity and its state. I have issued decrees on subordinating  the Crimean bodies of internal affairs directly to the minister  of internal affairs of Ukraine, all the security services of  Crimea to the chief of the Ukrainian Security Service, and all  the judicial bodies to the Ukrainian minister of justice.    I will further act within the framework of the Constitution,  in the constitutional regime. If the Supreme Council adopts the  documents you have mentioned, I will immediately submit to the  Ukrainian Supreme Council a draft resolution on stopping the  resolutions of the Crimean Supreme Council. That is to say, we  shall act, I emphasize this, within the framework of the  Constitution, our plenary powers, strictly proceeding from the  fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, as is written  in the Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea. Any revision  of this fundamental provision of principle, entails inevitable  grave consequences for those who carry this out.    Everybody must understand that there is a limit for any  society and for any state that no one is allowed to exceed.  This limit is the territorial integrity of the state. And he  who wishes to ignore this, to be guided by his ambitions and,  let us say, other principles, he must know that he acts contrary  to laws, he must know that grave consequences are possible, he  must know that these grave consequences will occur, first and  foremost, in Crimea itself, and will be experienced by the  population of Crimea. And those who provoke these consequences  will be responsible for this, no matter how high his regalia and  plenary powers, as they say.</p>

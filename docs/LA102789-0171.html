			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> TEACHER OF YEAR ASPIRANT KEEPS STANDARDS HIGH  </P> <P> Wilhelmina Van Hunnick, a teacher at Kennedy High School, is a teacher in  pursuit of excellence, one who tries to nurture the character of her students.  As a result, she has gained the admiration of many. She was recently chosen as  one of four Orange County teachers to compete for the statewide title of  Teacher of the Year.  </P> <P> "I feel being chosen is a great honor, not only for me, but for all the  teachers at Kennedy," said Van Hunnick, who has taught for 23 years.  </P> <P> The business teacher said she sets high standards, tries to provide a strong  role model and reinforces a reverence for education, thus giving every one of  her students -- regardless of his or her ability -- the opportunity to achieve  goals.  </P> <P> "Every student can work to his or her ability and is not satisfied until his  best is done," Van Hunnick said. "With all the programs for the GATE-identified  (Gifted and Talented Education) and special education students, the 'average'  students get lost in the shuffle."  </P> <P> Van Hunnick divides her school day between four computer application classes  and one typing/word-processing class.  </P> <P> "She tries her hardest to help her students," said senior Allen Gipson, one of  Van Hunnick's computer students. "She's helped me by setting up special  computers since I'm in a wheelchair."  </P> <P> Van Hunnick also spends a lot of time with students outside the classroom. She  advises the school's Future Business Leaders of America club, a student  organization that stresses business skills and leadership.  </P> <P> "I attract average students through FBLA," she said. "Average kids as well as  GATE students can excel and earn recognition."  </P> <P> Kennedy Principal Warren Stephenson said: "Willie is a very strong,  hard-working individual. She cares about her students. She has an ability to  make them work for her. They absorb her excitement and, in return, she gets  positive results."  </P></p>

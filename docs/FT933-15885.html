			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tokyo pushes to win entry to bigger security council JAPAN yesterday formally lodged its bid for a permanent seat on an enlarged United Nations security council by pledging that it would discharge all the obligations that this would entail. Japan's response to the UN on plans to restructure the security council calls for it to be expanded to about 20 members. In choosing permanent members the UN should give due weight to the country's political and economic weight in the world, according to the Japanese. Tokyo's campaign for a permanent security council seat, which has recently won the support of the US, may put it at odds with the UK and France. Japanese officials stressed that the proposal for an expanded UN security council was intended to avoid disadvantaging existing members. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said the question of Japan's wish for a seat was one that needed to be taken 'very gently.' Speaking shortly after his arrival in Tokyo for the Group of Seven summit, Mr Major said there were 'lots of ramifications,' not least the competing demands of other countries that would like to be permanent members of the security council. Discussions on the issue would last for some time, he predicted. Japanese officials have taken a low key approach to winning support for their campaign. Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, said that Japan wanted to make the security council more representative while maintaining its effectiveness in dealing with international disputes. He said Japan wanted the restructuring of the security council to coincide with the United Nation's 50th anniversary in 1995. Japan's claim to be ready to deal with the crises the security council addresses was undermined by it missing the deadline for responses to the UN consultation paper on the council's future. This was because different arms of the bureaucracy were at odds over how many seats the expanded council should have.</p>

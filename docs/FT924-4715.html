			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Boardroom bosses urged to tighten their belts: Recession and the public sector wages squeeze are fuelling demands for restraint in top executive pay Mr Peter Wood, the Royal Bank of Scotland director who has just trebled his annual pay, to more than Pounds 6m, believes the only people who will complain about the rise 'are ill-informed moaning minnies'. There are, however, a growing number of moaning minnies. And they have recently won some support from Mr John Major, the prime minister. By appealing to senior executives not to award themselves large pay rises during the recession Mr Major unashamedly took the side of public opinion against business's top earners. Such exhortations to top executives, and the private sector as a whole, to follow the public sector pay squeeze, are unlikely to have much immediate impact. But over the medium term, pay is affected by factors other than supply and demand; one of those is the prevailing political climate. Executive pay, for instance, rose strongly in the 1980s - as top marginal tax levels tumbled - partly because the government encouraged an increase in differentials between managers and workers. Some senior executives, such as Lord King, now detect an attempt to reverse the process. He warns: 'We must be careful about going back to the awful mistakes of the Heath days. If we want to attract talent we have to be able to pay for it.' But others, such as Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, would welcome restraint: 'Some people deserve the big salaries but others clearly do not. Just look at what some of the utilities are paying for jobs that have not changed that much since privatisation.' Mr Haskins and his six fellow directors - including three non-executives - earn less than Pounds 500,000 in total; this is about the same as what the chief executive of Unigate receives for running a company less than half the size of Northern Foods and less successful. Such variations in pay within the same sector abound. In 1991, for instance, the chairman of Fisons earned Pounds 343,000, while the chairman of ICI - a company with sales 10 times greater - earned only Pounds 499,000. There are often good reasons for such apparent inconsistencies. Mr Haskins points out that it can be easier to run a company which is both large and profitable than one which is small and struggling. 'I always put my best-paid people into the worst-performing divisions,' he says. But such considerations mean that establishing objective criteria for the absolute level of top pay is very difficult. The flood of surveys of executive pay increases can also be confusing because they tend to look at a variety of different categories of executive, and they seldom specify the size of company. Even the question of what should count as remuneration is complex. According to the Noble Lowndes consultancy, basic salary accounts for about 70 per cent of average top executive remuneration in the UK. Salaries are normally supplemented by annual bonuses, long-term incentives such as share options, and perks such as a car. Arguably, contracts that ensure that executives leave with two or three years' pay when they are dismissed should somehow be included in total remuneration. Many surveys do not cover bonuses but one that does, by the Monks Partnership found that 43 per cent of chief executives had received no bonus at all over the year to July. Over the same period the basic pay of main board directors rose 7.7 per cent, says Monks, which was slightly above the increase in UK average earnings. Mr Simon Rodwell of Monks believes that is not an excessive increase. He also claims that, while UK executives caught up with the level of pay of their international colleagues in the 1980s, they are not at the top of the table. The latest Monks study of European directors' pay, found the UK in fifth position this year. US executives are still better paid, although a higher performance element is included in their pay. But there is cause for concern about UK directors' pay, especially when charted against company performance and other employees' pay. The average chairman of a FTSE-100 company now receives a basic salary and bonus package of about Pounds 400,000, with total packages ranging from Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 6.2m. At the same time, top executives have been increasing their differentials over lower-ranked managers. In addition, according to the pay analysts Incomes Data Services, chief executive pay has risen 324 per cent since 1980, while pay for male manual workers rose by 239 per cent. Even more significant than this widening gap, most of the research on the link between executive pay and company performance has found little or no connection between the two. An unpublished study of the salary plus bonus of the highest-paid directors in 288 of the UK's top 500 quoted companies has found that the very high pay awards (averaging 20 per cent a year) received by top directors in the recessionary period 1989-1991 'appear to be unrelated to the performance of their companies'. The study, by researchers from the Centre for Economic Performance and the London Business School, did, however, find a strong correlation between growth in sales, often through acquisition, and growth in pay between 1983 and 1991. They say that if directors pay is driven more by size than performance they will have a strong incentive to pursue merger activity 'regardless of any benefit to shareholders, workers or the economy as a whole'. Defenders of top directors' pay levels, and increases, make various points about this evidence. First, there is room for argument about whether the study's measurement of performance - share price plus dividend returns - is always, in all companies, the fairest measure of effort and achievement. Second, some pay increases were the result of three-year bonus schemes which reflected stronger performance in earlier years. Third, executive pay is being distorted by a large catch-up for the chiefs of companies which have moved from the public to the private sector. But however eloquent the case for the defence, institutional shareholders are again taking a close interest in executive pay. Even where the link with performance is clear - as in the case of Mr Wood - some institutions are asking whether there should be a ceiling on annual bonuses. Their concerns have found some support from the Cadbury committee on corporate governance which issues its final report today. This will recommend greater use of remuneration committees of non-executive directors to set top executive pay. Mr Anthony Williams, director of executive remuneration at Hay management consultants, concludes: 'We are advising directors that they should take account of the risk of political and public pressure building up on pay.'</p>

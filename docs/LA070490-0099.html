			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Price Stern Sloan Decides Against Sale: Price Stern Sloan Inc. announced that  after an extensive evaluation of financing and strategic alternatives, it has  determined that a sale of the company at this time would not be in the best  interest of shareholders and that it will no longer pursue that alternative.  Price Stern Sloan said it will consider the sale of certain assets to reduce  its debt load and other opportunities that have been presented. Although  results are expected to be improved over those of 1989, the company will not  report a profit for the first six months, which traditionally is a loss period.  </P></p>

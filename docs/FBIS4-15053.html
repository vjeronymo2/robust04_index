			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1000 GMT on 6 April carries a report by correspondent  Svetlana Pankratova on a Russian-Finnish seminar on Russia  joining the Council of Europe. The seminar was held in Helsinki  and attended by members of parliament from both countries.    Pankratova reports that Oleg Lukin, head of the  international  affairs committee of the Russian parliament, said the meeting in  Helsinki "would accelerate the resolution of the issue of Russia  joining the Council of Europe." Finnish members of parliament  would also like Russia to join the Council, for otherwise the  process of European integration would not be complete.    Pankratova says that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of  Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, LDPR, took part in the  seminar, but refused to meet journalists at a general meeting  and preferred to convene his own news conference in a Helsinki  hotel.    Pankratova continues: "At his news conference, Vladimir  Volfovich lectured the Finns on how they should conduct their  affairs with Russia. Do not touch the Baltic states, for they  are a part of Russia, warned Zhirinovskiy. Otherwise you will  have a third world war. The LDPR leader thinks that this third  world war is already being waged in Tajikistan, Armenia, and  Azerbaijan. It is obvious that the LDPR leader's extremist  utterances not only do not facilitate any further strengthening  of trust between Russia and Finland, but on the contrary, do  much to devalue the results of the constructive dialogue which  took place between members of parliament from both countries."    Pankratova continues: "The report that following the news  conference, the LDPR leader visited one of Helsinki's best known  fleshpots, not among the best, either -- the erotic night-club  King-Sex Cockatoo -- had a truly shocking effect on the Finnish  public."</p>

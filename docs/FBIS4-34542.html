			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Teodomiro Braga's column "JB Report"] </F>   [Text] The Brazilian Government has canceled the visit of  Argentine Economy Minister Domingos Cavallo in retaliation for  President Menem's position during the ceremony closing the  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena on 15 June.    Itamaraty deemed "offensive" and "inelegant" Menem's  initiative to request support for Mexican President Carlos  Salinas' candidacy for the presidency of the future World Trade  Organization, ignoring Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's  candidacy for the same position.    Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja was  instructed on the night of 16 June to tell the Argentine  Government about the decision to cancel Cavallo's visit to  Brasilia on 27 and 28 June. His visit would express support for  the implementation of the real.    Winston Fritsch from the Finance Ministry and Jose Denot  Medeiros from Itamaraty left for Buenos Aires on 16 June at  night to convey Brazil's perplexity about the Argentine  president's haste to Argentine officials.    Itamaraty deemed Menem's attitude unacceptable, particularly  because the Argentine Government had been informed a week before  about Ricupero's candidacy to the presidency of the organization  that will replace GATT.    In addition to overlooking this fact, Menem committed  another  blunder by asking the chiefs of state to acclaim Salinas'  candidacy. President Itamar Franco's seat was empty because he  had suddenly left Cartagena and returned to Brazil.</p>

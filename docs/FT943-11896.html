			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Political static on HK-Taiwan route - The 1997 factor is getting in the way of inter-company negotiations over air rights Negotiations over air rights between Hong Kong and Taiwan - one of the most profitable air routes in east Asia - is becoming another field of battle between Beijing and Taipei. At stake is the renewal of an inter-company air service agreement that allows Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong based airline, and China Airlines (CAL) of Taiwan to fly between the British colony and Taipei more than 200 times a week. 'We hope we can negotiate another five-year deal,' said one Cathay official. 'But there are a number of complications which won't make this a simple agreement.' Both companies have been put in the unusual position of having to negotiate an agreement - which would normally fall to governments - because there are no direct political relations between Britain and Taiwan. Given the current state of relations across the Taiwan Straits, however, Taipei and Beijing appear to be using the negotiations over the agreement - which expires next April - to further other aims. Beijing wants direct air links between the mainland's principal regional capitals and Taipei and Kaohsiung, the island republic's second city, located on the south-western tip of the island. It remains unclear how hard Beijing will push to secure these concessions, but it does have power to frustrate the talks given the change in Hong Kong's sovereignty in mid-1997. China's interference appears to be behind the delay in other air services talks, including those between Taiwan and Japan. The two sides last met in February and no subsequent meeting has been scheduled. Links to Macao, the Portuguese colony which reverts to Chinese control in 1999, have also been held up because Macao plans to establish its own airline in which mainland Chinese interests are to hold a 40 per cent stake. For its part, Taipei would like to see flights between Taiwan and China limited to the existing arrangement under which the semi-official CAL flies to Hong Kong. At the same time, however, Eva Airways, Taiwan's second airline, founded by the Evergreen Group in 1991, is seeking access to the route. Taiwanese aviation officials said that talks between Cathay and CAL held in Taipei in late May broke down over whether the lucrative route should be opened to other carriers. No date for a future meeting has been set. According to the officials Cathay, citing Chinese government opposition, opposed changing the route's designation from single to multiple carrier. Cathay admits to keeping Beijing informed - in particular the Civil Aviation Authority of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office - but denies it is arguing Beijing's brief at negotiations with CAL. 'We do not want to force through an agreement only to have it torn up after the change in sovereignty in 1997,' a Cathay official said. Cathay also denies that it is trying to exclude Eva or other carriers from gaining access to the route. It points out, however, that Eva has no standing in the talks between Cathay and CAL, which are renegotiating an agreement between themselves. A Cathay official said that if Taipei wants Eva to have access to the Hong Kong-Taipei route, CAL should give up a portion of its right on the route to Eva. The case is, in any event, a harbinger of the increasing difficulty Taipei will face in maintaining its official pretence of no direct political or economic contacts with Beijing, especially once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. Air links with Hong Kong are critical to Taipei, whose fast growing trade and investment ties with China are mostly routed through the colony because of Taiwan's long-standing ban on direct cross-strait links. Moreover, the one-hour Hong Kong-Taipei flight is a cash-cow for Cathay and CAL and is believed to be one of CAL's few profitable routes. Granting access to other airlines could dilute profits, depending on scheduling and service. Another sticking point is that China will undoubtedly refuse to permit CAL's jets to fly to Hong Kong bearing the national flag of the Republic of China on Taiwan after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. It is likely CAL will be forced to fly to the colony via its affiliate, Mandarin Airlines, which it is reluctant to do. Because of the political sensitivities surrounding these negotiations, their progress has been shrouded in secrecy. Both governments deny direct involvement in the talks. That may be true for the time being but, when it happens, the renewal of the Cathay-CAL air agreement will be political.</p>

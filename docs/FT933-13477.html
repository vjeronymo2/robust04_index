			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Floating Rate Notes: Collared deals lead a resurgence of issuance HARDLY a week goes by without the launch of several new floating rate note (FRN) issues, on the belief that short-term interest rates in the US have hit rock-bottom and are set for an upturn. Last week was no exception as a batch of European banks (including Bayerische Landesbank, Dresdner Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank, and Credit Commercial de France) all launched collared floating rate deals and helped take the week's issuance to more than Dollars 1bn. Bayerische Landesbank and Dresdner Bank, both triple A-rated names, launched deals which were identical save for the amount raised. CCF, which has a senior debt rating of Aa3, launched an issue with identical terms except for the price, which at 99.5 (against 99.875 for the other two) was seen as adequately reflecting the difference in credit quality. All four borrowers had the coupon set at six-month Libor less 25 basis points, with a floor of 5 per cent and a cap of 8 per cent. The previous week's activity in this sector was dominated by a widely-praised new FRN issue for Credit Lyonnais, which was increased from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.25bn due to strong demand and provided the market with a liquid issue. The big US houses expect to bring plenty more FRNs (both of the collared variety, where there is a minimum and maximum coupon, and the 'plain vanilla' ordinary FRN), given that demand remains strong and that borrowers, generally banks, are obviously keen to take advantage of cheaper terms in the FRN sector as and when they arise. The renaissance of the FRN sector began last summer as market participants began to wonder whether US short-term interest rates had bottomed out. Several months later, many would argue that dollar short-term rates are 'treading water'. Market experts point out that the resurgence has been led by collared products, and it is easy to see why. Last week, six-month dollar Libor was quoted at 3.5 per cent: yet most of the collared FRNs with 12-year maturities that were launched last week had floors of 5 per cent and caps of 8 per cent. Investors have been focusing on the floor because they see an immediate pick-up and can lock into higher returns. 'Investors have had a good deal over the last few months - these have proved very nice transactions for them,' said one UK observer of the dollar-denominated FRN market. In some cases, investors expect to benefit as the creditworthiness of borrowers such as US banks improves. In the meantime, dealers point out, caps have shifted down from about 10 per cent last summer to around 8 per cent at present, reflecting the belief that while interest rates may increase, the rise will not be as fast as previously thought. 'If interest rates go up slowly, collared floaters will be in vogue, whereas if rates go up quickly, 'plain vanilla' FRNs will be in vogue,' said one analyst. US houses report both retail and institutional investor interest in collared FRNs, although the interest in these structured products tends to come from Switzerland and continental European investors. 'Given that the outlook for dollar interest rates is neutral to positive, one would expect to see more of these collared deals: problems will only arise if interest rates rise to close to 8 per cent, when you won't expect to see much of a bid for the paper,' warned one FRN specialist.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 THE TIME "PANDEMONIUM" PAISLEY PARK/REPRISE: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Billed as "the return of the magnificent seven," this reunion album from the  Twin Cities funk-rock fusionaries almost lives up to such hype-hopes. And why  not? The main reason the group broke up was that there were simply too many  talented people in it -- among them singer Morris Day, who went on to have  several solo hits, and keyboardist Jimmy Jam and bassist Terry Lewis, who  became a mega-platinum production team.  </P> <P> Anyway, they're all back for this flipped disc, and if they don't really add  too much new to their signature sound, well it's only because 'twas all so  plu-bleepin'-perfect in the first place.  </P> <P> The single "Jerk Out" and the title track are super-fine examples, with Day  jes' talkin' trash. Scheming, flattering, transparent trash. Sexy, funny,  endlessly tongue-in-cheek trash.  </P> <P> Mean-wild, back at the raunch, the band plays its collective bootissimus  maximus off. While "It's Your World" comes straight from the all-night  funkadelicatessen with a message of self-determination, "Blondie" and  especially the cast-iron "Skillet" rawk! the listener gently, gently with a  chain saw. All of which proves there's no Time like the right Time, and, baby,  the right Time is here 'n' now. DON WALLER  </P></p>

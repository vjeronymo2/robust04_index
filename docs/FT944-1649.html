			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: News round-up - Frankfurt The Bundesbank council holds its last meeting of the year on Thursday, but few analysts expect any news of a change in interest rates. James Capel says that in spite of still weak retail sales, the strength of third-quarter GDP data and rising capacity utilisation will mitigate against an interest rate cut. Capel still expects the next move in rates to be up, and the most likely time to be the second quarter of next year. The broker notes that the Bundesbank will also announce its monetary targets for next year, but does not expect any change from the current 4 - 6 per cent range. The coming week will also be a busy one for economic statistics, with data coming on November M3, producer prices, consumer prices and October's trade figures.</p>

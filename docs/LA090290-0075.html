			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN MONTEREY PARK, POLICE WHO COLLAR RECRUITS GET DAY OFF  </P> <P> Want a day off work? If you're a police officer, simply recruit a new  colleague.  </P> <P> As an incentive to police officers to attract high-caliber colleagues, the City  Council last week voted to give officers a day off work each time they bring in  an officer applicant who is hired.  </P> <P> The concept isn't new: Capt. Daniel Cross said he knows of several cities that  reward police officer recruiters with cash.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, for instance, any full-time city employee who successfully recruits  an officer receives $250 upon hiring of the officer and another $250 after the  recruit passes a one-year probationary period, Investigator Rick Martinez said.  </P> <P> Monterey Park's plan "is a way of rewarding them without spending money and  burdening the taxpayer," Cross said.  </P> <P> The recruitment incentive program comes as Monterey Park is recovering from a  rash of defections that at one point left six positions vacant out of the  department's authorized strength of 74 officers.  </P> <P> Much of the dissension was blamed on former Chief Kenneth Hickman, who resigned  in March after a unanimous vote of no-confidence from the Police Officers Assn.  He was replaced by Chief Robert W. Collins.  </P> <P> After Hickman's departure, city officials took steps to improve morale and  retention in the department. One of those measures was to put patrol officers  on a 12 1/2-hour, three-day work week designed to cut down on overtime and  reduce officers' commute time.  </P> <P> The department also began testing applicants more frequently -- monthly instead  of semiannually. Under the old system, Cross said, Monterey Park ran the risk  of losing qualified applicants who went to other cities rather than waiting for  the next test.  </P> <P> The extra efforts have paid off, Cross said, adding that the more potential  recruits that pour in, the more selective the department can be.  </P> <P> "We probably have more people applying now than we have in the past," he said.  "It was real bad last year. It was a very big problem because the spot would  stay vacant for some time."  </P></p>

The author of the article says:    The U.S.-Japan military tieup is an immediate offspring of  their policies toward Korea and Asia. The U.S. and Japanese  reactionaries are persistently seeking military tieup, motivated  by the ambition to stifle the DPRK with strength and invade and  dominate Asia with the Korean peninsula as a springboard.    They are showing new dangerous military moves around the  Korean peninsula while continuing military confabs for the  upkeep of U.S. troops in Japan, Japan's assistance to them,  intensified cooperation in military technology and arms buildup  under the cloak of "Japan-U.S. security."    At a meeting on "Japan-U.S. security affairs" a few days  ago,  the U.S. and Japanese ruling quarters confirmed that the  "Japan-U.S. security pact" was "vital." They claim that the  "pact" has not lost its meaning but, on the contrary, has  assumed a new meaning because "destabilising factors still  remain" in Asia, specially the Far East.    Their description of the DPRK as "a destabilising being" is  a  reversed logic and a trick to invent a pretext for strengthening  their military tieup and anti-DPRK camhaign.    Intensified cooperation in military technology and active  promotion of the unification of military activities are part of  their moves to tighten military tieup.    It is noteworthy that the United States and Japan are these  days making haste with the "theatre missile defence initiative"  allegedly to cope with "nuclear threat" and "missile threat"  from the DPRK. The "theatre missile defence initiative" is aimed  at a missile attack on the DPRK.    In this way, the United States is pursuing a military  adventure against the DPRK and socialism and the Japanese  reactionaries are going to arm themselves with missiles.    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are proceeding with  studies to strengthen the joint operation posture for a "case of  emergency" on the Korean peninsula. Large-scale U.S.-Japan  combined field exercises of three services have been held  several times in recent years on a "scenario of the case of  emergency on the Korean peninsula."    Their dream of stifling the DPRK and invading and dominating  Asia through their military tieup is anachronistic.    We are fully prepared to respond to any military pressure  and  offensive from them.    They must immediately give up the attempt to stifle the DPRK  through military tieup.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rolf Falter: "Dehaene's Departure Is Test for </F> Coalition"]    [Text] The almost certain departure of Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to the European Commission (EC)  threatens to be a test for the cohesion of the coalition  comprising the Christians, the Democrats, and the Socialists.  That was the message released by the government yesterday. The  CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party], which is again going to  request the prime ministership, wants clear agreements to be  reached in advance on the government duties for the next period.  They also want to know more about the demands of [PS] Jose  Happart.    Although still at the stage of very informal discussions,  politicians in Brussels have already formed a clear idea of the  likely scenario surrounding the appointment of Jean-Luc Dehaene  as EC president, assuming that this goes ahead of course.    After next Wednesday's [22 June] summit of the EPP [European  People's Party], the organization of European Christian  Democratic parties, where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will  announce to the Benelux countries who he would like to see take  over from Jacques Delors, EPP president Wilfried Martens would  probably state that a consensus has been reached and Jean-Luc  Dehaene would for the first time announce that he is indeed a  candidate.    The European summit on the Greek island of Corfu, on 24 and  25 June, would then appoint the candidate of the European  Christian Democrats.    The ideal scenario would then be for Dehaene to remain prime  minister until 1 August or 1 September, to pave the way for his  successor.    He will probably have to reshuffle his government even  earlier, as Pensions Minister Freddy Willockx is to be sworn in  as a member of the European Parliament (EP) on 19 July and  should therefore be replaced by Friday 15 July.    In addition to the replacement of Willockx and Dehaene, a  third element is also involved, namely a political compensation  for the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] for the loss of European  Commissioner Karel Van Miert, it is only logical to reshuffle  the cabinet in one single operation.  <H5>  CVP Van Rompuy </H5>   In the meantime the CVP [Flemish Liberal Democrat] is  demanding in increasingly clear terms the right to appoint the  Dehaene's successor. According to Johan Van Hecke, "it must be  a Christian Democrat," which must be understood as: Melchior  Wathelet (French-speaking Social Christian Party) can only  become prime minister if the CVP does not itself find a  solution. Anything else would be unacceptable to the CVP, now  that since Sunday the party is once again easily the largest in  the country.    The candidate who immediately comes to mind is deputy Prime  Minister Herman Van Rompuy, who has supported Dehaene through  thick and thin in the past five years. But Van Rompuy would not  want to jeopardize his chances of leading the next, possibly  Christian-Democrat-Liberal coalition, by going for an uncertain  prime ministership now. He would only agree to take over from  Dehaene if the government could set a clear course for the rest  of its term and if the coalition partners are prepared to  continue until the end of 1995.    Arguments to this effect have been heard in recent days by  CVP president Van Hecke and Minister Leo Delcroix. They want to  see a reassessment of the government program.    Then there are the dangers posed by Jose Happart and a  series  of matters on the government's agenda for the coming weeks that  are likely to cause problems with the socialist coalition  partner: the reform of pension laws, financial responsibility  for the health service, and the 1995 budget.  <H5>  Government To Resign? </H5>   In short, prior to the government reshuffle, the CVP wants  to  talk with the PS on its future plans for the government. One  message can already be heard: The CVP will not give in to PS  claims.    It is unlikely that any of this can be discussed before the  end of next week, and thus the Corfu summit. The question after  that is whether Dehaene, when appointed EC president, will still  have the authority to guide the government through the awaiting  pitfalls. And whether he still has to take such risks.    This is why it is not totally out of the question that the  prime minister might announce shortly after Corfu that his  government is resigning, leaving the King to do his  constitutional work and to charge an official with assessing the  possibilities of forming a Christian-Democrat-Socialist  government. At the moment this seems a more likely scenario  than the ideal one of the retiring prime minister who, before  leaving office, carefully prepares the ground for his successor.    The chances of Dehaene being prime minister when the Belgian  "Red Devils" football team takes the field in the World Cup  after 1 July are thus very slim.</p>

Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on March 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.9 Million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with the reformation of four gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989 which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86&hyph;63&hyph;000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon Southern's customers and interested state commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure.

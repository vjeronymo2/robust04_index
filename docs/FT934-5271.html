			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): Falling foul of the fault lines THE EUROPEAN CURRENCY CRISIS by Paul Temperton (editor) Probus Europe, Pounds 27.50 316 pages Economically, Paul Temperton points out in his extended introduction to this volume of collected contributions on the trials of the European Monetary System, Europe is not a good candidate for a monetary union. Without effective mobility of labour across borders, and with wages notoriously inflexible within them, monetary union would create enormous regional problems. The cost of buying and selling a house ranges between 12 and 22 per cent of the price in France, Italy, Germany and Belgium compared with 9 per cent in the US. Sir Alan Walters discusses his eponymous 'Walters critique' of the ERM, that pegging currencies forced governments into perverse domestic monetary policies: an attempt to run high interest rates to counter high inflation and monetary growth would invite a deluge of foreign inflows, refuelling monetary expansion. An ERM-type structure, with fixed but adjustable rates, is only at best able to offer a knife-edge equilibrium, being inherently unstable. With absolutely fixed rates, Walters adds, this would not apply because domestic monetary policies would have to be surrendered, presumably to the Bundesbank. Tim Congdon develops this analysis by considering the differences between domestic monetary frameworks, which meant for example that in the late 1980s the same interest rates in the UK and Germany led to a far higher rate of monetary growth in the UK (mainly because of the impact of the housing market). The ERM was simply incompatible with national differences in institutional structures and in tax incentives, and politicians had thought little about the consequences of this. This book, produced in collaboration with the bond commission of the European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies, was originally the victim of bad timing. The deadline for contributions was last June but the second ERM crisis, which reached its climax at the beginning of August, torpedoed its ambitions. However, the publishers managed to capitalise on the crisis by asking contributors for updates and delaying the publication date. There was a reasonable degree of co-operation except from the Banque de France which 'could not provide a contribution which reflected the recent change in circumstances' and is therefore the only major EU central bank not to be represented with its own chapter. Some bitter lessons were learned in August. EU governments were made to realise that their foreign exchange reserves of some Dollars 275bn counted for little against global asset portfolios running to trillions and regular foreign exchange turnover of Dollars 1 trillion per day. There is talk of the reimposition of capital market controls, but Congdon points out that it would be an ironic and unsatisfactory outcome if, on the supposed road to monetary union, EU member states were forced to separate their capital markets and banking systems. Although inevitably already a little out of date, this book provides a varied and expert analysis of the fault lines within the ERM. There are 10 independently contributed chapters on the ERM, the Maastricht Treaty and central bank independence, and a dozen perspectives from European central banks, some of which include blow-by-blow accounts of days of crisis. The latest central bank thinking, judging by recent statements from the heads of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England, is that member states must refocus directly on long- term economic convergence and not try to re-establish the ERM in its old form. Whether this represents the practical way forward, or simply reflects an attempt by central bankers to push the problem back to the politicians, is arguable: the desire to converge is much stronger in some EU member states than others. At any rate, central bankers have no desire to man any more barricades.</p>

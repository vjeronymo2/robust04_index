			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Eastern promise: German investment in Czechoslovakia Driving west from Prague, the elegant capital of Czechoslovakia, to the grimy industrial city of Pilsen, the name of Nuremberg appears on motorway signs. The mention of this German city along Czech roads is a striking symbol of the historical links between the two countries, which will be strengthened today when Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrives in Prague to sign a Friendship Treaty with Czech President Vaclav Havel. Though German occupation of part of Czechoslovakia during the second world war severely damaged the relationship, and Czechoslovakia's subsequent 40-year domination by communism put it beyond west Germany's reach, the economic opportunities created by the end of the cold war are helping to heal the wounds between the two neighbours. In the past two years, nearly Dollars 1bn of foreign investment has flowed into Czechoslovakia, with Germany accounting for about two-thirds. German industrial giants such as Volkswagen, Siemens and Mercedes-Benz have led the investment charge, but smaller companies are now moving in. What attracts them is Czechoslovakia's long industrial tradition - the province of Bohemia was the industrial heartland of the Austro-Hungarian empire - as well as its engineering skills, low wages, proximity, and access to markets in eastern Europe. For its part, Czechoslovakia needs foreign investment if it is to attain western levels of efficiency and prosperity. The Prague government has opened up the economy, curbed inflation to an annual rate of about 2 per cent, and started the privatisation process. 'The Czech republic was always part of western European markets,' says Mr Karel Spacek, finance minister of the Czech republic, which exists in a fragile federation with the smaller Slovak republic to the east. 'If you look at the map, Prague is more to the west than Vienna.' While Hungary has drawn the lion's share of western investment in eastern Europe, mostly from the US, German companies tend to favour Czechoslovakia. They cite its cultural similarities - Czechs often speak German and have a reputation for industriousness and orderliness - and the fact that the country's industrial base, with its emphasis on engineering, is similar to their own. Shortcomings in the areas of management, design and marketing are seen as opportunities. The main reasons for business interest are: Labour costs. Wages are about a tenth of those in Germany, averaging about 4,500 crowns (DM250) a month. High wage claims in Germany have prompted talk among industrialists about job losses and falling competitiveness. While east German labour is still cheaper than in west Germany, the gap is fast being narrowed in the wake of unification. The generous terms at which old East German Marks were replaced by D-Marks sharply raised industrial costs in eastern Germany. This increase was compounded by steep wage rises. Thus Czechoslovakia is becoming the low-cost location that east Germany is ceasing to be. Industrial skills. Productivity is below western standards. But German companies are impressed by local engineers and workers and have promised to raise output and roughly to maintain employment. 'They need money to improve their plants and they need better production and business organisation,' says Mr Bernhard Weiss, a Siemens manager responsible for a joint rail venture with Skoda Pilsen, the engineering group. 'But their workers know how to use modern machinery.' Mr Volkhard Kohler, deputy chief executive of Skoda cars, a separate company, says: 'We're interested in doing more and more development here in Czechoslovakia.' Access to eastern Europe. German investors foresee a growing demand for transport and other engineering products in the east. Overhauling the infrastructure will require huge investments. By combining their skills and contacts, German and Czech companies hope to profit from this enormous long-term potential. It is this long-term approach which has helped German comapnies gain an edge over rivals such as France's Renault, which lost out to VW and Mercedes in joint ventures with Skoda cars and Avia trucks, and ABB, the Swiss-Swedish concern which hoped to link up with Skoda Pilsen but was beaten by Siemens. But the German strategy has involved spending heavily on the plants of Czech partners to upgrade production to western standards. Volkswagen has spent DM620m on its 31 per cent of Skoda cars and has management control. It will lift its holding to 70 per cent in 1995. By 2000, it intends to invest some DM9bn, more than doubling output to about 450,000 cars a year in the mid-1990s. Mr Kohler admits Skoda's image abroad is better than at home, where many people now prefer western cars. But VW sees Skoda as a strategic addition to its range, becoming the northern equivalent of its low-priced Spanish-built Seat in western and eastern Europe. Siemens has a twin-track strategy, concentrating on the expansion of Skoda Pilsen's production of locomotives for eastern Europe, and the improvement of its power station technology. It will also help Skoda bid for mass transit contracts - Siemens and Skoda have already won an order to re-equip the Prague Metro - and provide sub-contracting work for its international energy business. Siemens is taking 57 per cent of Skoda Pilsen's Dollars 170m power generation business, its biggest division. Framatome of France will have 10 per cent. 'We wanted to broaden our range of products,' says Mr Jaroslav Mestanek, vice-president (commerce) at Skoda Pilsen. In the long run, this means access to Siemens' know-how in environmentally-advanced turbine technology. 'We couldn't span the next two years without Siemens,' Mr Mestanek says. On the rail side, Siemens is bringing in the transport activities of Krupp and Krauss-Maffei, in which it is already a partner. 'The idea is to develop competence as a full-line supplier,' says Mr Weiss. Skoda, which built 2,500 locomotives for the former Soviet Union, will provide the mechanical expertise, with the German companies contributing electrical and other equipment. The Germans will have 51 per cent of the Dollars 105m venture. Mercedes aims to carve out up to 30 per cent of the truck market in eastern Europe - the same as it has in the west. Mr Helmut Werner, head of the truck division, reckons the potential market in the east could exceed 800,000 trucks above two tonnes a year. The Daimler-Benz subsidiary plans to invest DM350m in the plants of Avia and Liaz, the Czech truck makers, in the next five years, lifting its minority stake into an eventual majority. The production goal of the three-way venture is 27,000 small, medium, and large trucks a year in 1997. The present Avia and Liaz trucks will be phased out. This is a pill the Czech companies have had to swallow to survive. 'We have to be realists,' remarks Mr Vaclav Bohac, Avia's finance director. Not surprisingly, the preponderance of German investment has led to charges in Czechoslovakia that Germany's economic influence could become too powerful. Criticism has mostly come from opposition politicians trying to arouse anti-German sentiment against the government and its free-market economic policies. Adding to the public interest, and introducing a controversial new element, have been the requests by Mercedes last month for high duties on imported trucks and a long tax holiday. The Czech government, which approves all large joint ventures, has objected to such demands, which Mercedes insists are only a basis for negotiations. The heat generated by Mercedes' tactics shows the sensitivities involved. Mr Spacek, the Czech finance minister, says the Czech government will accept the best offer of foreign investment, no matter where it comes from. But he admits that given equal offers, a non-German company would be favoured so as to broaden the investment spread. 'We want capital from other countries, not just Germany.' German executives know they have to tread carefully. Memories of the second world war linger. 'The war was the beginning of the end of Czechoslovakia's independence,' says VW's Mr Kohler. But many industrialists in Czechoslovakia are prepared to forgive and forget. 'That was history. We've got to think about the future,' concludes Mr Mestanek of Skoda. Flurry of German invesment Volkswagen has 31 per cent of the shares and management control of Skoda in Mlada Boleslave.  It is investing DM600m this year, DM1bn in 1993, and total of DM9bn by 2000. Volkswagen has also bought smaller BAZ assembly and components operation in Bratislava, Slovak republic. Siemens last year agreed ventures with Skoda Pilsen in energy and transport (need Czech government approval).  IT is taking 57 per cent of Skoda Pilsen's poer generation business.  Siemens, together with German partners (Krupp and Krauss-Maffel), is also taking 51 per cent of Skoda's locomotive business.  Siemens will add its Duewag rail-wagon subsidiary. Mercedes-Benz agreed with Avia and Liaz truck companies to produce Mercedes range.  Mercedes will have to initial 31 per cent, Avia-49 per cent and Liaz 20 per cent.  Mercedes to invest DM350m over five years.  Needs Czech government approval; requests for protective import duties and tax holiday irritated Prague.</p>

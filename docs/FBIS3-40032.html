			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F> Left secretary, by Marco Panara in London on 24 February:  "Occhetto in the Capitalist Kingdom"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Panara] What do you think, Mr.  Secretary, of the story about taxing treasury bills?    [Occhetto] If we form the next government we will do so on  the basis of an agreed platform, and we will not form a  government with anybody who wants to include a tax on treasury  bills in the platform. Do you also want to know why? Because we  believe that taxing treasury bills would be a mistake, would  discourage investment, and would disrupt the state's finances.  As a result of all this, we have no intention of taxing  treasury bills.    [Panara] What about NATO, which [Communist Renewal leader]  Bertinotti is saying Italy should leave?    [Occhetto] This debate about whether we should stay in NATO  or leave is really old hat. [Former Communist Party leader]  Berlinguer himself, however, said that NATO was an umbrella  organization to protect freedom. On Monday [28 February] we  will be going to Brussels to meet NATO's top officials. At this  meeting -- the first of its kind -- we will be discussing global  problems and NATO's role in solving them.    [Panara] What is your opinion of Bertinotti?    [Occhetto] Clearly, the battle waged by Communist Renewal is  closely linked to party issues. If they think that they will  win votes in this way -- which I very much doubt -- let them  carry on as they please.    [Panara] Even if the votes that they may win by doing so  were  considerably fewer than those they may cause the progressive  coalition to lose?    [Occhetto] I trust that this will not be the case, because  we  still have the capability to speak to the country at grassroots  level. We are a real presence, as shown by experience in the  last few days. We have seen that wherever there are real men  made of flesh and bone, the electoral lists are successfully,  but where there are only TV spots and hot air, they are  unsuccessful. [Occhetto ends]    Occhetto cuts short: "Look here, this electoral campaign can  be described as Occhetto versus [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi, not Occhetto versus Bertinotti."    We went on to discuss the issue of the restructuring of  industry, a process capable of causing massive redundancies.    "We are in favor of defending productive activities at any  price," Occhetto said. "We want to defend each citizen's right  to work. The time for a purely defensive battle has come to an  end; we are now aiming to enable people to move from one job to  another, without increasing the public debt, but rather, by  mobilizing private funds and the state's existing resources."

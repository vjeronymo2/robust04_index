The Council voiced its concern at the escalation of  violence. According to Achille Casanova, Swizerland's  vice-chancellor, it expressed the hope that the NATO ultimatum  issued to the belligerents on 9 February, and in particular to  the besiegers of Sarajevo, would be respected. The question of  military aircraft overflying Swiss airspace, he added, was not  asked, since no such request had been made to Swizerland.    The issue of whether foreign military aircraft could fly  over  Switzerland falls into the debate on neutrality. During the  Gulf war in 1991, Switzerland kept to the traditional definition  [of neutrality] and banned such aircraft from entering Swiss  airspace. Exceptions were made for the transportation of the  wounded, hospital workers, and medical equipment.    The foreign policy report published last November by the  Federal Council nevertheless marks a reorientation of political  neutrality. The Federal Council considers that a neutral state  can participate in coercive measures against another state as  provided for by the UN Charter, on condition that these measures  have the very broad backing of the international community.  This stance is then no longer in contradiction with the right  to neutrality.    The first example of this new practice was the authorization  to overfly Swizterland granted to NATO's AWACS radar aircraft  charged with monitoring the skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  Head of the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (DFAE) Flavio  Cotti, recently justified this measure by the humanitarian  nature of the flights and the principle of solidarity. Mr.  Cotti stated that the AWACS were not combat aircraft and thus  did not constitute a precedent for a NATO request for combat  aircraft to fly through Swiss airspace in the framework of UN  action.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Germany calls - Ballot Box German national pride came to the aid of Labour yesterday. Jubilant claims from the prime minister that Britain has now a lower rate of price rises than Europe's market leader on economic prudence met short shrift from its London embassy. Eschewing diplomatic convention an official could not resist tipping off Walworth Road that it was 'inappropriate' to compare the two nations' inflation rates because the figures were compiled differently. It would be fairer, the official said to compare underlying inflation, which was running at 4.3 per cent in Germany as opposed to 5.6 per cent in Britain.</p>

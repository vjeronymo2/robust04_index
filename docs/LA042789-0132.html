			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Turner to Offer Program for Schools: Turner Broadcasting System said it plans  to offer a commercial-free daily news program for schools as an alternative to  the ad-supported Channel One service tested recently by Whittle Communications.  Turner Chairman Ted Turner said his Cable News Network would begin providing  the daily 15-minute news show, called CNN Newsroom, on Aug. 14. The show would  be carried on CNN before dawn each school day and could be recorded to use in  class. A teacher's guide would also be available daily on how to use the  programming.  </P></p>

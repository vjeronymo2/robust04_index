			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Wanjun (7115 8001 6511) and Wang Yufang (3769 3768 </F> 2455): "The Hudong Shipyard: The `Cradle' of Corvettes"]    [Text] The Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives  office in the shipyard have worked hard together over the last  30 years. They have manufactured six different models of  corvettes, and 95 percent of the corvettes now in service were  manufactured by this shipyard. Therefore, the shipyard is  called the "cradle" of Chinese corvettes.    Corvettes are the main vessels a naval unit uses in combat.  Since its production of the first Chinese-made corvette in the  early 1970's, the Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives  office have jointly created 14 top products including totally  enclosed [quan feng bi 0356 1409 7028] corvettes, new types of  propellers, and vessels for helicopters to land on. Central  Military Commission leaders praised the shipyard for these  achievements. The tactical [zhan shu 2069 2611] and technical  functions of Chinese-designed and Chinese-made corvettes have  stood the tests of major activities including sea combat,  sailing to the South Pacific, and visiting three South Asian  countries, leaving their tracks in the Pacific and Atlantic  Oceans.    "Providing top-quality naval vessels for the party and the  people and qualified combat effectiveness for the armed forces"  has been the pursuit of the Hudong Shipyard's cadres and  workers, as well as naval representatives in the shipyard. They  are very meticulous about their work: After carefully welding  thousands of steel plates on a naval vessel, they use magnifying  glasses, X-rays, and supersonic equipment for double checks.  Cables on a vessel are generally dozens of kilometers long and  of more than 100 sizes. Military engineers in the shipyard  conduct repeated checks on each joint and rivet and test the  land and maritime functions of each weapon and equipment. In  the last 30 years they have discovered and handled more than  2,000 quality problems. As a result, over 95 percent of their  military products are up to standard. The corvettes they have  produced have won 13 gold and silver prizes from the state.    A corvette is a science city on the sea. The Hudong Shipyard  and the naval representatives office have always focused their  attention on the world's advanced shipbuilding technology and  brought about a higher level of combat effectiveness by means of  science and technology. They have established relations of  technological mutual assistance with more than 30 scientific  research institutions and applied some 30 high-tech projects  including laser, electronics, remote sensing, ultraviolet rays,  and simulation to the manufacture of modernized naval vessels.  In the meantime, they have used more than 1,000 scientific  renovation achievements to improve the functions of equipment.</p>

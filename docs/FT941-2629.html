			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium and copper hit peaks  -Week in the markets The London Metal Exchange aluminium and copper markets fed off each other's strength this week as they surged respectively to 20-month and 8 1/2 -month peaks. Helped by constructive technical factors the three months delivery aluminium price broke resistance at Dollars 1,320 a tonne in mid-week, triggering heavy stop-loss buying. The price moved on to Dollars 1,353 yesterday morning on speculative and physical buying, but then ran into profit-taking and European trade house sales, which took it down to Dollars 1,346.50 at the close, up Dollars 9.50 on the day and Dollars 47 on the week. Traders thought the market's bull trend remained intact, however. 'It will take a brave man to go short ahead of the weekend,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency. Copper's peak came on Thursday, when the three months position touched Dollars 1,985 a tonne. Traders attributed the rise to bullish charts, an improving supply/demand balance, a shortage of good quality metal and expectations of another big fall in LME warehouse stocks. The anticipated stocks fall was duely announced yesterday morning and the price, which had retreated to Dollars 1,965.50 by Thursday's close, rose to Dollars 1,970. The heavy selling that had hit the market late on Thursday then reappeared, however, and by the close the price had edged back to Dollars 1,968.50 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day and Dollars 38.75 up on the week. Precious metals were on the retreat for most of the week before gold led a late rally yesterday. The yellow metal regained Dollars 3.05 of the Dollars 3.85 it had lost over the preceding four days to end at Dollars 386.20 a troy ounce. 'Yesterday everybody was bearish at Dollars 382, now everybody is bullish at Dollars 386,' one dealer said. 'We may be seeing people taking out a bit of insurance against incidents in South Africa over the weekend,' suggested another. The platinum price, which had been lifted in response to the unrest in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, which accounts for 30 per cent of South Africa's production of the metal, weakened on the easing of tension before rallying with gold. It was fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 400.40 an ounce, up Dollars 1.55 on the day but still Dollars 3.35 down on the week. At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures climbed to the highest levels since the launch of the dollar contract three years ago. Monday's news that the US Department of Agriculture had cut its forecast for the 1994-95 Brazilian crop from 24.3m bags (60kg each) to 23.5m helped the May contract to break through the Dollars 1,300-a-tonne barrier on Monday and investors were encouraged by the market's ability to hold comfortably above that level over the next few days in spite of bouts of profit taking. Investment fund and trade buyers returned in force on Thursday, lifting the May price to Dollars 1,340 a tonne at one stage. It dipped to Dollars 1,315 yesterday morning but by the close was trading at Dollars 1,331, up Dollars 56 on the week. Cocoa futures also chalked up good gains before producer selling was attracted late in the week. The May price climbed to Pounds 985 a tonne on Thursday morning but ended yesterday at Pounds 953, up Pounds 27 on balance. Traders said that the market was continuing to attract selling from West African producers and, in the absence of buying interest from the investment funds, this was weighing down prices. They noted, however, that good support was likely in the Dollars 948-950 range.  ------------------------------------------            LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS          (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------------ tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium         +9,950 to 2,599,775 Aluminium alloy     +260 to    45,900 Copper           -11,525 to   520,625 Lead                -225 to   332,100 Nickel              +918 to   135,846 Zinc             +10,300 to 1,083,450 Tin                 +110 to    23,380  ------------------------------------------</p>

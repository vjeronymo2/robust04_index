			<p>BFN     [Text] South African National Defense Force Chief General  Georg Meiring says the National Peacekeeping Force, [NPKF],  failed because of insufficient training and inadequate command  structures.    At an international news conference in Pretoria today, he  said a British military assistance and training team was to help  with the selection and evaluation of former NPKF members for  their possible inclusion in the National Defense Force. General  Meiring also said that a service brigade could be formed to  support the government's Reconstruction and Development Program.    [Begin Meiring recording] Such an organization could form  part of the Reconstruction and Development Program, in so far as  it firstly, forms part of a sort of a funnel for people that do  not make the grade in the National Defense Force to be  retrenched. To go via this organization to enable them to  acquire skills, to enable them to better use themselves outside  in a civilian role, and also in doing this, delivering some  worthwhile action.

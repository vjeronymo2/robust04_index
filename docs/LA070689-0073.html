			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> IDENTICAL TWINS KEPT FROM A MATCH  </P> <P> Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo, identical twins ranked Nos. 2 and 3 in  Southern California Tennis Assn. singles and No. 1 in doubles, teamed for the  12-and-under title last week in the Junior Sectional Championships at Los  Caballeros Racquet and Sports Club in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Wayne and Kathy Bryan, the twins' parents, have taken steps to ensure that the  relationship between the 10-year-olds is amicable. Challenge matches between  the two are forbidden, for example.  </P> <P> "Every kid who wants to play tennis wants to be the best at his club, his  region, the world," said Wayne Bryan, tennis pro at Cabrillo Racquet Club. "You  can't be No. 1 in the world if you're No. 2 at home. It's an immediate block by  your own brother. We find plenty of people to play without them playing each  other."  </P> <P> So many competitors, in fact, that the boys have amassed more than 200  trophies.  </P> <P> Still, if it means facing each other, the Bryans will forgo a trophy.  </P> <P> Last year, if the two were to meet in a tournament singles final, they would  default on an alternating basis. Now, the two alternate between the 12 and 14  divisions.  </P> <P> It's strictly a case of brotherly love-love.  </P> <P> Add juniors: Other local participants in the Los Caballeros tournament included  Molly White of Camarillo, who advanced to the girls' 16-and-under singles  quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Courtney Rose of Beverly Hills. Gary  Potter of Thousand Oaks made it to the fifth round of the boys' 16 singles.  </P> <P> Kenny Pedroza of Ventura, who will attend Stanford in the fall, also advanced  to the fifth round of boys' 16 singles.  </P> <P> Kirstin Smith of Thousand Oaks, who will play at Pepperdine next season, and  Laura Richards of Orange County reached the semifinals of the girls' 18  doubles.  </P> <P> Brian Giffin and Peter Morawiecki of Camarillo, both of whom advanced to the  fourth round of the boys' 18 singles, reached the doubles quarterfinals.  Camarillo's Steve Stukovsky made it to the quarterfinals of the boys' 18  singles.  </P> <P> Youth is served: After winning the boys' 10-and-under singles division of the  Glendale Junior Public Parks tournament, Jonathan Wirjo of La Canada lost in  the 12-and-under final.  </P> <P> Wirjo has plenty of time to avenge the loss, however -- he's only 8. He began  playing tennis at age 4.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a child develop so rapidly," said Bob McKay, Wirjo's coach.  "He doesn't quit. His forehand and serve have improved rapidly over the last  six months. He has wonderful faculties."  </P> <P> McKay adds that a practice session with Wirjo will occasionally attract an  audience.  </P> <P> "People just stand and watch him hit," McKay said of his 4-foot, 50-pound  protege. "He's so tiny, it's like the ball is coming out of a cannon.  </P> <P> "You can't even see him on the other side of the net."  </P> <P> USTA doubles: A single-elimination men's 35-and-over doubles tournament  sponsored by the U. S. Tennis Assn. will be held the week of July 17 at Warner  Center Club in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Prize money will be offered and the tournament will help determine Southern  California Tennis Assn. rankings. Cost is $26 a team.  </P> <P> Information: 818-884-1100.  </P> <P> Clinic: A USTA nonprofit tennis program for about 4,500 players aged 8 to 18  begins July 10 at 98 locations around Southern California.  </P> <P> The six-week program provides participants with a T-shirt, 18-hours of  instruction, a tennis racket, if needed, and a USTA membership.  </P> <P> Registration is $10, but scholarships are available based on need.  </P> <P> Information: 213-208-3838.  </P></p>

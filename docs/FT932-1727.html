			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): An empire-builder who stalled - Industry NUFFIELD: A BIOGRAPHY by Martin Adeney Robert Hale Pounds 18.99, 224 pages ANYONE WITH an interest in the decline and fall of British industrial power must have regard to the motor industry and in particular to the story of William Morris, the first Lord Nuffield. In the late 1920s, the Oxford-based Morris and his Birmingham rival Austin held 60 per cent of the British car market, prompting Edsel Ford, son of Henry, to report to his father: 'We have been defeated and licked in Britain.' William Morris, the son of an Oxfordshire farmer, who started his business life as a bicycle repair boy, was the man chiefly responsible for that state of affairs. His intuitive grasp of popular taste, his mechanic's commitment to building reliable machines, and his more surprising vigour in addressing international trends in his industry, were the qualities that marked him out. Like the Japanese half a century later, Morris recognised that his early designs and successes would count for nothing if others - notably Ford - used more efficient production methods to offer lower prices. As early as 1913, with his company barely profitable, he crossed the Atlantic to study American methods and to seek deals with American components manufacturers. The result was the Morris Cowley and the Morris Oxford and the company's projection, following the hiatus of the 1914-18 war, into the front rank as a volume car producer. In the heydays of the 1920s Morris continued to amass durable motor trade insights. He was an early proponent of hire purchase and marketing devices such as owners' clubs and more than any of his competitors he recognised that his customers would be impressed by cars loaded with 'free' extras. It is difficult to separate the reasons for the Morris company's subsequent decline from an account of the man. Energetic and capable of vaulting optimism, Morris also had an insecure and even paranoid side which prevented him trusting senior colleagues or seeing the potential in alliances with rivals. Most specifically, he fell out with the equally headstrong Leonard Lord, who left Morris in 1936, after the founder had refused his demand for a share in the company, to run Austin, where he vowed to undercut Morris at every model launch and to take Cowley apart 'brick by brick.' Morris's own inability to delegate was compounded and perhaps rendered fatal by the circumstances of his time. In a country that had yet to recognise the fading sunset hanging over the Empire, he allowed himself to be distracted by the Australian market and the 'Empire' car project, which never got into production. His attraction to politics, in which his bullying egoism scored local successes, seems not to have nourished insight into global trends between the wars. Above all, he failed to see that his early success in building, for its time, a lean production system was one that he would have to repeat again and again in one lifetime if his achievement was not to perish. As Adeney says, he was not so much a Victorian industrial paternalist as an Edwardian, 'a product of a more overblown age when much of the Victorian striving had been replaced by a more complacent feeling that Britannia ruled the waves and much of the world by right.' In the end, Morris was a management failure. Perhaps he sensed that he had moved out of his depth, even though he was not a man to make such an admission. In the last 20 years of his life, before his death in 1963, he devoted most of his attention to philanthropic work, based upon the Nuffield Foundation. That was a role in which his autocratic and irascible temper could be more easily accommodated and through which he did much good. It also, however, yielded the irony that his acquired name, Nuffield, would live longer, on the gate of an Oxford college, than his family name in either the register of British corporations or upon the bodywork of a British car.</p>

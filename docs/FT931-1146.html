			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BAA sells electrical distribution networks BAA, the privatised British airports operator, has sold for Pounds 90m the electrical distribution networks of its three London airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, to London Electricity. The sale is part of BAA's strategy of concentrating on its core airport skills, Sir John Egan, the chief executive, said yesterday. The transaction will not have any material effect on BAA's trading profits, but the company said it would significantly improve its debt position and help in the funding of large capital projects. BAA recently filed a planning application for the construction of a fifth terminal at Heathrow expected to cost between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m. Under the terms of the sale, London Electricity will acquire the high and low voltage electricity distribution cables and associated electrical equipment of the three airports. The utility will also take over responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the systems in return for an annual fee which has been set at Pounds 13.5m for the first year. The fee will increase in future years depending on inflation and demand. BAA said it had invited its staff who currently run the networks to become employees of London Electricity. The airport operator also added that its customers, including airlines, baggage handling companies and retailers, will not be affected by the change of ownership. They would not face any increase in their electricity charges and would continue to buy their electricity through BAA.</p>

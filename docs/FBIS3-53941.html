Our correspondent reports that an Israeli  plane fired a missile at the headquarters of the Ahmad  Jibril-led Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine--General Command in the al-Na'imah hills at 1430. The  extent of the damage is not yet known.    Shortly before 1445 today, the Iqlim al-Tuffah hills came  under artillery bombardment originating from the Israeli  occupation forces' positions in Sujud, Bi'r Kallab, Mlita, and  al-Luwayzah. The shelling coincided with raking by large-caliber  machine guns.    A resistance group today carried out a machine-gun and  rocket  attack on the Sujud position, where the resistance and the  occupation forces clashed for 10 minutes.</p>

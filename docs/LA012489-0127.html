			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SHANNON'S MOVE TO POINT GUARD PAYS DIVIDENDS  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley Christian Coach Tim Shelton describes point guard Carrie  Shannon as "a diamond in the rough."  </P> <P> "She is still a junior and she has a long way to go," Shelton said. "She takes  some silly shots every once in a while."  </P> <P> Shelton moved Shannon from her off-guard position to point guard this season.  </P> <P> She has taken awhile to get accustomed to the change, but last week she settled  in, scoring a career-high 30 points to lead the Eagles to their first Olympic  League victory this season. Capistrano Valley Christian defeated Santa  Margarita, 46-43, Thursday night.  </P> <P> Shannon, The Times' athlete of the week, had been averaging about 15 points a  game. She said she had no idea she had scored so many Thursday night. "Everyone  was coming up to me saying, 'Oh, you had 28.' Then they said I had 30 and I  said, 'Oh, my God!' "  </P> <P> Before high school, Shannon watched all the college and National Basketball  Assn. games television had to offer. "I just love it," she said. When she got  to Capistrano Valley Christian as a freshman, she decided it was time to get  off the couch and onto the court.  </P> <P> She plays softball and volleyball as well as basketball for the Eagles while  carrying a 3.0 grade-point average.  </P> <P> "The nice part about it for me is that basketball is her sport," Shelton said.  "I think she would do just about anything to excel in basketball."  </P> <P> The Eagles are off to a slow start at 4-9 overall and 1-6 in league play, which  Shannon said has been frustrating.  </P> <P> "It has been hard to keep going because you feel like you're practicing and  nothing is being accomplished out on the court," she said. "But we have been  able to get things going in the third and fourth quarters. We usually catch  them a little bit and scare them. We can play with everybody, but we just have  to get started earlier."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia scored a school-record 52 points Friday to break her record of 48  points set in December. Jalewalia's big night came in La Quinta's 85-12 victory  over Pacifica in Garden Grove League play. Wednesday, Jalewalia scored 39  points in a 64-14 victory over Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Keri Erkenbrach of Canyon made three 3-point shots and scored a team-high 21  points Tuesday in a 54-44 victory that ended Foothill's 66-game, 7-year  domination of Century League opponents  </P> <P> Melody Mayfield of Saddleback scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds Thursday in  a 63-31 Sea View League victory over Tustin.  </P> <P> Kristen McDonald of Valencia made 14 of 16 shots on her way to a 30-point,  10-rebound performance Tuesday in a 102-25 victory over Anaheim.  </P> <P> Danielle Tomasick's three goals helped Newport Harbor edge Estancia, 3-2,  Tuesday in a Sea View League soccer match. Tomasick has eight goals this season  for Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Tracy Greer accounted for three of Valencia's nine goals in a shutout of  Savanna Thursday. The victory helped Valencia (4-0) remain undefeated in Orange  League soccer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carrie Shannon  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley Christian  </P> <P> Position: Point guard  </P> <P> Height, Class: 5-9, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Led Capistrano Valley Christian to its first Olympic League victory  this season with a 30-point performance in a 46-43 decision over Santa  Margarita Thursday.  </P> <P> Season: She's the leading scorer for the Eagles, averaging 15.1 points, and is  averaging 4 steals per game.  </P></p>

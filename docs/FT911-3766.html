			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Japan to send minesweepers The Japanese government yesterday gave final approval to the despatch of minesweepers to the Gulf, on what will be the Japanese military's first mission on active service overseas since the Second World War, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo. Leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided to override objections from critics who argued that sending troops abroad would infringe Japan's peace constitution. Six ships and 500 men will set off before the end of the week on the month-long voyage to the Middle East.</p>

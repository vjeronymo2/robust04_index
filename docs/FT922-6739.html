			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Newcastle 'could cut emissions' NEWCASTLE upon Tyne could reduce its annual emission of carbon dioxide from 2.3m tonnes by 45 per cent by the year 2010 if it applied of existing technology, a report said yesterday. The study is believed to be the first comprehensive analysis of energy use and its environmental impact in a UK city. It concludes that without a more positive attitude to energy efficiency, measures such as increased use of catalytic convertors in cars will be offset by traffic growth and increased energy demand.</p>

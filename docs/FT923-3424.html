			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Bush's F-15 ploy clouds BAe Saudi deal PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday flew to the electorally important state of Missouri, to tell workers at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St Louis that he was authorising the sale of 72 F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia. The announcement threw a question mark over whether Saudi Arabia intends to proceed with purchasing more Tornado strike aircraft from Britain. A long-awaited deal, estimated at Pounds 4bn, for 48 Tornados and British Aerospace Hawk light fighters and trainers, is believed to have been awaiting signature since August. BAe maintains its prospective deal will be unaffected by Saudi purchases from the US. Mr Bush had already hinted that he was likely to approve the sale, but chose to turn the formal announcement into a rally for his election campaign, as he did last week when he reversed his policy on arms sales to Taiwan by approving the sale of F-16 fighters built by General Dynamics in Texas. Missouri, though it has fewer electoral votes than Texas, is similarly viewed as critical to Mr Bush's chances of winning re-election. The Dollars 9bn sale is expected to provide 40,000 jobs and affect the economies of 45 states. Although Israel and its supporters in the US have in the past objected to the sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia, administration officials say they do not expect strong opposition from the Israeli government. Saudi Arabia initially opted for the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado in the mid-1980s when it was barred from purchasing the F-15E, the two-seat, long-range strike version of the US jet. It renewed its request for F-15Es in 1989 and again last year, after the Gulf war, asking for 48 of the strike version and 24 two-seat air-superiority fighters. The White House said the Saudis would get F-16XP models, less capable than the F-15E, which is only flown by the US Air Force. McDonnell Douglas has been anxious that Congress should notified within the next few days in order to obtain approval this year. Although Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has given qualified backing for the sale, the next opportunity for congressional approval would not be expected to arise before the spring. The US State Department yesterday announced its decision to waive restrictions on the export of six satellite projects to China, Reuter reports. They include the APSAT, Asiasat 2, Intelsat VIIA, STARSAT, Afriastar and Dong Fang Hong 3 satellite projects.</p>

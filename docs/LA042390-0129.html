			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GOLDIE HAWN LOOKS TO NEW CAREER  </P> <P> Goldie Hawn, the go-go dancer who turned a wide-eyed dumb blonde routine into a  string of hit movies in the 1970s, is hoping to revitalize her career in the  1990s.  </P> <P> "I didn't become a movie star because I made people cry or because I had some  incredible romantic persona," Hawn said in an interview in the May issue of  Fame magazine.  </P> <P> "I came on the scene with an effervescence and a lightness and an ability to  elevate spirits, which, by the way, I do not sell short."  </P> <P> After success with "Cactus Flower," "Shampoo," "Butterflies Are Free" and  "Private Benjamin," she starred in a series of movies -- "Swing Shift,"  "Overboard" and others -- that she admits were disappointing.  </P> <P> But Hawn, 44, has a slew of projects in the works, including a comedy with Mel  Gibson, "Bird on a Wire," which opens next month, and a seven-film deal with  Disney's Hollywood Pictures.  </P></p>

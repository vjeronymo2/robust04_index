However, imported apples will face even stricter quarantine  measures after the restrictions are lifted, especially those  from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and  Chile, which have been declared codling moth regions, the COA  added.    COA officials said that Taiwan currently limits the purchase  of apples from the US and allows limited imports from Japan,  Australia and New Zealand.    The officials said that after lifting the restrictions,  apples from Japan and Korea will have the competitive edge here  while apples from the US, Australia and New Zealand will not be  allowed in if they do not meet the stricter quarantine measures.    COA officials said that the enhanced quarantine measures are  necessary to protect domestic agriculture in the face of an  expected flood of imported apples.    Australia and New Zealand have expressed concern about the  new quarantine measures, Sun Ming-hsien, COA chairman, said upon  his return home Sunday from a weeklong visit to New Zealand.    Sun said he has agreed to a New Zealand request for a  meeting  on the measures. The time of the meeting has yet to be set, he  noted.    Australia is also expected to raise the issue of the new  quarantine measures during a scheduled meeting with COA in March.</p>

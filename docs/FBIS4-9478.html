			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- Premier Jozef Moravcik  told CTK today that his government was preparing no shock  therapy for the Slovak economy, though it wanted to accelerate  changes to bring the country to prosperity and to keep the  budget deficit under control even at the cost of unpopular steps.    "There will be no return to shock therapy because the  prepared measures do not have the nature of a shock," Moravcik  stressed.    He said the planned increase in the value-added tax imposed  on some kinds of food and reduction of subsidies to farming  should not "affect citizens markedly," but the lower-income  strata might be affected. They would get compensation in order  to ensure the transformation's social tolerability, Moravcik  said.    The government will try to "maintain the deficit on an  acceptable level so that we do not run into problems similar to  last year's. The deficit of the state budget then was almost  twice as big as the level acceptable from the point of view of  our ties with international financial institutions," Moravcik  said. In consequence the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has  postponed the signing of an agreement on a new loan for Slovakia.    Moravcik recalled that the IMF would not grant Slovakia a  loan unless it keeps the deficit below 4 percent of its gross  domestic product.    Slovakia had a deficit of 23 billion Slovak crowns (about  $696 million) or 6.8 percent of the GDP last year.    The state budget is also burdened by the 5.8 billion Slovak  crowns deficit on the clearing account used in trade with the  Czech Republic, and by debts in the health, education and other  spheres which altogether exceed 6 billion crowns.    According to the Moravcik government's programme statement  the government sector's net debt had risen to 60 billion crowns.    Moravcik said the government wanted to take further steps to  remedy the Slovak economy. "First of all we would like to  markedly accelerate privatisation. During the six months of our  tenure (the government was appointed on March 16 and early  elections are to be held on September 30-October 1), we want to  create the conditions for (a second wave of) coupon  privatisation so that it can be launched after the elections.  At the end of the second wave, more than half of state property  could be in private ownership," Moravcik said.    The first wave of coupon privatisation was carried out still  within the Czechoslovak Federation and ended in January 1993,  shortly after the country split.    "Concrete measures will not probably be reflected in the  economic sphere and in our citizens' living conditions within  the six-month period. Nevertheless we would like to push  through steps to give a new dynamic to Slovakia's economic life.  But their effect will probably be evident in its entirety only  after the elections," Moravcik said.</p>

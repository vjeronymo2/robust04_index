			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / SAS returns to black in first half SCANDINAVIAN Airline Systems (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of SKr502m (Pounds 49.3m) for the first six months of the year, compared with a SKr1.025bn loss during the same period in 1991. The airline's operating revenue rose by almost 5 per cent to SKr16.138bn from SKr15.158bn. Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS chief executive and president, said the airline had 'bucked the trend amongst most European airlines' during the first half of the year by moving into profit. He suggested this was because SAS had 'moved earlier and more forcefully to realign its cost structure to create a more efficient operating base' in response to the increasing competitiveness in the European civil aviation industry and the downturn in demand. SAS estimated its financial results for the second half of the year would be close to break even, but the profit for the whole of 1992 would be only marginally better than the result for the first half. Mr Carlzon said the result for the second half would be affected by adverse foreign exchange transactions, a continuing weak market in SAS's main areas of activity in the Nordic region, western Europe and trans-Atlantic routes, and the cost of integrating Lineflyg, Sweden's domestic airline, into SAS's structure. SAS made a pre-tax profit in its airline operations of SKr492m in the first six months of the year, compared with a SKr543m loss for the same period of last year. Its passenger traffic volume rose by 3 per cent and production by 5 per cent, as SAS increased its share of a declining business travel market. Its charter airline business continued to run at a loss. In the first six months it suffered a deficit of SKr64m, though this was better than the SKr151m deficit for the first six months of last year which was affected by the Middle East war. SAS's losses in its international hotel operations fell to SKr95m from SKr362m for the first six months of last year, while its service activities made a SKr78m profit, compared with an SKr18m loss for the same period of last year. Mr Carlzon said that SAS would continue to restructure and improve its efficiency with job cuts and rationalisation of its organisation as it struggled to increase market share in Scandinavia.</p>

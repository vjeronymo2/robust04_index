He  submitted his letter of resignation and left the cabinet  chamber. The resignation takes effect on 48 hours' time.  During the meeting, several ministers expressed reservations  about IDF [Israel Defense Forces] involvement in the peace  process; others spoke up for this involvement. On this and  other issues on the agenda, David Ze'ev:    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is scheduled to arrive home  late this afternoon. His office says the foreign minister will  sit down with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the next steps in  the peace process towards evening.    At this morning's cabinet meeting, a government source says  Prime Minister Rabin told his ministers: We are always giving,  and the Palestinians are always taking. Internally, the prime  minister spoke out against the criticism of Labor Knesset Member  Hagay Merom that Army officers are overly involved in the  diplomatic process of the negotiations with the Palestinians.  Rabin is said to have complained that the critics are never  satisfied. Either, they say, the Army isn't having a big enough  say, or, they say, the Army is too involved.    Meretz Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that while certainly the  Army must be involved in the military ramifications of the Gaza  Jericho First arrangement, there is the impression, says Tzaban,  that the IDF's involvement goes beyond what is necessary.    Health Minister Hayim Ramon presented his letter of  resignation, as expected. He was abrupt when asked about the  next 48 hours until the resignation takes effect, but he  certainly did not rule out the possibility of his remaining in  the government, and not just as a Knesset member.

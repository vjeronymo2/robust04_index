			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Nadir and a question of recognition Sir, Your editorial comment: '. . . the government of northern Cyprus should not think that welcoming him (Asil Nadir) with open arms is a cost-free decision. It is precisely such behaviour which will prevent it receiving the recognition it craves' ('Jumping bail', May 6), raises two questions. First, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was proclaimed nine years ago. Mr Nadir was a very important man in the UK then. Why did the UK not recognise the TRNC, say, in 1985? Second, how many times did the TRNC receive fugitives from British justice with open arms to justify the British diplomatic non-recognition? One final comment. Your usage of the word 'crave' instead of 'expect' or 'demand' implies a touch of unnecessary ugliness not becoming to the FT. Mehmet Arif Demirer, Dukres Sokak 8/3, D6680 Ankara, Turkey</p>

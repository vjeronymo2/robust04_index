			<p>BFN     [Text] Press communique: A plenary session of the cabinet  was held at 1500 on the afternoon of 18 June under the  chairmanship of Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech  Hun Sen, first and second prime ministers of the Kingdom of  Cambodia [KOC] to examine the investment bill. After a thorough  debate, the cabinet ratified this investment bill which has  eight chapters and 26 articles.    The cabinet commended the experts for skillfully drafting  the  bill which has contents suitable for the urgent requirements of  the nation and domestic and foreign investment.    The cabinet paid attention to discussing and improving the  draft to attract investments to the KOC, thus creating and  increasing jobs for the people and enhancing the production in  the following domains:    I. Concerning Chapter II dealing with the Cambodian  Development Council [CDC], the cabinet unanimously regarded the  CDC as the general staff of the Royal Government of Cambodia  [RGC] in investment work and the competent body which has sole  access to the issuance of investment permits. At the same time,  the cabinet agreed on the protection of investors' rights and  freedoms. The arrangement, function, and composition of the CDC  will be set by a sub-decree.    II. Concerning Chapter III dealing with the investment  guarantees, the RGC recognizes all investors equally, that is,  there will be no discrimination based on their nationality and  race. The RGC guarantees that it will not nationalize the  assets of the investors and ensures that it will not control  prices of products and services, except for public services and  provisions in the books of charge, and will permit the right to  purchase and transfer foreign currencies.    III. Concerning Chapter IV dealing with the incentives for  investment, the priority domains to be encouraged are as follows:    1. Modern or high-technology industries.    2. Investment projects that are labor intensive,  including those in tourism, the industries, and agriculture.    3. Projects to enhance the export or production of  import- substitutes, agro-industrial projects, and projects in  the processing industry.    4. Projects for the development of the provinces and  countryside, the physical infrastructure, and the sustainable  energy production located in special development zones.    Tax and duty incentives are as follows:    A corporate tax rate of nine percent; a corporate tax  holiday  of up to eight years depending on the characteristics of each  investment project, whose order of priority will be determined  by the RGC in a sub-decree; tax exemption on all reinvested  profits; 100-percent tax exemption on goods for export;  100-percent tax exemption on the import of goods to serve  investments, to serve projects whose 80 percent of their  production is exported, to serve projects in the tourist  industry, labor-intensive industry, processing industry,  agro-industry, or projects located in the special industrial  zones; and permission to bring into the kingdom foreign  supervisors, specialists, technicians, specialized workers, and  their dependents in line with the KOC's immigration law.    IV. Concerning Chapter V dealing with ownership and use of  land, in keeping with the Constitution there is no problem of  land ownership for investors who are either physical or juristic  persons with Cambodian nationality (meaning, those with more  than 50 percent of their gross capitals belonging to  Cambodians). As for foreign physical and juristic persons, they  are allowed to use land through a long-term lease of up to 70  years. This land use, including all the rights of land  ownership, must be implemented in accordance with the law.    V. Also on that occasion, the cabinet agreed that individual  disputes will be settled first by the CDC before being forwarded  to court. Also, any disputes with the authorities concerned  will be sent to ICSID [International Center for Settlement of  Investment Disputes].    The implementation of this investment law will be based on  the publication of several subsequent royal decrees,  sub-decrees, and regulations. However, this law will not affect  investors who have been operating before it takes effect.    The cabinet ended its session at 2000 in an atmosphere of  unity and with high sense of responsibility.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 20 June 1994</p>

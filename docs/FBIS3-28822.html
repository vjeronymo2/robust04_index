Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks on the  issue of sanctions against the DPRK at the Japan-U.S. summit  talks that "Japan will take every possible action within the  framework of the Constitution," Hashimoto criticized the prime  minister, and said: "We are greatly concerned whether Japan will  be allowed to take actions within the framework of the  Constitution in case this issue is turned over to the UN  Security Council for debate. Since it is not the United States  but Japan that will be asked to make sensible responses, how can  the prime minister remain so calm?" Thus, Hashimoto indicated  his strong concern as to whether the government would be  sufficiently able to respond quickly to the increasingly tense  situation in the Far East.</p>

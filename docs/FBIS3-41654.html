At  the last meeting of the Environment, Nature Conservation, and  Reactor Safety Committee, held on 20 October, the ministry  denied media reports that dummies had been incinerated in Basel  in 1986 instead of the 41 drums containing highly toxic dioxin  from Italy: The documentation supplied by the Hoffmann-La Roche  chemicals group stated that the incineration process had been  monitored by the Swiss authorities, and this appeared plausible,  said the ministry. An investigation program had nevertheless  been initiated, in the course of which the area under and around  the Schoenberg dump would be inspected and the dump's archives  would be laid open. In the meantime, a computer model of the  site was being drawn up to give an idea as to which type of  waste was where, and as to the areas for which there was no  information, the Federal Government stated.    Representatives of the Alliance 90/Greens parliamentary  party  pointed out that the dump's bookkeeping had been doctored and  that there was insufficient data to trace any old toxic drums.  Not for nothing had the Schoenberg area enjoyed ``top secret  site'' status in the days of the GDR. The group also voiced the  criticism that the inspection had been set in motion only after  a ``considerable delay,'' in spite of the long-standing  suspicion that toxic matter from Seveso had found its way to  Schoenberg. The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union] parliamentary party was of the opinion that, by  GDR standards, Schoenberg was one of the safest dumps. The FDP  [Free Democratic Party] parliamentary party also shared the view  that ``agitation'' seemed out of place. SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] deputies called on the Federal Government not  to leave the entire responsibility for such matters with the  laender should evidence of deposits of dioxin from Seveso come  to light. For its part, the government gave assurances that it  would investigate all suspicious circumstances. In the event of  the offending drums emerging, they would be returned ``promptly  and without red tape'' to sender.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / China continues to penetrate its future territory: There is concern over the growing number of Chinese investors in Hong Kong and their interests IN June 1991, Mr T T Tsui, one of Hong Kong's new rich, was in London doling out HKDollars 16m to refurbish the Victoria and Albert Museum's display of Chinese antiquities. The Prince of Wales turned up for the occasion. Last week, Mr Tsui was in Beijing for the launch of a business venture, New China Hong Kong Group, a company that plans to play the Hong Kong stock market and invest in China - this time with Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, in attendance. Mr Tsui's impeccable political connections are topped only by his ability to entice many of Hong Kong's leading businessmen to invest in his company. Mr Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's wealthiest men, Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's casino king, and Mr Lim Por Yen, chairman of Lai Sun, a large property developer are but three of the colony's personalities who have contributed to the company's paid up capital of HKDollars 400m. Sections of Hong Kong's business and political establishment have taken more than a passing interest in Mr Tsui's new company. But their main concern is with the list of mainland Chinese investors and one in particular, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (cabinet), HKMAO. This is China's top policy-making body on Hong Kong and reports directly to the prime minister; it is widely believed to lead the mainland investors who control about 32.5 per cent of New China Hong Kong's capital. The Hong Kong government watches New China closely but is powerless to act. The Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's financial watchdog, vets management competence, not ownership. Conflict of interest is the main concern. According to one government official: 'It has been vividly demonstrated that a mere statement from HKMAO can affect the Hong Kong stock market and indeed individual stocks. If Hong Kong people thought that an important agency of the Chinese government had a financial interest in its policy statements then they would be very concerned indeed.' This view has been echoed by merchant bankers and stock brokers in the colony. However, western diplomatic observers of Hong Kong take a less alarmist view of the company. Says one: 'It possibly does give them an advantage, but I don't think they are ready to compete with some of the more rapacious personalities in Hong Kong.' China has always had a presence in Hong Kong. Even in the late 1960s Bank of China, China Merchants, China Resources and China Travel Service - collectively known as the 'four heavenly sisters' - had a major role in the colony's economy. China Merchants and China Travel Service have both floated subsidiaries on the Hong Kong stock market. Other Chinese enterprises, China International Trust and Investment Corporation, CITIC, are now vying with the old British 'hongs', Jardine Matheson and John Swire. The extent of China's ownership of assets in Hong Kong is not known with any precision. But last month, a Chinese government official was reported in the official media saying that in 1992 alone the mainland had invested USDollars 20bn in Hong Kong and Macao, but gave no details. 'The real figure is a lot different from what they admit publicly,' said a western diplomat. In the past year, mainland companies have become significant investors in, and users of, the Hong Kong stock market. The current market value of the mainland's investments in quoted Hong Kong companies is about HKDollars 45bn. The value of these investments is expected to grow significantly once mainland Chinese companies begin to list directly on the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland companies have also been among the largest buyers of property in Hong Kong. Brooke Hillier Parker, a property consultant, estimates on the basis of publicly declared deals that mainland interests acquired property in Hong Kong with a value of HKDollars 20bn in 1992. That compared with purchases, mostly in the residential sector, totaling HKDollars 7.6bn in 1991. Not everyone is optimistic. In a recent issue of Dangdai, a magazine concerned with mainland politics and economics, an analyst writing under the pseudonym Wan Li Xing, charted China's takeover of Hong Kong's economy, based on the way the Communist Party took over Guangzhou (Canton) and Shanghai 40 years ago. Wan said that China would co-opt Hong Kong's leading businessmen by offering them political status as a reward for fostering Hong Kong's economic development. 'After a certain period of time Hong Kong's economic system would be absorbed into China's. As a special economic zone, Hong Kong's economy would not be allowed to develop independently for ever.'</p>

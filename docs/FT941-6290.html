			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dawson to make Pounds 50m provision for US shake-up Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, is closing its fleece and jersey business in the US and taking a Pounds 50m exceptional provision for the year to March 26 1994. The rationalisation was announced yesterday following an independent review of Dawson's US businesses, which had sales of Pounds 214m in 1992-93, about half the group total. Last month the shares fell to 134p after the group warned that difficult US trading conditions would lead to 'a very substantial exceptional provision this year.' Yesterday they closed down 5p at 153p. Dawson is also considering the sale of Dawson Home Fashions, which makes shower curtains and bath mats. Although it had 60 per cent of the US market last year, DHF has been hit badly by import penetration. Operating profits in the six months to September 25 amounted to just Pounds 300,000 on turnover of Pounds 30.4m. The fleece and jersey business lost Pounds 8.9m on sales of Pounds 29.1m in the same period. Known as JE Morgan Apparel, it operates 12 plants and has 2,000 employees. Sir Ronald Miller, executive chairman, said the three plants making fleece, which is used in jogging suits, would be closed. Three of the remaining plants are dedicated to making jersey, which is used for T-shirts and underwear. These would be reorganised, along with the jersey-making operations of the mixed plants, with a view to a possible sale. Dawson went into the jersey and fleece business in 1989, and was a supplier to Kmart, the US retailing group. Sir Ronald said the business had been hit by excess capacity in the US, imports, lower sales in the recession and the battle between US retailers. He pointed out that Kmart lost Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the fourth quarter. Goodwill of Pounds 42m from the purchase of JE Morgan will need to be written off through the profit and loss account. A further Pounds 14m will need to be written off if the shower curtain business is sold. The group's net debt at March 26 is expected to be about Pounds 70m. It also has Pounds 27.9m of convertible preference shares. Dawson has two further businesses in the US, Morgan and Duofold, which make thermal underwear and other clothing. The group expects this year's results to be better than last year's. Sir Ronald said the rationalisation would enable the company to concentrate on its profitable US operations.</p>

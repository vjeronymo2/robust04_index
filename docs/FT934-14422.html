			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: It's simple sense to make a will - Two-thirds of UK adults haven't made one. Bethan Hutton explains why they should MONDAY IS the start of Make a Will Week, a Law Society promotion now in its third year. In spite of the publicity generated by solicitors posing in Superman outfits as the character Will Power, the society still estimates that at least two-thirds of adults in the UK have not made a will. The message of the campaign is that while failing to make a will can leave your family a legacy of legal costs, complications and disappointment, making one is easy and inexpensive. Too many people think they still have plenty of time, or they do not own enough to make it worthwhile, or that it will all go to their husband or wife, anyway. The campaign this year is being targeted particularly at unmarried couples who live together. They have no rights in law when their partner dies unless property, such as a house, is owned jointly or they can prove to a court that they depended on the partner. Even then, they may be awarded only a small part of the estate. Make a Will Week is not necessarily a time for those who have already made one to feel smug. How long ago was it written? If it was more than a couple of years, your circumstances may have changed: you could have married or re-married, bought or sold property, acquired children or grand-children, or even received an inheritance yourself. Wills need to be reviewed every few years, or whenever there is an important change in your financial or personal circumstances. If amendments are necessary, you can write an entirely new will or add a codicil to your existing one. In England and Wales, marriage automatically revokes all previous wills, so see your solicitor as soon as possible after the wedding or draw up new wills to be signed on the day. Divorce will invalidate clauses involving your former spouse. In Scotland, neither marriage nor divorce invalidates a will. Deciding who should inherit the bulk of your property is usually easy. You might also decide to make a few small cash bequests to friends or relatives, or distribute a few pieces of jewellery or collectors' items to people you feel will appreciate them. Many charities offer guidance on will-writing as a way of encouraging people to make charitable bequests - often, these are an important source of funding. If you have no worries about leaving your dependants in need, providing small sums to a handful of favourite charities can be a nice gesture. The other essential element of a will is choosing executors - the people who carry out your wishes. You should choose several, and they can be beneficiaries. If they are professionals, such as solicitors, you should make provision in the will for them to be paid their normal fees. Be wary of appointing a bank as your executor, though, as charges can be high and service slow. Allow for alternate executors in case any should die before you or be unable or unwilling to act. A will is not just about who gets what after you die. It also lets you express your intentions for your children, other dependants or pets, and what should be done with your body. Those with young children should name guardians who could take charge of them if both parents should die in quick succession. Obviously, you should seek the agreement of the person or people, as guardianship is a serious commitment. Some people are driven to make a will only by the thought of what might happen to a pet if they died. You might not want to leave your entire estate to support your labrador in its customary lifestyle, but you could want to specify who should look after it and set aside some money for its upkeep. But if you leave all your worldly goods to your dog, and make no provision for your human dependants, they could go to court and make a claim on the estate. Executors are not obliged legally to act upon wishes that have nothing to do with with the disposal of your property (for example, where you want to be buried and what the gravestone should say), but usually they will honour them unless there is an overriding reason against doing so. Richard Bark-Jones, a probate practioner with the Liverpool firm of Moorecroft, Dawson and Garnetts, recalls a will for which his father, also a lawyer, was executor. The deceased had always been afraid of being buried alive and, in his will, asked to be pierced through the heart before being interred. Bark-Jones senior found this idea distasteful, not to say macabre, but felt himself morally obliged to carry out the request. So, he arranged for a surgeon to perform the task with the executors as witnesses. Unusual or illegal conditions attached to bequests can be overruled. For example, a statement that a child can receive a bequest only if he is brought up in a certain religion could be ignored. Making a will is a good occasion to think about inheritance tax and whether there is any way you can lessen its impact. IHT of 40 per cent must be paid on estates over Pounds 150,000; for many people in the south of England, especially, the family house alone pushes the estate over the limit. There are some exemptions, such as transfers between spouses, but the children can be landed with a large tax bill when the second parent dies unless prior action is taken. IFA Promotion, an organisation representing independent financial advisers (IFAs), says Britons pay Pounds 665m in unnecessary IHT every year. Some of this could be avoided with very simple measures, such as writing insurance policies in trust so that the money is not paid to the estate but to the survivors. Other avoidance measures include giving money away before you die, changing the basis of ownership of the home, or setting up discretionary trusts. An IFA should be able to tailor arrangements to your needs. IHT planning should also be reviewed regularly to take account of any change in your circumstances or the tax laws. Insurance companies often are eager to offer advice or assistance with wills, as a person in the mood to ponder his own mortality could easily be persuaded to buy a life policy. These can be useful for IHT planning, but it is best to take independent advice. The obvious person to consult when you make a will is a solicitor. If you have never needed to see a solicitor, or do not know one locally, ask friends or neighbours for recommendations or consult the Citizens Advice Bureau. Solicitors charge around Pounds 50 for a straightforward will; if your partner has a similar one drawn up at the same time, that will add perhaps half as much again. Solicitors usually charge by the hour for drawing up more complicated wills involving trusts and so on. It is perfectly acceptable to ask a few solicitors for quotes before making your choice. Another option is to use a will-writing service. These often are franchise operations, and the training given to franchisees sometimes is not very extensive. Check first on the qualifications of the person who will actually write the will - they might not be able to cope with unusual or complex situations - as well as the price. It might not be any less than using a solicitor. It is possible to buy a simple form from a stationer and write your own will. It is, however, easy to make mistakes or oversights that are unlikely to be discovered until too late. Even if your wishes are very simple - say, to leave everything to your spouse - what would happen if you both died in the same accident? Wording can be a problem, too. If your will says that you leave all your money to your husband, this might be interpreted as just cash or money in bank accounts, building societies, national savings etc - not shares or other investments. Remember also that a will must be signed in front of two witnesses - who must not be beneficiaries. Bark-Jones says the most common mistake in do-it-yourself wills is failing to make a residuary bequest. People itemise their main assets and specify who is to get the house, cash and certain treasured items, but do not say who should get the rest. Failure to appoint executors, or guardians for children, is also frequent with do-it-yourself wills. 'They tend to cost the family a lot more money than it would have cost them to go to a solicitor in the first place,' says Bark-Jones. Finally, remember that it makes things easier for everyone if you keep the will somewhere secure but where it can be found easily, and destroy out-of-date wills to avoid confusion. Keeping a list of bank and building society accounts, insurance policies and investments somewhere accessible is also a good idea. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People has a free booklet and information service on will-making for deaf people. Contact the RNID, 105 Gower Street, London WC1E 6AH, tel. 071-387 8033. Action for Blind People has a cassette on the subject: write to 14-16 Verney Road, London SE16 3DZ, or telephone 071-732 8771. ***** WHO GETS WHAT IF YOU DIE without a will, who gets your money and your property? For those living in England and Wales, the situation is this if you are: Single (including divorced, widowed or co-habiting) with no children If one or both parents are alive, they inherit. If both are dead, then brothers and sisters or their children inherit. If there are none, then half-siblings followed by grandparents, aunts or uncles, then any other relatives. If no close relatives can be found, efforts will be made to find more distant ones but, if this fails, the estate goes to the state. Unmarried partners and friends do not get anything if you die without a will. If you die before a divorce has been finalised, your spouse still has a claim on your estate. Single with children The estate goes in equal shares to your children or, if any are dead, their children in equal shares. Married without children At present, the spouse will receive the first Pounds 125,000 of the net estate, plus one half of the rest. The other half goes to the parents or siblings, or other relatives as above. Married with children The spouse gets the first Pounds 75,000 and a life interest in half the rest, which passes to the children when he or she dies. The children get the other half. Earlier this year, the Lord Chancellor announced that the portion of the estate kept by the spouse would be increased to Pounds 200,000 for childless couples, and Pounds 125,000 for couples with children. But no date has been set for this. Children are in the same legal position whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted, but step-children are not counted as yours for inheritance purposes unless you have adopted them legally or named them in a will. The rules for Northern Ireland are similar to those for England and Wales, with Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 125,000 going to the spouse depending on whether there are children. But if there are children, rather than the spouse receiving a life interest in half the residue, all of this is divided up equally between the surviving spouse and the children. There are other minor differences. The situation in Scotland is markedly different, as various elements of the estate are categorised separately and the spouse has an entitlement to these up to various limits. Children may inherit a greater share of the estate.</p>

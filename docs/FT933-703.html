			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Wrangling leaves reform plan in the balance THE FATE of Mr John Smith's reforms of the Labour party constitution remains in the balance before tomorrow's vital vote, with lobbying attention focusing on the constituency party activists and the handful of tiny unions that could still swing the result. For the first time at a Labour conference the constituencies hold the balance of power, with 30 per cent of the vote. As many constituency delegates are not clearly mandated on the issue of one-member-one-vote, the Smith camp hopes a loyalist momentum will bring the minimum two-thirds of delegates it needs. The lobbying was partially overshadowed yesterday by explicit opposition to Mr Smith's policy change from Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, and by the lukewarm support expressed by the party's deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett. Mrs Beckett infuriated other Labour leaders by refusing to back Mr Smith explicitly against union opponents such as Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB. 'Nobody is disagreeing with John Smith over one-member-one-vote,' she said. 'Nobody's against it, but people have different preferences as to how it should be exercised. Let's hope that on Wednesday those preferences are resolved into one agreement behind which we can all unite.' There was further disagreement between Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU craft union, a strong supporter of the reforms, and Mr Edmonds. Mr Jordan said Mr Edmonds was standing out for a continuing union presence in the selection of parliamentary candidates because he was seeking 'common ground' with the left-led TGWU general union, with which the GMB is hoping to merge. 'It could be the costliest piece of ground in political history', Mr Jordan said. A spokesman for Mr Edmonds said the allegation was 'ludicrous' and the union policy was driven by strong local and regional feeling. Mr Jordan conceded that the vote would be extremely close and that movement towards Mr Smith's position had 'slowed up' after a rush of support on Sunday. Some Smith supporters were speculating that the vote on the National Executive Committee rule change in favour of one-member-one-vote might be lost but a complex composite motion backed by the RMT rail union and Nupe, the public service union, would be supported and could form the basis of a new NEC proposal. Some opponents of the reform say, however, that they would consider legal action in the event of such a move, especially if one of the motions hostile to one-member-one-vote was also passed. The Smith camp could be saved by some smaller unions. One medium-sized union which has been opposing the reforms has indicated that it is poised to switch position at the last moment to support the NEC rule change.</p>

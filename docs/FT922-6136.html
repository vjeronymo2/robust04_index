			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Swissair sells holding in Kuoni SG WARBURG SODITIC, the Geneva subsidiary of the British merchant bank, has purchased the 35.8 per cent stake in the Swiss travel group Kuoni held by Swissair, the Swiss national airline, and sold it to European institutional clients. Terms were not revealed, but following the announcement of the transaction the price of Kuoni bearer shares rose SFr1,100 to SFr23,900, valuing the Swissair stake at SFr119.9m (Dollars 81m). The sale has been rumoured for some time as part of a Swissair programme to sell off peripheral activities. 'By pulling out of Kuoni, Swissair is underlining its intention to concentrate on its core businesses, the transport of people and goods, and related services,' the airline said. Mr Luigi De Carlo of Warburg Soditic said that one quarter of the shares were placed with Swiss institutions. The remainder were placed with institutional customers elsewhere in Europe. Warburg's view was that the shares were undervalued and that the wide distribution of the Swissair stake would raise liquidity and investor interest. The Kuoni-Hugentobler Foundation still has absolute control of Kuoni, with a 52.6 per cent voting stake.</p>

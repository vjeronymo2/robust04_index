			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON PLANS TOUR OF LAGUNA LAUREL SITE;  </P> <P> CANYON: CRANSTON WILL GET FIRSTHAND LOOK  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston will tour Laguna Canyon with officials from Laguna Beach and  the Irvine Co. Friday to view the proposed site of a 3,200-home residential  development that has fueled a decade-long battle between th developer and local  residents.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the visit is to give the senator an update on the progress of  discussions going on regarding Laguna Canyon," said Gil Saldana, an aide to the  California Democrat. "In 1981 the senator authored a (failed) bill that would  have made the canyon and Irvine Coast a national park, so now he's interested  in the local efforts that are now taking place."  </P> <P> Cranston will visit the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel project site as part of a  one-day trip to Orange County that will also include stops in Santa Ana and  Newport Beach, aides said. They said Cranston wanted to get a firsthand look at  the project area, anticipating the possibility of a future request for federal  funding from local officials.  </P> <P> "The senator has not taken a position on the development and will not take a  position on the development," Saldana said. "But in the event that the Irvine  Co. decides it will relocate the project out of Laguna Canyon, we imagine the  Laguna Beach officials will probably need some financial assistance to acquire  the land."  </P> <P> He did not specify which funds or how much federal money could be available to  Laguna Beach for land acquisition to preserve open space.  </P> <P> The Cranston visit comes several weeks after the Irvine Co. announced it would  consider moving the project out of the canyon into neighboring Irvine, if  officials from the two cities agree to a set of stringent demands on the scope,  finances and review process for the development.  </P> <P> For nearly 10 years, city officials and the Irvine Co. have been at odds over  the proposed residential development slated for the mouth of Laguna Canyon. The  development would include apartments and condominiums, a golf course, a school  and shopping center, along with public parks and preserved terrain.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach residents and many local officials fear the large development  would damage the environmentally sensitive canyon.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. officials said they were recently contacted by Cranston's office  inquiring about the status of the negotiations between the cities of Laguna  Beach and Irvine.  </P> <P> "I don't know what actually can come out of this meeting," said Irvine Co.  spokesman Jim Barich. "I think we're just showing him the site. I don't think  he's coming down here with any specific agenda."  </P> <P> Some local officials criticized the upcoming Cranston visit as an attempt to  bolster the senator's image, which has been tarnished recently by a scandal  involving Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. Cranston and four other senators have  been accused of interfering with a federal investigation of Lincoln in exchange  for thousands of dollars in political contributions from owner Charles H.  Keating Jr. The resulting collapse of the thrift resulted in a $2-billion loss  for the federal government.  </P> <P> Despite skepticism about Cranston's intentions, the senator's visit will help  attract statewide attention to an environmental issue that so far has generated  mostly local interest.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said he is sure Cranston is trying  to improve his image, "but I don't mind if it helps us. There could be an  important federal role there if we come up a little short, the feds might come  in and use some of their federal park monies to help us. It's a long shot but  we don't pass up long shots."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach City Council member Robert F. Gentry also welcomed the Cranston  visit and encouraged other elected officials and candidates for office to tour  the canyon.  </P> <P> "If his visit means there is a potential for preservation of Laguna Canyon by  the federal government, then I'm elated," Gentry said. "It validates it as a  regional and a national issue. The fact that he's here to review the site  indicates to me that he is indeed interested in the future use of the land."  </P></p>

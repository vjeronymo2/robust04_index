			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) An audit finding during the servicer's two most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits amounting to at least five percent of funds received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or administered by the servicer under the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A citation within the preceding five years for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's failure to submit a required audit report within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an acceptable amount of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third-party servicer that shows these indicators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionable past performance with regard to the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs could not, under paragraph (d) of this section, contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an institution unless the persons or entities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over the servicer agree to be responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any potential liability arising from the servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. In the case of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that has been subjected to a termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action, the servicer could not contract with an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless either the servicer or persons or entities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over the servicer (or both) provide financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guarantees (specified by the Secretary) to the Secretary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential liabilities arising from the administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. These provisions are necessary to hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons who have substantial control over a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountable for their past performance in the administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any contract between an institution and a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer would have to require the servicer to agree to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using any Title IV, HEA program funds that the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administers and any earnings on those funds solely for Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program purposes. The servicer would have to agree to refer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspected instances of fraud and criminal activity to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education's Inspector General. These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would parallel those currently required of institutions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing an institution's administrative capability but add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the servicer would also have to refer suspected instances of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud and criminal activity committed by the institution. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract would have to require the servicer to agree to be liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary, jointly and severally with the institution, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to third-party servicer liability, a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators opposed the Secretary's proposed language, submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to negotiators at negotiated rulemaking, requiring a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer to share liability with an institution for an infraction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program requirement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators offered three basic reasons for their opposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the negotiators stated that any imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability would improperly interfere with the private contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the servicer and the institution. The parties, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view of the negotiators, should be free to decide how and if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability should be divided without Federal regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescription.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

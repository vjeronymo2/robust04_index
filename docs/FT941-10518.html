			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Polish composer of wide acclaim / Obituary of Lutoslawski On Tuesday morning, just two weeks after his eighty-first birthday, the composer Lutoslawski died in his native Warsaw. That was something like a lucky accident, for from the late 1950s - when his Funeral Music for strings earned him wide international acclaim and interest - Lutoslawski had spent long periods abroad, teaching in America, Scandinavia and England as well as conducting his own works. He was soon laden with commissions, honorary doctorates and prizes. Recently the South Bank devoted a retrospective series of concerts to his music, and it enjoyed a quasi-popular success that few living composers could expect. Lutoslawski was already forty-five when the Funeral Music (an In Memoriam for Bela Bartok, whose musical character it reflected in its own rigorously constructed way) made him internationally known. His discovery proceeded in opposite directions. On the one hand his already substantial oeuvre, scarcely known outside Poland, offered a wealth of happy finds: in particular his witty, cross-grained expansion of Liszt's 'Paganini' variations (from 1941, when he eked out a living by playing cafe-piano), now a duo-pianists' staple, and the grandly exuberant, playful, slightly menacing Concerto for Orchestra (1954). In the other direction, there were his newer, radically exploratory pieces, from before the Funeral Music and after it - and on and on: the later Lutoslawski never repeated himself. He pursued various ideals of form, always original, often oblique and yet transparent. For a time he flirted (like the Hungarian Gyorgy Ligeti) with 'aleatoric' writing, in which individual players are left to realise free notation in their own ways, but strictly contained within the whole composition. The common factors were always 'definiteness of intention', razor-sharp and unmistakeable; a superb ear for well-placed, unexpected instrumental colour; and a dangerous sense of humour (peculiarly Polish, perhaps). To those, the music of his last two decades - from the Cello Concerto for Rostropovich - added a stern eloquence, which flowered broadly in his third and fourth symphonies, but turned laconic and even savage in his series of contrapuntal Chains for smaller ensembles. The London Sinfonietta was among the beneficiaries of that series. It is sad to think that the Chains are broken off now: they amounted to a public exhibition of a first-class composer's developing thoughts, and one awaited each new instalment with excited anticipation. It is consoling to remember that there is plenty of late Lutoslawski that cries out for further, rewarding acquaintance still; and to reflect that his long career culminated ' unlike most composers', contemporary or long-past ' in a quarter-century of deserved admiration.</p>

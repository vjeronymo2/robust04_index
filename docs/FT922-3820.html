			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont rules out early City reform REGULATION of financial services will remain unchanged as a result of the Treasury's new responsibilities for the industry, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said last night. On the day he took over responsibilities previously held by the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Lamont made clear that he did not envisage an early shake-up in the City's system of self-regulation. Speculation about possible reforms had been encouraged by the appointment of Mr Anthony Nelson as economic secretary to the Treasury. Before he became a minister he was a critic of the City 'club' and a proponent of extra powers for the Securities and Investments Board. At the minimum, yesterday's statement suggests that there will be no immediate move towards giving the Bank of England a more direct role in overseeing the City's investment markets. Mr Lamont said financial services had become increasingly closely linked in the UK and overseas, justifying the bringing together of responsibilities into a single department. 'No changes are proposed in the way financial services are regulated as a result of the transfer,' he said in a Commons written answer. The transfer involved the functions and staff of the DTI's financial services division. They covered policy, legislation and the overseeing of regulation in the areas of investment business, collective investment schemes, the issue of securities to the public and investor protection. The Treasury will now have responsibility for the regulatory system set up under the 1986 Financial Services Act, including overseeing SIB. The DTI will continue to have responsibility for company law and for investigations under the financial services, insolvency and companies acts. It will retain responsibility for the insurance industry.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved sharply lower in heavier trading volume than on Monday but once again there was little real attempt at driving the cash market. The FT-SE December contract closed at 3,046 for a near 10-point premium to the cash market. The fair value premium stands at around 17 points. Trading volume rose substantially on Monday's depressed levels, jumping to 17,553 lots in what traders yesterday described as 'steady business throughout the trading day'. Activity was said to be fairly evenly divided among locals - independent traders - and the big brokers with the latter producing most of the throughput when the FT-SE December contract hit its high for the day of 3,073 just before 3:30pm. Opinions among traders on the immediate direction were mixed but if there was any sort of consensus it suggested that London equities could soon be ripe for a rebound. 'We'll either go through 3,000 or bounce back above 3,100,' said one big trader yesterday. Activity in traded options also improved, rising to 39,646 contracts, against 22,605 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE accounted for more than half of total activity. The most actively traded individual stock options were BP (2,689 lots), Hanson (1,418) and Shell (1,066).</p>

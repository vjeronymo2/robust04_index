			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP AND JAZZ CAPSULES : THE ENCHANTED 'JOURNEY' OF LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO  </P> <P> It's appropriate that Ladysmith Black Mambazo's next album is titled "Journey  of Dreams." It's hard to imagine a more fanciful trip into international pop  celebrity than that taken by the 10-man a cappella Zulu group from Durban,  South Africa, which appeared at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium on Friday. But  even if Paul Simon had not spotlighted the group on "Graceland," it's likely  Ladysmith would have still gained attention. In each elemental rush of breath,  the group's rich, haunting harmonies resonate with the innocence of free play  and the profundity of spiritual values.  </P> <P> Whether singing in Zulu or carrying the simplest of English love lyrics, these  voices suggest another kind of phantasmagoric journey, from ancient war chants  to hymnals to American field hollers to street-corner doo-wop, finally brought  home and reinterpreted at the source. Because of the culturally specific  format, Ladysmith's show tends to become repetitive, especially since almost  all of the material is in the same key. And the more politically acute listener  might wish for some reference to apartheid. But that doesn't mean there's any  lack of spirit here; Ladysmith Black Mambazo's elegant, hypnotic sound is  testimony enough to how truly visionary art can rise above a state of  oppression.

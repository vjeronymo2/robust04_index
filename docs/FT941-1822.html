			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (3): Big change in attitudes - One of the fastest growing aspects of pharmaceutical R&amp;D is contract research Contract research has expanded from a small cottage industry in the mid-1970s to a business whose worldwide turnover is now estimated at Dollars 3bn a year. Contract research organisations - known generally as CROs - span the whole spectrum of pharmaceutical R&amp;D. In the discovery phase, they synthesise tiny quantities of research chemicals and help to elucidate the pharmacological action of new molecules. But their biggest contribution comes in clinical development; indeed, some of the larger CROs have built up clinical departments as large as those in medium-sized pharmaceutical companies. Toxicology and laboratory analysis are the most mature sectors of the CRO market, in which companies routinely contract out work. A book just published* by Technomark, a London consultancy, contains what is claimed to be the first comprehensive analysis of the international contract research industry. It shows that there about 1,000 CROs worldwide, of which at least 20 have revenues exceeding Dollars 20m a year. Richard Wyse and Graham Hughes, the Technomark authors, estimate that the European CRO industry has a turnover of about Dollars 900m, of which the UK accounts for Dollars 400m. Britain is the preferred location for drug development programmes, they say, because of the strength of its scientific expertise, its health and academic infrastructure and, above all, its favourable legislative and economic conditions. Factors fueling the rapid growth in contracting out include: Regulatory and legislative changes which require pharmaceutical companies to carry out larger and more wide-ranging studies. Globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry; CROs have local knowledge and skills which can be very attractive to, say, a Japanese drug company trying to expand into Europe. Growth of biotechnology companies which have little in-house experience of the complex process of clinical development and cannot afford to staff their own overseas offices. Strategic decisions by many pharmaceutical companies to use CROs for certain areas of R&amp;D, so as to accelerate development and cut costs. Increasing recognition by the industry that CROs represent a valuable source of expertise. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, explains why CROs are so useful  -'in R&amp;D, there's a baseline level of activity and then there are peaks and troughs. It's important not to staff up for the peaks,' he says. 'The idea is generally to contract out for the peaks; that way we can keep a lean machine.' That is the classic justification for contracting-out. Dr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director of Elf Sanofi, puts it similarly: 'Development comes in waves. We want to use our development capacity at 100 per cent,' he says. 'Anything over 100 per cent and we turn to CROs. That's better than hiring new people. This is an unstable world. I'd prefer not to hire people and then fire them a couple of years later.' Japanese drug companies with global ambitions have particular reason to contract out clinical development overseas. 'We already use CROs in the US,' says Mr Masaji Ohno, managing director for R&amp;D at Eisai. 'We aren't sure in Europe yet. There's no tradition of CROs in Japan, but they make it very easy to enter clinical trials. It allows us to avoid building up an expensive infrastructure overseas.' Mr Mitsuhiko Sentoku, director of planning and development for Daiichi, agrees. 'We can acquire very good clinical data in London - we're putting one of our leading products Cravit through CROs in Europe. That avoids having to build up important infrastructure.' Sir Richard Sykes draws a clear distinction between contracting-out and collaborative research. 'Contracting-out is for a specific task; we lay down the parameters and we pay for it,' he says. 'That's quite different from collaboration, where there's a close flow of information between us and our partners.' In 1992/93, Glaxo spent Pounds 183m on research, of which Pounds 39m went to external organisations - mainly collaborative partners. In the same year, the company spent Pounds 556m on development, of which Pounds 128m was external - mainly contracted out. 'Our major competitors are still the pharmaceutical companies themselves, rather than other CROs,' says Dr John Mills, senior vice-president for Europe at Besselaar - one of the largest CROs with 1,100 employees worldwide. 'In some companies the medical directors are resistant to contracting-out because they think they will lose control by handing work over to us. People are not yet as open with us as they could be.' Even so, Dr Mills says, there has been a huge change in attitudes over the past 20 years. 'When I started out in the industry, you contracted-out the bits which you really didn't want to do or which you were afraid might fail. 'Contracting was regarded as a rather mucky end of the business - and not very exciting. We're much more respectable now.' Mr Simon Garnham, who founded Chiltern International in 1982 and has seen it grow into a substantial European CRO, describes another change. 'The market has developed from a very immature, not to say casual, situation 10 to 15 years ago when significant clinical research expenditures were often made on the basis of discussions and a simple exchange of letters, to a point today where sophisticated 30-page legal agreements accompanied by full product specifications and costings are more the norm.' Most people in the contract research industry expect it to continue growing in the years ahead, though not as quickly as over the past two decades. 'The minimum critical mass necessary to undertake larger projects today is somewhere of the order of 100 staff, spread amongst a balance of departments giving really quite significant drug development capabilities,' says Mr Garnham. 'But by trying to keep the size of functional groups modest, say between 20 and 30, it is possible for contractors to respond to clients better and for clients to identify better with those groups who are providing services. 'Overall, the market today is still very fractured.' he says. 'In 20 years' time, people in business schools will probably look back and refer to this as a classic situation of an immature market developing and polarising into a relatively small number of relatively large players who dominate the game, together with a relatively large number of small players to provide highly specialised services - in particular, therapeutic or geographical areas.' *Pharmaceutical Contract Research in the 1990s, Pounds 250; from Technomark, King House, 5-11 Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UA.</p>

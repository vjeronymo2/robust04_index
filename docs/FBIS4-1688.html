A Foreign Ministry spokesman of the DPRK today said that the  DPRK's nuclear issue "is not at all an issue to be discussed by  the Security Council," the official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN"  reported.    The statement is a product of the U.S. policy of being  hostile to the DPRK and strangling the country, he said, adding  that the United States has "taken advantage of the UN Security  council" to bring pressure to bear upon the DPRK.    In a statement issued in New York on March 31, President of  the UN Security Council Jean-Bernard Merimee urged the DPRK to  allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete  its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities.    The spokesman said the statement has seriously violated the  purposes and principles of the UN Charter because the Security  Council discussed the DPRK's nuclear issue just after the IAEA  had made "an improper and biased" conclusion of its inspection.    He stressed that since his country is now at the temporary  stage of not pulling out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,  it is "totally unreasonable" for the DPRK to undergo an  additional inspection.    He warned that if the United States continues to break its  promises and bring pressure to bear upon the DPRK, the country  will have to resume the "peaceful nuclear activities" which it  had ceased unilaterally during the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The DPRK has been taking the stand of peacefully solving the  nuclear issue and any pressure exerted on the country will  surely end in failure, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The press service of  the Russian State Duma has released the full text of a statement  by the Russian Federation State Duma in connection with events  in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Below is the full text of the statement:  <H5>  Statement by the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the </H5> Russian Federation    Deputies of the State Duma express deep alarm in connection  with the news of the air strikes in the area of Gorazde in  Bosnia- Herzegovina. In spite of the position of Russian members  of parliament, which has been expressed more than once in  official documents and deputies' speeches on the danger of using  military force in solving the conflict, a decision was adopted  to utilize military aviation, and furthermore without  preliminary consultations with Russia and other members of the  UN Security Council.    The use of NATO aviation has led to fresh casualties among  the Bosnian civilian population and has dealt a significant blow  to efforts aimed at solving the conflict by peaceful means.    The worsening of the situation in the area of Gorazde  testifies to serious inadequacies in the mechanism for adopting  and implementing decisions during the implementation of UN  peacekeeping operations. Peacekeeping operations should not be  used for the implementation of military actions on a bloc basis.    We are extremely concerned by NATO's continuing policy of  using force as a means for solving the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia. In light of what has happened the State Duma:    1. Condemns unilateral NATO acts of force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    2. Demands the immediate convening of the UN Security  Council to discuss the situation that has arisen as a result of  NATO's military interference in the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take measures to avert an escalation  of this explosive situation.    3. Calls on all the warring sides to end immediately the  bloodshed and to open negotiations on a total cease-fire.    4. Deems it essential that UN forces be urgently deployed  in the vicinity of Gorazde and that every measure be undertaken  to prevent provocations by any of the sides.    5. Demands that the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry  elaborates an active position on the creation of effective  machinery for the implementation of UN Security Council  resolutions so as to prevent in future the adoption of forcible  measures without the opinion of Russia being taken into account.    6. Recommends that the State Duma Committee on  International Affairs, the State Duma Committee on Defense, the  State Duma Committee on Geopolitical Issues and the State Duma  Committee on Security submit proposals that take Russia's  interests fully into account in the elaboration of the position  of the State Duma on the concept for Russia's interaction with  NATO.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After the Libyan withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip  in Chad, Colonel al-Qadhdhafi demanded that the French troops  stationed in Chad leave. He believes that their presence is no  longer justified. Paris does not agree. Minister Alain  Lamassoure explained this during the traditional question time  at the National Assembly:    [Begin Lamassoure recording] After this withdrawal, an  agreement, a treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed by  Chad and Libya, and we also welcomed this. The French troops  currently in Chad -- what is called the Epervier operation,  consisting of 800 men -- are there as a result of an agreement  made with the Chad Government. That government has not asked  France to modify its operation. Given that fact and given the  precariousness of the situation in the country and in the  region, there are no plans either to modify and certainly not to  reduce this operation for the moment. [end recording]    The French minister for European affairs was answering  questions this afternoon in place of the foreign minister who is  currently in Germany. [passage omitted]</p>

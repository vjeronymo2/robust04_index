			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man was in critical condition Tuesday night at Mercy Hospital after being  shot in the neck by a police officer who believed the man was trying to run him  over in a City Heights parking lot, police said.  </P> <P> The officer, whose identity was not available, saw a car he suspected was  stolen in a parking lot at Modesto and Juniper streets shortly after 2 p.m.  Tuesday. After running a license-plate check, which confirmed that the car was  stolen, the officer approached the driver, police spokesman Dave Cohen said.  </P> <P> The driver suddenly backed out of a parking space and gunned his engine, Cohen  said, leading the officer to believe the driver was trying to run him down.  </P> <P> The officer fired two shots at the car as it came toward him, then dived out of  the way. Cohen said at least one shot hit the driver in the neck.  </P> <P> Police said the car left the parking lot, turning onto Juniper Street and  continuing to Sumac Drive, where the driver staggered out, bleeding heavily.  The man walked about 100 yards before collapsing on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> Mercy Hospital spokeswoman Laura Avalone said the driver, who was in his 20s,  underwent surgery and was in critical condition.  </P></p>

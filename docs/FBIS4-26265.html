			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Watch Out for Li Teng-Hui's Words and Deeds </F> About `Taiwan Independence'"]    [Text] In a lengthy talk with Japanese writer Ryotaro Shiba  (Terukazu Fukuda) in March this year, Li Teng-hui expressed many  views unheard before. The most conspicuous ones are: First,  the Kuomintang is a "immigrant political power," and second,  "the term `China' is ambiguous." In addition he repeatedly  stressed the grief of the Taiwan people. These remarks would  not be surprising if they had been made by one advocating Taiwan  independence, but they were made by none other than Li Teng-hui,  the Kuomintang chairman and Taiwan's supreme leader, to a  Japanese writer who stubbornly adheres to a militarist stand, so  they cannot but arouse great public concern.    Though their conversation was casual, its theme was quite  clear: Li tried to deny the existence of China and that Taiwan  is a part of China. He even went so far as to consider himself  a "Moses" who will deliver the Taiwan people "from Egypt." What  he implied was understood. Since Li is Taiwan's supreme leader,  with real power in his hands, if his political and historical  philosophy were to be put into practice, it would bring disaster  to Taiwan.    Li made a glaring mistake in logic and in practice by  describing the Kuomintang as an "immigrant political power," as  he himself is Kuomintang chairman, as well as Taiwan's  president. He was elected by the "national congress," which  together with Kuomintang moved to Taiwan from the mainland in  1949, and he was promoted as "vice president" by Chiang  Ching-kuo after he had served the "immigrant political power"  for many years. Li described the Kuomintang as an "immigrant  political power" in order to deny the rationality of the  political power. By doing so, however, he debased his own power  and denied the rationality of the Taiwan authorities. This  might be a reason why principal media in Taiwan did not report  the interview.    His attempt to deny the existence of China is both  ridiculous  and lamentable. The concept of China or the Chinese nation is  clearly defined, which no clown like Ryotaro Shiba can deny. In  the early period of this century, China suffered from domestic  trouble and foreign invasion, including the invasion of Taiwan  by Japanese militarists, but all this is gone, never to return.  China now is marching toward modernization, and no one can  prevent its rise from oblivion. China is now an important,  widely respected member of the international community, and the  Chinese nation never has been so united as it is today. The  attempt by a few people who alienate themselves from the Chinese  nation, forget their own origins, and sing a duet with those  disgraceful foreigners who are trying to bring imperialism back  to life can be compared only to a mayfly trying to shake against  a giant tree. They ridiculously overrate themselves.    The conversation reflected Li's gloomy ideas in his heart of  hearts. It absolutely was no accident that he chose Ryotaro  Shiba as his partner in conversation, nor was it that he  repeatedly beautified the Japanese invaders' rule over Taiwan.  He impudently alleged that "Taiwan independence" would lead to  "Tibet and Xinjiang independence," "making it very difficult for  Beijing to establish a greater Asia Chinese nation [da zhong hua  min zu ya zhou 1129 0022 5478 3046 2469 0068 3166]." For the  leader of the Taiwan authorities to express such a view cannot  but arouse great concern among the people on both sides of the  Taiwan Straits. Since the end of the Cold War, civil war has  broken out in a number of countries, such as Bosnia-Hercegovina  in Europe, Georgia in the Near East, and most recently in Yemen.  The international community is loath to see such turbulence  because it can only plunge the people into misery and suffering,  and endanger regional security. This also teaches the people of  other countries how social security and territorial integrity  are important to them. The area of Taiwan is only 35,000 square  meters and its economy is of a sea-island type. Taiwan's  current economic and social situations have not come easily. It  is extremely irresponsible for a person in power to separate  Taiwan from the mainland because such an act is against the  interests of the Chinese nation, including the Taiwan people,  and against the current trend of peace and development.    If the person in power resorts to the former colonialist and  foreign forces in trying to split the country, he will drag  Taiwan into an abyss and stand condemned through the ages.  People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits must maintain high  vigilance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 April, Kashi Prefecture cracked down on a  number of criminals, thus contributing to efforts to maintain  social order and to deter lawless elements.    In view of the fact that the felony crime rate has been on  the rise in the last few years, courts at all levels of Kashi  Prefecture have been resolute and have shown no mercy in  clamping down on crime. On 14 April, a total of 47 criminals  involved in 34 cases that have taken place since 1993 were  sentenced in Kashi city, Shufu County, Jiashi County, Markit  County, Shache County, and Yecheng County. Eleven criminals,  including Abudu Kelimu, Abuli Miti, and Aishan Tuoxun, were  executed for intended manslaughter or for robbing taxis, acts  which had a very bad social influence. Another 36 criminals  were sentenced to various prison terms of at least one year for  rape, stealing, swindling, intentionally causing injuries to  others, kidnapping, or illegally detaining other persons.</p>

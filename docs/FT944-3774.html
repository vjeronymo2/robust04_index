			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Israel, Jordan open embassies Israel and Jordan yesterday opened their respective embassies in Amman and Tel Aviv hotel suites, setting the seal on their October 26 peace treaty. Jordan is the second Arab state after Egypt to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel. The ceremony in Amman's Forte Grand Hotel provoked a demonstration by more than 400 protesters, who burned an Israeli flag outside the prime minister's office. Moslem and left-wing militants condemned the opening as 'a black day'. But Mr Yoav Biran, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's deputy director-general for Middle East affairs, said he hoped the Jordanian initiative would inspire Syria and Lebanon to complete the peace process. The first ambassadors are expected to present their credentials early in the new year. Four Lebanese Moslem guerrillas and one Israeli soldier were killed yesterday in an exchange of fire near the South Lebanese town of Marjayoun. A military spokesman in Jerusalem said five other Israelis were wounded.</p>

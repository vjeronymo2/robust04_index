			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gordan Nuhanovic: "The Will of the Voters Has </F> Been Deceived"]    [Text] Whether the voters will recognize in the most recent  amendments and supplements to the Law on Election of Deputies to  the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia a fundamental betrayal  of their will in the recent elections in August 1992 has at  least become a question because the most recent legislative  amendment destroyed the so-called principle of the first  unelected deputy on the state election slate. Some legal experts  see in that enactment, which no longer exists, a legal loophole  that cannot be filled by any authentic legal interpretations,  but the present article, which was supposed to resolve the  perplexity, seems to have managed in a very subtle way to ignore  the will of the voters when it comes to deputies listed on the  government slates.    Because rotation into various positions in the government is  altogether normal among parliamentary deputies of the incumbent  party, their alternates are coming to take their places in the  parliament. While the law is altogether clear about deputies who  come to the parliament elected as candidates in their own  electoral units, because every candidate had as his alternate a  specific individual, deputies elected on the government slates  were deprived of that unambiguous provision in the law. The  election law tried to solve the problem of the "alternates" of  deputies elected on government slates "by personal replacement  of deputies from the government slate." When Mladen Vedris gave  up his deputy's seat, his place was taken by Simun Saulic, who  ran as the 36th candidate on the government slate of the  Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. When he gave up his seat to  take a post which was incompatible with being a deputy, he was  replaced by Borislav Beslic, the 37th deputy on the government  list of the HDZ. Thus, for all practical purposes Beslic  replaced two deputies, but only one deputy seat was made vacant  when the duties of deputy ceased to be performed. In exactly the  same way, Dr. Boris Segota, 40th candidate on the government  list of the HDZ, is the alternate of Dr. Jurje Njavra, who in  this legal arrangement should have been replaced by Vesna  Girardi- Jurkic, M.A., who is now a minister and who because of  her post in the government also had to take a leave of absence  from her office of deputy. Boris Segota, whom we mentioned, just  like Beslic, freed only one deputy's seat when he left the  office of deputy, in spite of the fact that he was the  replacement of two deputies. This example taken at random of  deputies elected on the government slate best illustrates the  shortcoming of the so-called pairing of deputies and their  alternates, because it is quite certain that should the reasons  disappear for the deputy's leave of absence, some of the persons  mentioned above might simply be put in a position of not being  able to call upon the law. The practice of "pairing" also ceases  to have meaning in case of an election success, that is, as was  the case of the incumbent party, whose government slate obtained  31 seats in the August election. Each government slate has 60  candidates for deputy, so that every candidate of the HDZ who  was elected did not have his personal alternate, because the HDZ  slate would have had to have 62 candidates for deputy so that  each would have his alternate.    Nevertheless, in the amendments and supplements we have  mentioned to the Law on Election of Deputies to the Assembly,  the Committee for Legislation, a well-known working body of the  Assembly, instead of overcoming this legal loophole, has  actually "taken a step backward." In the final version, the  paragraph of Article 1 of the amendments and supplements to the  Law on Election of Deputies to the Assembly reads: "A deputy  elected on the state slate who accepts a post incompatible with  the office of deputy shall be replaced by that unelected  candidate on the government slate on which the deputy was  elected, to be determined by the political party whose  government slate is in question." This seemingly harmless legal  wording, say some of the legal experts, essentially disavows in  its last clause ("...to be determined by the political party  whose government slate is in question") the election slate and  instead of the "personal replacement" inaugurates a so-called  intraparty consensus as to appointment of the replacement of  deputies whose seats have been vacated. Thus, on the basis of  this legal wording, which has been adopted, the possibility is  opened de jure, for example, for the incumbent party, to which  that amendment of the law pertains the most, to promote as  replacement for a deputy who has taken a government post a  candidate who on the government slate of the HDZ was, say, 58th,  while at the same time a large number of candidates ahead of him  on the state slate would simply be ignored. In the opinion of  those who have a superb knowledge of election law, that  amendment, obviously imposed on the Assembly, infringes the  political will of the electorate. In voting for candidates on  the government slates, the voters were guided by the order  presented from one to 60, and in presenting the candidates, the  party took care to put at the top those individuals it felt  should be those who would carry the slate. Thus, the sacred will  of the voters has in a sense been neglected. It is difficult to  escape the impression that the most recent amendment to the law  on election of deputies to the House of Representatives is  actually being used to pay off old intraparty scores in the  incumbent party, whereby a small group of people is legally  keeping away from the benches of parliament "undesired"  alternates, that is, candidates who ran on government slates.  The very bitter debate that developed over adoption of this  amendment to the law distinctly indicates how essential this  relatively unassuming paragraph of the law is to its initiators  and proponents, a paragraph which along with everything else  opens up the possibility of manipulating some of the deputies  and their alternates on the government slate. Leaving it to the  party to decide who will be a member of parliament makes things  cloudy in political life and, just like the institution of  abeyance of the deputy seat, sets a certain precedent concerning  the parliamentary benches in the House of Representatives.</p>

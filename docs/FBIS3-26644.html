Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat and chairman of the CCCMPS, said: This year is  extremely critical for accelerating the establishment of a  socialist market economy. This year, maintaining political  stability and social security become even more arduous, as does  the comprehensive management of public security. Therefore, the  responsibility on our shoulders is heavier than before. It is  necessary to have a clear understanding of this situation. With  a high sense of responsibility for the party and the people,  each and every department should play its own role and work hard  to ensure the accomplishment of the task.    Shu Huaide, member of the CCCMPS and secretary general of  the  Central Commission on Politics and Law [CCPL], conveyed the  guiding spirit of the CPC Central Committee leading comrades.  Chen Jiping, vice secretary general of the CCPL, member of the  CCCMPS, and director of the CCCMPS general office, gave an  explanation on the "Key Points of the 1994 Comprehensive  Management of Public Security Work" and the "Opinions Concerning  Further Strengthening the Work of Arranging Jobs for and Helping  and Teaching Personnel Who Are Released After Serving Their  Sentences or Being Released From Labor Education Institutions"  jointly forwarded by the CCCMPS and five ministries and bureaus.  He also gave a briefing on the plan for setting up positions  for special inspectors. CCCMPS members who attended the meeting  examined these two documents. Relevant departments exchanged  ideas about their plans for carrying out their work this year.    Ren Jianxin affirmed the results achieved in the work of  comprehensive management of public security over the past year  in maintaining social stability and safeguarding the drive of  reform, opening up, and modernization. He said: "Paying equal  attention to material and spiritual civilization construction"  is a basic principle for establishing socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always iterated the  great importance of this principle, as has the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. It is a common  task for the whole party to conscientiously carry out this  principle and correctly handle the dialectical relations between  the drive of reform, opening up, and economic development on one  hand and political stability and social security on the other.  The task is particularly important for major leading comrades  of party and government organs at all levels. Therefore, the  responsibility system for carrying out comprehensive management  of public security should be strictly enforced.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: Facing new conditions and problems,  party committees and governments at all levels as well as the  CCCMPS should further improve their work style and leadership,  go deep into the reality of life, immerse themselves among the  masses, conduct more investigations and studies, and know how to  find outstanding problems affecting political stability and  social security as well as those security problems strongly  criticized by the people. They should pay close attention to  weak links in the comprehensive management of public security  and take timely measures to conscientiously solve them. It is  imperative to strengthen the analysis of the social security  situation; study the development trend of public security  problems under the new situation; and formulate effective  measures for cracking down on crimes, prevention, education,  management, and other aspects so as to control the initiative in  the struggle.    He said: In carrying out the comprehensive management of  public security, it is necessary to further liberate our way of  thinking. The most fundamental thing is to follow the mass line  in carrying out specialized work and fully mobilize the  enthusiasm of the great masses of the people, all circles in  society, and relevant departments. It is necessary to  strengthen giving publicity to comprehensive management of  public security and better mobilize and organize the people to  participate in this work.    Ren Jianxin emphatically said: It is imperative to bring  into full play each department's functions in maintaining social  stability so as to show the effectiveness of joint efforts.  Only when the force of all sectors has been condensed and their  work is well coordinated can the special advantage of  comprehensive management be really demonstrated.    Ren Jianxin said: The work should be focussed on grass-roots  units where all measures are expected to be conscientiously  carried out. Grass-roots units' basic work in comprehensive  management of public security should be strengthened this year  through a major project for improving public security in public  and complex places in urban and rural areas. The building of  party organs at village, township, and neighborhood level should  be strengthened. Great results should be achieved in two or  three years so that all measures of comprehensive management of  public security will truly blossom and bear fruits in  grass-roots units.    Also attending the meeting were CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Zhang  Siqing and Cao Zhi.</p>

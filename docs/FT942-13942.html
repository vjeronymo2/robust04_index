			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Leading Article: Lloyds' capital deployed The idea that banks might have too much capital for their own good or for the good of the banking system appears entirely counter-intuitive. Capital is, after all, the banks' ultimate cushion against loss. Yet banking history is littered with cases where excess capital has had a corrosive effect on prudential discipline and encouraged managers to over-expand loan books or engage in injudicious takeovers. The banking authorities have thus had good reason to worry about the growing possibility that the UK clearing banks might become over-capitalised. And they can probably take comfort from the fact that Lloyds, the most prolific generator of retained profits, has found a way of disposing of capital that does not appear to pose any obvious systemic threat. One of the Bank of England's concerns has been that clearing banks have been slow to drop their hurdle rates of return in a period of relatively low inflation. High nominal returns against a disinflationary background can only be achieved by taking exceptional risks, assuming that the banks are already exploiting existing profit opportunities in the less competitive areas of their business to the full. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's return on equity last year was around 16.5 per cent. With Lloyds paying 2.1 times book value for the society, that return will shrink to a little over 8 per cent. Goodwill element This is a long way short of the target rates of return Lloyds was widely assumed to be looking for. And while the return will be enhanced by a further year's earnings by the time Lloyds comes to lay out the money in the second quarter of 1995 if the deal goes ahead, the regulators can feel that the balance of risk and reward looks sensible. The Pounds 936m goodwill element of the Pounds 1.8bn purchase price looks high, at first sight, in relation to Lloyds shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.1bn. But it will probably more than halve on the basis of current year retained earnings alone. Compared with most other potential investments available to a clearing bank, the acquisition looks good from both Lloyds' and the authorities' points of view. Whether it is an appropriate way to dispose of assets held in mutual ownership is more controversial. A reduction in building society numbers through takeovers by outsiders is unobjec-tionable. With a 68 per cent home ownership rate in Britain, the building society movement's mission is substantially fulfilled. Nor will there be any great change in the shape of Britain's high streets. The two parties to the deal have largely complementary operations; and since Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's cost-income ratio is little more than half the industry average, the scope for rationalisation is unlikely to be very great. Yet the price being offered to building society members - a price earnings multiple substantially below Abbey National's current rating - looks far lower than could have been achieved for a comparable transaction in an open capital market. Arbitrage opportunity In effect Lloyds is exploiting an arbitrage opportunity between different forms of ownership. The minimal accountability that goes with mutuality entrenches the position of management, at the expense of the owner. The cost to the owners is the shortfall of the bank's offer against what the society would fetch if it operated in a proper market for corporate control. Yet it seems a little unlikely that society investors and borrowers, who have been pleasantly surprised to be promised an average of Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 500 respectively, will make a big fuss about exit price earnings ratios - though it is worth noting that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is noted for having courted financially sophisticated customers. There is little reason to worry about a takeover on competition grounds. The resulting joint share of the mortgage market, at 7 per cent, scarcely looks worrying. Yet the fact that a society has had to contemplate changing ownership to obtain a lower cost of funds should give the Treasury pause for thought in its current review of building society legislation. Easier access to wholesale funds and a less cumbersome process for outside takeovers for building societies looks desirable in an increasingly integrated financial services market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department appreciates the difficulties of enforcing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards when multiple zones exist in a single State. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has specifically listed those local governments in the higher wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zones in each State. Depending on the facts surrounding the sale of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured home, both the manufacturer and the dealer will be responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for assuring that the home will be in compliance with the standards by siting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the home in the proper zone. The State Administrative Agencies (SAAs) will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of the changes resulting from this rule and will assist the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department in discovering homes that are sited in noncompliance with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Anchoring and Tie-Downs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The change in lease communities could be revolutionary, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homes become more permanent in nature (122) and homes are taxed more as real,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than personal, property. Generally, lessors are required to restore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the site to its original condition when they move. This requirement, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relocation of utility connections, would be made more difficult with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent foundations. In addition, the FHA Title II allowance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation would not be sufficient for the additional costs of permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foundations (146, and others).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has evaluated these comments and has removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the design requirement for a permanent foundation. However, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains concerned that some form of strengthened tiedown system may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to protect homes adequately in high wind areas. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department will be reviewing the issue of permanent foundations and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthened anchoring systems in conjunction with regulatory action on wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistant design and construction requirements for the remainder of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The impact of the new Wind Standards can be adversely effected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if there is inadequate enforcement and monitoring of the placement of homes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure that only homes that have been designed for the wind load requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Zone are permitted to be sited. There is a need for better local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection; the home is only as good as its anchoring system (149). There is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling evidence that much of the damage from Hurricane Andrew was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the lax enforcement of State and local building codes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including anchoring requirements, rather than to inadequate standards (80,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 122). Similarly, the main problem with manufactured homes is the proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of anchoring equipment, which the Department cannot regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (100).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the use of tiedowns was widespread in the areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by Hurricane Andrew, indicating some attempt to comply with codes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tiedowns generally performed very poorly. None of the tiedowns observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was certified in accordance with code requirements. The Department is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the authority to regulate installation of manufactured homes and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploring ways to encourage States and localities to adopt and enforce more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent anchoring requirements. The Department also is reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate methods, including a disclosure requirement, to inform consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the installation of the home in a manner that achieves the highest wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection performance for the home's design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meanwhile, the Department will be contacting the Governors of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, and in particular States where the wind risk is the greatest, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advise the Governors of the changes in the wind standards and the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each State to establish installation standards and a system of enforcement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Typical ground anchors performed adequately in Hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Andrew (14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and others). If given enough time, ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchor manufacturers can develop an anchoring system that is comparable to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent foundation system (29).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With very few exceptions, manufactured homes in the path of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hurricane Andrew were destroyed by the resulting wind forces. The lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate attachment of single or double-wide units to ground anchors was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major factor in loss of units. The chassis of some units could be found some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance away from their original site. However, in some cases the anchors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did hold the floor of the unit down while the ``box'' of the structure was torn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> away by the high winds. For this reason, there is justification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the strength of the structure by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date of these new requirements will now be at least 180  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days from today. The Department agrees that innovative anchoring systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable to permanent foundations systems can be developed; however, anchor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers are cautioned regarding the resistance capacity of auger-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchors presently used for installing manufactured homes, when those anchors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to high winds and ensuing saturated soil conditions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's tests show substantially less resistance than required by 24 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3280.306(f), even when tested under dry soil conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Substantially increased siting requirements would be a problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially for retirees in land-lease communities and for minority owners who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reside on ``heir property'' and cannot secure clear title to their site (672).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Alternative anchoring systems that are expected to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required resistance to high wind forces are already available in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market. The Department believes that if siting requirements are increased by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local governments, the manufactured housing industry will likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop ways to accommodate siting in land-lease communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

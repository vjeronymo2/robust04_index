			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK bank starts criminal action to recoup Bombay losses STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international bank, yesterday said it was launching criminal proceedings in India to try to recover Rs9.04bn (Pounds 162m) from brokers and others it believes defrauded it through the securities market there. Among those implicated in the criminal action is expected to be one of India's most influential financiers, Mr Bhupen Dalal, along with brokers connected to Mr Dalal and his broking firm, Bhupen Champaklal Devidas. The amount sought by Standard is higher than the total potential exposure of Pounds 100m it has admitted before. However, it holds securities which it believes cover its claims on Bank of Karad, a tiny Indian bank which owes it some Pounds 65m and which is in the process of being wound up. The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, had put its total exposure at some Pounds 200m. Standard Chartered announced its action following a meeting in London on Thursday between Mr Rodney Galpin and Mr Malcolm Williamson, its chairman and chief executive, and Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank said that, from what it had so far seen, it was satisfied that Standard Chartered's Pounds 50m provision against possible losses was adequate. In a separate move to shore up the liquidity of its Indian operations, Standard Chartered said it had transferred funds into the country. Standard Chartered had earlier been in negotiation with Mr Dalal and others to try to reach a settlement over the affair. However, it is believed to have come under pressure from the Reserve Bank to launch criminal actions in conjunction with India's Central Bureau of Investigation. Mr Dalal will be the second prominent Indian financier implicated in the affair, following the arrest last week of Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker. Unlike Mr Mehta - who achieved instant cult status last year for his bold investments - Mr Dalal has spent two decades building up a reputation as one of the country's most discrete and influential financiers. Those likely to be implicated in the criminal proceedings include Mr Hiten Dalal, a distant cousin of Mr Bhupen Dalal, and Mr A D Narottam, a former senior executive in Mr Bhupen Dalal's broking firm. Both were identified in a report into the affair by the Reserve Bank ten days ago, and have since had their assets seized by a government-appointed custodian. The action is also likely to take in Mr J P Gandhi, said to be an uncle of Mr Bhupen Dalal and head of his firm's government securities dealing. Last night the CBI raided the home and office in Bombay of Mr V B Desai, a broker linked to the Bank of Karad, and two offices of Union Commercial Bank, which has also been linked to the scandals. Mr Bhupen Dalal is well-known to Indian expatriate investors, having been instrumental in persuading the authorities to develop special investment accounts for non-resident Indians. Last month he travelled to London to promote India's biggest share sale, a Rs12.5bn issue for the Mangalore oil refinery. Among his clients are members of the Birla family, one of India's leading business clans, whose companies include Grasim and the IndoGulf group. Mr Dalal has expanded out of broking in the past decade, establishing in Cifco one of the small number of financial services groups which have been set up to take advantage of the liberalisation of India's financial markets. State Bank of India, the country's biggest commercial bank, is to make a provision of Rs7.07bn against possible losses from the scandal. The decision was taken at a special board meeting on Thursday evening, called after the Reserve Bank had put pressure on it to set up the provision. The decision could weaken the position of ANZ Grindlays, which has so far resisted calls from the Reserve Bank for it to provide against a possible liability of Rs4bn. Both State Bank and Grindlays paid cheques made out in their own names into accounts they maintained for Mr Harshad Mehta.</p>

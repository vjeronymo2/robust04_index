			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Help yourself to after-hours banking Customers can serve themselves from dawn until the late hours at new service terminals installed by Siemens Nixdorf for Nationwide Building Society's new Touchlink branch in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The eight terminals designed by the German computer company will allow people to draw out and deposit cash and cheques, check the state of their accounts and pay bills from 6am until 11pm seven days a week. Customers need a card or a passbook to use the customer service terminals. A special terminal can be used by customers in wheelchairs. The terminals are personal computer-based and can be easily linked to existing networks. Banks and building societies can build up their own functions for the system. Nationwide: UK, 0793 455199.

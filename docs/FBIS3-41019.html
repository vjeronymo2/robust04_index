			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent; ITAR-TASS transmits a </F> service message at 1542 GMT killing the following item]    [Excerpt] Rome, 28 Jan -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of  the Russian Government, who is on a visit, acquainted himself  today with the report from Tehran that Kazakhstan is changing  its stance on the elimination of the nuclear weapons on its  territory. Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Government's  press service, said this in an exclusive interview with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent.    V. Sergeyev said that "the Russian premier expresses his  doubts that the statement made by the Kazakhstan ambassador to  Iran reflects the official position of Almaty. All the more so  since Kazakhstan has not informed the Russian Government about  such a change in its position. Viktor Chernomyrdin will have  the opportunity to meet Nursultan Nazarbayev at the World  Economic Forum in Davos, to which they have both been invited.  Anyway, such issues should be resolved through talks with all  the interested parties participating, including Russia, and not  in a unilateral manner."

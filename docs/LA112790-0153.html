The crew was airlifted to the Santa Barbara  Municipal Airport at 9:22 p.m. and released.  </P> <P> Toledo said that the three crew members were located by a Coast Guard jet at  6:50 p.m. and that a helicopter dispatched from the guard's San Francisco base  picked the survivors up a short time later.  </P> <P> One of the survivors was in the water when they were spotted. He was aided by a  Coast Guard rescuer, who was lowered from the helicopter.  </P> <P> Toledo said that it was not immediately known why the hull split but that the  boat, which sank about 60 miles west of the Channel Islands, was tossed about  in 15-foot swells and 40-knot winds shortly before it went down.  </P></p>

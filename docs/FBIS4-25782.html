			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's top judge, Ren  Jianxin, today called for the country's courts to learn from how  other countries' courts function.    The president of the Supreme People's Court, in a written  text conveyed to a national judicial conference on foreign  affairs now being held here, suggested that from other  countries' experiences, courts could learn how better to fulfil  the tasks laid on them by China's Constitution.    China has established ties with courts from nearly 100  countries and regions, and international organizations such as  the International Court, according to the conference.    In the past ten years, the supreme court sent 125  delegations  of 429 people abroad for visits, and received 113 delegations of  554 members, the sources said.    Ren Jianxin said such foreign affairs work has helped to  promote China's judicial exchanges with other countries, and win  understanding and support from the international community.</p>

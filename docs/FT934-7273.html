			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accountants have skills now Sir, Sir Geoffrey Owen's article in your Accountancy Column (November 18) is a welcome contribution to the debate on the role of accountants in business life. He and his colleagues at the London School of Economics correctly identify the need for accountants actively engaged in business management to be trained for total management, as opposed to the narrower traditions of accountancy. The fact is, however, that the 'five most important skills' he identifies as necessary for the future are all catered for already, with precision, by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. The whole ethos of our training is towards producing versatile people trained as management accountants and equipped to hold senior management positions. Among their basic working tools is the ability, as part of management, to provide and manage information, financial and non-financial, gathered from inside and outside the business as the basis for fundamental business decisions. It is no accident that British Airways, which has just been presented with the CIMA Training Award, now relies almost wholly upon CIMA training for its graduate accountancy recruits.

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Duracell climbs in quarter DURACELL, the battery company taken private by a leveraged buyout in 1988 and then refloated on the stock market last year, saw after-tax profits of Dollars 23.4m in the three months to June 30, against a Dollars 71.4m loss in the same period a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The quarter is the last of Duracell's financial year, and it takes profits for the 12 months to Dollars 127.8m, compared with a Dollars 34.2m loss last time. Part of the advance comes from sharply lower interest charges - Dollars 17.3m for the quarter against Dollars 37m last time, and Dollars 80.3m for the 12 months, compared with Dollars 186.3m.</p>

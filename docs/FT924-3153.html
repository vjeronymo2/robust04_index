			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Butte accounts not ready for 1992 AGM BUTTE MINING, which is claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 214m) in the US against more than 70 former advisers, directors and investors, has told shareholders its accounts for the year to end-June will not be ready until next month but the Companies Act requires it to hold an annual meeting in 1992. Consequently, the company has arranged its meeting for December 29, to be followed by an extraordinary meeting early next year to receive and adopt the accounts. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said that Ernst &amp; Young, formerly Butte's auditors, resigned after being named as defendants in the US law suit and have been replaced by Arthur Andersen. Substantial new work on the accounts was being carried out and it had not proved possible to prepare them in time for this year's annual meeting.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Greek bank governor resigns Greece's central bank governor, Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, resigned at the weekend in response to pressures from the new socialist government. Mr Christodoulou, a former economy minister appointed by the previous conservative government, said he was stepping down to make way for someone 'closer to the government's political conviction'. Although the socialists had been expected to sack Mr Christodoulou because of his close connections with the opposition New Democracy party, the timing of his departure was a surprise. The favourite to take over as central bank governor is Mr Ioannis Boutos, another former economy minister who is close to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.</p>

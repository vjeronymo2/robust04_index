			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of PLO Executive </F> Committee -- read by announcer]    [Text] Rabin's government bears the responsibility for  destroying the foundations on which the peace process had  embarked, particularly that the head of the Israeli Government  was the first one to declare that the dates of the agreement  were not sacred.    Since the Oslo agreement, Israel has been submitting  proposals which contradicted the core and the articles of the  agreements in all areas of security, administration and economy;  a matter that might result in an organized form of occupation  instead of ending it.    The Israeli side to the negotiations proposes limited and  restricted prerogatives for the Palestinian police force. It  also proposes a map of the withdrawal from Gaza Strip that will  in fact lead to the enlargement of the settlements, as this map  stretches to 13 kms along the Palestinian coast and other area  in parallel to the Green Line. This is done to weaken and  marginalize the role of the Palestinian authority; and to  maintain the control of the occupation in a camouflaged way.    These Israeli stances and proposals are responsible for a  lack of a real progress in the negotiations, and for reaching  the date of 13 April without achieving any results; contrary to  the claims of the government of Rabin that is trying to blame  this delay on the PLO.    The Palestinian position, expressed following the Hebron  massacre and the suspension of negotiations, is not the reason  behind the lack of progress. On the contrary, the facts confirm  that Israel's measures, taken in the aftermath of the massacre  by imposing wide-ranging sanctions against the Palestinian  people represented in the imposition of a curfew, an economic  embargo, acts of killings committed by forces of occupation in  Hebron and Gaza, and especially the assassination of six cadres  from the PLO's militants are responsible for such a delay of  progress.    All this represents the real reason behind a delay in the  negotiations; and behind stripping them from any seriousness and  credibility. The Israeli proposals, currently submitted on the  negotiating table in Cairo, continue to revolve around the same  framework, i.e., they aim to strip the agreement of the  transitional phase from its content; and a replace the  withdrawal with new forms of occupation and hegemony.    The government of Israel bears responsibility for the  quasi-impasse that the peace negotiations have reached. There  are no indications that point to the serious desire of the  Israeli Government to reach a fundamental progress during the  coming weeks. The PLO will deal with this situation from the  point of view of our experience in the negotiations of the past  months and the negative results that we have reached, to protect  the interests and rights to our people; and to establish the  peace process on serious and effective foundations.</p>

The prime minister  intends to set up a private advisory body next spring, at the  earliest, with the task of fully studying ways to formulate  Japan's comprehensive security. The idea is surfacing that the  "basic defense buildup plans" aimed at maintaining Japan's  necessary minimum defense capability in peace time, a  fundamental philosophy of the current "Guideline," should be  replaced with new defense buildup plans which are in tune with  the relaxed international tensions. With the prime minister  deciding to replace the current "Guideline" with a new one,  Japan's defense buildup plans based on the current "Guideline"  that was set in 1976, will face a turning point.    The current "Guideline" features a call for the shift from  the conventional defense plans designed to cope with external  threat to the "basic defense buildup plans." An attached table  of the "Guideline" set the fixed number of troops for the Ground  Self-Defense Force at 180,000, and mainstay military hardware  and organizations for three services of the Self-Defense Forces.    Former Prime Minister Miyazawa announced that his government  would review the current "Guideline" in 1995, but he did not  think of changing the basic defense buildup plans.    Prime Minister Hosokawa has been eager to set the direction  of reviewing the current "Guideline" as soon as possible in  light of the dramatically changed international situation  following the collapse of the Cold War structure.    The Defense Agency [DA] has already inaugurated the "Study  Group for Discussion of Japan's Defense in the 21st Century"  consisting of pundits in various fields with the intention of  compiling a defense budget for fiscal year 1996 based on a new  guideline. The DA, which set up a research council consisting of  defense experts, originally planned to place the council under  the Defense Agency director general, but it later decided to  shelve the plan and cooperate with the prime minister by  "elevating" the council to a private advisory body for him.    The prime minister envisions the private advisory body as a  body like the Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa  Council, says a government source). A plan is under examination  to organize the private advisory body with a dozen former DA  officials and Foreign Ministry officials. Former Defense Agency  Vice Minister Seiki Nishihiro is surfacing as a member of the  body.</p>

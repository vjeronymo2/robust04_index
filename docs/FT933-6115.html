			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Public to be involved in war against crime POLICE AUTHORITIES are to be given a new and specific duty to involve the public in the fight against crime, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said yesterday. His comment came after a Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph found three-quarters of those questioned believed vigilante action was sometimes justified. The poll also found widespread dissatisfaction with the way crime is handled by the police and the criminal justice system. The Tories see tough action to tackle crime as a key part of efforts to restore their political fortunes but the survey showed that there was little belief their plans would have much effect. Only 15 per cent believed that promises to get tough on law and order in the coming months would have any impact on crime. Mr Howard will also announce later this week the next phase of putting the running of prisons out to private-sector tenders. The move comes in spite of the critical report last week by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, on the Wolds remand jail  - Britain's first privately run prison. Ministers intend to make measures on law and order the centrepiece of the next parliamentary session. Apart from the bill to implement the government's conclusions on the Sheehy report on the police and the changes to police authorities, there will be a criminal justice bill, which will include tougher action against those who re-offend while on bail. The restructured police authorities will have to prepare plans giving local people a role in helping the police, for example through taking part in neighbourhood watch schemes or by becoming special constables. Mr Howard did not condone taking the law into one's own hands. He said on BBC radio: 'We do not want vigilantes but we do want vigilance.' Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the poll showed 'the huge sense of frustration and despair that underlies a lot of people's feelings towards the criminal justice system and towards rising crime'.</p>

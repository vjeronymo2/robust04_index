			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Virtually real democracy You are sitting at home, your hand near the remote con-trol device. A convicted murderer's face appears on the screen, top right corner. A voice asks whether the miscreant should or should not be executed. The text alongside reinforces the spoken message: 'To have your say, simply press Y or N' The unpleasant details of the killing, some recreated by computer imagery, have just been replayed for what seems like the thousandth time. You are reminded that if the public-access vote is 'Y' the supreme penalty will be exacted, in full view, just after the dinner hour. You reach across your snack tray and pick up the remote . . . The above little scene, some may protest, is a sub-Orwellian nightmare, unworthy of serious attention. Oh yes? Even in California? Sophisticated folk like us know that true democracy is a nonsense. It is the rule of the mob. Elites - that is, you and I - manage to stave off the mindless tyranny of the majority by a variety of means, the most effective of which is the pretence that periodic elections decide matters of importance. Modern government, even in its minimalist form, is so complicated that it would be impossible to consult the voters at every turn. Not so. Technology that could make the largest of countries function like a parish meeting already exists. In its most advanced form - a multimedia box connected by telephone line to everywhere - the necessary gadgetry is likely to become commonplace in middle-class homes by, shall we say, the turn of the century. Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, indicated yesterday that his company proposes to sell software that puts buyers in touch with catalogues, purveyors of financial snake-oil, electronic libraries, and that great stimulant of so many of our imaginations, the Internet. Mr Gates has made a huge success of Windows, the program that enables newcomers to understand computers. He might do well with his Microsoft Network. It is not evident that he has political applications in mind, but that makes no difference. Politics is already entwined in the Net. In the 1992 presidential election Mr Ross Perot promised electronic plebiscites. Last year President Bill Clinton stage-managed an 'electronic town hall', although without voting rights. His vice-president is starry-eyed about the whole business. If you have the necessary hardware you may embark on a virtual reality tour of the White House. Sophisticated chip-based devices were deployed in last week's mid-term elections, the ones in which the Democrats were so thoroughly worsted. In Minnesota candidates for the Senate conducted an on-line debate. Computer-access public interest groups have been established in Oregon, Ohio, Illinois, Florida and elsewhere. They are available on the World Wide Web, which can transmit text, moving pictures and sound. In California, nearly every candidate spent part of his or her campaign funds on digitising their messages. A nasty proposition, number 187, was overwhelmingly approved. It denies public services to illegal immigrants. Last year some Californians supported attempts to have TV cameras present at executions. Software companies have invented ways of identifying electors at their home screens, although it is not clear how this kind of electronically screened vote could be kept secret. Yet add it all up and my opening paragraph becomes less fanciful. Wired democracy is a popular notion. No wonder Mr Newt Gingrich, leader of the Republicans in the lower house, remarked after his party's recent victory that every bill or committee report filed in Washington would be put on line. It is important to keep hold of actual reality. Browsing through Profile, the FT's on-line library, I read that some 20-30m personal computers, in at least half the world's countries, are linked to the Internet. Yet the most advanced technology is probably possessed by say, between 2m and 3m PC owners. That probably defines the number of Americans who logged on to candidates' literature during the mid-term elections. Could it be that the Net is just another device for whiling away the long night hours? We have waves of the future come and go; none has yet drowned us. Satellite TV, cable, fibre-optics, the fax, the cordless telephone have been subsumed into our lives; none has become predominant. That said, I am not so sure that the gathering wave of 'electronic democracy' will recede. Voters everywhere are disillusioned with established parties and politicians. The temptation to travel back to ancient Athens via one of Mr Gates's icons may be irresistible. In Britain various think tanks and pressure groups have worried at the edges of the problem, without reaching much of a conclusion. Lean Democracy, a pamphlet published by Demos in the summer, discusses participatory models of wired decision-making. 'It is likely to take many years of experiment . . . to discover which methods of using technology entail which effects,' the prudent authors say. A discussion on referendums organised by Charter 88 a few weeks back could be summarised as concluding that they are all right if limited to constitutional issues or local matters. Demos, Charter 88 and the Labour-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research have all discussed citizens' juries, groups of public-spirited individuals who are prepared to sit and listen to professionals before pronouncing on the merits of this or that policy. The IPPR booklet, Citizens' Juries, by John Stewart, Elizabeth Kendall and Anna Coote was published last Thursday. It describes experiments in the US and Germany and proposes a trial run in Britain. Why not? An electronic referendum is a dangerous idea. Voters would decide on the basis of no knowledge, and flashy sound-bites. The poor may not have access to computers. Putting a citizens' jury on TV or an interactive net might be more attractive, if you could be certain that the participants paid attention. Meanwhile, we should think. The first picture of an Apple PC in the FT appeared in the late 1970s. It showed a child at the screen. Now grown up, she has presented me with a subscription to the Internet. That is how far home computing has travelled in about 16 years. We will experience the politics of this device well before another 16 have passed.</p>

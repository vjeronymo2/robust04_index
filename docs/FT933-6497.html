			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Upbeat view tempered by investment warning THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday raised its forecast of economic growth in Britain this year and next, but warned that sluggish investment and persistent current account and budget deficits could still upset recovery. The employers' group now expects that gross domestic product will increase by a real 1.7 per cent this year, after a 0.4 per cent decline last year, with growth accelerating to 3 per cent next year. This is in line with the most recent consensus forecast for UK economic growth this year, as measured by Consensus Economics, a consultancy. But the CBI is taking a more bullish view than the forecasters' average growth projection of 2.6 per cent for 1994. Its previous CBI forecast, published in May, predicted growth of 1.6 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year. Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI's director of economic affairs, said stronger consumer demand had prompted the upward revision of this year's forecast and this was offsetting the negative impact of slower growth in continental Europe. In its latest forecast, the CBI predicted: Continued strong manufacturing output, up 3.3 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent in 1994. Consumer spending rising 1.8 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next year. Exports of goods and services rising by about 5 per cent in volume this year and next. Company profits rising by a real 9.4 per cent this year and 4.1 per cent next year after declines of 4.7 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively in 1991 and 1992. Continuing low inflation, with the underlying rate (excluding mortgage interest rates) little changed at around 3 per cent at the end of next year and the 'headline' rate, including mortgages, rising to 3.3 per cent by the end of 1994 from below 1.5 per cent at present. The group said it was concerned that investment would lag the recovery, rising by just 0.6 per cent across the whole economy this year and 1.7 per cent in 1994. Although manufacturing investment is forecast to rise over the second part of this year, its average level over the whole year is still expected to be 1.4 per cent below last year's level. Even if investment grows as projected by 2.5 per cent, it will still be 11 per cent below the 1990 level. The CBI expects short-term interest rates to fall to 5 per cent from 6 per cent by the end of this year but then rise to 5.5 per cent by the end of 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE CBI EXPECTS THE ECONOMY TO GROW  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    % change of previous year                                  Outturns,                CBI                            1991 CSO data 1992     1993  forecast  1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total GDP (average   measure)                -2.3*          -0.4*     1.7             3.0 Manufacturing output      -5.3*          -0.8*     3.3             3.5 Consumer spending         -2.2*           0.0*     1.8             2.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fixed investment:         -9.9           -0.5      0.6             1.7   General government (a) -10.4           12.5      7.1             0.8   Manufacturing (b)       -9.4           -3.0     -1.4             2.5   Private dwellings      -16.7           -2.3     -1.3             3.1   Other (mainly private     services)             -8.4           -2.7      4.9             5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government   consumption              3.2            0.0     -0.8             1.0 Exports (goods and   services)                0.1            2.7      4.9             5.0 Imports (goods and   services)               -3.1            5.6      3.2             3.5 Current account (pounds   bn) (c)                 -7.7           -8.6    -17.5           -15.5 Stockbuilding (pounds bn) -3.4           -1.3     -1.2             0.6 Inflation (retail prices   index) (d)               4.2            3.0      1.7             3.3 Inflation (manufacturer's   output prices) (d)       5.0            3.3      3.6             3.5 Unemployment (millions)   (e, f)                   2.4            2.8      2.9             2.9 Company profits (g)       -4.7           -3.6      9.4             4.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1991-92        1992-93  1993-94         1994-95 PSBR (Pounds bn) (c)      13.7           36.5     46.4            41.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * revised figures yesterday  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (a)  Excluding purchases, less sales of land and existing building (b)  Including leased assets (c)  At current prices (d)  Fourth quarter (e)  UK, excluding school leavers, seasonally adjusted (f)  Annual average (g)  Gross pre-tax trading profit of industrial and commercial      companies, net of stock appreciation, excluding North Sea oil and      adjusted for inflation as measured by the GDP deflator  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOME MEMBERS ONLY;  </P> <P> NEW PRICE CLUB, CHAIN'S LARGEST, WILL ONLY SELL TO BUSINESS CLIENTS UNTIL IT  CAN WIN REZONING  </P> <P> Price Company, the San Diego-based chain of discount warehouse stores, will  open its first Price Club store in Los Angeles on Sept. 23. The store, all  144,000 square feet of it on Tampa Boulevard in Northridge, will be the largest  Price Club store to date, with parking space for 1,000 cars. But it's not  likely to be overflowing with autos for quite some time.  </P> <P> The reason is zoning -- or more precisely, the lack of it. As a prominently  displayed sign in front declares, the new store will sell merchandise only to  business members, not to individual customers. Unless you represent one of the  discount warehouse's business members, you'll be asked to go back home.  </P> <P> At the moment, the property is zoned only for wholesale and industrial uses.  </P> <P> Price Company, which has a chain of 45 Price Clubs offering low-cost  merchandise to customers who pay a membership fee, says it plans to apply for a  zoning change so it can sell goods to individual members. But company officials  concede the zoning change, which must be approved by the city of Los Angeles,  could take a year or more to complete.  </P> <P> Why open a store that only can sell to some of its customers? Brent Knudsen,  Price Company's vice president of marketing, says the decision was made to open  the store without rezoning because businesses account for about 70% of a Price  Club store's average annual volume of $110 million.  </P> <P> Daniel P. Garcia, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm Munger, Tolles &amp;  Olson, which represents Price Company, said the company's failure to obtain a  zoning change by the opening date wasn't an oversight, but merely reflects the  need to prepare the zone-change application properly. "It's just a cautious  start," said Garcia, who is the former president of the Los Angeles City  Planning Commission, a five-member committee that oversees zoning issues. He  adds that he expects the rezoning process to go smoothly.  </P> <P> Price Company acquired the 19.7-acre site last year as part of its $52-million  takeover of Alfred M. Lewis, a Riverside-based food wholesaler. The Northridge  facility was formerly a distribution center, but Knudsen said it is ideal for a  Price Club because the surrounding area has strong demographics and business  growth.  </P> <P> Given the immense amount of information a company must produce to apply for a  zoning change, it's not surprising that Price Company hasn't applied for the  change yet, said David Lessley, a city planner who works on zoning changes.  </P> <P> Even if no major snags occur, getting new zoning is a Byzantine process. After  Price Company compiles the necessary information, such as a detailed map and  environmental data, it must file its request for a change with the city.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Planning Department committee decides if the store should receive  environmental clearance, or if it should be required to prepare a full  environmental impact report, which is often required for controversial  projects. If, for instance, it's determined that the store would generate a  huge amount of additional traffic in the area, Price Company might be required  to submit an environmental impact report, which could take up to a year to  complete.  </P> <P> Lessley said it's likely that the Price Club would receive environmental  clearance if certain steps are taken to alleviate potential problems. For  instance, many retail developments, such as mini-malls, face opposition because  they provide too few parking spaces and add to traffic congestion. But Price  Club's big parking lot could alleviate that worry.  </P> <P> If the company wins environmental clearance, the Planning Department will  schedule a public hearing. After the hearing, a Planning Department examiner  will prepare a report that often lists conditions, such as a certain type of  landscaping, for a zoning change to be accepted.  </P> <P> The approved zoning request moves to the City Council's Planning and Land Use  Committee, chaired by Councilman Hal Bernson. Another hearing, this one by  Bernson's committee, is held and the committee makes its recommendation to the  full council. The council would then draft a zone-change ordinance, which the  mayor must sign. Thirty days after the ordinance is published by the city clerk  in a general-circulation newspaper, the change becomes effective.  </P> <P> Garcia, the Price Company's lawyer, said it's important to get every step right  in the zoning maze. But he said the process is also "a pain in the neck."  </P></p>

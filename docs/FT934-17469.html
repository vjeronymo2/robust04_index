			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Big pensions reforms urged: Goode report calls for industry watchdog and compensation scheme SWEEPING reforms of the way occupational pension schemes are governed were recommended yesterday by a government advisory committee appointed in the aftermath of the Maxwell pensions scandal. In a 1,000-page document, which was given a broad welcome from employers and pensions groups, Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the committee, recommends a law spelling out for the first time how schemes should operate and a compensation scheme covering fraud, misappropriation and theft. It suggests compensation be financed by a levy on all occupational pension schemes. It also urges the creation of an industry regulator, minimum solvency requirements and representation for scheme members on boards of trustees. However, it stops far short of curbing employers' use of contributions 'holidays' or requiring them to help pensions keep pace with inflation, and would allow them to wind up schemes that become too expensive in the future. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the government would consider the recommendations contained in the Pensions Law Review Committee report. It would be 'inconceivable' for legislation to be introduced before the 1994-95 parliamentary session, he said. Mr Lilley added: 'The government is keen to encourage greater private pension provision and to maintain the positive contribution which company pension schemes have made. We will wish to take whatever steps are necessary to re-establish confidence that the structure of occupational pension schemes is secure, stable and fair to all.' Welcoming the report, the Confederation of British Industry said it struck 'the right balance between improving the position of scheme members and the security of benefits on the one hand and the interests of employers - who underwrite most of the obligations - on the other'. Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade body, said there was nothing in the report likely to prompt employers to abandon final salary pension schemes - which promise pensioners a proportion of their final salary upon retirement - in favour of money purchase schemes. Those simply promise that a sum of money will be invested annually on an employee's behalf. 'I don't think this will accelerate the move to defined contribution schemes. That is already happening on its own for employers for whom it is appropriate.' Employers' groups had warned the committee, made up mainly of their professional pension advisers, that radical proposals would cause final-salary schemes to be abandoned. Such schemes are seen as the most secure form of retirement provision. However, the actuarial profession sounded alarm-bells over the report's recommendation that a fund's assets should always equal the cost of meeting all existing pension promises if it were wound up immediately. That might prompt schemes to switch their assets out of equities - in which they are largely invested - to lower-yielding UK government gilts. 'There is a serious risk that the equities market would plummet,' said Mr Roger Key, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Sons. Explaining the report's objectives, Prof Goode said: 'Our concern is to provide a system which is fair and secure and practical and not too difficult to administer.' Prof Goode said some issues had proved particularly difficult to resolve. Among them was a suggestion that employees who left schemes before retirement - the vast majority of members - should be entitled to better protection against inflation. The committee was also particularly divided over the suggestion that an industry compensation scheme should also cover poor investment performance or maladministration. Both, in the end, were rejected. Details, Page 11 Editorial Comment, Page 19 Lex, Page 20</p>

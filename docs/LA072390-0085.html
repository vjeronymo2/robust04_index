			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: IT WAS LIKE WATCHING GORSE GROW  </P> <P> Watching Nick Faldo win a golf tournament is like watching fish swim.  Remarkable in its own way, but pretty boring after a while.  </P> <P> If you're crazy about lag putts, approaches to the fat part of the green, nice,  safe two-woods off the tee, you'd love the British Open Sunday. If you're into  monotonous perfection, Nick Faldo is your pin-up.  </P> <P> He's no fun. He's not Seve Ballesteros winning his Open out of the parking lot  at Lytham. He's not Arnold Palmer, his shirt hanging out, his eyes squinted,  trying to figure out how to work the ball over two trees and a five-story  building. He's not Lee Trevino hitting shots that smack the flagstick,  otherwise they'd go in the Firth of Forth.  </P> <P> He plays computer golf. B-o-o-r-r-i-n-g! Someplace inside there is a floppy  disk and a microchip and a program for a 72.  </P> <P> He's an offense against nature, if you're a golfer. No one should play the game  that easily and dully. You should win such tournaments as Opens with massive,  three-break, 60-foot putts, as Hale Irwin did at Medinah. Or you should hit  breath-taking two-irons to guarded flags, as Hogan did at Merion, or chip in  out of hip-high rough, as Watson did at Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> Faldo won the British Open Sunday like a guy walking the dog. He won it off the  principal, so to speak, without having to invest more than the interest in his  game. He's about as exciting as a clerk.  </P> <P> But he "caned the loop," as the Scots say. That is, he went through the series  of holes, seven through 11, out on the promontory of this land jutting into the  sea, known as the "loop," without disaster. "Caning" takes its cue from the  practice of British officers taking their walking sticks to disobedient troops.  </P> <P> Faldo shot a 71 on the final round, if you care for minutiae. Of course he did.  He sized up what it would take to keep the field at bay. He didn't go for the  tournament record -- 268, set by Watson in 1978.  </P> <P> Faldo doesn't make it interesting. He plays what the gang at Rancho Municipal  would call "commercial" golf. Just good enough to win. Like a fighter who never  throws the right, a hitter who shortens up on the bat with two strikes, Nick  was not about to fall into the trap Arnold Palmer set for himself in 1966 when,  with a seven-shot lead with nine holes to play, he set about to breaking  Hogan's Open record and ended up breaking his own heart -- and nearly everyone  else's.  </P> <P> Nick knew par golf would win him the 119th British Open. It won him the 116th  British Open, you will recall. Nick could par the Indian Ocean. Color him gray.  </P> <P> But also color him with the Union Jack. It used to be a Brit winning the  British Open was man-bites-dog stuff. Now, it's the-Pope-is-Catholic stuff.  </P> <P> From the start of the first invasion of Britain by American golfers headed by  Bobby Jones and company in the mid-'20s to the second invasion by Palmer and  company in 1962, Yanks seemed to be able to win this tournament any time they  really cared to. And when they didn't care to, the tournament seemed to be  given over to other colonialists -- Bobby Locke and Gary Player of South Africa  and Peter Thomson of Australia, for instance.  </P> <P> British or British-based golfers (Ballesteros) have now won five of the last  seven championships. There'll always be an England.  </P> <P> Is Nick Faldo now the world's No. 1 golfer? Well, winning two majors this year  and coming within a missed putt of the other would seem so to rate him. "I let  my clubs do the talking," shrugs Nick. "But I feel I'm one of the key players  at the moment. In the last four seasons, I've won four majors, and I'm the  first guy in a long time who's won two in one year."  </P> <P> Nick is like Hogan. He weighs his words the way he does his shots. He doesn't  like them to go drifting off in the rough, either. He spent most of the  post-tournament news conference discussing what he should do with his swing, if  you consider that sexy. "I'd like to draw the ball better," he said. "I'm  trying to do something about getting the top half of my body in sync with my  legs. I'm tall, and I get too much leg drive."  </P> <P> Not exactly Churchillian in tone or inspiration.  </P> <P> Faldo is so low key, his preparations Sunday included a midday sleep. The last  guy I saw able to fall asleep just before one of the biggest fights of his life  was Joe Louis. Joe had to be awakened to go in the ring. So, presumably, did  Faldo.  </P> <P> Most athletes have trouble sleeping the night before a big game. Faldo has no  trouble sleeping an hour before. That should tell you something about Nick  Faldo. Maybe, all you need to know.  </P> <P> He made only three bogeys all week. He went into only one sand trap. He had no  three putts. No wonder he has trouble staying awake. His game bores even him.  That's not golf, that's something else.  </P> <P> He does, however, have one colorful accessory -- his caddie. His caddie is a  woman from Sweden, 22-year-old Fanny Sunesson, a bubbly, vivacious type who  keeps Faldo -- well, awake.  </P> <P> She does this, Nick reports, not by talking to him about the trouble he might  encounter but by talking about the kind of drapes he might put in his new home,  or how many bedrooms he has there and what kind of wallpaper he should have and  whether he will own a dog. "I knew what she was doing," Faldo says with a  smile. "She was trying to keep my mind off of golf."  </P> <P> Maybe. And maybe, like everyone else, she was hoping Nick would hit it into  trouble once in a while. You don't need a caddie when every shot goes right to  the fat of the green, the center of the fairway, and every putt is as safe and  un-adventurous as government bonds.  </P> <P> Faldo might be the world's greatest player, much as John Gielgud might have  been the world's greatest actor. This doesn't prevent the public from  preferring Bruce Willis.  </P> <P> Nick doesn't know what fun this game can be. I mean, 72 holes without a ball in  the water or out-of-bounds or under a log and a whole card full of two-putts!  That's not golf. The game would have died out long ago.  </P> <P> No wonder he's able to fall asleep. He puts everyone else there, too.  </P></p>

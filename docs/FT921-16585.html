			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Business leaders predict gloom for election year BRITAIN'S election campaign over the next six months will be fought against a background of deep economic gloom, according to leading economists, chief executives and trade union leaders, write FT reporters. In a Financial Times survey of new year forecasts published today, most of the 23 groups of economists from the City, universities and independent think-tanks say the Treasury's November prediction of a 2.3 per cent rise in gross domestic product this year is too optimistic. Instead, the average forecast for output growth is about 1.7 per cent between 1991 and 1992, with unemployment likely to climb to 2.7m. With the pound continuing to struggle as the weakest currency in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the government may face having to take the politically unpopular step of raising interest rates from their current 10.5 per cent. This follows the increases made by other ERM members just before Christmas. In the FT survey, economists generally take a bullish view of prospects for interest-rate cuts in the longer term. They expect rates to have fallen to 9.5 per cent by the end of 1992, with retail price inflation at a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. However, these potentially positive points appear elusive to many industry leaders. Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive of ICL, the UK computer group owned by Fujitsu of Japan, said the next 12 months would be 'extremely tough'. While Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, believes 1992 will usher in 'modest' growth, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman of glassmaker Pilkington, said: 'For planning purposes, we are assuming that 1992 will be much the same as 1991.' From the banking world, Mr Peter Burt, chief general manager of the Bank of Scotland, said: 'There is is not yet any sign of an improvement in economic conditions.' Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank concurred. He said 1991 saw the 'worst collapse' of business confidence since the 1930s. Prospects were little better for the new year. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said ministers could take an important step to revive the economy by calling an early election. Consumer spending was unlikely to increase before people knew whether they would have to pay higher taxes under Labour, he said. Small businesses will continue to have a tough time, said Mr John Townend MP, chairman of the smaller business committee of Conservative backbenchers. The long period of high real interest rates was still exerting a 'debilitating' effect on many small companies, he said. Mr Roger Bootle, of Greenwell Montagu, said: 'The man in the street may not see any economic improvement at all because all the things he knows and cares about - unemployment, house prices and business failures - will still be getting worse.' Some are arguing that the government should change tack. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, says Mr Lamont should refrain from referring to a recovery in the not-too-distant future, and instead 'start to prepare people psychologically for the difficult period over the next two years during which growth will be extremely muted'. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'People are still struggling with the large hangover of debt from the economic boom of the 1980s. This hasn't been a normal recession, and we won't see a normal recovery.' The picture is little different seen from the perspective of trade unions. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said business confidence had yet to return and more large-scale redundancies were in prospect. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU general union, said: 'Everybody I speak to is immersed in gloom.' Most economists see end to recession in 1992 Page 4</p>

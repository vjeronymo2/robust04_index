			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew to make Ulster plea in US SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to visit the US early next month in an attempt to win backing for British policy on the province. His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall over how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks, in-volving Unionists, nationalists, the British and Irish government after the local elections in the province on May 19. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Molyneaux raised proposals set out in his 'Blueprint for Stability' on Northern Ireland - an agenda that accepts the case for a new assembly in the province but says that, in its absence, the government should improve local democracy. Sir Patrick has not visited the US before as secretary of state and is keen to meet members of the Clinton's administration. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston he will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. There is also concern in London about the possibility of the US granting visas to leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, for propaganda trips.</p>

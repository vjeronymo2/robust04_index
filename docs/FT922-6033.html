			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg It may be gratifying for SG Warburg to unveil Pounds 71m of previously hidden reserves, but that also creates a large slice of additional capital on which it has to make an acceptable return. Yesterday's annual results show that only Pounds 3m would have been added to hidden reserves in 1991-92 had they still been in place. So the extra capital may prove something of a millstone, although Warburg will need to be well-capitalised to meet EC securities company regulations. That in turn creates a requirement for a steady flow of large issues, whatever conditions in the market, if the capital is to be used efficiently. Net return on capital last year was only 12 per cent. Mercury Asset Management's provisions against its investments in Jupiter Tyndall and Isosceles are a real but transitory embarrassment. More worrying is the fact that, thanks to pension fund holidays, it only attracted some Pounds 2bn of new money last year. Since it cannot continue to cut costs for ever, MAM must break into the nascent European pension fund market to secure future growth. The chances are that a smooth operator such as Warburg can cope with these problems better than most. But the road ahead is difficult. A yield of 4 per cent offers only limited compensation for investors, even if the scare surrounding February's so-called profit warning was overdone.</p>

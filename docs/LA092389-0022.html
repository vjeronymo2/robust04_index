			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S INTEGRATION?  </P> <P> Thank you for the article "San Fernando Comes of Age" (Sept. 17) on the city in  which I have been a lifelong resident. It is truly revealing to read of the  phenomenon we have all experienced.  </P> <P> One thing puzzles me. While you continually mentioned the advance of Latinos  into the formerly isolated north end of town, you never mentioned how many  Anglos have moved into the former barrio. It seems to me that an "integrated"  community must be something like a two-way street. If no reverse action has  taken place, "integration" is a misleading term.  </P> <P> If, by the turn of the century, the Latino population of the north end will be  90%, does that alone make for "integration"? Is the south end still also 90%  Latino? Would it be "integrated" if they were both eventually 90% Anglo? I  somehow doubt it.  </P> <P> DAVE THATCHER  </P> <P> San Fernando  </P></p>

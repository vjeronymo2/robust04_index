			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index mildly firmer after narrow fluctuations Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range on selling by overseas investors, and buying by dealers who covered their positions after computer problems at the Tokyo stock exchange, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average closed 29.91 up at 19,336.57 after moving between 19,372.67 and 19,284.76. Overseas investors were net sellers for the eighth consecutive trading day. Analysts said foreign fund managers were securing profits ahead of the close of the business year in December. Buying orders placed in the afternoon by domestic institutions provided underlying support. Volume came to 210m shares, against 256m. Activity remained light due to the lack of fresh news. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 2.11 at 1,527.61 and the Nikkei 300 firmed 0.54 to 280.75. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 7.83 to 1,252.69. Overseas investors sold steels, while arbitrage buying and purchases by individuals of machinery stocks supported share prices. The brief breakdown of the stock exchange's computer in the morning session had minimal impact other than triggering buying by dealers due to the lack of prior activity. Mitsubishi Estate, a property developer which owns 80 per cent of the Rockefeller Group, of the US, fell Y50 to Y1,070. Reports in the US that Rockefeller Center, a member of the Rockefeller Group, could default on its mortgage payment discouraged investors. Mitsubishi refused to comment on the reports. Seiyu, the supermarket chain, weakened Y100 to Y1,200 on reports that it would bail out its affiliated consumer credit company. The retailer said it had not yet decided on providing financial aid. Higher raw metal prices supported mining and non-ferrous metal stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y7 to Y941 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting added Y6 at Y439. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, resisted selling by overseas investors and finished Y1 firmer at Y386. Speculative buying supported Hoya, an optical and electronic equipment maker, which climbed Y50 to Y2,490. Kayaba Industry, an auto parts maker, rose Y21 to Y663. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 34.75 to 21,444.03 in volume of 70.9m shares. Roundup Tuesday's US interest rates rise was still having some effect on the region. HONG KONG was led down by interest rate-sensitive property stocks. The Hang Seng index declined 73.96 or 0.8 per cent to 9,518.28. Turnover decreased to HKDollars 2.8bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 3.6bn. Among property issues, Cheung Kong dropped 70 cents to HKDollars 37.20, Sun Hung Kai Properties 50 cents to HKDollars 57.75 and New World Development 40 cents to HKDollars 25.20. Local retail interest rates were expected to rise after today's meeting of the Association of Banks. SINGAPORE saw institutional interest in leading blue chips, and the Straits Times Industrial index put on 11.47 at 2,357.97. Brokers said a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates by the United Overseas Bank was largely discounted. SEOUL was supported by a late spurt of institutional buying. The composite index added a net 1.88 at 1,120.63, having rallied from a day's low of 1,115.39. Citizens National Bank went limit up, gaining Won1,000 at Won24,000, while Shinhan Bank set a record volume with 853,880 shares traded, and moved forward Won500 to Won24,100. TAIPEI was easier as turnover dwindled amid continued nervousness regarding the outcome of next month's elections. The weighted index slipped 48.90 to 6,297.88 as turnover dropped to TDollars 19.5bn, the lowest level since TDollars 19.0bn on October 21, 1993. Stocks linked to the Hualon group, which had risen in recent sessions, retreated on profit-taking: Hualon Preferred receded TDollars 2.40 or 4.9 per cent to TDollars 46.60. MANILA made a modest gain of 2.65 in the composite index to 2,904.100, largely on a rebound in PLDT shares of 2.7 per cent, spurred by its Dollars 1 rise in New York overnight. The mining sector shed 43.6 to 5,250.9 on profit-taking. KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses as profit-taking wiped out most of the gains made earlier in the week. The composite index dipped 10.67 or 1 per cent to 1,052.48. Volume was a thin 102m shares. Granite Industries dominated activity, tumbling MDollars 1.30 to MDollars 6.40 in volume of 15m shares. Granite said it planned to acquire timber and hotel assets which would result in a reverse takeover of the company by Malaysian businessman Ting Pek Khiing. SYDNEY ended sharply lower on continued bearishness over rising bond yields. The All Ordinaries index fell 17.9 to 1,922.4 in turnover of ADollars 550m. BHP finished 8 cents down at ADollars 18.96. NAB dropped 32 cents to ADollars 10.36 in spite of a bigger than expected rise in the final dividend. WELLINGTON closed higher, but was off its best level for the day. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 10.18 at 2,048.21, after touching 2,054.99. Telecom put on 5 cents at NZDollars 5.44 ahead of going ex-dividend on Monday.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines plans to export more sugar THE PHILIPPINE Sugar Regulatory Administration plans to sell more sugar on the world market in 1993-94 to dispose of its huge stockpile, Reuter reports from Manila. About 500,000 tonnes will be exported this season against the previous crop year's nearly 150,000 tonnes world market allocation, the SRA said. Total sugar production is expected to reach 2m tonnes in 1993-94. SRA administrator Mr Rodolfo Gamboa said the increased allocation was because of a huge stock of sugar, amounting to some 400,000 tonnes, carried over from 1992-93. Some sugar exporters were not keen to sell abroad, however, because the world price of 6 to 8 US cents a lb is much lower than the domestic cost of production of about 13 cents a lb, Gamboa noted. He said the large stock would not depress domestic prices because of delays in milling for the last crop by one to two months to around November this year. The delays were because of a drought that prevented early plantings last year, he added.</p>

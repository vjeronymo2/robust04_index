			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Anna Vargova; place and date not given: "One  Must Prepare Oneself for Entry Into the European Union"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] While in Vienna, you surely  also discussed our interest and endeavor to become a member of  the European Union [EU]. How do the Austrian partners perceive  our chances?    [Weiss] The Slovak Republic naturally wants to become  integrated into the EU. I believe that it is necessary to be  well prepared for entry practically, legally, and economically.  The Slovak Republic, too, could file a formal application for EU  membership within a few days. That is not what matters,  however. I am in favor of preparing a well-thought-out strategy  of preparing Slovakia for this entry, which should be based on  the Agreement on Association With the EU.    [Vargova] Have you discussed within the framework of the  coalition the possibility of the present government filing such  an application?    [Weiss] No, we have not discussed this issue.    [Vargova] At the news conference in Vienna, you said that  you would like to become prime minister after the elections.  Could you specify your reply?    [Weiss] I said that every party naturally wants to win  elections and have the prime minister.    [Vargova] If the SDL should win the election, has a decision  already been made in your party that you would be its candidate  for this post?    [Weiss] No decision on this issue has yet been made by SDL  bodies. In the case of our electoral victory, we would  definitely nominate the prime minister.</p>

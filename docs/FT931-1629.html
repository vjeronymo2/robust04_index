			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (9): Attitudes turn west - Higher dividends are being sought THE CONTRAST between Anglo-Saxon and Japanese attitudes could not be more complete. In traditionally high-inflation UK, pension funds, insurance companies and individuals have got used to having a large holding of equities in order to protect their wealth from rising prices. A quick glance at the performance of gilts and equities since the first world war shows that this is no more than good sense. But in low-inflation Japan most money has traditionally been held in deposits or bonds, and holding equity has been regarded as a way of cementing corporate relationships or, in the case of individuals, gambling. 'My father has been saving for a long time and he would never consider putting money into the stock market,' claims Ms Yukino Shigeno, an interpreter working in Nagoya. 'He thinks it's just another way of betting on the horses.' That attitude is not just a jaundiced by-product of the stock market collapse. Yet whatever the historical motives for Japanese investors holding shares, the shock to the financial system which followed the collapse of the bubble economy is forcing both institutions and individuals to reassess their whole investment philosophy. It seems likely that, for better or worse, that review will result in the import of more western investment habits. For a start, calls by Japan's insurance companies for higher dividends have been a formal ritual in the past. Now they are more insistent. Mr Hideya Kubo, a senior economist at Nippon Life, explains how institutional pressure on Japanese companies to improve profitability is growing. 'We have been examining corporate return on assets and equity and they are too low. Companies are also paying out too little in dividends. We will not be reducing our weighting in equities but we will consider selling shares in those companies which don't regard shareholders highly.' Such sentiments are even more keenly felt by the smaller trust banks and life companies which are suffering most from the fall in the stockmarket. Large life companies have assets which were acquired for next to nothing in the aftermath of the second world war. Smaller life companies are not nearly so feather-bedded. Some of these may be running low on reserves, and they, rather than the banks, may be the real target for the government's price support operation. Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, points out: 'Only 16 per cent of the large banks' capital base is directly sensitive to the level of the stock market. Even that could be replaced by subordinated bonds if the need arose. It is the life companies which are really suffering from unrealised stock losses.' That seems to be confirmed by the way that the Japanese ministry of finance has eased the rules on how life companies have to report the losses on foreign bond holdings. The pain is clearly real. Traditionally, Japanese investors have been happy to let company managements run the business. Now that institutions are feeling the heat, they are less relaxed. 'There are those who think it is necessary to review our non-interventionist posture,' thinks Mr Kubo, 'but if Japanese companies decide to emphasise return on assets, that will help the Japanese economy.' That said, there is an element of posturing in the institutions' position. Faced with having to earn high enough returns to satisfy policyholders, they are fast running out of options. Short term deposit rates are now at 2.5 per cent, a record low. The only alternatives left are high-yielding foreign bonds - which carry substantial currency risks - or equities. And as equities no longer offer near-automatic capital gains, life companies are demanding bigger dividends. But if the government is successful in its attempt to put a floor under share prices and equities start to rise, Japanese institutions may be forced back into the market, however much they kick and scream. Even if they return, though, the lesson of the last two years is unlikely to be lost quickly. Fund managers and individuals will probably not be prepared to put all their faith in rising asset prices, and will demand the security of western-style dividends. Other western habits are likely to catch on too. The stock market will have to become more transparent and shed its image as an insiders' club if it is to stand any chance of regaining investors' trust. That may mean more stringent accounting standards and a greater openness by companies. The Dollars 1bn foreign exchange losses at Showa Shell demonstrate how easy it is for individuals - and by implication companies - to skirt round current accounting rules. In particular, greater openness will be needed to encourage foreign investment in Japanese equities - a point made by Mr Noboru Fukuda of Nikko Securities: 'We have to work with the infrastructure to provide a transparent and fair market. That is part of the process of re-establishing investors' faith in shares.' Mr Fukuda also thinks that investors need better benchmarks to measure performance: 'There has been a decline in the attractiveness of the market. In part that reflects investors' concern with finding an appropriate way to value shares. They need a criterion which is convincing, and it cannot simply be yield.' The recent western-focus cash flow measures of performance may catch on in Japan too. Individuals may be equally cautious about returning to the market unless transparency improves. Many investors who ploughed their savings into the NTT telephone privatisations have seen their shareholdings fall dramatically. And the poor public image of equities will hardly have been improved by the last two years of falling prices and scandals. Bulls point to the low proportion of assets which individuals keep in shares. The likelihood is that that it will remain low. For individuals, shares will continue to be a home for speculative pin money.</p>

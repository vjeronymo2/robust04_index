			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BOC makes German buy BOC Group, the industrial gases company, yesterday announced that it had acquired the hydrogen distribution business of Huls, a subsidiary of the Veba Group of Germany. The move is part of the strategy of Mr Pat Rich, BOC chairman, to expand in continental Europe and South America. BOC's shares closed down 2p at 657p. The business includes the longest hydrogen pipeline in Europe, extending more than 210km through the Rhine-Ruhr area and serving customers in both oil refining and chemicals. It also includes a cylinder and trailer filling station for hydrogen, methane and ethylene at Marl, near Munster. Financial details were not provided. However, BOC said the consideration would be less than Pounds 78m. It is understood the sum is greater than Pounds 50m. The amount should be settled in cash on completion, expected in mid-July. The deal has the agreement of the German competition authorities. BOC said the business should make a positive contribution to earnings within a year as demand for hydrogen was robust and continued to grow. The company expects long-term demand growth to average at about 5 per cent a year. BOC said the business would make a substantial addition to its continental operations whose turnover last year was about Pounds 140m. Group turnover was about Pounds 2.8bn. Huls will continue to manufacture hydrogen for BOC and operate the filling station. No redundancies at Huls are involved. Goldman Sachs advised the German company. Mr Chung Kong Chow, BOC Gases' chief executive, said: 'This acquisition is a unique opportunity to broaden our product range in a major industrial gas market. It will complement our existing gases business in continental Europe and is a significant step in the expansion of our hydrogen business around the world.'</p>

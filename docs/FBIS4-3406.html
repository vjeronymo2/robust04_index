			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial  party committee and governor, visited with delegations from the  cities of Sanming and Putian to listen to their discussions on  the government work report and he discussed his views with the  deputies on issues such as the development of agriculture and  the rural economy, technological transformation of old  state-owned enterprises, technological input, and the building  of spiritual civilization.    Jia Qinglin said: In view of the relatively low income the  peasants earn from working the land, the provincial government  has taken some measures and increased grain prices. Therefore,  it is necessary for leaders in various localities to do more  ideological work, encourage the spirit of dedication, and manage  grain-producing areas well. Not only should grain-producing  areas pay attention to grain production, but the coastal areas  should also do the same. When talking about the new line of  thinking on developing grain production, he said: We should not  develop a one-crop economy and take grain as the key link as we  did in the past, because such a practice will lead us nowhere.  Grain production should be carried out as part of the entire  rural economic development in connection with the development of  a diversified economy and the bid to increase the peasants'  income. The more grain production is developed, the greater the  need to develop a diversified economy will become. Only when  the entire rural economy develops and the peasants' income rises  can grain production possibly be uplifted.    When discussing large and medium-sized enterprises, he  pointed out: Large and medium-sized enterprises must speed up  the pace of technological transformation, continuously upgrade  technology, enhance their competitiveness, and at the same time,  do a good job of the basic work to establish a modern enterprise  system, strengthen internal enterprise management, continue to  change the way enterprises operate, and gradually strive to  become modern enterprises.    When dealing with technological input, he remarked: There is  still a problem of low returns in regard to the current  transformation of scientific and technological research  achievements into productive forces. Scientific and  technological efficiency cannot entirely be achieved by relying  exclusively on government investment. It is necessary to  conduct a series of reforms in agriculture and the scientific  research structure and absorb some useful experiences from  foreign countries. It is my hope that departments concerned  will do more research.    Jia Qinglin also stressed: It is necessary to place  simultaneous stress on the two civilizations and attach  importance to the development and construction of Meizhou Wan.</p>

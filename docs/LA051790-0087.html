			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DIAL-A-RIDE CONTRACT GOES TO COSTLIER FIRM  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday awarded a one-year contract for  Dial-A-Ride transportation services to Medi-Ride Inc., even though the company  plans to charge $34,000 more than a second firm that also sought the contract.  </P> <P> Council members said that in addition to cost, they were considering  Medi-Ride's references and its track record in serving the city since December.  </P> <P> The Dial-A-Ride program provides van and taxi transportation to the elderly and  handicapped on weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., in Glendale, La  Canada-Flintridge and the county areas of La Crescenta and Montrose.  </P> <P> Medi-Ride said it would provide four vans and cab service for $436,725. Another  firm, Care Van, offered the same service for $402,795. An evaluation team  representing the cities and the county recommended that the contract go to  Medi-Ride, beginning July 1.  </P> <P> A city staff report stated that since Medi-Ride took over the ride program on  an interim basis in December, complaints have decreased and ridership has  increased.  </P> <P> Bradley K. Thesman, owner of Care Van, told the council that he did not believe  his firm was properly notified or given fair consideration by the city staff.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Zarian and Councilmen Richard Jutras and Carl Raggio voted to  follow the staff's recommendation and award the contract to Medi-Ride.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg dissented. "I'm not at all sure we played fair on  this one," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Bank To Issue $7.5b in Bonds"] </F>   [Text] The newly established State Development Bank, one  of the country's three policy-oriented banks, has begun issuing  financial bonds to pool capital.    The flotation began last Wednesday and by Monday a total of  20 billion yuan ($2.3 biilion) worth of three- and five-year  bonds will be issued to 10 financial institutions, said Yao  Zhenyan, president of the bank.    Instructed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank,  these institutions will also buy 8 billion yuan ($920 million)  in bonds next month.    The bank is planning to issue 65 billion yuan (S7.5 billion)  in bonds this year. The rest will be sold in three batches in  the second half of this year, Yao said.    The institutions buying the bonds are the Shanghai and  Shenzhen branches of the People's Bank of China, the Industrial  and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank,  the Construction Bank, the Communications Bank, the Everbright  Bank, the Industrial Bank of the China International Trust &amp;  Investment Corp and the Post Saving and Remitting Bureau.    The paperless bonds cannot be traded in the market or among  banks, but they can be used as collateral when borrowing money  from the central bank.    The issue of financial bonds is an important way to ensure  that the bank, which went into operation on July 13, has enough  capital to support the country's key construction projects.    More capital will come from the national treasury, which has  promised 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) of registered capital  over the next four years.    Relying on the financial bonds and State allocations, the  bank this year is planning to supply 80 billion yuan ($9.2  billion) in low-interest loans for infrastructural construction.    About 40 per cent of the loans is expected to be granted in  the first half of this year, Yao said, adding that the money  raised through the bonds will be channelled to projects within  several days.    The bank's loans will be used for developing the country's  key infrastructural projects and the basic but overburdened  industries that have been hindering economic growth.    This year's beneficiaries include 345 large and medium-sized  construction projects such as the giant Three Gorges Dam, the  Beijing-Kowloon railway and some big power stations.    To raise more capital, Yao said, his bank is quite willing  to  co-operate with international financial sources.    At first, the bank will be responsible for the relending of  some loans from foreign governments and international financial  organizations.    It is also likely to issue bonds overseas if it gets the  approval, of the State.    Yao said many overseas financial institutions have expressed  their wishes to help the bank issue overseas bonds.    Furthermore, Yao said, the bank will also seek commercial  loans from overseas banks.    He said the bank will set up some affiliates in foreign  countries in the future.    Establishing the State Development Bank is an important part  of the country's financial reform. It is aimed at ensuring the  smooth flow of capital to key State projects and providing the  central government with a powerful tool to rein in excessive  investment in fixed assets.</p>

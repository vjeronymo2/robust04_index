			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Graham issues pathfinder and shows 25% rise Graham Group, the builders' merchant about to be demerged by BTR, the industrial conglomerate, returned pre-tax profits ahead 25 per cent to Pounds 13.5m last year, on sales just 8 per cent higher at Pounds 374m. Graham, one of the first companies in the building materials sector to come to the market for some years, published its pathfinder prospectus yesterday. It is seeking a listing through the placing and public offer of 114.6m shares and is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. The Luton-based company has had a difficult time in recent years, falling from the leading position in the builders' merchant league to fourth place with a UK market share of 5 per cent. Profits have fallen by 60 per cent since the peak in 1989. Mr Ian Mills, managing director, said this had been due both to recession and the pursuit of volume at the expense of margin. Mr Mills stressed that the group had substantial opportunities following the appointment of new management and a strategic review last year. 'We will increase the gross margin by adding value,' he said. Last year, Graham's gross margin declined by 0.5 of a percentage point to 21.8 per cent. Debt is expected to be Pounds 19.6m after the demerger, representing 22 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Mills said this was expected to come down in future, in spite of a Pounds 36m, three-year capital expenditure programme. Capital expenditure has been significantly increased in the past year as Graham began to refurbish its 148 branches. Dividend payments this year are expected to equal approximately half of Graham's after-tax profits, which were Pounds 12m in 1993 giving earnings of 10.5p (8.1p) per share. Graham intends to pay one third of the dividend at the interim stage. BTR is selling Graham and other distribution businesses to focus on manufacturing and reduce its onerous debt. Earlier this year it completed the Pounds 120m disposal of Summers Group, the US electrical wholesaler.</p>

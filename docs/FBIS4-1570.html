			<p>BFN     [Text] China is preparing to crack down on pirated compact  discs (CDs) being smuggled into Hong Kong, according to a  leading recording industry body that has lobbied the mainland  for stronger controls.    The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department yesterday  admitted the problem had become difficult to control because of  lax restrictions on the mainland covering intellectual property  rights. The customs commissioner, Don Watson, predicted another  huge increase in seizures of pirated CDs this year.    The regional head of the International Federation of the  Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Giouw Jui-Chian, said the Chinese  government was drafting legislation that would make CD piracy a  criminal offence - it is currently regarded as a civil matter.    Giouw said the IFPI, which on behalf of the recording  industry has been lobbying the Chinese government, had been told  that a central authority would be set up to combat the problem  and CD imports and exports would be subjected to rigorous checks  from June. He said CDs pirated in China had been seized in  countries throughout Asia and North America and two consignments  had been recently confiscated by authorities in Central American  countries.    In the first two months of this year, Hong Kong customs  officers arrested 75 people and seized more than 13,000 pirated  CDs with a retail value of $600,000 [currency not specified]:  Last year, the number of seized discs jumped to 95,671,  compared with only 10,117 confiscated in 1992. Watson said he  expected more seizures this year.    Speaking after a ceremonial destruction of pirated CDs  yesterday, Watson said the Government was working closely with  the music industry to stop the influx of pirates, which last  year cost the industry an estimated $300m in lost profits. He  said intelligence indicated that organised efforts were behind  the smuggling and distribution of pirated discs.    "I not sure we can dignify them with the name of  'syndicates'  as of yet but we're looking very, very closely at who is  responsible for the distribution," Watson said. "I know when it  first began as a problem, we were satisfied the (discs) were  coming in, not in an organised way, but by travellers coming  back from (Shenzen) bringing CDs with them which they could buy  very cheaply. The picture has changed because of pressure  applied by Customs and Excise and the police and I think now  because of the profits factor, there is growing evidence that  there is an organisation behind it."    He said that several different Chinese authorities were  responsible for enforcing intellectual property laws and without  any co-ordinated effort the problem would be remain widespread.    "I have spoken to the Chinese customs about this problem but  the problem there is that they do not have the authority to deal  with the situation in China," he said.    "Until you can actually have one authority which is  combatting the manufacture, distribution and sale of pirated CDs  then we're unlikely to get very much further than we are at the  moment. I understand that through the efforts of the IFPI some  sort of co- ordinated action is being taken. "It is only  through co-ordinated action against producers that we are likely  to see any improvements in the situation locally.    "I think the problem is due to the fact that the  manufacturing capacity of CDs in China far exceeds the domestic  demand for the product and the spare capacity is being used to  produce these pirated CDs. I think the problem can only be  resolved by the factories in China being closed down or being  reduced to producing legitimate CDs for the legitimate markets.    "I would hate to say it's out of control but...the major  problem is the sheer volume of traffic between Hong Kong and  China."    Watson said none of the pirated CDs seized so far had been  made locally and although some had been manufactured in other  Asian countries, most were from China.    Giouw said that until stronger legislation was introduced in  China, the pirating of compact discs would continue to  proliferate.    "None of the pirates are afraid of the laws," he said.    "If they are making a million a year, why should they worry  about paying a fine or half a million dollars in damages?"</p>

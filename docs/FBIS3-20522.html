With the deepening  development of reform and opening up, the number of solely  foreign-owned enterprises is rising daily, and the number of  their employees is also rapidly growing. Consequently, party  building work in this area is arousing increasingly strong  attention from party organizations at all levels. Solely  foreign-owned enterprises are characterized by a unique  environment which is fundamentally different from that in  state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises, and is  markedly different even from that in Chinese-foreign joint  ventures and cooperative enterprises. In such a unique  environment, it is very difficult to operate on the basis of the  traditional enterprise party-building model. It is now  absolutely necessary to actively explore new approaches to the  building of party organizations in solely foreign-owned  enterprises on the basis of proceeding from complex realities.    I. The Current State of and Problems in the Building of  Party Organizations in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises.    The party member employees in solely foreign-owned  enterprises come from all social strata and from across the  country, and the individuals are very different in terms of  their experiences and levels of ideological competence. After  leaving their previous work posts and coming to work in solely  foreign-owned enterprises, they would inevitably make  adjustments with regard to their pervious party organization  ties. But in reality some party members do not want to bring  their party organization ties to the new work environment. Some  party members do not want make their party member status public.  As most foreign-owned enterprises are small and medium-sized  enterprises, there are few party members among the employees,  and the party members are scattered. As a result it is very  difficult to arrange for them to take part in party member  activities. Party members in some solely foreign-owned  enterprises are even in a situation of being supervised by no  one.    The establishment of party organizations in solely  foreign-owned enterprises has allowed many party members to  return to the embrace of the organization and to hear the voice  of the organization, thereby enhancing party members' sense of  organization and sense of the glorious mission of the communist.  As the situation of the functioning of party organizations in  solely foreign-owned enterprises shows, it is true that party  organizations in some enterprises have begun to operate in a  normal manner and accumulated work experience, while winning  understanding and support from the foreign businessmen involved.  Nevertheless, in terms of the overall situation, it is still  necessary not to overlook the fact that it is very difficult to  carry out party building work in solely foreign-owned  enterprises. The main difficulties in the work include: 1) There  is a lack of explicit legal safeguards and policy protection for  the existence of party organizations in solely foreign-owned  enterprises, and the "underground party" phenomenon cannot be  completely eliminated; 2) activities of party organizations  cannot be covered by the general framework of enterprise  activities, and the role and status of party organizations in  solely foreign-owned enterprises are very unclear; 3) as the  mobility of party members is high, it is difficult to grasp the  people to be targeted in the work, and as a result grassroots  organizations are unstable; 4) activities of party organizations  cannot be scheduled to take place within the legal eight-hour  work period, while it is often difficult to ensure that  activities can be carried out in other time; 5) it is difficult  for party branches to carry out joint collective activities, and  it is even more difficult for a small number of party members  who have become part of party branches of other units to have  normal organizational life; 6) there are still some problems in  the supervisor-subordinate relations and unified management of  party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises, and the  phenomenon of "management in name but not in substance" is  rather serious; 7) working in an entirely new environment, party  members in solely foreign-owned enterprises are affected by bad  tendencies, and thus they are strongly inclined to consider  money to be all-powerful and have a weakening sense of  organization, making it very difficult to conduct ideological  and political work; and 8) activities of party organizations are  greatly restricted in terms of time and space because some  foreign businessmen fear that the enterprises' operations would  acquire political colors.    II. The Difficulties Facing the Building of Party  Organizations in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises Call For Deep  Thinking.    According to the traditional model of party building work in  enterprises, the party organization is the political core of a  state-owned or collective enterprise; specialized work offices  of the party organization need to be established and there need  to be a certain number of party affairs cadres; the enterprise  would make available activity time, activity space, and activity  funds in a unified manner. The Chinese partner controls a  certain proportion of the shares of a joint-venture or  cooperative enterprise which thus is still publicly owned to  some extent, with the employees remaining masters of the  enterprise in some sense. The participation of the Chinese  partner and its supervisory agency in the operations of a  joint-venture or cooperative enterprise also creates some  conditions for the building of party organizations in the  enterprise. But things are very different in solely  foreign-owned enterprises. Foreign businessmen assume  independent responsibility for the operations of the enterprises  and make independent decisions on operations, employment, and  the distribution system, while party organizations are unable to  play a role in important matters. Party organizations have no  power or position in solely foreign-owned enterprises.  Consequently there are many problems which should be thought  about in a profound manner: What role do party organizations  play in solely foreign-owned enterprises? What is the goal of  party organizations' work? As the means of production of solely  foreign-owned enterprises are owned by foreign businessmen as  private individuals, employees are no longer masters of the  enterprises, and the employee-employer relationship between  labor and management is very clear. In such an environment, how  should party organizations in the enterprises handle their  relationships with foreign businessmen? How to carry out work  among employees?    According to some people, the party organization in a solely  foreign-owned enterprise cannot become the political core of the  enterprise. It lacks rallying power, combat effectiveness, and  cohesive power, and thus will not be able to play an important  role. According to some others, the Communist Party is the  ruling party and the representative of the interests of workers.  The party organization should become a political core of and  battle bastion in a solely foreign-owned enterprise. According  to some people, employees of solely foreign-owned enterprises  are all wage laborers, and as owners of the enterprises foreign  businessmen are in essence exploiters; therefore party  organizations at the enterprises should not serve the foreign  businessmen. According to some others, party organizations  should proceed from the overall situation, and make active  efforts to ensure that workers support the work of foreign  businessmen. Various ideological and practical problem such as  these have not yet been resolved in practice.    III. It Is Necessary To Explore New Approaches To  Building Party Organizations on the Basis of Proceeding From the  Unique Environment in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises.    First, it is necessary to face up to realities and transform  the traditional ideas on and methods of party building work.  Solely foreign-owned enterprises are different from state-owned  enterprises and collective enterprises as well as joint ventures  and cooperative enterprises. Foreign businessmen manage their  own enterprises in accordance with the state's relevant laws and  regulations and international practices, and would not establish  offices exclusively engaged in party affairs work, maintain  full-time party affairs cadres, or make time, place, and funds  available for activities of party organizations in a unified  manner. To do a good job of carrying out the work of party  organization building in solely foreign-owned enterprises, it is  necessary to discard old working models and methods and  transform old ideas; it is necessary not to blindly follow the  customary methods used in party building work in state-owned  enterprises. Party organizations and party members in solely  foreign-owned enterprises should gradually adapt to the unique  environment in solely foreign-owned enterprises; should, in view  of the characteristics of solely foreign-owned enterprises,  carry out their work by having part-time party affairs cadres,  by conducting activities after work, and by conducting  small-scale and scattered collective activities; and should  combine principledness with flexibility, and gradually  accumulate experience on party building work in solely  foreign-owned enterprises. The idea, based on disregarding the  unique realities in a solely foreign-owned enterprise, of asking  the party organization to become the leading organ and political  core in the structural framework of the enterprise and to  acquire such duties and power as entailing direct participation  in enterprise decision making as a matter of course represents a  dream totally divorced from realities.    Second, some important problems of principle on the building  of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises must  be further clarified in the party's policies, the state's  policies, and the relevant laws. Whether party organizations  should be established in solely foreign-owned enterprises,  whether party organizations should be allowed to be established  in such enterprises, and what the scope, mode, and goal of the  operation of party organizations in solely foreign-owned  enterprises should be are all important problems of principle.  Without clear legal and policy interpretations, party  organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises would lack  legal and policy guarantees, and their existence and development  would exhibit a strong tendency to be changeable and be  characterized by willfulness. For instance, the Foreign-Funded  Enterprise Law of the People's Republic of China adopted by the  National People's Congress in April 1986 and the Rules  Implementing the Foreign-Funded Enterprise Law promulgated by  the State Council in December 1990 do not explicitly stipulate  that grassroots organizations of the CPC may be established in  solely foreign-owned enterprises in accordance with the law; as  a result there has emerged a situation where the establishment,  existence, and development of party organizations in solely  foreign-owned enterprises are to a large extent dependent on the  foreign businessmen's attitude toward and understanding of the  issue. A small number of foreign businessmen who are opposed to  establishing party organizations in enterprises would fire party  members as soon as they are discovered, and clear away party  organizations; meanwhile grassroots party organizations are at a  loss what to do. The demand for explicit legal and policy  provisions for the legality and rightfulness of the existence of  party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises does not  entail the demand for giving party organizations in solely  foreign-owned enterprises the status and power similar to those  enjoyed by party organizations in state-owned enterprises, but  entail the demand for providing necessary safeguards for the  existence and development of party organizations under the  preconditions of respecting the international practices  regarding the management of foreign-funded enterprises and of  respecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign  businesses.    Enterprise employees have the right to participate in legal  political parties. This is a legal principle followed both at  home and abroad. But there is a large difference between  socialist and nonsocialist countries in the status and operating  methods of grassroots enterprise organizations of political  parties (especially the ruling party). Foreign businesses'  biggest worry is that enterprises' party organizations would  acquire the power similar to that enjoyed by party organizations  in state-owned enterprises by exploiting the ruling party status  of the CPC, thereby threatening foreign businessmen's  independent management of private enterprises. If we make  appropriate legal and policy rules which explicitly stipulate  that the existence and activity mode of party organizations in  solely foreign-owned enterprises should not affect foreign  businessmen's independent management of enterprises, and if we  establish party organizations and carry out party work in an  active and steady manner, then we are sure to secure  understanding and support from foreign businessmen.    Third, party organizations in solely foreign-owned  enterprises should enhance leadership over trade union  organizations in enterprises, and should be good at using the  trade-union battle position in an effort to conduct their own  work, consolidate their political position, establish their  political prestige, and increase party organizations' cohesive  power and rallying power. The lawful status of trade unions, as  employee organizations in enterprises, in solely foreign-owned  enterprises is protected by various enterprise laws and  regulations. Trade unions' carrying out work and the  participation of trade unions in enterprise management are in  accord with international practices, and are thus understood and  respected by foreign businessmen. To have party organizations  actively promote the establishment of trade union organizations  in solely foreign-owned enterprises and to have party  organizations participate in enterprise management through trade  union organizations represent a very realistic approach.    According to the Marxist theory, trade unions constitute a  tie and bridge linking up the masses of workers with the party.  Through having party members work in trade unions, party  organizations influence the broad masses of employees, make  propaganda on the party's line and general and specific  policies, raise the ideological consciousness of the masses of  workers, and get employees organized in activities to maintain  their own legitimate rights and interests, thereby increasing  the party's influence and strength. This theory provides an  important guiding idea on the work of party organizations,  including party organizations in solely foreign-owned  enterprises. In solely foreign-owned enterprises, party  organizations can still become political cores, but such  political core status is not just given to them on the basis of  legal and policy protection or guaranteed through the  distribution of enterprise management power and the deployment  of cadre personnel, but is embodied in the party organizations'  own work. The chief way to play the political core role is to  provide effective leadership over, and to organize, trade union  work.    Fourth, while carrying out trade union work in solely  foreign-owned enterprises, party organizations should pay  attention to enhancing multichannel communication and  cooperation with foreign businessmen, and secure understanding  and support from foreign businessmen, so as to create a good  enterprise environment for the building of party organizations.  The existence of solely foreign-owned enterprises is the product  of our party's reform and opening up policy. It is our policy to  develop the national economy, to introduce advanced technical  equipments, and to learn advanced management experience of  foreign countries through utilizing foreign businesses'  investing in establishing enterprises. In carrying out work,  party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises should  be guided by the aforementioned policy, seek common grounds and  keep differences in the process of communicating and cooperating  with foreign businessmen, seek effective ways of cooperation  under the precondition of adhering to principles, and utilize  trade union organizations in adjusting labor-management  relations, in organizing labor contests, and in providing  technical and management training, so as to promote the  development of the enterprises in the right direction. Party  organizations can secure understanding and support from foreign  businessmen through carrying out practical work, being sincere,  organizing activities, and giving play to party member's pioneer  and model role, thereby creating a vast space for the building  of party organizations.    Fifth, to enhance the building of party organizations in  solely foreign-owned enterprises, it is necessary to proceed  with efforts at both the upper and lower levels simultaneously.  On the one hand, enhance sector-based management, establish  effective management institutions, and overcome the phenomena of  disorderly sector-based supervisory relationships and of  "management in name but not in substance"; on the other hand, in  grassroots organizations, make further efforts to do a good job  of building organizations and institutions and carrying out the  work of party members' ideological education, enhance party  members' sense of organization, and prevent the lowering of the  political quality, so that the building of party organizations  in solely foreign-owned enterprises can proceed in a normal and  regular manner.</p>

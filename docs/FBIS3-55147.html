The decision was reached during the Russian-Belarusian talks  in Moscow which were attended by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Belarusian  Premier Vyacheslav Kebich.    The participants signed a joint statement on the integration  of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. The statement  said that the integration will take place after the prime  ministers of the two republics have signed a package of more  than ten agreements specifying the mechanism of integration in  Minsk in the second half of January.    Kebich told ITAR-TASS after the three-hour talks that the  sides have also agreed the exchange rate of the Russian rouble  and the Belarusian coupon under which one coupon will be  exchanged for one rouble.    Kebich also said that Yeltsin expressed the hope that the  agreements to be signed in Minsk will come into force as soon as  possible. "This would fully meet the interests of the heads of  government," he added.    The Belarusian premier believes that the process of  Belarus's  transition to the Russian rouble will be long and may take three  to six months. This is caused mostly by technical problems of  cash supplies to Belarus. Kebich said some other CIS states may  also join the rouble zone. "But for this to happen, a certain  mechanism should be worked out," he concluded.</p>

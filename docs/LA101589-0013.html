			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: FISHING IN THE TIBER BY LANCE MORROW (HENRY HOLT: $12.95)  </P> <P> In this collection of essays, Time writer Lance Morrow considers a variety of  topics -- television, the explosion of the space shuttle, the reputation of  John F. Kennedy -- without offering a single original insight or opinion.  President Kennedy died young but left an enduring myth, he proclaims with the  timely wisdom of Columbus discovering America in 1892. Morrow reveals that the  Vietnam War remains a divisive issue and that many Vietnam veterans are  troubled. He presents Imelda Marcos' 2,700 pairs of shoes as a symbol of an  irrational greed that is "a subdivision of the banality of evil," while  subjecting his audience to the evil of banality. Prefab profundity for readers  who have trouble grasping the 30-second sound bites on network news shows.  </P></p>

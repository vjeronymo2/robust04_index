			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Third top vacancy opens up at BBC A THIRD high-level vacancy opened at the BBC yesterday when Mr Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1, announced his move to Carlton Television. Mr Powell's resignation comes a week after Mr Ian Phillips, the BBC's director of finance, said he was leaving in February. A replacement has not yet been found for Mr John Tusa, managing director of the BBC World Service, who retires at the end of this month. Mr Powell, who has been controller of BBC 1 for five years, will leave the BBC before Christmas just as Mr John Birt takes over as director-general. Mr Powell, who will be head of drama and international development at Carlton, said yesterday: 'It's a very nice, interesting company and a nice, interesting job.' Carlton takes over the ITV London weekday franchise from Thames on January 1. Mr Powell said one of his jobs would be to pursue drama-making opportunities wherever they could be found. 'Broadcasting is changing so much, the only thing to be is completely flexible,' he said. In his time at the BBC, Mr Powell has been responsible for the first regular production deal with an independent producer - Select TV's hit Birds of a Feather - successful comedies such as One Foot in the Grave and innovative drama such as Between The Lines. He was also responsible for Caught In The Act, a home video clips programme he now describes as 'a complete bummer'. Then there was Eldorado, the BBC drama still struggling for life outside BBC 1's Top 30. Mr Powell had a year of his contract to run - a contract that would probably not have been renewed. As a producer, Mr Powell made programmes such as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Testament of Youth. When he was head of drama at the BBC his commissions ranged from Casualty and Edge of Darkness to The Singing Detective and A Very Peculiar Practice. The three senior vacancies present a short-term headache for Mr Birt, who takes over from Sir Michael Checkland as director-general on Christmas Eve, but it also gives him scope for a significant restructuring. Many people at the BBC expect radical changes in the structure of BBC Television as a result. It has now become clear that the impending departure of Mr Phillips had much more to do with the arrival of Mr Birt than the controversy over the potential overspend at BBC Television. It is believed that Mr Phillips decided to leave after seeking and failing to receive an immediate endorsement. A number of senior BBC executives who were close to Sir Michael believe they may not long survive Mr Birt's accession.</p>

The Presidential and Executive Councils of the united Iraqi  National Congress, INC, held their sixth joint meeting in the  INC headquarters in the city of Salah-al-Din from 1-6 February  1994.    The meeting was inaugurated by a Koranic recitation. The  chairman of the Executive Council then read a report on the  INC's activities during 1993 and the agenda of the meeting was  approved. The agenda includes a review of recent developments  inside Iraq and on the regional and international levels with  regard to the Iraqi issue. The conferees studied the report  presented by the chairman of the Executive Council.    In light of this, the following committees were formed to  discuss matters in detail:    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee; the International  Affairs Committee; the Financial Committee; the Administration  and Organizational Committee; and the 1994 Plan Committee.    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee discussed ways to  promote the INC's relations with the neighborly states, the Arab  states, and the Islamic world to serve the cause of the Iraqi  people and to confront dictatorship in Iraq. The committee made  many recommendations in this regard.    The International Affairs Committee dealt with developments  in the issue in terms of international organizations and foreign  countries. The committee recommended that the INC exert efforts  to ensure the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions  706 and 712, which call for providing food and medicine to the  Iraqi people to alleviate their suffering provided that the  dictatorial regime is deprived of the flow of funds.    The conferees studied the new international efforts to  implement the UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council  Resolution 688, which call for ending repression and coercion  against the Iraqi people. The conferees underscored the need to  protect human rights and called for an expansion of the no-fly  zone to cover the whole of Iraq and establish a safehaven in the  south. They also noted that the international community is  becoming firmer vis-a-vis the dictatorial regime of Saddam  Husayn and is supporting trends to set up a national democratic  alternative in Iraq that respects the will of the Arab and  Kurdish people to choose the form of their future government in  Iraq.    The Financial, Administrative, and Organizational Committees  studied financial, administrative, and organizational affairs.  The committees' reports tackled financial, administrative, and  organizational matters. The conferees discussed these issues  and made the appropriate decisions.    The conferees also made the necessary decisions and took  measures to activate the constitutional consultative council.    The committee charged with charting the 1994 plan stressed  the need to continue the conference's program and working plans  to confront the dictatorial regime and establish a democratic  alternative.    The plan touches on the principal issues in the struggle  against dictatorship, especially the political aspect. It is  aimed at implementing the conference's political statement by:  emphasizing the democratic, national alternative that we seek  to achieve; by entrenching the democratic experience in  Kurdistan; by showing concern for the unity of Iraq, which is  being threatened by the course followed by the dictatorial  regime and by the regime's continuation; by emphasizing the  importance of strengthening Arab-Kurdish brotherhood and  guaranteeing administrative and cultural national rights to the  Turkomans and Assyrians; and by seeking to create a democratic,  pluralistic, federal Iraq that strengthens the country's unity.    The plan also emphasizes the need to employ regional and  international sympathy for our people to help enact the  international resolutions and serve the struggle against  dictatorship. The plan also emphasizes our reliance on our  people's administration to establish an alternative of their  choice.    The plan is also aimed at strengthening the conference's  initiatives on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels to  win greater attention from the world in support of the Iraqi  cause.    On the subject of human rights, we stress the need to draft  a  comprehensive plan to activate and implement UN Security Council  Resolution 688. This includes the dispatch of UN observers to  monitor human rights violations in Iraq, the stationing of UN  guards in all parts of Iraq, the confrontation of all acts of  suppression practiced by the regime, and the end of the domestic  embargo imposed on liberated Kurdistan and other areas in the  south. Iraqi Kurdistan must be exempted from the international  embargo in order to alleviate the people's suffering and to help  ensure the success of democracy in the region. We must do  everything possible to stop the regime from continuing the  policy of drying up the marshlands and displacing its Arab  Shiite inhabitants. We also demand that Saddam and his gang be  brought before an international court in accordance with the  bill of indictment, which was prepared by the INC and presented  to the United Nations and other international organizations.    In the field of the media, the plan stresses the need to  adopt a policy, both inside and outside, to implement the  political directives of the conference, develop media agencies,  and provide the necessary funds and supplies for them.    The conferees also decided to consider all the papers  presented by the specialized committees, after they are  approved, as part of the 1994 plan.    The joint meeting of the two councils was briefed on certain  aspects and results of the field action. The competent agencies  in the conference have chartered the plan for the field action  for 1994.    The problems, programs, and action plan were discussed with  a sense of great responsibility. Constructive and practical  decisions and recommendations were reached in a democratic  fashion, which confirms the existence of common convictions in  all areas.    The conferees were apprised of the outcome of the meeting  held in Ankara by the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran, and  Turkey. They welcomed the ministers' statement the the internal  siege clamped on Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Iraq must be  lifted, and that electrical services must be restored to Dahuk.  They also welcomed the ministers' reiteration that Iraqi  people must be allowed to determine their future by free will.  In the same vein, the conferees would like to assert that the  continued survival of Saddam Husayn's regime poses a real threat  to the country's unity. We Iraqis, are the most concerned for  the unity of our people and homeland, the conferees noted.    The conferees underlined their eagerness and constant  efforts  to establish a democratic Iraq that would promote regional  security and stability, contribute to the establishment of good  relations with neighboring countries, and foster the economic  growth of the peoples of the region.    The conferees hailed the third anniversary of the glorious  popular uprising of March 1991, which expressed the people's  will against dictatorship and constituted a popular referendum  demanding the ousting of the regime. They glorified the martyrs  of the uprising and the anniversary of the heroic feats forged  by the uprising's heroes. They also pledged to the martyrs to  continue the struggle until the achievement of their objective  of toppling dictatorship.    While condemning the regime's repressive and criminal  practices, the joint meeting of the INC's Presidential Council  and Executive Council commends the steadfastness and sacrifices  of the glorious Iraqi people. In the same vein, they hail the  Kurdish people's resistance, as demonstrated in their efforts to  safeguard their democratic experiment, as well as the gains they  have made for the whole of Iraq. The conferees also commend our  people's steadfastness and resistance in southern and central  Iraq and the rest of Iraq. They urge military personnel and  Ba'thists to abandon the tyrant, to join the people's ranks in  struggle, and to step up this struggle on all levels in order to  topple dictatorship and set up a patriotic and democratic regime.    And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your  work, and His Apostle, and the believers. [part of a Koranic  verse]    [signed] The Presidential Council and Executive Council of  the united INC, Salah-al-Din, Irbil    [dated] 6 February 1994, corresponding to 24 Sha'ban 1414  Hegira</p>

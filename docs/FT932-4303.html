			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Brittan admits flaws in aid THE European Community is to reform its Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.18bn) aid programmes in the former Soviet bloc, following allegations that they are slow and poorly managed. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, yesterday promised to streamline and decentralise the Ecu1bn Phare programme - aimed at central and eastern Europe - and the Ecu500m Tacis programme for the former Soviet Union. Addressing the European Parliament's external relations and budgetary control committees, Sir Leon said the Community needed 'to learn from its mistakes as well as its successes'. MEPs attacked the Commission, manager of the Phare and Tacis programmes, for the slow disbursement of funds, which are used for technical assistance and advice in areas such as food distribution, privatisation, banking and civil service reform. The deputies also took up the criticisms of some east European beneficiaries that the programmes rely heavily on costly consultants, favouring northern EC member states which are strong in that sector. Sir Leon conceded that bureaucratic procedures and a lack of specialist know-how had hampered the work of the EC in eastern Europe. 'We are increasingly discovering that the pool of qualified know-how is limited and sometimes less qualified than we and the beneficiaries expect,' he said. He also promised to take tough action to prevent member states from influencing the selection of projects in favour of their own commercial interests. 'Phare and Tacis are not a form of outdoor relief for member state consultants,' Sir Leon said, adding that the Commission would try to ensure that projects were selected 'purely on objective criteria' in future. Sir Leon said the main elements of reform would include greater involvement of beneficiary countries in helping to make the projects work, with the EC restricting itself to development of the framework policy. 'Such a change would lead to less bureaucracy, more flexibility and a greater appreciation of the Community's efforts by the recipient countries,' he said.</p>

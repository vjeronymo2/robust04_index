			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDIAN AIRLINES AIRBUS 320 CRASHES APPROACHING RUNWAY, KILLING 91  </P> <P> An Indian Airlines jet with 146 people aboard crashed and burst into flames  while attempting to land at a southern Indian airport today and 91 people were  killed, authorities said.  </P> <P> The Airbus 320 crashed at 1 p.m. (11:30 p.m. Tuesday PST) while on final  approach to the runway at Bangalore airport, airline and airport officials  said. The plane apparently grazed a grove of trees and crashed about 50 yards  from the runway, they said.  </P> <P> State-run television showed shots of the crash site, a grassy plain on a golf  course adjacent to the airport. The craft's tail was intact, but its fuselage  was shattered and charred and the nose smashed.  </P> <P> "The crash occurred before the plane touched the runway, and it caught fire as  soon as it crashed," said P. S. Shetty, airport manager in Bombay, where the  hourlong flight originated.  </P> <P> The crash was the first by the sophisticated Airbus 320 on a commercial flight.  One of the planes crashed during a demonstration flight at an air show in  eastern France in 1988, killing three people and injuring 50.  </P> <P> Airline officials said the plane, which was an hour behind schedule, carried  139 passengers and a crew of seven.  </P> <P> One airline official said 17 foreigners were believed to be on the flight. The  foreigners included two Americans, a Frenchman, two Canadians, three Japanese  and a Hong Kong resident, all of whom survived, said the spokesman.  </P> <P> "My husband's presence of mind helped me to get out of the aircraft through the  back door," said Marook Sadhwa, a 29-year-old Canadian who was being treated  for burns. "As soon as we came out, we ran for a few yards and there were two  or three minor explosions."  </P> <P> Local villagers rushed out of their huts and across the field littered with  baggage and debris toward the flaming wreckage. Local police were called to try  to keep them away.  </P> <P> Airline officials did not know what caused the crash, but they said weather was  not a factor. The jet was acquired by the nation's government-run domestic  carrier about three months ago for $38 million.  </P> <P> After Indian Airlines announced it was adding 31 Airbus 320s to its aging fleet  of Boeing, Fokker and Avro planes, news reports criticized the airline for  failing to adequately train pilots to fly the sophisticated aircraft, the first  civilian airliner with a fully computerized flight control system.  </P> <P> Developed at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the A320 was certified for flight on  Feb. 26, 1988, and went into service in April, 1988.  </P></p>

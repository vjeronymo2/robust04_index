			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Empire 'oui' to 125p cash bid EMPIRE STORES Group, the mail order retailer, has recommended its shareholders to accept the 125p per share cash offer from Redoute Catalogue, part of La Redoute, the French catalogue retail group. Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman of Empire, recommended the offer although the board believed it did 'not fully reflect the value of Empire'. Empire claims a 7 per cent share of the UK mail order market. Its shares were unchanged yesterday at 127p. The recommendation was not supported by Gecos, the Italian retail group which holds 24.2 per cent of Empire, has been a shareholder since 1984 and has two representatives on the board. It is taking independent advice and will clarify it's position by May 1. It could remain a minority holder even if Redoute's offer succeeds, and if sufficient other holders did not accept, the listing might be kept. Redoute said last night it was pleased with the recommendation, but concerned about a 'very gloomy trading statement' made by Empire as part of its recommendation, and the lack of a profit forecast for the financial year ending this weekend. The first closing date for Redoute's offer is tomorrow but Redoute has already promised to extend this to May 8. Redoute said from the start that its offer, launched in mid-March, would not be increased. This followed its purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Empire from Great Universal Stores, the retail, property and finance company, and a promise to GUS that the subsequent offer would be final. Redoute already held almost 26 per cent of Empire when it bought the GUS stake, giving it 37.9 per cent. Mr Mays-Smith said Empire was recommending the offer, which values the group at Pounds 49m, because trading had worsened since the group announced an interim loss of Pounds 951,000 in January. Sales had 'held up less well than we had expected' he said, and 'sales in recent weeks have been particularly disappointing'. The group had also suffered a rise in bad debts. He said 'as a result the group's results in the current year will fall short of those for which we had hoped at the time of my interim statement'. Another reason for the recommendation was that the UK mail order industry was being shaken up following the sale of Grattan to Otto Versand, the German retailer, and the possible sale by Littlewoods of its mail order side. This was likely to make the market more competitive. Also the performance of Empire's shares, if it remained independent, was likely to be affected by Redoute's holding. The recommendation to shareholders also said they should accept 'unless a higher offer is announced'. However, analysts said the chances of a rival bid were slim given Redoute's stake. If a rival bidder had been interested it would probably have shown its hand by now. Mr Mays-Smith said the group was not in discussions with any other bidder.</p>

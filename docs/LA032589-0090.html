			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESSFUL RECORD CITED;  </P> <P> DEL MAR GROUP SELECTED TO RUN RACE TRACK FOR 20 MORE YEARS  </P> <P> Citing the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club's success at drawing people while  maintaining the suburban tranquility of surrounding cities, the state Race  Track Leasing Commission decided Friday to begin negotiations with the club for  a new 20-year contract to run the famed track.  </P> <P> The decision by the six-member commission, established by state lawmakers  solely to select an operator for the Del Mar Racetrack, ended a long, grueling  evaluation.  </P> <P> After spending nine months reviewing proposals from six applicants for the  contract to run the annual 43-day horse-racing season, the commission narrowed  the field to two finalists: the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, the track's current  operator, and John Brunetti, a New Jersey construction magnate and operator of  Florida's Hialeah Park Racetrack.  </P> <P> Familiarity with the Thoroughbred Club and its plans to continue to emphasize  horse racing, rather than use the race track for a number of entertainment  events as proposed by other bidders, apparently weighed heavily in the final  decision.  </P> <P> During the hearings by the commission, civic leaders and residents from Del Mar  and neighboring Solana Beach backed the Thoroughbred Club and expressed concern  about zealous profiteers who might introduce raucous concerts and destroy  neighborhood serenity.  </P> <P> "I believe we have two strong proposals," commission member Bob Vice said. "But  I believe we have to choose an operator that can deal with the concerns of the  local community and generate the best return for the state.  </P> <P> Describing the Thoroughbred Club as "a credible operator who has a willingness  to work with the commission and who has a proven record," Vice proposed that  the club be awarded the 20-year contract.  </P> <P> From the start, the local Thoroughbred Club was considered the favorite to win  the contract, based on its accomplishments over the last 19 years. The  organization guided the track from obscurity to prominence.  </P> <P> "We're delighted," said Joe Harper, executive vice president and general  manager of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. "It's going to be a lot different  from when we started 19 years ago. There's a lot more money to be generated and  we're looking forward to it."  </P> <P> Harper also said the club's nonprofit status -- all revenue is returned either  to the operation or the state -- helped it win the contract.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Relations  </P> <P> The club has maintained good relations with local communities, as demonstrated  by the endorsements it received from local homeowners' association and city  councils.  </P> <P> During the commission's last hearing, the Thoroughbred Club was backed by a  parade of supporters who spoke on its behalf.  </P> <P> "We're proud of the class operation run by the Thoroughbred Club," said Brooke  Eisenberg, Del Mar's deputy mayor. Eisenberg also expressed concern about  Brunetti's inexperience working in San Diego County.  </P> <P> "His ability to negotiate with labor in San Diego County is an unknown," she  said.  </P> <P> But Brunetti wasn't without supporters.  </P> <P> "All of you are concerned about an outsider coming in," said Raul Martinez, the  mayor of Hialeah. "But I urge you to consider Mr. Brunetti not as a stranger  but as a man who has a commitment to make the industry better, not just Hialeah  or Del Mar."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credited Brunetti  </P> <P> Martinez, who said he attended the hearing voluntarily, credited Brunetti for  turning around his city's once-failing race track.  </P> <P> Although the Thoroughbred Club was ahead at the finish line, Brunetti, who  promised to produce more revenue by holding more promotional events, adding  races and luring top-flight thoroughbreds, appeared to be gaining momentum  during the final months of the selection process.  </P> <P> "We felt that we were a long shot, but I thought our chances were improving,"  Brunetti said.  </P> <P> Brunetti said he knew from the start that he was fighting an uphill battle  against a hometown favorite. The commission's decision to hold the hearings in  Del Mar placed him at an even greater disadvantage, Brunetti added.  </P> <P> "If this was held in Florida, I could have brought in the same amount of  support," Brunetti said. "I think things may have been different if this took  place in Sacramento. I believe it would have been a lot more objective."  </P> <P> But Harper disagreed.  </P> <P> "The commission agreed months ago to hold the hearings here," Harper said.  "Because it is a local issue, the community has to have its say."  </P></p>

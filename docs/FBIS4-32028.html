			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mihai Fabian] </F>   [Text] In an unmistakable manner, Corneliu Coposu,  president of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic  Party] is making efforts -- as George Padure's advertisement  might say -- to make the life of each Romanian "a bit better."  The fact that he starts from presenting his own person, with  his (social) classmates, or with his party colleagues, and that  he does not show the least interest in the life of the majority  of the people is his own business. However, this attitude  cannot leave indifferent those many who are threatened from two  sides at once. One side is represented by the fact that, to  reach his goal -- the one that he has clearly and openly  declared, namely, to bring back former King Mihai to the throne  -- Coposu and "his group" will do all they can to provoke early  elections. And if they win those elections (that is what he  believes) the Constitution can be changed and the ex-king, who  is exiled to Versoix, will be able to return to Romania, and  might even drive under the Arc de Triomphe in a jeep similar to  the one that U.S. General Patton was driving during the  debarkation in Normandy...    It is obvious that early elections can be provoked only by a  crisis. But, we are quite aware of what a crisis means and we  are sort of fed up with it. However, the change of the  Constitution will have to have the approval of the electorate.  This is the only note of optimism (for us) in the tenebrous  threats voiced by the PNTCD leader; it is difficult to assume  that the Romanian people, who spoke out for the Republic in  1991, would willingly change their options in 1995 on the  alleged ground that there is no leader -- certainly except for  the ex-monarch -- who can currently polarize the sympathy of the  electorate, as Coposu affirms. It is true that a great part of  the electorate does not know what the monarchy meant and might  be seduced by the much-publicized slogans according to which the  monarch would "save" Romania.    The other side -- and unfortunately for Coposu, this side is  much larger -- knows what the ex-monarch really meant for our  country. Thus, as far as the popular vote (we cannot help it,  the expression defines the reality) is concerned, it cannot be  really changed.    The more so since, while revealing such an obvious lack of  competence that for a moment we almost thought that we are  facing a trick that we cannot figure out, Coposu also threatens  us, apart from reinstating the monarchy, with the implementation  of the much-publicized integral restitution of property  (restitutio in integrum). This means that such an extraordinary  polarization will take place in Romanian society, and will  result in such a gap between the rich (a few) and the poor (the  majority) that not even the liberals, who are known for having a  cure to all ailments, will be able to fill it up.    The integral restitution of all the goods that in one way or  another have become state property, usually through violation of  the law, would mean repairing an error by committing a much  greater error. We are not referring only to a few million  tenants who will see themselves thrown out in the streets, and  peasants who will return to the state of serfdom, although  nobody is entitled to play with the fate of these people. We  are talking about the complete destruction of the work carried  out by millions of Romanians for scores of years, who created  factories out of small workshops, blocks of flats on empty lots  that were left untended, and holiday resorts at the seaside or  at the mountain, in one word a patrimony for which we have all  made great efforts, but less those who, willingly or  unwillingly, stayed far from the homeland and who -- when  Coposu's dream comes true -- will not hesitate to come and claim  their properties.    The distinguished PNTCD president seems not to have taken  all  this into consideration. Moreover, he believes in a favorable  response to the intentions he clearly expressed: the restoration  of the monarchy and "restitutio in integrum." The insistence he  has displayed to fulfill this "credo" makes us believe that the  PNTCD leader wishes no longer to be part of the parliamentary  opposition. Maybe he finds the ... street more comfortable. In  any event, by militating for the return of big lands to past  landowners or their current successors, Coposu has proved again  -- as if it was still necessary -- how "close" he is to the soul  of these people whom we call peasants and through whose efforts  Romania has always managed to get out of any impasse. Coposu  added the "chance" of his unequivocal speech to the common sense  of this peasant, who has always known whom his friends are. His  speech will be "sanctioned" accordingly, even if it will not  happen so soon. As far as the road from Republic to monarchy is  concerned, we do not even bother to try to convince Coposu that  for the immense majority of Romanians this is inconceivable.  But one should grant him what is rightfully his! That is, we  must recognize Coposu's "merit" and make thinner with every  passing declaration, like the aforementioned one, the not very  large group of his own camp. Through this monarchist zeal,  Coposu is the best advertiser of the form of government that  currently prevails in our country, that is, the Republic. In  other words, Coposu is campaigning for the Republic without  being aware of it...</p>

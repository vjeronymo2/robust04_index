"Large-scale aggression against Tajikistan is out of the  question, although groups of 50 to 200 men might try to break  into the territory of the Republic, hoping to get support from  groups within (Tajikistan) and pursuing political aims,"  Colonel-General Boris Pyankov told reporters in Dushanbe on  Wednesday. He said he was sure the 15 April deadline for the  peacekeepers' presence in Tajikistan would be moved to 31  December.    Pyankov said all financial and other problems the  Commonwealth force initially faced had been solved. He said  Russia was paying 50 percent of the expenditure for the  peacekeepers, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were paying 15 percent  each, and Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan 10 percent each.    The general said Tajikistan's leadership wished the force to  be enlarged and that it might suggest that Armenia, Ukraine and  Belarus send in reinforcements. But he doubted that Belarus  would send in any troops, its legislation banning the use of its  armed forces outside its territory.    Pyankov on the whole expressed approval of the idea of  having  more CIS states involved in the peacekeeping mission, for this  would "eliminate all mistrust and give the lie to the  accusations that Russia acts as an imperial power."    He said the initiative for giving the peacekeepers the  status  of a U.N. force had nearly been killed off, the United Nations  being unable to fund it. But Russia is ready to pay for its  peacekeepers anywhere in the CIS if the United Nations  recognizes those expenses as Russia's payments for U.N.  peacekeeping missions, Pyankov said. He said a proposal to that  effect might be made to U.N. secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, currently visiting Moscow.</p>

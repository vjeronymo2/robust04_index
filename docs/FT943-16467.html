			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Forbes' new homes at Carlton and Royal Insurance Anthony Forbes, 56, who stepped down as joint senior partner of Cazenove &amp; Co at the end of April, has started to collect his first non-executive directorships. He has joined the board of Carlton Communications and will join Royal Insurance Holdings on August 10. Forbes, who joined Cazenove in 1960 after Eton and the Coldstream Guards, was one of two men who ran the city's best-connected firm of stock brokers for 14 years. His colleague John Kemp-Welch, 58, takes over as chairman of the London Stock Exchange on July 14. Kemp-Welch has already been appointed a non-executive director of Sun Alliance. Forbes knows Carlton Communications well; Cazenove is one of the firm's brokers. He soon expects to collect another couple of non-executive directorships.</p>

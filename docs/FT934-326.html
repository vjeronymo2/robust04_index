			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Company reaction For companies, what steps they are required to take if the solvency threshold is breached is also important. The Goode proposal that companies should have three months to make amends, if the fund falls below 90 per cent solvency, looks harsh. Companies could find themselves facing a sudden and unexpected liability. The strain on corporate cash flow could be intense, especially for companies with a large pension scheme in relation to their current business. Faced with that risk, companies might prefer the comfort of a money-purchase scheme instead. The solvency debate underlines that valuing pension funds is an inexact science. Since pension surpluses make up a large proportion of earnings for some companies, that is of concern for the equity market too. The current accounting standard for pension costs allows companies a great deal of latitude in choosing what assumptions are used when valuing the pension fund. The Accounting Standards Board is therefore right to press for greater consistency. The ASB faces the same dilemma as the Goode Committee. Prudence demands that pension costs should not be understated. But rules that are too tight might drive companies away from final salary schemes altogether. Valuing pension liabilities anually with reference annuity rates - the cost of buying deferred annuities from insurance companies - is the method favoured by many accountants. That would provide a common benchmark between companies. Since annuity rates rise and fall with gilt yields, and depend on the willingness of insurance companies to sell such policies, a more volatile pension charge could also result. In periods of very low bond yields - 1994 looks like being a good example - companies would also face much higher pension costs than are currently being charged.</p>

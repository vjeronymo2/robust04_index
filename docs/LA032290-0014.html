			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIBERACE'S LOVER TESTIFIES IN QUADRUPLE  MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> A former lover of the late entertainer Liberace Wednesday linked both  defendants in the Laurel Canyon murder trial to the house where four people  were bludgeoned to death in 1981.  </P> <P> Scott Thorson, 31, who said he received a settlement of $95,000 after he filed  a palimony suit against Liberace, testified that he was staying at the Studio  City home of defendant Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah in 1981 when he overheard a  violent argument between Nash and porno movie star John Holmes.  </P> <P> Nash and co-defendant Gregory Diles, Nash's bodyguard, were "beating Mr. Holmes  up," Thorson said under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Dale Davidson. "I  heard Mr. Nash . . . telling Mr. Holmes that if he didn't take him to where  those people were who robbed him, he would have every member of his family  killed."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that the murders were in retaliation for a robbery two days  earlier by three occupants of the house, with Holmes' aid.  </P></p>

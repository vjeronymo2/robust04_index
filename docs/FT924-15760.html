			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Bank on the poor THE BUSH administration is often criticised for a lack of vision in policy, but it has shown foresight in its dealings with Latin America. Its decision to seek, for example, a free trade agreement with Mexico and to offer that prospect to other Latin countries has provided a genuine opportunity to change an often adversarial relationship. This constructive attitude is reflected in radical, but thoughtful, proposals to reform the InterAmerican Development Bank outlined last month by the Treasury. Behind them are worries that democracy and the recent economic advances in Latin America - reforms of budgets and the structure of economies, which are beginning to be reflected in growth - may be jeopardised by popular reaction. The perception that adjustment programmes benefit the rich and hurt the poor  -sometimes, but not universally, true - needs to be corrected. An important element of the wide-ranging US proposals for the IADB is a concrete attempt to address this issue. It suggests half of the bank's lending should be devoted to improving the lot of the worse off and making sure the benefits of growth are more broadly spread. This is not only good politics, it is good economics. Investing in the poor, in better primary education and improved health provision, in particular, yields high economic returns. A promise to focus on poverty is easy to outline, tough to carry out. Getting money through to the needy has been a long-standing problem for the region's governments own poverty programmes. Cash passes through many greedy hands before reaching the needy, and badly-designed poverty programmes can raise a country's debt without benefiting its people. Washington has recognised that the bank's offices must be restructured to allow close collaboration with affected populations. The IADB has undergone significant changes, mostly for the better, over the past few years. Now it must accept further change. The US proposals are sensible and have been set out in a constructive fashion. They should be welcomed in the region and taken up next year, by whatever administration is in the White House.</p>

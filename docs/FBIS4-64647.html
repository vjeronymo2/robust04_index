			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/379: "Commission Publishes </F> Annual Report on U.S. Trade Barriers"]    [Excerpt] The European Commission is issuing today its  tenth report on U.S. barriers to trade and investment. The  report is not only a useful guideline and reference for  bilateral trade negotiations between the European Union and the  United States but also summarizes the obstacles inhibiting the  free flow of transatlantic trade and investment and the main  trade barriers European business faces in a significant number  of U.S. markets. The bulk of the European Union's trade with  the United States is not affected by trade barriers.  Furthermore, for the relatively small percentage of the trade  that does face barriers there will be fewer in the future due to  the wide scope of the Uruguay Round and public procurement  agreements that were finally concluded in Marrakesh in April  1994.    This year, the report also points out the areas where the  United States has to implement the Uruguay Round agreements.  The faithful and timely transposition of these agreements into  U.S. national legislation is of major importance to ensure that  the benefits of the Round are capitalized on as soon as  possible. It is important that the United States and the  European Union demonstrate leadership in implementing the  Uruguay Round results which will boost world trade and economic  growth, create jobs as well as lowering transatlantic trade  friction.    The publication of the tenth report follows the United  States' publication of its annual national trade estimate report  on foreign trade barriers. The Commission services report,  however, is not a direct response to the U.S. report. The two  reports differ in one major respect: Under U.S. trade law, the  U.S. report could lead the United States to impose unilateral  trade sanctions due to President Clinton's executive order on  identification of trade expansion priorities of March 1994,  which reintroduced a super 301 procedure. The Commission  services report, however, does not serve such ends. The European  Union is committed to full compliance with the multilateral GATT  rules and those of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). It  urges the United States to do likewise. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Key U.S. Impediments to Trade and Investment </H5>   The European Commission services report identifies major  horizontal and sectoral areas where access to U.S. markets is  potentially threatened or excluded. These  are:     -  Unilateralism in U.S. trade legislation: The U.S. has  recently undertaken to renew the super 301 legislation by way of  a presidential executive order. No other major trading partner  of the EU has similar trade legislation. Such moves point to a  renewed impetus in the U.S. towards increased use of unilateral  or bilateral trade measures, and are a cause of great concern to  the EU. They are largely inconsistent and incompatible with the  multilateral trade system -- the backbone of post-war global  economic growth.    -  The extraterritorial application of national  trade provisions: These measures can adversely effect trade and  investment by clashing with the sovereignty of America's trading  partners and thereby lead to insoluble legal conflicts which  create uncertainty and deter investment. Examples include the  Cuban Democracy Act, reexport controls and the marine mammal  protection act.    -  The extensive use of national security  considerations: The United States continues to put forward  national security considerations to justify curbs on trade and  investment in pursuit of certain protectionist objectives.  Measures range from limits on market share to procurement  restrictions, such as those contained in the Berry Amendment  Legislation, and from unilateral export controls to the  screening and possible prohibition of foreign direct investment,  for example through the Exon-Florio amendment. A restrictive  1934 act limits foreign investment in radio communications to 20  percent of the capital stock of any corporation in this area of  business.    -  Public procurement and "buy America" legislation:  There has been extensive discrimination, and even total  exclusion, of non-U.S. controlled companies for certain public  contracts tendered at federal and state level. A recent joint  study by the EU and the United States pointed out the extent of  these measures covering areas such as ports, airports and mass  transit schemes. However, the recent EU-U.S. bilateral  government procurement agreement signed in Marrakesh has helped  to open up substantial parts of the U.S. procurement  market.    -  High tariffs, fees, and excessive invoicing  requirements: The Uruguay Round will greatly improve access to  each other's markets. However the United States textiles,  clothing, footwear, tableware, and glassware tariffs are still  excessive with tariff rates as high as 40 percent for some  items, higher than many developing countries apply. Tariffs  applied for two-door multipurpose vehicles, presently considered  by the U.S. as trucks, are burdened with a 25 percent tariff on  imports (instead of the 2.5 percent tariff applied to cars),  this despite a May 1993 ruling by the U.S. Court of  International Trade to the contrary.    -  Tax legislation such as  state unitary taxation, car taxes (luxury tax, gas guzzler tax,  cafe) which are the subject of a GATT panel request by the EU.  The discriminatory luxury tax for example has meant the  European manufacturers have incurred almost 80 percent of the  tax revenue, while only having a 3 percent market share. Beer  and wine excise taxes are also unsatisfactory.    -  The multiplicity  of standards at federal, state and municipal level, as well as  protectionist labelling requirements hinder trading  opportunities: Multiple standards and standard-making  procedures in the United States, some of which are in breach of  international norms, and the resulting fragmentation of the U.S.  market add up to indirect barriers to trade. The EU and the  United States are engaged in consultations in order to reduce  such impediments.    -  The protection of intellectual property: This  has caused conflicts, notably the continuing discrimination  against non-U.S. products through section 337 of the tariff act  of 1930, despite a GATT ruling to the contrary. The agreement  on trade related aspects of intellectual property has resolved  some of the issues provided it is faithfully transposed into us  legislation.    -  The conditioning of the granting of national  treatment to non-U.S. controlled economic operators in the  United States: Companies with non-U.S. parents are often  treated differently to those with U.S. parents regarding  antitrust exposure of production joint ventures, or the  participation in federally funded R&amp;D. This discrimination is  brought about through reciprocity conditions and economic  performance requirements, and could make EU investment notably  less attractive in the United States. There are no less than 11  bills pending in the Congress with these conditional national  treatment provisions. In the same spirit the EU is concerned  about impediments to foreign service providers to obtain  effective access to the services markets in the United States as  well as pressures to discriminate against foreign  banks.    -  Antidumping and countervailing duties: the EU had to  request a GATT panel last year after finding that the United  States did not respect reasonable countervailing and antidumping  procedures and methodology regarding a major part of the EU's  steel exports. In a more recent case, provisional dumping  duties of over 300 percent have been levied on a European based  subsidiary of a Japanese company. The implementation of the  Uruguay Round AD/CVD agreements are being carefully monitored by  the European Commission.    -  Agriculture, fisheries, services,  telecommunications and broadcasting: In all these sectors, the  EU recognises that the Uruguay Round will bring relief to  historical trade tension that has prevailed and affected  transatlantic trade relations. Nevertheless considerable  obstacles will have to be overcome to provide European industry  with meaningful and sustained market access.    -  The maritime and  aviation sectors: The EU remains very concerned at the use of  direct and indirect protection provided to the United States  shipbuilding industry (via the Jones Act). It is also worth  recalling the persistently high level of indirect subsidies  funnelled into the United States aircraft industries through  various federally funded programmes.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Domestic concerns about the competitivity of U.S. industry  continue to exercise considerable influence on the formulation  of U.S. trade policy both within Congress and the U.S.  Government. The revitalisation of the "super 301" procedures  through presidential executive order, proposals to install  "green" and "blue" 301 provisions to cover environmental and  social concerns, the unreasonable application of anti-dumping  and countervailing duty measures against exports from the EU,  and the growing proliferation of conditional national treatment  provisions either still pending in Congress or already enacted  are indicators of a residual undercurrent of protectionism and  unilateralism that still exist in the United States. All these  measures are anathema to an open world trading system which  should be based on one set of negotiated multilateral rules and  procedures fairly applied to all contracting parties in the GATT.    The signing of the Uruguay Round has removed a significant  number of trade irritants between the European Union and the  United States. Given the broad balance in EU/U.S. trade flows,  there is now a major opportunity to cooperate and work together  on the new trade issues of tomorrow. Furthermore EU and U.S.  leadership will be essential to continue to remove global trade  barriers thereby opening up new opportunities for all trading  nations.</p>

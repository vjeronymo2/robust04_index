			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CUBAN BASEBALL: IT'S BIG LEAGUE IN ITS OWN WAY  </P> <P> Tired of baseball lockouts and strikes? Wish the game were played more for fun  than for money?  </P> <P> Come to Cuba.  </P> <P> On the field, the play is very much big league: Fastballs that hum in at 90  plus mph and double plays turned as smoothly as the swings of the guys with the  bats.  </P> <P> Watch Javier Mendez uncoil from his slight crouch and belt one over the sign  advertising Fidel Castro's next big speech. Like Cuba's politics, Mendez swings  from the left.  </P> <P> He looks like he would feel at home in almost any big league lineup. Off the  field, though, U.S. and Cuban baseball are as different as the two countries'  politics.  </P> <P> There is no such thing as an "owner" in the George Steinbrenner sense. All  enterprises in Cuba belong to the state, including baseball teams.  </P> <P> Nor are there "player demands" in Cuba. These fellows, some of them world class  players, have to settle for their 100 pesos or so a month, no questions asked.  Collective bargaining? Forget it.  </P> <P> Cuba-born Jose Canseco, who left the island as an infant, makes about as much  playing for the Oakland A's in a single inning (over $1,000) as the average  Cuban player makes in a year and that's no typo.  </P> <P> There's no army of people needed here to handle finances. Admission is free and  there are no advertising revenues. (Castro gets to put up his sign for free. He  has other ballpark signs as well: "Socialism or Death" and "Ready to Conquer.")  </P> <P> By U.S. standards, Cuban players endure extraordinary hardships. All travel is  done by bus on this 800-mile wide island. Because of the U.S. embargo,  American-made aluminum bats, the kind Cubans prefer, are in short supply. Some  players are forced to use a bat size not to their liking.  </P> <P> Several teams, including Havana, live in barracks-like structures. Even during  homestands, the players get to go home to their government-provided apartments  only on the days always set aside for open dates, Mondays and Fridays.  </P> <P> If a player is a student during the off-season, his salary could be as low as  50 pesos a month. At the official exchange rate, that's only about $45. Kirby  Puckett spills that much before breakfast. Can you imagine Orel Hershiser  toiling away for $45 a month?  </P> <P> If a player works as a 150-peso a-month laborer during the off season, he makes  the same salary when he's playing ball. If he averages three homers and 10  RBI's a game, it makes no difference: 150 pesos a month, end discussion.  </P> <P> But with housing, food and transportation provided for, the players don't  complain, at least not openly.  </P> <P> "We're not rich but we have our needs resolved," says Juan Padilla, a whiz  around second base for the Havana team.  </P> <P> Ahh, Cuban baseball. Memories of Minnie Minoso, Pedro Ramos, Sandy Amoros,  Camilo Pasqual, Tony Perez. The Havana Sugar Kings of the International League.  In the last 22 world amateur baseball championships, Cuba has won 19 times,  finished second once and third twice, according to Baseball Commissioner Manuel  Morales.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable baseball men figure 35 to 40 Cubans are of major league calibre.  Cuban pitching appears to be mostly minor league level but it's not hard to  envision Cubans at other positions, particularly infielders, dazzling crowds at  Candlestick or Fenway.  </P> <P> When asked about his lavishly paid counterparts in the U.S. "ligas grandes,"  Mendez, 25, shrugs and says he sees no need for salaries in the million-plus  range.  </P> <P> "There comes a time when that kind of money corrupts," he says. Castro agrees,  often lamenting that the U.S. is plagued by "irrational consumerism." Some  people, he says, think they have to have "65 shirts." Wonder what he would say  about major leaguers who buy Mercedes by the six-pack?  </P> <P> Mendez is standing in the barracks where he and his mates from the Havana team  live.  </P> <P> The season is 23 games old and Mendez has been brutalizing opposing pitching,  hitting a league-leading .392. He has six home runs and 19 RBI's. Injuries  hampered his performance in previous seasons but no longer. It's about four  hours before gametime, and most of the team is watching an afternoon soap opera  on TV.  </P> <P> The trappings for the players evoke memories of boot camp: seven players to a  room, no privacy.  </P> <P> Manager Servio Borges calls the place a "sporting motel." It is located in the  heart of a sports complex south of the city. Much of the area is devoted to  training athletic instructors.  </P> <P> With a 17-6 record, Havana is leading the eight-team league in what is known as  the "serie selectiva," the prestige tournament of the several Cuba holds each  year. Many players compete virtually all 12 months. The "selectiva" is the  competition Cuban fans wait for. The winner of the 63-game season gets to play  abroad and earns bug-eyed adulation from their fans. With fewer players, the  calibre of play is higher than the 18-team national competition held between  November and January.  </P> <P> Borges, 43, likes the idea of having his players live under one roof. Last  year, they all lived at home and the team played poorly, so poorly that the  local Communist Party chapter sat down with the team for a pep talk. (This  happens to other teams as well.)  </P> <P> Borges says discipline is better this year and the record shows it. Still, he's  antsy. The pressures on him are no less than those faced by Tom Lasorda or Don  Zimmer. There's not much to do in Cuba, so people watch baseball and root hard.  Morales, the baseball commissioner, says 72% of Cuban televisions are regularly  tuned in to a game.  </P> <P> Castro, a one-time pitching prospect before making a career switch, likes the  Santiago team from Cuba's east end. He was raised nearby and, besides, that is  the city where the revolution began.  </P> <P> Borges feels he and his team are constantly under the microscope. The  "Girardillos," as his team is called, finished in second place four years in a  row and it's been 15 years since Havana has won the "selectiva." The fans are  getting impatient.  </P> <P> On this particular evening, the team dines together on pork chops at the sports  complex and then boards the bus for the half hour ride to Latin American  Stadium. As usual, Borges is nervous. The bus takes off behind schedule and he  won't have time for the pregame meeting. Borges insists his players are nervous  as well but the horseplay on the bus leaves a different impression.  </P> <P> Tonight's opponent is Las Villas, a team from the central part of the country,  and Havana is gunning for a three-game sweep. From the dressing room, the  Havana team (known officially as Ciudad Habana) heads for the field, descending  cement steps that have been chipped away by player spikes since 1946 when this  relic, unsullied by artificial turf, was built.  </P> <P> The stadium seats 60,000 (some other playing fields in the league hold only  12,000) but there is a homey atmosphere, with many seats close to the action.  It has a charm that some of the astroturfed U.S. ballfields lack.  </P> <P> There are relatively few private cars in Cuba so most fans walk to the park or  take the bus. Shortly before gametime, with about 25,000 people in the stadium,  about a third of the parking lot -- there are only about 150 spaces -- is  filled. For the fans, the nice part is walking in and sitting down free of  charge. The choicest seats are reserved for families of the players and VIP's.  </P> <P> The atmosphere is relaxed. Here at least, the totalitarian police state  ambience that American conservatives fret about is missing. Blacks predominate  in the stands and on the playing field. Fans are expected to return foul balls  hit into the stands. About 10 to 15 balls are used per game, well below the  major league average.  </P> <P> A strapping right-hander, Lazaro Valle, only 19, has been picked to start for  the home team. Borges says he's one of the three best pitchers in the league.  Control would be his biggest problem tonight.  </P> <P> For their part, the Girardillos are having few problems solving the Las Villas  starter, Roberto Almarales, a slim righty. The home team, clad in blue and  white, gets to him early.  </P> <P> LAT  </P></p>

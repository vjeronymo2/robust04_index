			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed account of "undelivered speech" by Federation </F> Council Deputy Petr Romanov under the "Talking About the Treaty  Aloud and to Yourself" rubric: "Facing Up to Life" -- first  paragraph is introduction]    [Text] As we have already reported, the Federation Council  approved the Treaty on Social Accord without discussion and  instructed Speaker V. Shumeyko to sign it. Deputy Petr Romanov,  who voted against, sent his undelivered speech to the editorial  office.    The problem of choice has always faced and will always face  each and every one of us, and very often we have to choose  between loyalty and honor. The ancients used to say: "Loyalty  cannot prevail over honor." Unfortunately, we sometimes forget  this piece of wisdom, as we have in the Federation Council.    I recall with shame our meeting with the prime minister.  Instead of demanding from him an account of what had been done,  of what the government intends to work on, and of the help it  needs from us, we began vying with one another in expressions of  loyal sentiment. First, we spent time deciding, with a most  serious expression on our face, where best to seat our cherished  guest, then, with utter inappropriateness, we burst out with  applause in response to his proposal to abolish public holidays.  As if this will solve the problem when the country is already  working a three- or four-day week. You get the impression that  many of us are more concerned about loyalty to the regime than  the honor and dignity of the Federation Council and its  accountability to the people and history.    And today, in the process of working on the agreement, you  get the impression that we have been away from Russia for a  couple of years and that now this treaty is for us the light at  the end of the tunnel. But no, these are the lights of an  oncoming locomotive, the driving force of which is supplied by  the awakened working class and peasantry. In the last century a  classic author uttered these remarkable words: Politics is the  concentrated expression of economics. I think these words would  sound more appropriate now if reversed: "Economics is the  concentrated expression of politics." In other words, the  economy we have is nothing but the fruit of the political  actions of the current leadership of the country. It is now  necessary to talk about and include on the agenda the following  item: The political crisis of the regime and, as its  consequences, the collapse of the economy, the collapse, that  is, rather than a temporary stoppage of the economy. We should  all appreciate that if the political conditions are not changed,  no changes will be achieved in the economy. Therefore we must  not sign the treaty because:    first, it brings political stability to the president and  government, guarantees of loyalty to them and security, and  trust in the authorities;    second, the treaty does not bring economic stability to  Russian producers, the regions, and Russia;    third, the president and the executive branch avoid giving  any guarantees on their own part.    Such guarantees could be:    a) the swearing of an oath of allegiance to the new  Constitution by the president;    b) a clear and unambiguous rejection of any attempts  whatsoever to violate the Constitution by the president and  government;    c) the consideration by the Federal Assembly and possibly by  referendum of the basic principles of the reforms under way with  the aim of fashioning a course which would be supported by the  overwhelming majority of the population. I would very much like  the work of the First Russian Federal Assembly to be remembered  by the people in the same way as the reforms of Petr Arkadyevich  Stolypin or the results of the postwar restoration of the  national economy.    I conclude this speech with the words with which I began it:  Loyalty to the regime cannot prevail over honor, especially when  it is the honor of the Russian parliament.</p>

Loughran met late last week with minority  students who one week earlier had taken over his office at the Westchester  campus.  </P> <P> Although Loughran declined to comment on his discussions with the students  until he had issued a statement to the university community, he said the  meeting was mostly to confirm agreements made after the student takeover last  month.  </P> <P> In a statement, Loughran acknowledged that insensitivity toward minorities is  an issue on the campus.  </P> <P> On April 27, five minority students arrived at Loughran's office at the end of  the business day, demanding to discuss minority issues, including allegations  of racism among administrators.  </P></p>

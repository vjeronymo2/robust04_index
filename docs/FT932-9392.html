			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / French interest rates fall again THE Bank of France yesterday announced a reduction of 0.25 percentage points in its leading interest rates, the sixth fall in official rates since France's centre-right government took power six weeks ago. The intervention rate was reduced to 7.75 per cent and the short-term 5-to-10 day facility to 8.75 per cent. The bank's announcement, which followed the news from Spain, took the markets by surprise. It came only a day after the main commercial banks had reduced base rates to 9 per cent and less than a week after the last cut in official rates. Economists had anticipated further falls in French rates but had expected the French authorities to wait until after next Tuesday's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty. However, the French franc remained robust after the announcement. It ended the day at FFr3.3715 against the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.3720 on Wednesday. The stock market's response was also positive. The CAC-40 Index, which has been sluggish in recent days, edged higher to close up 0.39 at 1,879.93. Both Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, his economy minister, have made it clear that they hope for further falls in interest rates to alleviate the pressure on the French economy. Hopes of recovery were encouraged by yesterday's publication of provisional figures by the state statistics institute, Insee,indicating that inflation rose by less than 0.2 per cent in April, bringing the annual rate to just over 2.1 per cent. However, Insee also endorsed earlier warnings that the French economy is now in recession by forecasting a 1 per cent decline in the real rate of GDP growth for 1993.</p>

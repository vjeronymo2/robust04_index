			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WHAT DOES MARRIAGE MEAN TODAY?  </P> <P> Erma Bombeck is on a book tour. This Best of Bombeck originally appeared Jan.  19, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One of the hardest things in the world to explain is the difference between  being married and living with someone.  </P> <P> As an advocate of orange blossoms and long mortgages, I usually end up throwing  around a couple of high-class words such as commitment and responsibility to  offspring. When my opponent tosses back such phrases as "Love doesn't need a  piece of paper" and "Look how many people get stuck in unhappy relationships,"  I crumble. I don't have a good answer.  </P> <P> Somehow I can't seem to put my finger on that elusive bit of intimacy that  makes marriage "different." In both relationships, one shares the same  bathroom, feeds the collective dog, eats together, shops together, sleeps side  by side, and yet. . . .  </P> <P> In a recent TV show, the widowed father no longer wanted to continue his  relationship with a contemporary without marriage. She couldn't understand it.  They were doing just fine the way they were. He looked at her and said sadly,  "But we don't worry about things together."  </P> <P> You have to be married to understand that line. Anyone can play house, but a  couple struggling to pay for one is something else. A philosopher once said,  "Marriage is our last, our best chance to grow up." He could be right.  Everything up until the time you walk down the aisle has been polite, guarded  and a little superficial. Returning from the altar is a different feeling  altogether. You have not contracted for a temporary position; this is a  permanent career.  </P> <P> But there is something else. You have legally agreed to share equally in  belongings, debts, closets, fidelity and children. There are defined duties: to  respect each other, tell the truth, listen, take care of each other and be  sensitive to individual needs. This isn't dating anymore; this is the major  league of relationships, with surprises around every corner.  </P> <P> We've gone through 3 wars, 2 miscarriages, 5 houses, 3 children, 17 cars, 23  funerals, 7 camping trips, 12 jobs, 19 banks and 3 credit unions. I stopped  counting slammed doors after 3,009. What do I have to show for it? A feeling of  pride and contentment for having done something that isn't easy. A realization  that there is someone outside of myself without whom I do not feel whole. Maybe  the difference between living together and being married is that the former is  a spectator sport and the latter is playing the game by all the rules.  </P> <P> Marriage has no guarantees. If that's what you're looking for, go live with a  car battery. As for fear of making a mistake, another philosopher said it all:  "God help the man who won't marry until he finds a perfect woman, and God help  him still more if he finds her."  </P></p>

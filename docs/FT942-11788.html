			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Dutch coalition set to lose majority in general election The Netherlands' two ruling parties, the centrist Christian Democrats and Labour, look set to lose their majority in parliament as a result of yesterday's national elections, holding out the prospect of a three-party coalition for the first time since 1981. Two smaller parties which made strong gains will play a crucial role in the coalition negotiations that lie ahead. The rightwing Liberals are projected to have gained eight new seats for a total of 30, while D66, a left-of-centre party, is forecast to win 24 seats, double its number in 1989. These four main parties share a broad consensus on economic, monetary and foreign policy issues. Where they differ most is on the vexed question of social security and how to continue paying for it at a time of rising unemployment and the ageing of the population. The two most likely coalitions are Labour, CDA and D66, or a right-left alliance of Labour, Liberals and D66, which would shut the CDA out of power for the first time since 1918. The CDA of prime minister Ruud Lubbers had been trailing Labour in the opinion polls but regained ground in the last few days before the election. It won two seats less than Labour, which won 36, according to exit polls and preliminary projections by Dutch television. Both parties fell back sharply from the last general election in 1989, when the CDA won 54 seats and Labour 49 seats, giving them a governing majority in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. The dramatic loss of support for the CDA, the linchpin of every government since the second world war, was caused mainly by the impending departure from national politics of Mr Lubbers, the Netherlands' longest-serving prime minister. His successor, Mr Elco Brinkman, did not have the same authority. Coalition talks could take weeks or months, and it is possible that a new government will not be sworn in until the summer. The close finish between CDA and Labour means that both parties will be in the running to provide the next prime minister. Labour's candidate for the job is the current finance minister, Mr Wim Kok. The far-right Centrum Democraten won three seats compared with one seat in 1989, but some opinion polls had predicted it would win as many as eight. Two new parties representing pensioners won a total of eight seats, underlining the importance of social security as an issue.</p>

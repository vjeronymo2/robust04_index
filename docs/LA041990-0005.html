			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SEEK SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> The Oxnard Union High School District voted unanimously Wednesday to pay  $12,000 to a statewide organization of school boards to search for a new  superintendent.  </P> <P> The new superintendent will replace Dr. Bob Carter, who leaves July 1 after  serving 10 years as chief of the 11,000-student OUHSD system.  </P> <P> Carter has been hired as superintendent of the Santa Clara Unified School  District in Northern California.  </P> <P> Although the trustees said they hope to hire a new superintendent by the end of  June, Richard Montgomery, assistant executive director of the California School  Board Assn., cautioned members that it may take four months or more to complete  the search.  </P> <P> "We're in no major rush to fill the superintendent's position because we want  to do whatever it takes to find the right person. Still, we would like someone  to be in place before Dr. Carter leaves, or at least by the end of the summer  before school starts," Trustee Bedford Pinkard said.  </P> <P> Montgomery will conduct the search by preparing a pamphlet describing the  district to potential applicants and placing advertisements in national trade  journals. He also plans to meet with school officials, teachers, parents and  students to discuss the district's needs. CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: House prices and the polls FT-SE Index: 2,547.1 (-9.7) The thesis of a new year revival in the UK housing market is already wearing thin. Yesterday's news that the Halifax building society's house price index registered a further 1.2 per cent fall in January - after dropping 1.3 per cent in December - is alarming enough. What may be of more concern to the government is the developing trend year on year. Even assuming no further softening of prices in the next couple of months, the annual rate of decline could be as much as 5-6 per cent by the time of a spring election. Any recovery based on the level of inquiries rather than firm orders deserves to be treated with suspicion. Recent reports of bustle in the showrooms also belong in the context of last year's Gulf war, the suspension of stamp duty until August and the surprise half-point cut in the mortgage rate. If a more lively market cannot be created in these conditions, it is hard to see how one will be, short of further price cuts by the builders themselves. Interestingly enough, the contracting sector - which underperformed the market in January for the fourth successive month - has largely ignored the hype. A handful of quality second-liners such as Persimmon and Wilson Bowden have seen some demand, but investors looking to buy building-related cyclicals have mostly focused their attention on building materials. For the moment, there seems little reason to reverse this stance. The over-riding requirement for the housebuilders is to write down their landbanks to a level where they can again start making pre-tax profits. As 1991 came to a close, the sort of provisions being bandied about the market were already fairly bleak. Another month of weakening house prices and they will be even bleaker.</p>

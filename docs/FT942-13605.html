			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Over Oman and round the bend - Nick Haslam flies across mountain and desert to the isolated, ancient villages at the tip of the Gulf Violently buffeted by up draughts, the Twin Otter dipped and soared crazily. My neighbour, an Omani businessman in blue dish-dasha and white headscarf, peered out of the window. 'There,' he said. 'There is the village where I was born.' Below, high bare mountains dropped down to the Arabian Gulf. Tucked under one cliff, I could just make out small, white houses strung along a narrow strip of beach, with boats drawn up. We were flying over Musandum, the northern-most province of Oman, a rocky peninsula which juts out into the Straits of Hormuz. Separated from the rest of Oman by the United Arab Emirates, Musandum had, until 1970, been a largely forgotten enclave. With high mountains intercut with long deep ravines, its few villages were accessible only by sea, and had changed little since the Middle Ages. But when the conservative Sultan Said was deposed and his son, Sultan Oaboos, took over, Oman was catapulted into the 20th century. A coastal road to Musandum through the UAE was completed in 1980, and schools and a small hospital built in the provincial capital of Khasab. We landed on an airstrip in a deep wadi that ran down to the sea, and were driven into Khasab, the narrow road winding between mud-brick houses. It was Friday, and the call to prayer echoed from the mosque around the steep mountains behind the town. Groups of young men in dish-dashas walked hand-in-hand through palm groves to the mosque, and women, covered from head to foot and wearing the birka, a leather face-mask which leaves only the eyes exposed, stood gossiping in dusty side streets. Dominating the beach was a fine mud-brick fort, which could have come straight from the pages of Beau Geste. It was built by the Portuguese in the early 17th century as part of a chain of posts which controlled the trade between India and Arabia through the Straits of Hormuz. Its cannons still point across the bay, where graceful crescent-shaped booms, the traditional trading and fishing boats of the Arabian Gulf, lie at anchor. We drove that afternoon up through the wadi Khasab, snaking along the dry riverbed at the bottom of the steep dry hillsides, and then climbed a near perpendicular track to the summit of Jabal Al Harim, one of the highest mountains of Musandum. We passed through villages of simple stone houses built into the side of cliffs, and children rushed out to wave as we passed by for few vehicles come this way. At the pass, a group of shepherds wearing cloaks of sheepswool, warming their hands around a fire, beckoned us to join them. Near the fire, drying on a frame, was the skin of recently killed animal. I asked what it was. A lynx, they said. It had been eating their sheep. They also said there were leopards in the mountains. Below us, jagged valleys fell away in folds and a cold wind swept up from the Arabian Gulf. We stayed at the Khasab hotel, and that night its bar filled with Omanis. Moharned, a building contractor, told me over a beer that this was the only place in town where he could drink alcohol legally. 'It is better,' he said. 'This way the young peoples cannot be tempted to drink.' I nodded sagely, knowing that Omani alcohol laws are liberal compared with those of other countries in the Arabian Gulf. In the morning, under a sparkling sky, we boarded a 30ft-long boom and headed up the Khawr Ash Shamm, one of the longest fiords in Musandum, which meanders into the mountains. The light was brilliant. Mountains ran into the sea. As if on cue, a school of dolphins broke surface around the boat and flying fish skittered across its wake. A carpet had been spread under an awning, and we reclined, eating dates, and chatted to Masood, the captain. We were going to visit his village, Nadifi, where preparations for a wedding were being made. The village, a cluster of white single-storey houses, stood at the top of a shallow beach. Accessible by sea alone, it had the tranquil air that only places which have never seen the motor car can have. We came ashore and were welcomed by village men who were rehearsing wedding dances in the shade of an acacia tree. Abdullah, the groom, came to greet us, and invited us into his house for coffee. We sat cross-legged in the cool interior, and ate oranges and hareeth, a porridge flavoured with chicken. The wedding was two days hence, but excitement ran through the village. Little girls, their eyes made up with kohl, came to the doorway and peered coquettishly at us. In the courtyard, women with handsome Semitic features were preparing food for the feast. Abdullah told me that he had met his bride at another wedding, and that, unusually, she was from a different tribe. They had met only two or three times, and negotiations over the dowry had dragged on for months. Finally, Abdullah would pay her parents 1,500 riyals (nearly Pounds 3,000) in gold and fine clothes. As we spoke, a delegation from the bride's village arrived in some style, in a powerful speedboat bedecked with flags, to discuss final details of the wedding. Reluctantly, we left them exchanging greetings, and returned down the fiord. Our last port of call had made its mark on the English language. Rounding the last curve before the fiord ended in a spectacular cliff, we came to Telegraph Island. A relay station on the first cable to link London and Bombay, the island was manned for only five years, from 1864 to 1869. The high number of watchmen who were driven mad by the solitude and heat during their 18-month shifts were said to have 'gone round the bend'. It was difficult to imagine, as we lay sun-bathing at anchor on a January afternoon with a balmy wind blowing from the mountains, that anyone could ever tire of such an enchanted place. Nick Haslam travelled to Oman with Gulf Airways. Apex returns start from Pounds 750. His trip to Musandum was organised by Khasab Tours, PO Box 28050, Khasab, Musandum, Sultanate of Oman, tel: 660464, fax: 660364.</p>

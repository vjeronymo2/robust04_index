The head of state, His Excellency Henri Konan Bedie, this  morning appointed a new Supreme Court president. He is Michel  Koui Mamadou. Soon after his appointment, the new Supreme Court  president resigned from his post of deputy and announced that he  would leave the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire-African  Democratic Rally [PDCI-RDA] because of the new responsibilities  assigned to him. Here is the new president's statement soon  after his appointment:    [Begin Mamadou recording] His Excellency President Henri  Konan Bedie has just honored me by appointing me to the high  office of the president of the Supreme Court of Cote d'Ivoire.  In this solemn moment, I would like to sincerely thank him for  fully trusting me--trust that I will strive to further serve.  [passage omitted]    I would like to stress that while accepting the functions of  president of the high institution that President Henri Konan  Bedie has assigned to me, I will automatically give up the post  of deputy that I have been occupying. I cannot be a judge and  parliamentarian at the same. My resignation is effective  immediately. Similary, as of today I give up all my functions  within the PDCI-RDA steering organs because of the neutrality  demanded by my new responsibilities. [end recording]</p>

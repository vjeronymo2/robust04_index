			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Norway, Sweden drop treaty Norway and Sweden, agreeing they were unlikely to go to war with each other, yesterday tore up a 1905 treaty creating a demilitarised zone between the nordic neighbours, Reuter reports from Stockholm. The two foreign ministers, Ms Margaretha af Ugglas of Sweden and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, abolished the treaty, which was meant to lower tension when Norway and Sweden ended their 91-year union in 1905.</p>

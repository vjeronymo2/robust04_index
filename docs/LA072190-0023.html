			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANSWERS FROM BABY DOOMERS ON WHETHER THEY'RE APATHETIC  </P> <P> Why should it come as a surprise to anyone that America's youth are unlikely to  comprehend much less take interest in public affairs ("Media Study Finds 'Age  of Indifference,' " Part A, June 28).  </P> <P> As a child of the eighties, I found the report less disheartening than comic.  </P> <P> The very notion that today's youth -- unknowingly saddled with an economy in  disarray, an ailing social welfare system, and an impending ecological disaster  -- could fail "to find public events compelling" makes for a passable joke.  </P> <P> What is really funny, though, is that older Americans -- having fed their  children a steady diet of meaningless Hollywood fantasy, denied youth a proper  education in favor of our "vital" defense budget, and left my generation with  the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Andrew Dice Clay for role models --  could ever express shock at the situation. Ha ha ha ha.  </P> <P> PETER A. ZELLNER  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHTLY ARMED MARINES COULD GET CHEWED UP, SOME EXPERTS FEAR;  </P> <P> MILITARY: MOBILE UNITS DESIGNED FOR QUICK STRIKES ARE ILL-SUITED TO TAKE ON THE  ENTRENCHED IRAQIS, ANALYSTS SAY.  </P> <P> When the United States needed to move quickly to block a potential thrust by  Saddam Hussein into Saudi Arabia, highly mobile Marine units were able to take  up defensive positions in the desert within days to ensure that any Iraqi  advance would be difficult and costly.  </P> <P> But almost five months later, with the battle of Kuwait taking shape as a  collision between two huge war machines, the presence of 50,000 Marines in the  desert is beginning to stir questions among some in the defense community.  </P> <P> Positioned beside heavy Army units on the allied "line in the sand," the rapid  deployment Marine troops face an armored Iraqi force across the border that has  more and heavier tanks and greater firepower. And that force is becoming better  entrenched by the day.  </P> <P> Unless the lighter-equipped Marines are pulled back and repositioned for their  brand of quick amphibious assaults against the enemy, some defense analysts and  former military officials fear, they could be chewed up in a large-scale land  battle for which they are ill-suited.  </P> <P> "Certainly Marine M-60 tanks would be no match for Iraqi (Soviet-made) T-72s,"  said retired Lt. Gen. William Odom. "And their doctrine says not to go deeper  than 10 or 20 kilometers off the beach because their log (logistic) train is at  sea," added the former Army intelligence chief, who is now at the Hudson  Institute, an Indianapolis think tank.  </P> <P> Questions about the Marines' mission are one part of the debate simmering in  the ranks of current and former military people about the U.S. strategic  position as the U.N. Security Council deadline of Jan. 15 approaches for Iraq  to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible military action.  </P> <P> Many are quick to point out that U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf, fully  aware of their troops' relative strengths and weaknesses, would not use the  Marines in a way that would magnify a mismatch. However, the disproportionate  casualty rates the Marines suffered in Vietnam underscore the gravity of the  issue.  </P> <P> In that war, where Marines were used as front-line soldiers, they suffered more  than twice the Army's dead and wounded rate, according to figures from the Army  Center of Military History.  </P> <P> More specifically, of every 1,000 soldiers serving in Vietnam, seven were  killed, as compared to 16 Marines. And for every 1,000 soldiers, 29 were killed  or wounded, compared to 81 Marines.  </P> <P> To the argument that the Marines in Saudi Arabia would be drastically  overmatched, ex-Marine officers offer several rebuttals, although they admit  that the Army is better equipped and trained for hard-slogging ground warfare.  </P> <P> An Army armored division, for example, has six times more tanks, and more  modern types, than the typical Marine division. The Marine division now in  Saudi Arabia, situated in the desert between Saudi troops and an Army armored  division, has twice the usual number of tanks, but its armor remains  considerably inferior to its Army neighbors.  </P> <P> One ex-Marine argued, "To the Marines, tanks are just an adjunct -- just one of  the weapons we have," while "the Army guys in armored divisions eat, sleep and  breathe tank warfare."  </P> <P> Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), who was a Marine combat officer in Vietnam,  argued that the casualty statistics there probably reflect "the fact that a  greater percentage of Marines were in front-line combat," while the Army had a  high proportion of soldiers holding terrain or in logistics support units.  </P> <P> "If you compared Marines to the (Army's) 82nd Airborne or 1st Cavalry  (divisions), I bet they'd be about the same," Robb said last week, referring to  the Army units that saw the most combat in Vietnam. Such a breakdown was not  available from the Center of military History or the National Archives,  however.  </P> <P> Robb, who recently visited the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that he has "some  reservations" about deploying Marines on the ground in ways that reduce their  flexibility and create additional logistic supply difficulties. But he is  confident, he said, that U.S. generals in Saudi Arabia "appreciate the strength  and weaknesses of forces, American and allied, under their command."  </P> <P> A senior Marine general, now retired, complained that comparing a Marine  brigade to an Army armored division "is comparing apples and oranges." Both can  have roughly the same number of personnel (about 15,000), but they are  "different tools," he said.  </P> <P> "Sure, if you have to go into a tank battle, or go 150 miles deep, I'd take an  Army armored division or mechanized infantry division over the (Marine)  amphibious assault force," he said. "But I'd also take them over the Army  airborne. That's not what Marines or Army airborne were designed for.  </P> <P> "The airborne is for dropping behind enemy lines, and the Marines are for end  runs," he continued. "Like at Inchon (the amphibious landing during the Korean  War), where we saved the day."  </P> <P> Another retired Army general, also a Vietnam veteran, noted that the Army's  airborne divisions are equipped even more lightly than the Marines in terms of  tanks and artillery. These parachute troops, also deployed at the front in  Saudi Arabia, appear as vulnerable as the Marines and also ill-suited for  straightforward ground offensives, he said.  </P> <P> "With airborne, there's a rule of thumb -- you've got about 72 hours to get in  there and relieve them (after they are dropped), or you lose them," he  explained. These shock troops can't sustain heavy fighting within enemy lines,  so the main force must break through to them within about three days. He viewed  the role and limits of Marines in similar fashion.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine that (Gen. H. Norman) Schwarzkopf (who commands U.S. troops in  the gulf) would want to use Marines for deep penetration missions overland when  he has those armored divisions," said the ex-Marine general.  </P> <P> Then why not pull them out? "Politics," according to one former Army officer.  "The Marines have a large and effective lobby in Congress, like (former  Marines) Chuck Robb and John Glenn (D-Ohio) in the Senate," he said. In a time  of shrinking defense budgets, every service wants to demonstrate its merit to  forestall deep funding cuts in coming years.  </P> <P> The Army and Marine Corps have always argued about "roles and missions," but  the Army chief of staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, and the Marine Corps commandant,  Gen. Alfred M. Gray, have reportedly had more heated exchanges than their  predecessors over which service can best provide the United States with light,  fast, mobile forces in the future.  </P></p>

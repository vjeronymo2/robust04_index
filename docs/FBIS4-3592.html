			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, April 21 (XINHUA) -- South China's Hainan  Province, the largest special economic zone in the country, will  quicken the establishment of a sound property rights market,  according to Deputy Governor Wang Xiaofeng.    Wang said that the province's property rights transactions  market is open to any economically eligible and reliable  domestic and overseas investment institution or individual.    The property rights can appear in various forms, such as  fixed assets of enterprises, management rights, land-use rights  and intellectual property rights.    The property rights can be transferred by way of agreement  or  public auction, and investors can buy the assets, take the  original debts and conduct barter trade, the deputy governor  said.    Between April 8 and 13 the province sponsored its first  property rights transactions fair, attended by more than 100  domestic enterprises.    The entire property rights of three state-owned or public  enterprises were bought by other large firms at the fair.</p>

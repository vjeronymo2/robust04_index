			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Recession claims 4,500 jobs THE UK recession claimed more than 4,500 jobs yesterday while new figures confirmed that the number of company failures is still accelerating and about to break all records. With industry still awaiting significant signs of recovery, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, said that more than 46,000 companies collapsed in the first nine months of this year - almost equalling the number of failures in 1991. The company warned that the recession looked poised to 'devastate' small businesses. Reacting to the latest redundancies, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general workers' union, claimed that unemployment was now 'running out of control', with Britain heading towards 'the worst winter for unemployment in living memory'. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said there was 'a jobs avalanche on the move'. The biggest jobs blow yesterday was the announcement that about 2,000 jobs will go at the government's Defence Research Agency, set up in April last year to make the government's defence research activities more cost effective. The job cuts, to achieve savings of Pounds 90m a year, will take two years to complete. In the private sector, up to 1,800 jobs are to be shed by Sears, the UK retail and mail order group. In the latest reorganisation of its British Shoe Corporation business, the group plans to close 350 shops - which trade under high street names such as Dolcis and Saxone - over the next three years. Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, is to cut 426 jobs, most of them in Northern Ireland. The company blamed the recession. Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian tyre and cable company, is to dismiss nearly 300 workers at plants in Hampshire and Newport, Wales. The company blamed falling demand. Independent Television News said it was shedding 112 technical support and administration staff as part of a cost-cutting programme. The company will ask for volunteers but said compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out.

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PROTECT CHILDREN ACT' AIMS TO BAN CIGARETTE DEALS IN FILM  </P> <P> Legislation has been introduced in Congress to ban youth-oriented cigarette  advertising, including payments to film makers to feature specific cigarette  brands in their movies.  </P> <P> Paid "product placement" deals, calling for brand-name merchandise to be shown  in films, are a legal and potentially large source of revenue for movie  producers.  </P> <P> But paying to have cigarettes placed in movies is "a subtle technique by the  merchants of addiction to get young people to smoke," Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio)  said in introducing the bill last week. The proposed legislation is being  co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.).  </P> <P> Luken also said paid  </P> <P> placement of cigarettes in films "has the effect of circumventing the federal  ban on cigarette advertising on television" when movies appear on TV.  </P> <P> Tobacco companies say they shy away from product placement deals precisely to  avoid charges like the one Luken made.  </P> <P> But in filing the bill last week, Luken, who chairs the House transportation  and hazardous materials subcommittee, said a preliminary inquiry has turned up  three instances in which cigarette makers did pay to feature their brands in  recent films.  </P> <P> In response to questions from Luken, Liggett Group Inc. said in a letter that  it paid $30,000 in 1983 to have its Eve cigarette brand appear in the movie  "Supergirl" -- although the company's policy since has been to "not pay for  product to be used in films."  </P> <P> Philip Morris Cos., the No. 1 U.S. tobacco company and maker of the Marlboro  brand that is the world's largest seller, disclosed two cases in which payments  were made to feature cigarettes in foreign-made films destined for United  States and foreign audiences. In a Feb. 24 letter, the company said these were  the only cases it had discovered "based upon our review thus far."  </P> <P> In the first case, more than $40,000 was paid in 1979 for Marlboro to appear in  "Superman II." And the company's Tokyo-based advertising agency agreed last  fall to pay $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in "License Revoked," a new  James Bond film shot primarily in Mexico. Lark is actually a Liggett brand, but  Philip Morris owns the rights to the brand overseas, including in Japan, where  the James Bond character is especially popular.  </P> <P> In the United States, Philip Morris said, it has been providing free cigarettes  or advertising signs for an average of 17 films per year, but without paying  cash.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a Philip Morris spokesman told The Times that the company  had not paid to place its cigarettes in movies "for at least 10 years," but  said he was not sure this applied to all foreign subsidiaries.  </P> <P> R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the No. 2 cigarette maker, told Luken it does not  pay film makers to feature its brands, a policy "we believe . . . has been  adhered to" at least since 1982.  </P> <P> Frank Devaney, director of product placement at Rogers &amp; Cowan Inc., a  public relations firm, said Reynolds "is the one account that I don't pursue  any placements for." He said that when film makers request cigarettes for  movies rated "R" or "PG-13," "I give them product and that's it. . . . If they  come to me and they want my brand, I'm certainly going to say OK."  </P> <P> The issue is a sensitive one for the cigarette makers, who were helped in  decades past by a flood of endorsements from glamorous stars. The companies say  they do not target adolescents through movies or other media, and that they  advertise only to lure smokers of other brands -- not to induce non-smokers to  start.  </P> <P> Critics have long accused the companies of using popular entertainment to  market their brands to youth. With nearly all new smokers taking up the habit  while still in their teens, critics say the cigarette makers must target youth  to replace the 2 million smokers who annually quit or die.  </P> <P> An aide said Luken will press the cigarette companies for more specifics on  their product placement policies. For example, some firms that said they  currently do not pay to get their brands in movies did not provide information  back to 1979, as Luken requested.  </P> <P> Legislation to ban all forms of cigarette advertising and promotion went  nowhere in the last session of Congress. The Luken bill, dubbed "The Protect  Our Children From Cigarettes Act of 1989," takes a less sweeping approach. It  would permit text-only advertising on billboards and in print media, with no  pictures other than the cigarette pack. However, cigarette billboards would be  banned from sports arenas, vending machine sales would be barred in places  accessible to adolescents and payments to feature cigarettes in movies would be  banned.  </P> <P> Luken said he was not trying "to restrict in any way an artistic decision to  have a smoking scene in a movie." But he said that decision "should not be  influenced by the lure of large cash payments."  </P> <P> Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, declined  comment, saying through a spokeswoman he was studying the bill.  </P></p>

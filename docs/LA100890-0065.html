			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGER REVIEW;  </P> <P> REPORT CARD / T.J. SIMERS;  </P> <P> DON'T LET MOMS, DADS SEE THIS ONE  </P> <P> F: QUARTERBACKS  </P> <P> Receivers might have better chance of joining circus and catching bullets in  their teeth than trying to flag down one of Billy Joe Tolliver's rockets.  </P> <P> F: RUNNING BACKS  </P> <P> If they ever find Amelia Ehrhart, Ronnie Harmon will be close by.  </P> <P> Plan to keep Rod Bernstine well-rested for playoffs is working just fine.  </P> <P> F: RECEIVERS  </P> <P> These guys aren't exactly bringing home the groceries, but then if they tried,  they'd probably drop them, too. Stop Anthony Miller, and that's that.  </P> <P> F: OFFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> Eric Floyd's no longer a starter and you thought there was no good news Sunday.  In-jured Courtney Hall plays on because alternative is Mike Zandofsky.  </P> <P> F: DEFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> Pass rushers do the unimaginable: They make Brister-Strom look impressive. Les  Miller has now scored as many TDs as running back Marion Butts.  </P> <P> F: LINEBACKERS  </P> <P> Gary Plummer has now scored as many TDs as Les Miller and one more than Walter  Wilson and Quinn Early. Get well -- soon -- wishes to Billy Ray Smith.  </P> <P> F: DEFENSIVE BACKS  </P> <P> Like Boston's bullpen, if it comes down to these guys, there goes the old  ballgame. Everyone, but everyone, goes for the homer against Donald Frank.  </P> <P> F: SPECIAL TEAMS  </P> <P> Blame the blocked punt on Fuad Reveiz. That's what Jack Clark would do, and the  more you see 'em, don't they remind you of a certain baseball team?  </P> <P> F: COACHING  </P> <P> The future of the hula hoop looks more promising than Dan Henning's. But  Shoeless Joe &amp; Friends in "Field of Dreams" had more life than these guys.  </P></p>

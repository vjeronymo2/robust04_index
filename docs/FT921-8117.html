			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Appointments: Braham broadcasts to GMEN board The Guardian and Manchester Evening News (GMEN) has given Michael Braham, chief executive of Broadcast Communications, a seat on the board, the first member with specific broadcasting connections. GMEN paid over Pounds 12m for Broadcast in 1989 - a price some regarded as a stiff entry fee into the television world. In the harsh climate for independent producers that has prevailed since, the budget for its Channel 4 Business Daily contract was first cut back severely, then terminated with effect from this September. But Braham insists the company has diversified successfully, and that its 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 483,000 is respectable given the condition of the rest of the sector. Last year it secured deals with five winning bidders in the commercial television licensing round. Braham, who is 47, and, after nine years as a newspaper reporter still thinks of himself very much as a journalist, says GMEN is looking for further acquisitions on the broadcast side, 'though there is no specific pot of money set aside'. GMEN is a shareholder in Sunrise, the breakfast television consortium, a door that Braham opened for the newspaper group. Harry Roche, chairman and chief executive of GMEN, believes Braham and Broadcast are poised to capitalise on an increasing demand for independent producers. 'But we will have to wait another couple of years to see if it was a good investment,' he acknowledges. ***** LONDON TRANSPORT has found a temporary solution to the problem of the chairmanship of London Buses by appointing David Thompson, one of its non-executive board members, to the post part-time. The London Buses chairmanship falls vacant at the end of March because of the retirement through ill-health of John Telford Beasley. Thompson, 60-year-old chairman of Rank Xerox (UK), will therefore find himself taking over just days before the expected date of the general election. Trouble is, Thompson's new job will cease to exist if the Conservatives triumph because they have pledged to break up and privatise London Buses. If Labour wins, the buses will stay as they are and London Transport will quickly need to find a full-time chairman to look after them. Either way, Thompson seems unlikely to have the job for long. ***** The rapid growth of research and development at GLAXO, the leading UK pharmaceutical group, has led to the creation of new posts in R&amp;D. Richard Sykes, R&amp;D director, gains a deputy for the first time - Goran Ando, currently Glaxo's medical director, will take the job, which involves co-ordinating the company's international pharmaceutical development programme. Until three years ago, Ando, a 43-year-old Swede, worked for Astra, his country's leading drug company. Glaxo has recruited Joseph Feczko, an American who was responsible for Pfizer's European clinical research, to succeed Ando as medical director. And James Niedel, currently vice-president for research in the US, becomes director of the Glaxo Research Institute in North Carolina. Niedel, formerly a professor in the medical school at Duke University, joined Glaxo in 1988. ***** Harry Groome has been named chairman of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM consumer brands as from May 1. Previously president of SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, Groome will replace John Hunter, who is retiring. SmithKline Beecham's worldwide consumer brands business achieved sales in 1990 of Pounds 1.34bn. Groome, an American, has spent 14 years in consumer brands management; the company says nothing should be read into the fact that an American is replacing a British executive: 'Candidates are chosen for ability, not nationality.' ***** Olivier Doria, Mark Goodman, Gabriel Grippo, Kirby Hoeft, Michael Jensen and Gail McDonnell have been appointed directors of MERRILL LYNCH in London. ***** MIDLAND BANK has appointed David Markham and Roger Thompson its representatives in Moscow and Beijing, respectively. ***** BARING SECURITIES has appointed Michael Bird, Geoffrey Broadhurst, Fu Ya Yin, Peter Meurer, Peter Norris, Peter Horton, Adrian Phillips, James Remington-Hobbs, Debra Schinasi, Carl Strutt and Janice Wallace as directors. ***** COUNTY NATWEST SECURITIES has appointed Beat Lehmann head of its Zurich branch; he moves from Salomon Brothers. ***** Kenneth Joseph has been appointed director and head of sales and trading for UK and European equities at LEHMAN BROTHERS SECURITIES; he moves from Salomon Brothers. ***** Michael Ladenburg, formerly international corporate finance director at Robert Fleming, has been appointed assistant general manager and head of corporate finance at SAUDI International Bank. ***** Ian Brimecome is moving from Salomon Brothers to become a director of MERRILL LYNCH INTERNATIONAL. ***** Ann Busby, formerly a director of BZW Investment Management, is appointed a director of QUEEN ANNE'S GATE ASSET MANAGEMENT.</p>

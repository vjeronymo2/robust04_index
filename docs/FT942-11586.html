			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Treasury expects recovery to continue The Treasury yesterday presented a favourable picture of UK economic developments to coincide with the monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. In its latest monthly report, prepared for the meeting, the Treasury noted that Britain's latest monthly economic indicators remained consistent with continuing recovery, and retail sales 'remained on a strong upward trend'. Although the report merely compiled recent economic data and gave no new insights into the thinking of policymakers, it added to the impression that yesterday's meeting was not the occasion for a decision to change monetary policy. Expectations of a cut in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent have been receding for some time, with some commentators now suggesting that the next move could be upwards. Britain's gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 19m in April according to Treasury figures released yesterday. The overall level of official reserves rose by Dollars 531m to Dollars 43,446m at the end of April from Dollars 42,915m at the end of March. Economic Indicators, Page 14</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Tuesday [14 June] the government will deal with  discrimination against Koreans living in Japan in the wake of  reported assaults on students going to pro-Pyongyang schools.  "That (Korean) children have been hurt is intolerable," Hata  told a session of the House of Councilors Budget Committee.  Hata said he will urge all ministries and agencies to think  about appeals to stop such racial discrimination.    In recent weeks there have been frequent reports of Korean  students being subjected to abusive language by Japanese and in  some cases of the ethnic uniforms of female Korean students even  being ripped to shreds. Police suspect that there must be a  sense of discrimination against pro-Pyongyang Koreans behind the  scenes amid the international tension over North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms development program.    National Public Safety Commission Chief Hajime Ishii and  Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the same committee session  that the situation is "regrettable," adding that the government  will intensify investigations and improve measures to protect  foreigners' human rights.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, some comments opposed the inability of the applicant to obtain work authorization during the appeal period if his or her claim is denied by the immigration judge within the 180-day period. One comment noted that the applicant's access to counsel will be jeopardized on appeal while another observed that negative decisions frequently are reversed. A comment stated that such an applicant may face the choice of either starving or returning to a country where he or she faces persecution. Comments also stated that a decrease in appeals will hinder proper interpretation of the law by preventing the presentation of novel legal issues. These comments suggested that employment authorization be granted to applicants during the appeal process or that an exception for economic necessity be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department strongly believes that the asylum process must be separated from the employment authorization process. This rule will discourage applicants from filing meritless claims solely as a means to obtain employment authorization. More important, the rule provides legitimate refugees with lawful employment authorization. When the system is fully operational, asylum officers are expected to grant or refer affirmative claims within about 60 days. Thus, persons with bona fide asylum claims would get work authorization in approximately the same time as the current 90-day period for adjudicating work authorization applications. All applicants could have work authorization after 180 days, unless their claims have been denied by an immigration judge. Under existing authority, work authorization may be granted to persons who are paroled into the United States by the INS. 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(11). This provision, which can be employed in the case of asylum applicants seeking admission at a port of entry to the United States and paroled into the country, is not changed in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments presented on this issue have been carefully considered. Particular attention was given to the recommendations that alternative means be established to adjudicate employment authorization on the basis of the merits of the claim or on the economic situation of the asylum applicant. Either alternative would invite a large number of applications, thus diverting resources and undermining the goals of asylum reform. Using a merit-based standard would require the INS to adjudicate asylum applications for work authorization eligibility either through a paper evaluation or a separate work authorization interview. A need-based standard would impose a similar administrative burden. Given that the vast majority of those deserving asylum will promptly receive their decisions and, hence, their employment authorization, this burden would not be justified by the results achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also considered the claim that asylum applicants will disregard the law and work without authorization. While this is possible, it also is true that unlawful employment is a phenomenon not limited to asylum applicants, but is found among many categories of persons who have illegally entered or remained in the United States. The Department does not believe that the solution to this problem is to loosen eligibility standards for employment authorization. This is particularly so because of the evidence that many persons apply for asylum primarily as a means of being authorized to work. These rules will discourage applications filed for such reasons and thus will enable the INS to more promptly grant asylum_and provide work authorization_to those who merit this relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These provisions of the proposed rule also are in keeping with United States obligations under international law. Article 17 of the 1951 Convention provides that a ``[c]ontracting State shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances, as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment.'' Under this rule, refugees_i.e., persons granted asylum_are immediately eligible to apply for and receive employment authorization. Article 17 imposes no further obligations on access to employment authorization for those who are applying for asylum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also has carefully considered the comments directed to the impact that new rules on employment authorization would have upon the states. These concerns are addressed under heading 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with its decision to remove the requirement for an asylum application fee, the Department will not adopt in this final rule a requirement that asylum applicants pay a fee to accompany an initial application for employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.13. The fee requirement will be retained for applications to renew employment authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Queen arrives in Moscow to begin historic visit The Queen arrived in Moscow yesterday, the first British monarch to visit Russia, as the continuing furore at home over the Prince Charles biography threatened to mar the four-day trip. John Major, the prime minister, dismissed as 'pretty far from the mark' reports that he was to advise the Queen that the Prince and Princess of Wales should divorce as soon as possible. Close aides of the prime minister made clear that he continued to believe the monarchy was the cornerstone of the constitution and must remain so. Joe Rogaly, Page 20; Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting in  Beijing today, Cui Dewen, vice director of the State Gold  Administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry,  called on localities to resolutely shut down illegal gold  markets before the end of this month.    Cui Dewen pointed out the recent appearance of unauthorized  gold transaction points in some regions and the brisk illegal  transactions of gold there. The existence of illegal gold  markets leads to the loss of gold products. Localities must  conscientiously implement the guidelines set out in the relevant  circular issued recently by the State Council General Office;  immediately organize banks, industry and commerce departments,  public security bureaus, customs, gold industry, and gold and  jewelry production management departments to take forceful  measures; further rectify illegal gold markets; and strictly  investigate and handle cases of illegal sales of gold products  by gold-producing enterprises. Concerned personnel and major  local officials will be held responsible if illegal gold markets  are found in their regions after 1 July.    Cui Dewen stressed that the state exercises fixed management  over the production, processing, and wholesale and retail sales  of gold and jewelry. Localities must immediately crack down on  units that illegally sell gold and jewelry without the approval  of the People's Bank of China. Gold futures trading is strictly  prohibited, and the establishment of various types of gold  futures markets is also strictly prohibited. All levels of gold  management departments and production enterprises should enhance  their management over finished gold products. Gold mines must  turn over all the gold they produce to the state, they must not  engage in illegal transactions, and they must not retain gold  for their own use.</p>

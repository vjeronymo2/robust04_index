			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (1): Murmurings of anxiety - Singapore continues to dazzle the world with its rapid economic growth and its prosperous and stable society. But there are signs of strain as it faces ever keener competition with its equally dynamic southeast Asian neighbours 'A COUNTRY is like one big corporation. Its gross national product is equivalent to a company's revenue and its population its employees. A national economy competes with other national economies for market shares in the world. If it fails to compete, its population or employees will not be paid well. If it is competitive, its standard of living will rise.' (Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, October 15 1992). It may not be immediately obvious from the sleek facade of Singapore Inc. But among senior managers of the world's most successful corporate state, there are unmistakeable, and quite deliberate, rumblings of unease about the future these days. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, founder and now non-executive chairman, complains of a lack of enterprise among his employees and compares the 'corporation' unfavourably with its buccaneering rival to the north, Hong Kong. Mr Goh Chok Tong, his successor as chief executive, worries aloud about Singapore's position in the accelerating race for trade and investment in Asia and frets that the workforce may be going soft or getting greedy. On cue, a chorus of middle managers takes up the call for a reorientation of corporate strategy, another efficiency drive, a fresh push into overseas markets. At first glance, it is hard to see what the fuss is about. Singapore remains, by any standard, a phenomenal case study in economic achievement. After nearly three decades of almost uninterrupted rapid expansion, its gross domestic product continues to grow at annual rates around 6 per cent, without significant inflation. On a per capita basis, it is richer than any of the other Asian 'dragons', and has already overtaken several countries in Europe. It boasts full employment, remarkable political stability, an incorrupt and efficient public administration, and the highest home ownership and national savings rates in the world. Foreign investment continues to pour in, to the extent that an island state of 3.1m people hosts one foreign company per 1,000 inhabitants. And Singaporeans enjoy a quality of urban life without parallel in the region. Yet if the message from the top is to be believed, now is no time for resting on laurels. The constantly reiterated theme of ministerial and prime ministerial speeches over the past year is that the challenges of the next decade will be as stiff as anything Singapore has faced since it was thrust out of the Malaysian Federation and into sovereign independence in 1965. The task is not only to stay several jumps ahead of competitors within Asia but to upgrade the economy to a point where it can claim a place among the developed nations. 'We are like someone being chased by tigers with a cliff in front,' said Mr Goh in a speech to trade unionists last October. 'The tigers are closing in fast but the cliff is difficult to scale. The tigers are the dynamic economies like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The cliff is the formidable challenge posed by the developed countries.' The prime minister's colourful warnings are exaggerated for effect. He and Mr Lee, who as Senior Minister is still considered by many as the ultimate authority despite having relinquished the premiership in late 1990, like to give the impression of being engaged in a constant struggle to maintain the values which helped propel Singapore out of poverty in a generation - its legendary political discipline and the quiescence of the workforce in pursuit of general prosperity. Yet implausible as their scare stories may sound, there are legitimate reasons for at least mild concern over Singapore's medium term prospects. In the first place, the battle to stay commercially competitive is becoming fiercer all the time. Singapore is still attracting foreign investment at an enviable pace - manufacturing investment in fixed assets reached a record SDollars 3.48bn last year, 21 per cent up on the 1991 figure. But it has to work at it against formidable constraints. With less than 3 per cent unemployment and the population more or less static, there is a chronic labour shortage, and for political reasons Singapore does not want to import any more immigrant labour than it has to. One result is that wages have been outpacing productivity growth in recent years, in the process eroding Singapore's competitive edge. 'We've got to worry all the time,' says Mr Goh. 'If we lose our competitive edge, I think the whole house may collapse. To give an example, if we are not competitive, say, with China, we'll find that China will suck in our investments very quickly ...a hollowing out of the economy may take place ...This anxiety element is something we've got to live with.' The second broad area of concern is Singapore's place among the dynamic economies of Asia as a whole. From mainland China in the north and India in the west to south-east Asian countries next door, markets with vast potential are opening up to outside investors. But Mr Lee, in particular, has taken to issuing stern warnings that Singapore is in danger of failing to capitalise on this rapid growth. Singaporeans, he complains, are a staid and timid lot who prefer to stay at home and work as middle managers rather than venturing abroad in search of business opportunities. It is time for them to develop an entrepreurial spirit, 'go regional' and build an external dimension to the country's economy in the way that South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan have done. There are delicious ironies in Mr Lee's new campaign, since the conservatism and unimaginativeness he attributes to his subjects spring in no small measure from the tightly controlled society that he has created. Since Singaporeans are schooled from birth in Confucian virtues of obedience, discipline and collective endeavour, since the government controls the main levers of economic power, and since they have for years heard disapproving lectures from their leaders about the corruption and maladministration of other Asian countries, it is scarcely surprising that they show little initiative in doing business abroad. Fear of failure - kiasu in the Hokkien Chinese dialect - remains a powerful feature of Singaporean society, reflected in everything from the ultra-cautious way it regulates its financial centre to bankruptcy laws of a severity unparalleled anywhere in the industrial world. Those Singaporeans who have broken out into the wider region often did so in spite of the system rather than because of it, and many of them show little inclination to return home. Nevertheless, it is significant that the nation's patriarch has seen fit to air this issue now. Mr Lee's speeches betray an awareness that to stay abreast of breakneck development in the region at large, Singapore itself will have to change. Unwittingly perhaps, Mr Lee's concerns about Singapore's need to spread its wings abroad also underline what is the biggest domestic political challenge facing the ruling People's Action Party over the next few years: how to keep fulfilling the ever-rising expectations of Singaporeans themselves. Singapore may be to all intents a one-party state, but without doubt the PAP owes its unbroken 34 years in government principally to the prosperity it has engendered, and to its success in giving Singaporeans a stake in their own society. As one foreign diplomat put it: 'The PAP knows that whatever grip it now exercises on the state machinery its political dominance stands or falls on its record of creating and distributing wealth.' And here, the omens have not been universally favourable for the government of late. Mr Goh is still smarting from the blow the PAP received in the elections of August 1991, when its share of the vote fell to 61 per cent - a setback only partly redeemed by the PAP's 72 per cent score in a by-election late last year. Although the ruling party still enjoys support that governments in the west can only dream of, there can be no disguising the decline in its share of the vote through the last four general elections. Next time, or the time after that, the PAP may have to reckon with a considerably larger presence of the opposition parties in parliament. This would scarcely be a disaster. But it does imply a period of adjustment for an elite unaccustomed to challenges to its rule. And that process will not be rendered any easier by the doubts that have unexpectedly arisen in recent months surrounding the succession to Lee Kuan Yew. Late last year, it was announced that both Mr Lee's eldest son, Lee Hsieng Loon, and Mr Ong Teng Cheong, both deputy prime ministers, were being treated for cancer. The news shocked Singaporeans since it had been widely presumed that the former, a tough but not especially popular chip off the old block known everywhere as 'BG Lee' in deference to his military rank, was being groomed as Singapore's prime minister in the not too distant future. The government insists 'BG' Lee is responding well to treatment and will be back at his desk soon. But if the illness were to remove him permanently from the scene, the reins of power would continue to be held by a group of men without an obviously charismatic leader. This is not an immediate problem. Mr Lee himself, now 70 but in apparently robust health, looks like being around for a good while longer. Mr Goh is an able administrator and is setting about trying to develop a more collegial - if not much more consultative - style of government. But it does seem that, as it grows richer and better educated, as the generation that experienced the traumas of independence fades from the stage, and as income disparities widen, Singapore is becoming a more complex place to govern. The fundamental questions are whether a society so regimented as Singapore's still is will develop the capacity both to nurture the creativity of its best and brightest and to channel the frustrations of the less privileged - and whether it will continue to adapt and prosper in a way that outlasts the man who founded and moulded it.</p>

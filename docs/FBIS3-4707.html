In connection with the secret contact of envoys between the  South and North upon President Kim Yong-sam's proposal to hold  South-North summit talks, Director Kim Tok said that "this is a  totally false report."    Regarding reports by the media that North Korean Secretary  Kim Chong-il was in an accident, Director Kim said: "As far as  I know, he just hurt his leg after falling while riding a horse."    It was learned that in a private meeting, Director Kim  reported: "It is not clear if North Korea is developing nuclear  weapons, but it is clear that it has reached a stage of  completing nuclear development. It was learned that recently  North Korea has been strengthening security at the Yongbyon  nuclear facilities."</p>

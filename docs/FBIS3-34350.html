			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Algiers by Hisham Fahim] </F>   [Text] Abdelhamid Mehri, the leader of Algeria's National  Liberation Front [FLN], which has ruled the country for 30  years, has stated that his party will deal with the new regime  in Algeria as an authority that lacks constitutional legitimacy.  He added that his party will help this authority to emerge from  this status and gain popular and constitutional legitimacy,  provided there is goodwill and a true desire to restore normalcy  in the country.    In remarks to AL-AHRAM, Mehri pointed out that the society's  real problems cannot be solved through institutions that lack  legitimacy and credibility. Asked if his party will accept any  responsibilities or positions in the Transitional National  Council (parliament) or in the new Algerian Government, Mehri  said the FLN will accept no responsibility in running the  country's affairs during the transitional period, adding that  the period's political objectives are shrouded in ambiguity.    On the national dialogue conference, which the party has  boycotted, and his assessment of it, Mehri said: It was  supposed to conclude the dialogue that started over 18 months  ago but the dialogue deviated from the natural course we  expected it to take. He noted that for the FLN, the goal of the  dialogue is to agree on comprehensive and political common  grounds envisaging solutions for the various security,  constitutional, institutional, economic, and social problems and  to form a national coalition based on these common grounds. He  added: But the dialogue turned into an attempt to recommend the  successor to the Higher State Council and extend the  transitional period for another three years with the same policy  and views applied in the past two years.    He noted that this was why his party boycotted the  conference, because its results could neither change the  political, security, and economic realities in the country nor  draft any clear-cut policy to confront these problems. He added  that this does not mean that the party rejects dialogue, because  dialogue is a necessary means to solve problems, but that what  counts is the dialogue's nature.    Asked about possible developments, Mehri said that the  situation in Algeria is very difficult, noting that emergence  from the current crisis will require all the political and  social forces to agree on how to end the violence. He added:  It also requires taking the appropriate measures to restore  full constitutional life based on the 1989 Constitution and to  call on the people to contribute to running their own affairs  through elected municipal, legislative, and presidential  councils.</p>

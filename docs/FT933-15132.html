			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Increase recorded in house prices HOUSE PRICES rose in the second quarter of the year in all regions, according to Halifax, the biggest building society, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The largest gain was in East Anglia, which showed a 5.1 per cent increase over the first quarter. The west Midlands recorded the lowest increase of 1 per cent. However, prices are lower than for the same period last year in all regions with the exception of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Greater London, with a 5.1 per cent drop, saw the largest fall in the second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. Prices for the whole country dropped by 3.4 per cent. The news comes after Halifax's monthly figures this week showed average house prices fell for the second month. Unlike the monthly data, quarterly figures are not seasonally adjusted and reflect the stronger-than-expected rise in prices in April and the sharp fall in January. Halifax said the underlying regional picture of house-price inflation was 'perhaps not quite as buoyant as the figures would suggest' and any recovery in the market would remain fragile. It predicted prices would rise more steadily for the rest of the year.</p>

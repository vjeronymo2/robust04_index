			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional puts Ibstock into red IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, the UK's third largest brick maker, reported a Pounds 17.1m pre-tax loss in the first-half after taking a Pounds 20.2m exceptional charge, mainly to cover the costs of closing one of its two Portuguese pulp mills. The deficit in the six months to June 30 1993 compared with a Pounds 3.1m profit a year earlier and came on turnover which edged ahead to Pounds 141.8m (Pounds 138.1m). At the trading level the group reported a Pounds 1.87m loss compared with a Pounds 2.24m profit last time. The combined UK, US and continental European building products operations produced a profit down from Pounds 2.65m to Pounds 1.21m. However, as a result of falling prices in fiercely competitive markets, the forest products division incurred an increased Pounds 3.08m loss, up from Pounds 409,000. The exceptional charge was partly offset by a Pounds 6.29m profit on the sale of assets. Net interest costs were Pounds 1.39m compared with net interest receipts of Pounds 857,000 in the year-ago period. Losses per share of 4.93p compared with earnings of 0.76p. The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 0.5p and the share price closed just 1p lower yesterday at 76p. Following a review of its forest product operations the group decided to close the smaller and less effici-ent of its two pulp mills in Portugal, which resulted in an asset write off and closure costs totalling Pounds 18.7m. In the core building products division Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director, said there was now 'some encouragement' from the UK businesses, which reported reduced profits of Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 2.71m) on flat turnover of about Pounds 30m. Mr Maclellan said Ibstock's brick sales in the first six months were between 14 per cent and 15 per cent higher compared with a 4 per cent increase in overall demand. 'We are now seeing some improvement in prices for the first time since the start of the recession,' he said. COMMENT Ibstock's management deserves credit for making all the right moves - painful though they have been - and the group should be well positioned to take advantage of the upturn. Brick stocks have been reduced, costs cut and market share boosted by expanding into the housing market. Total UK brick sales this year should reach 3bn compared with 2.9bn last year and 4.8bn at the 1988 peak. Excluding exceptionals the group should break even this year and make between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m at the pre-tax level and up to 2.6p of earnings in 1994.</p>

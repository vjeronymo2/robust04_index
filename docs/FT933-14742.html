			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Regional firms compete with City of London - Legal Briefs Large regional firms are competing increasingly for work that has traditionally been done by City of London law firms, according to the 1993 edition of The Legal 500*, the latest edition of the clients' guide to the UK's top 500 law firms, which has just been published. Regional firms have improved in quality terms, it says, and have proved very competitive on cost. During the recession this has proved attractive to commercial clients. Otherwise, this sixth edition of the guide contains few surprises. The list of the top 10 company and commercial law firms in London, for example, is the same as in 1992, except that Allen &amp; Overy and Lovell White Durrant have moved up a couple of places at the expense of Norton Rose and Herbert Smith. One feature absent from the 1993 guide that will be sorely missed is its recommendation of 'firms going from strength to strength'. Perhaps this is an indication of the impact of the recession on the legal profession. *The Legal 500 - the Client's Guide to UK Law Firms, by John Pritchard, Legalease, Pounds 39</p>

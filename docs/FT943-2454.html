			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The Markets: Reassurance for borrowers - Economics Notebook The decision by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise bank base rates by half a percentage point last week has naturally prompted fears of further interest rate increases. Memories of the savage doubling of UK base rates to 15 per cent in the 18 months to October 1989 are still relatively fresh. In the US, the decision of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to lift short-term interest rates by a quarter point in February has been followed by four other monetary tightenings. But hopes are high in Whitehall and in the City that UK rates are not heading back to the stratospheric levels of the late 1980s. Borrowers can take comfort from the nature of Britain's recovery, now in its tenth quarter. The accompanying chart highlights one of the big differences between this recovery and the previous cyclical upturns of the past 20 years. Past recoveries were accompanied by house price inflation. House prices today, according to the Nationwide Anglia index used in the chart, are still lower than when the recovery began in the second quarter of 1992. All recoveries are unique and the four featured in the chart are no exception to this rule. Inflation was high when the two earlier recoveries began: at about 26 per cent in the third quarter of 1975 and at just under 13 per cent in the first quarter of 1981. Higher prices overall sharply reduced, or, in the case of the 1975 recovery, overwhelmed the wealth creating effects of higher house prices. That was not the case with the recovery that followed the 'growth pause' of 1985. Annual retail price inflation was comparatively low by UK standards, at about 5.5 per cent. It declined to 2.4 per cent by the summer of 1986 and was to stay below 5 per cent until mid-1988, just before the economy hit its cylical peak. However, house prices were motoring ahead and rose by an average 77 per cent in the four years to their peak in late 1989. The strong real increase in house prices generated a bubble economy. Mortgage lending surged. So did equity withdrawal as people traded up the housing market and took some of the proceeds as cash. Consumers felt more confident. Net savings slumped. The result was the late 1980s consumer boom. Headline retail inflation was in double digits by the late summer of 1990. It proved especially difficult to root out because the house price boom had developed its own momentum. Moreover, inflation was boosted by the very interest rate increases that were intended to control it, because mortgage interest payments are included in the retail prices index. Base rates, once put at 15 per cent, stayed at that level for a year. Housing has so far played no part in the current recovery. Not only have house prices been little changed over the past year, but turnover is 7 per cent below its peak. Although estate agents and building societies keep reminding us that houses are currently very affordable, there are good reasons not to expect a return to boom. The bust in the early 1990s has created a generation of young potential house buyers who have witnessed the miseries caused by mortgage rates doubling, negative equity and homes being repossessed. Government tax relief on mortgage interest payments has been much reduced and is set to fall further. The shift in patterns of employment to more part-time working and the reduced security offered to many in middle management should also dampen demand for houses. The upshot, Bank of England and Treasury officials believe, could be a climate in which people buy houses to live in rather than as an investment. Britain's housing market is still very different from that in most other European countries. The owner occupier ratio is high - about two thirds of households own their own home. House purchase continues mainly to be financed by mortgages linked to potentially volatile short-term interest rates. This is partly because demand for fixed-rate mortgages, which were increasingly popular last year, was halted by the rise of long-term interest rates in the spring. There is also the sheer importance of housing as a store of wealth: nearly 40 per cent of gross personal sector wealth was tied up in residential property at the end of 1992. But there are hopes that the UK economy may be becoming more akin to those on the continent. If so, interest rates will not have to be raised so savagely in this cycle to curb inflation, because house prices will be less of an engine of inflation. Nobody is ruling out the need for sudden interest rate increases to deal with unexpected shocks. But it may be a hopeful sign that Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers, one of the few City economists to forecast last week's rate rise, does not expect base rates to rise much above 7 per cent in the foreseeable future. That would leave them lower than at any time in the 1980s.</p>

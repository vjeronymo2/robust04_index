			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas surprise A shock Pounds 1.65bn of restructuring and a dividend that disappointed more people than it pleased ensured that British Gas was the most heavily traded stock in London. The shares fell 11 to 328p with more than 20m shares traded. The 14.5p dividend represented the first time that British Gas had not increased its pay-out to shareholders since the company was privatised. Ms Irene Himona of SGST argued that gains from overseas expansion will not compensate for the loss of UK earnings as its monopoly is eroded. Some analysts said that the dividend was the best that could be hoped for but that the write-downs for 25,000 job cuts were twice as high as expected, and the estimated benefits from those job cuts were lower than forecast. Fourth-quarter figures from Shell Transport and continental European arm Royal Dutch prompted a sharp sell-off in both classes of shares as investors reacted to a lower than expected dividend. The UK dividend of 13.8p satisfied the market but the Royal Dutch pay-out of Fl 8.60 was below the lowest forecasts. NatWest Securities oil analyst Fergus McLeod said the Pounds 776m net income was below his forecast and he was maintaining a comparatively low Pounds 3.3bn forecast for this year. However, Brendan Wilders of Hoare Govett turned buyer with a Pounds 3.7bn forecast arguing that the company was masking solid progress on the recovery story and was not too geared to oil prices. Shell Transport fell 23 to 699p with heavy turnover of 6.6m shares and Royal Dutch dropped Fl 5.7 to Fl 202.7.</p>

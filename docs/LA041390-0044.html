			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Schools Out for Grateful Dead: The Grateful Dead have been banned at UC  Berkeley and Stanford University because of "Deadheads" who like to camp out  while awaiting concerts.  </P> <P> Both schools told the Bay Area band that it is no longer welcome to perform its  annual concerts on the campuses. Police said 30 to 50 arrests -- mostly  drug-related -- are made each summer when the Dead performs its three-concert  stand. The band was also bounced from Irvine Meadows in Orange County this year  because of similar disruptions. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

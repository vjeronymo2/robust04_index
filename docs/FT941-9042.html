			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Observer: PA in a big way If it was good enough for grandad, it's good enough for us, seems to be the motto of Ian and James Ivory, a couple of Old Etonian fund managers. Taking a lead from their grandfather, James Ivory, the Edinburgh-based fund managers are putting a couple of million pounds of their own money into their latest vehicle - Stewart Ivory's Ptarmigan International Capital. James Ivory, the grandfather, founded British Assets and backed his judgment by investing the family's fortune in it, as did his son, Eric. However, the latest generation of Ivory's, who have skipped around from Ivory &amp; Sime to Stewart Ivory via Ivory &amp; Co, are not just following in their grandfather's footsteps. An old Ivory &amp; Sime colleague, Ian Rushbrook (ex-East Ham Grammar), owns nearly 30 per cent of Personal Assets, a Pounds 14m investment trust, and since he took it over in 1990 it's outperformed its peer group handsomely. A case of anything Ian can do, Ian Ivory can do better?</p>

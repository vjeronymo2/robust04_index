			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Russia may join substitute Cocom COCOM, the western organisation set up in 1950 to block the export of sensitive goods to Communist countries, is to be replaced by April 1994 with a new scheme open to a broad range of new members, including Russia and other former east bloc countries. Officials from the 17 Cocom countries, meeting yesterday in The Hague, said discussions with Russia would begin in a matter of days. Other potential new members include Efta countries such as Sweden and Austria, but also Ireland, New Zealand and Hong Kong. 'We would also encourage China to participate in our organisation as early as possible, but that means we have to come to a common understanding,' Mr Frans Engering, director-general of foreign economic relations at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, said. The focus will be on export of sensitive military and dual-use industrial goods.</p>

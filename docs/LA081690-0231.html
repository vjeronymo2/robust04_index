			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> PLANS FOR TRANSIT PROGRAMS  </P> <P> New public transportation programs, including one for recreational outings  outside the city, will be reviewed by the City Council on Aug. 28.  </P> <P> The plan discussed Tuesday was for two new programs to be added to the city's  three existing low-cost transportation programs, the Sierra Madre Augmented and  Restricted Transportation (SMART), Dial-A-Ride and Foothill Area Community  Services (FACS).  </P> <P> The services transport residents in the city for 25 cents for a one-way trip.  Although open to all residents, they are mainly used by senior citizens. About  $147,000 is allocated for the programs.  </P> <P> The proposed programs would cost about $35,000, City Manager James McRea said.  They would have to be approved by the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission.  </P> <P> "We have a sticky wicket on the one hand, and an opportunity on the other,"  Councilwoman Mary Ann MacGillivray said. "We have to develop a less-costly  system that provides more service and we have to very seriously look at  duplication of services."  </P></p>

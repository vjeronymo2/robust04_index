			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail decision a joint one Sir, Yes, we are looking to recruit a new chief executive who can make a valuable contribution to our thinking on the need to establish an entity appealing to the private sector and separate from the three promoters of CrossRail, the proposed east-west cross-London rail link ('CrossRail team plans to split from partners', November 18). The decision on the form of any separate entity, however, will not be down to the new chief executive as you suggest; the decision will be a matter for the government as shareholder, in consultation with the promoters, London Underground, British Rail and Railtrack. In reporting our conversation, your correspondent has taken two thoughts out of context. The way CrossRail is eventually developed for the benefit of London and the south-east region will in large measure depend on the views of the private sector, since it is the private sector that will be providing a substantial part of the finance needed. The step change in journey experience and scale of resulting benefits for London can only result from the introduction of a project such as CrossRail  -just as has been experienced with cross capital RER services in Paris. Some people have suggested that the same result can instead be achieved by upgrading parts of the existing underground network. But all of our research with London Underground shows that such measures do not produce a viable alternative to CrossRail. Maintaining and improving the existing rail networks is essential anyway.

The commission, in  which AIDS experts from both government and non-government  spheres are represented, recently decided on the following  distribution of the money: 20 percent will go on prevention  (education, behavior surveys, and so on) 26 percent on testing,  and more than a half for everything else, principally treatment  and investment. this means that health insurance covers, for  example, only the drugs for hospitalized patients, and not for  those whose disease has not yet developed and are being treated  as outpatients. According to Trojan, who is also president of  the non-government Association for the Struggle Against AIDS and  for Sexual Education, the commission could not turn down the  funds for this purpose because it would endanger human lives.  "Let us call things by their names, and do not boast to the  World Health Organization of 70 million spent on prevention, if,  in fact, the money is only covering for the state or health  insurance," Trojan says. Just for a comparison: Great Britain  invests an annual 20 million pounds on prevention.    Non-government organizations receive approximately 7 percent  of the 70 million. (The World Health Organization generally  recommends, however, that at least 15 percent of the total be  allocated to these organizations.) The AIDS Help Society wants,  for instance, to establish a so-called light house for those  sick and dying of AIDS. According to Trojan, non-government  organizations have to fight much harder for funds. The idea  apparently still prevails that they are more likely to waste the  funds at their disposal than government institutions.</p>

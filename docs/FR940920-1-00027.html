Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides an introduction to the proposed rule by: (1) Summarizing the history of the development of NSPS for new MWC's over the past 7 years; (2) summarizing the general goals of the proposed rule that are specified by sections 111(d) and 129 of the Act of 1990; and (3) providing a brief overview of the major issues discussed in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Summary of Regulatory Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the early and mid-1980's, several studies were performed to determine whether MWC emissions should be regulated and, if so, under what section of the Act. As set forth in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987), the EPA decided to regulate air emissions from MWC's under section 111 of the Act, and based the regulation on best demonstrated technology (BDT), as required by section 111. On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed NSPS for new MWC's and emission guidelines for existing MWC's (54 FR 52251 and 54 FR 52209, respectively). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted and added section 129 to the Act. Section 129 of the Act specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the requirements of sections 111 and 129. Section 129 further specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines be developed for both large and small MWC's and that the revised NSPS and emission guidelines must reflect a more restrictive standard of performance. Section 129 includes a schedule for revising the 1991 NSPS. When the EPA did not comply with that schedule, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The resulting consent decree requires the EPA Administrator to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking not later than September 1, 1994 and a notice of promulgation not later than September 1, 1995 (Nos. CV&hyph;92&hyph;2093 and CV&hyph;93&hyph;0284).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NSPS and guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488 and 56 FR 5514, respectively) apply to MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day and reflect BDT as determined by the Administrator at the time those standards were issued. Today's notice therefore proposes to create new NSPS to be fully consistent with sections 111 and 129 of the Act and to extend coverage of the standards to new MWC units located at MWC facilities with aggregate plant capacity above 35 Mg/day. Additionally, under a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , new subpart Cb emission guidelines for existing MWC plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day of MSW are being proposed pursuant to sections 111 and 129 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed NSPS is more stringent than the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991. Today's proposed NSPS would replace the subpart Ea NSPS for those facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994. However, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect for affected facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 and on or before September 20, 1994. Those sources subject to the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS would also be subject to the emission guidelines being proposed under subpart Cb in a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In most cases, the proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines are more stringent than the existing subpart Ea standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. New Source Performance Standards_General Goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires the promulgation of performance standards under section 111 for categories of new and existing stationary sources that may contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Section 129 of the Act specifies that NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the requirements of sections 111 and 129 of the Act. Section 129(a)(2) provides that the revised standards for new MWC's reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of designated air pollutants, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements that the Administrator determines are achievable for a particular category of sources (this standard is commonly referred to as ``maximum achievable control technology, or ``MACT''). Additionally section 129 provides that standards for new sources may not be less stringent than the emissions control achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit. This is referred to as the ``MACT floor.'' The standards themselves are set forth as emission limits and do not specify what technology must be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Other side of the link Sir, I note ('Universities plan business links', September 30) that the universities are to appoint chief executives to help build links between higher education and the private sector. As someone who has worked in industrial R&amp;D, I suggest that, in addition to the longer-term links associated with the sponsoring of MSc and PhD students, they also promote ways of allowing companies access to university knowledge and facilities on a shorter-term, more flexible basis.

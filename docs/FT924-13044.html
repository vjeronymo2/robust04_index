			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Is it time to buy? NO ONE RINGS a bell to tell private investors when it is the right time to buy shares. There is always the risk of buying just before the market plunges. Yesterday's base rate cut caused a mini-rally in equities. Any fall in interest rates increases the attractions of shares over cash; and declining rates ease the burdens on indebted companies and increase the chance that the economy will recover. But cutting rates has its dangers. The pound may weaken, leading to rising import prices and higher inflation. And the prospect of a declining pound may dissuade overseas investors from buying UK shares. Nevertheless, the traditional valuation methods provide some comfort for those who believe the time is right to buy. The dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share is 4.9 per cent, marginally below the 20 year average of 5.1 per cent but significantly above the rate of inflation at 3.6 per cent. In the last quarter century, real yields have normally been negative, not positive. The ratio of long term gilt to equity yields is even better news. The higher the ratio, the more attractive the returns on gilts - and the greater the danger that investors will sell shares and buy bonds. Indeed, the ratio peaked at 3.34 on October 2 1987 - just before the Crash. But the ratio is currently 1.9, below the 1976-92 average of 2.2. Prospects are less encouraging if you watch the price-earnings ratio, which relates share prices to corporate profits. Over the last 20 years, the average p/e ratio on the FT-A 500 Index has been 11; the current ratio of 15.7 is well above that, indicating that shares are expensive in historical terms. But Ian Stephenson, of Smith New Court, feels that if private investors can afford to lock money away, they should think about moving into the market. He points out that if gilt yields fall to 8 per cent and the yield ratio remains around current levels, share yields will fall to 4 per cent, offering the prospect of a 20 per cent capital gain. The gloomsters' view is that traditional valuation methods have become irrelevant owing to fundamental changes in the investment climate. Some argue that we face a Great Depression akin to the 1930s. Deflation will occur and that will mean falls in asset prices such as houses and shares. 'We believe the rise from the November 1987 lows represents nothing more than the biggest suckers' rally in history', says David Kauders, a Taunton-based financial adviser who has been recommending his clients to invest in gilts and US treasury bonds. In his newsletter he says: 'It is essential at present to stand aside from stock markets, to make very few changes to your portfolios of government securities.' With expert views diverging so sharply, the average investor can be forgiven for feeling confused. At least some compromises are available. The first is the savings schemes offered by unit and investment trusts. These allow the investor to buy into the market gradually and avoid the danger of investing just before a crash. Pound-cost averaging means that investors buy more shares and units when prices are low. Guaranteed products can protect against capital loss. They are not ideal, since the investor normally needs to hold them for a set period to receive the guarantee, does not receive any income and may suffer a tax penalty. Two five year bonds were launched by the Britannia Building Society and Guardian Royal Exchange this week. The first offers 110 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index over five years; the GRE offer will pay slightly less than Footsie's rise. Those interested should consult a financial adviser.</p>

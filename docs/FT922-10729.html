			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y special meeting raises concern OLYMPIA &amp; York has called a special meeting next month at which holders of bonds secured by a Manhattan office building expect they will be asked for concessions to help conserve the property developer's cash flow. Such a request would be a departure from the debt-restructuring plan outlined by O&amp;Y three weeks ago. The plan envisages segregating O&amp;Y's relatively healthy North American property portfolio from the rest of its Dollars 12bn debt. O&amp;Y said yesterday the purpose of the meeting was solely to bring holders of Dollars 548m of bonds secured by the building at 55 Water Street up to date on recent developments. However, bondholders are expecting that they will be asked to defer Dollars 35m in annual interest payments due on June 30. Although collateral on the 53-storey building appears sufficient to meet the June interest obligation, longer-term cash flows are threatened by the expiry of a sizeable portion of leases this year and in 1993. Mr Michael Barr, an analyst at H Rivkin &amp; Co, a New York bond trading house which represents some holders of Water Street paper, said any move by O&amp;Y to defer interest was likely to be resisted by the bondholders. The Water Street financing, arranged through a single-purpose company, was designed to protect investors from any financial problems of O&amp;Y itself. Cash flow from the property must be used for running expenses and bond payments before it can be channelled to O&amp;Y. In another sign of the growing number of brushfires threatening O&amp;Y, the trustee of an overdue Canadian commercial paper programme has called a meeting on May 20 which is likely to consider a resolution declaring the company in default. The commercial paper is secured by the 36-storey Exchange Tower in Toronto, which O&amp;Y has been trying to sell and lease back with the help of a Canadian government loan guarantee. But a tentative deal has come unstuck following the government's reluctance to be involved. Under the Exchange Tower trust indenture, the trustee is obliged to put O&amp;Y in default if 25 per cent of paper holders ask it to do so. O&amp;Y is expected to tell the meeting that the investors may have more to lose by putting the company into default than by waiting for a sale of the building or a wider debt-restructuring agreement. The company has failed to make several debt payments since its liquidity crisis surfaced last month. But it did pay about Dollars 6m in monthly interest two weeks ago to holders of floating-rate notes secured by three New York buildings. O&amp;Y has not indicated whether it plans to pay CDollars 25.4m (USDollars 21.5m) in semi-annual interest due by May 14 on bonds secured by the 72-storey First Canadian Place in Toronto.</p>

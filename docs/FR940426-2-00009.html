The intended beneficiaries are U.S. producers of nonagricultural goods or services that seek to export such goods or services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Market Development Cooperator Program funds should not be viewed as a replacement for funding from other sources, either public or private. An important goal of this program is to increase the sum of Federal and non-Federal export market development activities. This goal can best be achieved by using program funds to encourage new initiatives. In addition to new initiatives, expansion of the scope of an existing project also may qualify for funding consideration. The Department of Commerce will consider such projects as entirely new initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are encouraged to propose activities that would be most appropriate to the market development needs of their industry or industries.

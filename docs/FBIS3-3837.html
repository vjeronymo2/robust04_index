The chairman of the Somali Patriotic Movement Aden Abdullahi  Nur told XINHUA late tonight that "Aidid and Ali Mahdi have  reached a compromise and will sign a peace agreement tonight or  tomorrow. Now they are preparing for the signing."    Secretary General of the Somali Intellectuals Forum Zakaria  Mohamud Haji Abdi disclosed that after the press release issued  by the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), Aidid  called on the acting special representative of U.N.  Secretary-General Lansana Kouyate and proposed that he and Ali  Mahdi could represent their separate alliance to sign the  agreement.    This afternoon, the acting special representative stated in  the press release that as the faction leaders were not able to  resolve the problem of representation of the Southern Somali  National Movement (SSNM), he decided that the United Nations was  no longer able to provide the faction leaders with good offices  and facilities to continue their current consultations.    In an interview with XINHUA late tonight, SSNM Secretary  General Abdullahi Sheikh confirmed the compromise.    "That (the compromise) has given a mandate to group of 12  spokesman Awad Ashareh Mohamed, and let us sign on behalf of  SSNM, Aidid gets another mandate. Both of them will sign a  document on behalf of the factions belonging to them", said  Abdullahi.    "This is what we have reached at this time. Maybe tomorrow  we will have another development and we will sign a document  along this line," he added.    This afternoon, Awad Ashareh, spokeman for the group of 12  led by Ali Mahdi, noted that the Nairobi peace talks on the  Somali issue have collapsed "because Aidid refused to sign the  reconciliation agreement," adding that "we have accepted all  conditions raised by him (Aidid) during the peace talks."    The Somali peace talks sponsored by the United Nations  Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) began here on March 17.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexican media sale nets Dollars 641m for government THE Mexican government has sold two state-owned television networks, a string of cinemas and other media companies for 2bn pesos (Dollars 641m) to Radio-televisora del Centro, a company formed by the owners of Grupo Elektra, the electrical and white goods chain. The new company will be controlled by Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president and principal owner of Grupo Elektra. It will become Mexico's second-largest media group after Televisa, the powerful television, radio and newspaper concern. Radiotelevisora bid some 30 per cent more than the runner-up in the privatisation, Cosmovision. Radiotelevisora will look for domestic and foreign partners to help it compete with Televisa, which has about 90 per cent of Mexico's television market and owns stakes in Univision, the principal Spanish-language station in the US, and the Peruvian broadcaster, Radio Defusion de Peruana. Televisa also has links with TCI, the world's largest cable company, among others. The new company is also expected to invest heavily in improving the run-down former state-owned cinema chain. The government recently gave the industry a boost by removing controls on cinema ticket prices. The government decided not to sell the state-owned newspaper El Nacional, on the grounds that the highest offer was not sufficient. The newspaper, which staunchly supports the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party but which is believed to be loss-making, will thus continue to be run and subsidised by the government. Privately-owned Grupo Elektra is Mexico's largest consumer electronics chain, with some 275 stores. It imports, makes and assembles televisions, white goods, radio equipment and other electronic goods, and through a subsidiary, offers personal radio communications.</p>

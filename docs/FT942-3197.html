			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Foot-dragging slows path to single market: Commission is pointing a finger at the laggards in an attempt to prod them into more rapid legislative action Eighteen months ago the single market for Europe was launched with great fanfare. Yet it is still far from complete. Today, the European Commission will point the finger at the EU's most slothful members to find out why their parliaments have still not adopted all the legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital within the market's frontiers. Commission tables to be produced at today's council of ministers meeting in Luxembourg show that Germany, France and the Netherlands have the poorest record on pharmaceutical products: in company law Germany, Greece, Spain and France fall well short; on intellectual property, half the EU's member states have delayed adoption of the relevant directives; perhaps most worrying of all - since it accounts for 15 per cent of the EU's gross national product - is the sluggish progress made on securing a single market in public procurement. Second, and more crucially, ministers will be asked to consider a proposal designed to examine rigorously those areas of the single market where no harmonisation legislation applies but where the principal of 'mutual recognition' of technical standards is supposed to ensure that pressure cookers made in Italy, for example, can be sold without obstacle anywhere else in the Union. This proposal goes to the heart of a dilemma facing Europe's policymakers. With countries still blocking goods from other member states on the often spurious grounds that safety or technical standards do not match, the Commission has to decide whether more legislation is required to maintain momentum behind the single market. It is unlikely to get agreement on the proposal today. Several countries are opposed, most notably France and Germany, against whom most complaints have been received. The decision to step up pressure on EU members comes after what Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, describes as a 'period of observation'. 'Overall, the single market is working,' he says. 'But in some areas, legislation at a national level has been delayed - completing the legislative programme must now be an urgent priority.' The naming-names exercise is thus designed to prod member states into speeding up their legislative programmes to ensure, as one official put it, that 'home bases are covered'. The Commission insists that its approach is less about public humiliation and more about fact finding. 'The idea is to go through those areas that are performing worst, and for the member states to spell out the problems that are getting in the way of adopting directives,' said the official. 'We want to get detailed responses from the member states as to when we can expect these problems to be unblocked.' The exercise will continue at the next council meeting in October, when Mr d'Archirafi intends to switch his focus away from the quantity of legislation adopted, to the quality of legislation once it reaches national statute books. But more likely to provoke heated argument at today's meeting is the Commission's proposal to examine where mutual recognition of technical standards is not working. When the single market was first dreamt up, it was deemed unnecessary to harmonise standards in all commercial sectors. Standards in sensitive areas such as medicine, chemicals, cars and toys would be harmonised under legislation agreed by all 12 member states. But for the bulk of goods and services mutual recognition was supposed to ensure that prams, lollipops and electric light bulbs, for example, would circulate freely. In practice, there have been endless hitches. A Commission inventory of barriers to trade based on complaints from manufacturers shows that peas from Belgium, for example, came up against barriers in Denmark because of 'classification problems and quality standards'. The UK objected to Dutch radishes because of worries about a certain fly. Ceramic tiles from Greece have been barred from the French market because of 'difficulties in obtaining type approval'. Generally, the complaints tend to come from manufacturers in smaller member states who cannot get their goods circulated in the larger countries. A survey by the Danish finance ministry produced a shockingly high number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade. As a result Brussels is coming under pressure to produce more harmonisation legislation, particularly from the less powerful EU members such as Denmark and Spain, to deal with those areas where mutual recognition is failing. 'There have been, for example, a lot of concerns from caravan makers,' said an official from DG15, the directorate responsible for the internal market. 'We have had pressure to produce a directive over things like dimensions and the materials with which the caravans are made.' As a first step, today's proposal recommends a change to the way in which complaints are recorded. At present, Brussels relies on manufacturers to keep it abreast of what is going on at a grassroots level. Now it wants to switch the onus to the authorities who are doing the refusing. In other words, any national authority that refuses a product from one country will have to notify the Commission thereby providing Brussels with a more complete record of where problems are arising and where more harmonisation legislation might eventually be required. Some member states - notably Britain - are very keen. The French and Germans, however, have argued that there are so many examples of where one country is blocking another's goods that the proposal will spawn unnecessary bureaucracy. Some at the Commission are sceptical. They say the Germans and French do not want the issue to be tackled so they can continue to block products from other countries, thus protecting their own manufacturers. What is certain is that today's meeting is unlikely to produce a consensus on the proposal. That is more likely to come in October when internal market ministers next meet. Until then, and until the information has been gathered, the Commission will continue to favour mutual recognition as a better, less cumbersome, route than legislation. This is partly because legislation is so costly, but also in recognition of the fact that a directive on caravans, or peas would do nothing for the image of the meddling Brussels bureaucrat. But if mutual recognition continues to be flouted by the Union's biggest and most powerful states, some countries, and many manufacturers, will step up pressure for more harmonisation. At that point Brussels will have to decide how best to tackle the grievances of the Belgian eiderdown maker who, because of the stuffing he uses, cannot sell his products in the Netherlands, Germany or France.</p>

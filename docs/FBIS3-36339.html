That is where passions are seething!    The whole point is that the draft agreement on dual  citizenship was prepared by the Russian side and conveyed  through the Russian Embassy in Kyrgyzstan to the republic's  president and government. Later there was Askar Akayev's New  Year address to the people, his interviews with newspapers, and  speeches in which he noted that dual citizenship "will be useful  to both sides and will introduce a new spirit of trust,  cooperation, and fraternity to relations between the two peoples  -- Russian and Kyrgyz." And most importantly it will work like  a dam in the path of the stream of the Russian-speaking  population leaving the republic. After all, last year alone,  according to the Slav foundation, over 100,000 Russian speakers,  as almost all inhabitants of nonindigenous nationality are now  called here, left Kyrgyzstan. And those who left were primarily  skilled national economy specialists, doctors, teachers, and  engineers.    The republic's president is concerned. Measures are being  urgently elaborated in the government to halt this destructive  flow. But the process has begun, as the saying goes. And,  unfortunately, it is being accelerated by several political  parties defending so-called "national resurrection." Closing  their eyes to the obvious advantages of dual citizenship both  for Russians and for the Kyrgyz, not only, for instance, in the  stabilization of the situation in the republic but also in the  sphere of science, education, and so forth, they have rallied on  one salient -- preventing the signing of this agreement. The  fiercest attacks on Askar Akayev come from the headquarters of  the "Asaba" national resurrection party. Its central council  has stated categorically and without beating about the bush:  "The introduction of dual citizenship is a threat not only to  the sovereignty of the Kyrgyz state but also to the very  existence of the Kyrgyz nation."    But sober politicians who have preserved a spirit of  internationalism do not think that way at all. Here is the  opinion of Feliks Sharshenbayevich Kulov, a hero of August 1991  in Kyrgyzstan, vice president, and now head of the  administration of Chuyskaya Oblast, the largest in the republic:    "I hope no one can accuse me of lacking patriotism, and I  hope it does not seem immodest, but my actions have spoken  louder than any words.... I unconditionally support the idea of  dual citizenship since it serves primarily the interests of the  Kyrgyz nation and could become the foundation of our state's  security."    An interview with Chingiz Aytmatov appeared in VECHERNIY  BISHKEK at just the right time. Considering Russian culture and  its influence on him as an Asian man, the writer simply and  clearly told his fellow citizens as if for their edification:    "How blind are those who call for national self-isolation,  speaking of national exclusiveness. That road is a dead end. I  think Kyrgyz culture should in no circumstances separate itself  from Russian culture, from the Russian language which opened the  way for the Kyrgyz people into world culture."    Whether or not there is to be dual citizenship will most  likely be decided in the next few days. Optimists, and there  are many of them among sober Kyrgyz politicians, believe that  Askar Akayev will embark on such an interstate agreement between  Russia and Kyrgyzstan after victory at the referendum.</p>

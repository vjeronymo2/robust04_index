He said -- and we quote: "There is no question of  tearing up any map or territory, as might be deduced from the  alarmism that some People's Party leaders wish to transmit to  the public."    Saavedra advocated the path of "calm, tranquillity, and  mutual respect" in order to achieve the impetus to autonomy to  which Felipe Gonzalez committed himself in his investiture  speech and which will enable the autonomous communities to  achieve the maximum level of powers recognized by the  Constitution and their respective autonomy statutes.    The minister asserted that the government will not negotiate  Aznar's autonomy proposal in its current form and that it will  continue to implement its own policy. As will be recalled,  Saavedra has described as "simplistic" and "underdeveloped" the  autonomy proposal that the People's Party presented in Barcelona  and asserted that an issue as complex as building the state of  the autonomous communities cannot be reduced to a proposal that  seeks the standardization of powers of all the communities  within two legislative terms and that recognizes only a few  distinctive features.    In this connection, Saavedra clearly distanced himself from  the People's Party strategy of finalizing the autonomy framework  by stating that the state of the autonomous communities is  always being built, "like it or not." But Saavedra's line  hardened even further when he added that "if this (approach) is  shared by the other political forces, I am delighted for  everybody; if not, let everybody implement the autonomy policy  that he deems most opportune."    In his opinion, it is clear that the People's Party does not  have a serious and well-developed autonomy proposal on which to  sit down and negotiate, since its document does not specify the  distinctive features or define points as important as the  matters that are nontransferable and those that can be  transferred to the autonomous communities.    Nevertheless, he especially emphasized the government's  desire to reach agreement with the People's Party on the  so-called democratic impetus and the "local pact." According to  the minister, the latter agreement will bring about a real  decentralization of the state's public expenditure, which will  make our country one of the most decentralized in the world. In  this connection, he agreed with [Catalan president] Jordi Pujol  that the distribution of expenditure must be in keeping with the  level of powers assumed by each of the state's administrations.    Last, the minister would not assess the Federation of  Municipalities' new demands for powers and played down its  threat to curb the turnabout in autonomy unless there is  previously a municipal pact.</p>

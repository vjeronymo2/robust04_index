			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tower in US S&amp;L Maxwell connection ROBERT MAXWELL used former Senator John Tower to seek US government assistance for an aborted attempt in 1988 to acquire 15 insolvent Texas savings-and-loans institutions, according to a former US bank regulatory official. Tower, who died in an air crash last year, was a paid consultant to Maxwell and served on the board of Macmillan, the publisher owned by Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). In August 1988 Senator Tower went to see Mr Danny Wall, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the now-defunct agency that previously regulated the US savings-and-loan industry. The former Texan Senator met Mr Wall to argue on behalf of a bid by Maxwell for 15 failing savings-and-loan institutions that were later declared insolvent, sold as a single package and renamed the Bluebonnet Savings Bank. A Congressional investigator claimed at the weekend that 'Maxwell hired Tower to try and grease the savings-and-loan deal', but Mr Wall, who resigned in March 1990, said he saw 'nothing nefarious' in Tower's approach.</p>

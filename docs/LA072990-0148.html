			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING WORDS  </P> <P> Although it is true that Massachusetts and Virginia were settled by English  speakers, it is also true that from Florida to California, the only European  language was Spanish, even before the Mayflower. The arguments the Proposition  63 people raise have nothing to do with unity but rather with supremacy.  </P> <P> The first thing the English-speaking slave owners did after bringing the  Africans to the United States was to separate them so they would forget their  language. Forget your language, and you forget your culture. Forget the  culture, and you forget the history. Forget the history -- and Anglos have  always been here, because it was their destiny.  </P> <P> Forget your native language, and be fed exclusively by ethnocentric  schoolteachers and by Madison Avenue. Forget Spanish, and it's OK to invade  Central America. After all, those are not our people; they don't speak English!  </P> <P> FORREST HOPPING  </P> <P> SPANISH TEACHER, GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

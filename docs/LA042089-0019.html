			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON PARDON  </P> <P> Robert Shogan's article "Historians Tending to Support Pardon of Nixon" (Part  I, April 8) notwithstanding, I still believe that President Gerald Ford's  action was a mistake of historic dimension for at least two important reasons:  </P> <P> 1. The pardon gives precedential support to the idea that presidents are above  the law. Please, let us continue to restrict membership in our nobility to  noted entertainers and athletes.  </P> <P> 2. The pardon cut off a most promising investigation of high-level politics as  conducted in the U.S. I see no reason why Richard Nixon's testimony could not  have been required under a grant of immunity. To me, self-knowledge as a nation  is much more important than the transient embarrassment of politicians and  their hangers-on.  </P> <P> HORACE M. GAIMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Bhopal, Feb. 27 (PTI [Press Trust of India]): There  are a total of 707 patients who are confirmed to be suffering  from the dreaded AIDS in the country, according to Dr. Lev N.  Khodakevich of the World Health Organisation, who is working as  a medical officer for the global programme on AIDS in India.    Dr. Khodakevich, who was here recently to inaugurate a  five-day national project for training doctors in tackling AIDS,  said the number of unreported AIDS cases in the country could be  anything between 10,000 and 20,000.    Bombay and Manipur were the most affected areas as far as  AIDS was concerned, he said. One per cent of pregnant women in  these two places were suffering from the HIV infection.    Dr. Khodakevich said Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Daman  and  Diu were the country's only places from where not a single AIDS  case had been reported but pointed out that this could be due to  lack of any proper reporting system for the disease. AIDS had  first entered the country in 1986. The largest number of AIDS  patients were found in the world in Africa, followed by Asia,  South America, North America and Europe.</p>

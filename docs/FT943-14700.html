			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Credit in debit The French banking industry was shocked at the depth of Credit Lyonnais' problems and the scale of the rescue package announced earlier this year. Unfortunately, it now appears that the bank's prospects are even grimmer than outlined then. Yesterday's report into the state-controlled bank is a corporate horror story of reckless managers and negligent owners. But the most worrying aspect is the chairman's suggestion that there is more bad news to come. It had appeared that Mr Jean Peyrelevade had quickly got a measure of the bank's problems after taking control last November. But Credit Lyonnais is now certain to incur further big losses in the first half of this year. That only increases the need and urgency to raise fresh capital to shore up the bank's solvency ratios. The likelihood of rights issues at discounts to book value will dilute the returns available to existing shareholders. At some point, though, a strong recovery story could emerge. It would be folly to buy Credit Lyonnais shares while the scale of provisioning is unknown. But as the Swedish banking sector illustrates, sentiment can swing astonishingly quickly once hard evidence emerges that the worst is past. Credit Lyonnais has a solid retail banking franchise in France. It has bought some sound businesses abroad - even if it paid too much for them - and controls an Dollars 11bn portfolio of industrial holdings. As a massively-geared bet on European recovery, Credit Lyonnais may one day have its attractions. But before then, existing shareholders - and French taxpayers - will have much pain to endure.</p>

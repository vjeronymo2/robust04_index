			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN'S BORZA BEATS MATER DEI HIS WAY  </P> <P> The only sparks in Thursday night's game between Tustin and Mater Dei were  provided by Tustin quarterback Andy Borza.  </P> <P> Borza made all the big plays on offense to give Tustin a 27-3 victory in front  6,000 at Orange Coast College. Borza scored on runs of 65 and two yards and set  up a third touchdown with a 38-yard pass to Robert Collier to give the Tillers  their third consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Off the field, Mater Dei suffered another loss when running back Derek Sparks  was not cleared in time to play. A frantic attempt to get approval from  Southern Section commissioner Stan Thomas to use Sparks failed.  </P> <P> Sparks, who gained 1,944 yards at Van Nuys Montclair Prep last season, enrolled  at Mater Dei on Monday. However, his transcripts lacked a signature from  Montclair Prep principal Vernon Simpson.  </P> <P> School officials finally obtained Simpson's signature at 7:05 p.m. Thursday --  55 minutes before game time -- according to Mater Dei principal Lyle Porter. He  called Thomas, but the commissioner said the transcripts had arrived too late.  </P> <P> "The commissioner requested that we wait another day," Porter said, "and we  agreed."  </P> <P> So Sparks, who was suited up and prepared to play, could only watch as the  Monarchs made one mistake after another. Mater Dei (0-2) turned the ball over  six times, which provided Borza with plenty of scoring opportunities.  </P> <P> Borza completed only three of 15 passes for 68 yards, but two completions set  up touchdowns. He also gained 58 yards rushing.  </P> <P> "Andy really came through for us tonight," Tiller Coach Marijon Ancich said.  "We made only about 10 good plays tonight and Andy made four of them."  </P> <P> The first came midway through the second quarter after Mater Dei's Rick Ellis  fumbled to give Tustin the ball at the Monarchs' 21-yard line. On third down,  Borza rolled to his right and completed a pass to Collier for a first down on  the two.  </P> <P> On the next play, Borza improvised, taking the snap and diving forward for the  touchdown.  </P> <P> "That's was his own doing," Ancich said. "He saw that the defensive was split  and just followed the center. We teach our kids to look for those things."  </P> <P> On Tustin's next possession, Borza spotted Collier, who had slipped behind  defensive back Jim Doone. The 38-yard completion set up a two-yard touchdown  run by Visko Ancich.  </P> <P> Borza scored again in the third quarter on a 65-yard quarterback sneak, which  was another ad lib on his part.  </P> <P> Other than Borza, the Tustin offense was contained by the Monarchs. Running  backs Ancich and Ron Goods were stopped for the first time this season.  </P> <P> Goods, who came into the game as the second-leading rusher in the county,  gained 39 yards in 14 carries and fumbled twice. Ancich had 40 yards in 15  carries.  </P> <P> However, Tustin kept Mater Dei's offense bottled most of the evening, limiting  the Monarchs to 84 yards rushing and 232 total yards. Mater Dei got inside  Tustin's 10-yard line three times, but managed to score only three points from  those opportunities.  </P></p>

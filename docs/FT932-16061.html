			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Money Markets: An easier atmosphere THERE WAS an easier atmosphere in European cash and futures markets yesterday after the Bundesbank announced that it would be offering wholesale funds to commercial banks this week at variable rates, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank said that it would offer a variable rate repurchase agreement  -or repo - in this week's tenders for 14 days and 35 days. The lowest accepted rate last week was for 8.17 per cent. There were strong expectations that the rate would be shaved to around 8.10 per cent this morning, or even to 8.05 per cent. News of the variable rate offer had a positive effect on German cash and futures markets. The interest rate on German call money dropped to about 8.15 per cent, helped by adequate reserves among German banks. Euromark contracts were higher right across the board. The June contract rose 7 basis points on the day to close at 92.84, while the September contract also gained 7 basis points, ending at 93.74. In spite of this more optimistic mood, there was talk that some banks might offer to buy funds at comparatively high rates to be sure of getting adequate liquidity. This is only the second month of the Bundesbank's new and less rigid minimum reserve requirements and some banks are concerned not to fall foul of the new arrangements. The announcement of the variable rate repo had a positive effect on French franc markets. One-month French francs fell from about 10.25 per cent at the start of the day to 10 per cent by the close. Three-month money also declined, from around 9.75 per cent to about 9.5 per cent, bringing the spread between three-month D-Marks and three-month French francs down to 156 basis points. The June French franc futures contract finished 2 basis points higher on the day at 91.80. There are strong expectations that the Bank of France will bring down the interest rate on its 5 to 10-day lending window, currently at 12 per cent, tomorrow. Cash rates in the sterling money markets softened again on an easier day in the discount market. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 850m. Three-month deposit rates closed at around 5 7/8 per cent, having been at 5 15/16 per cent on Monday night.</p>

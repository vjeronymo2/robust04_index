			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Soyuz' Group Appeal" -- SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA headline] </F>   [Text] Dear compatriots, fellow citizens, and friends!    We are now in the third year of the great tragedy of which  the "Soyuz" group of the Congress of USSR People's Deputies  repeatedly warned. It is time to sober up: Not only the  peoples but also their leaders have had bitter experience of  "salvation" apart. Now everyone sees that this is impossible.  Our strength resided and will reside in the unity of peoples  and territories. Our strength resided and will reside in the  correct cause of mutual assistance, sincere friendship, and  cooperation. Our strength resided and will reside in the clear  realization that each of our peoples stands to gain more in a  unified Union than without it.    The restoration of a unified Union should not be seen as the  restoration of the featureless dominion of the totalitarian  bureaucracy. That would be a step back. The basis of the new  union must be a political, economic, legal, and cultural area of  multiethnic states.    In that form cooperation between peoples and states will  make  it possible to make the best use of the wealth of natural  resources, industrial potential, and possibilities of  agriculture. This will ensure the highest labor productivity --  the only real basis for an increase in the standard of living  and prosperity of all peoples and society as a whole. The  state's coordinating role in the development of the economy  should be commensurate with the acuteness of the social tasks  that this state is urged to resolve by the whole course of  history. By virtue of its uncontrolled laws of price formation,  competition, and the activity of investment areas, the market  should not be the main regulator of commodity and money  relations.    Only a unified army and unified state security organs can be  the guarantors of the state's national security. The state  should provide the defenders of the fatherland with firm social  guarantees.    We deputies within the "Soyuz" group have not betrayed our  principles and remain true to our positions to this day despite  the taunts unleashed against us by many mass media. We  previously advocated the preservation of the unified state, and  today our main and sole objective is the restoration and  strengthening of the state system, the restoration of our common  home -- as a renewed union of peoples -- and the unity of all  our territories.    As you know, during the Second "Soyuz" Congress the group  was  reorganized into an all-Union association of deputies of all  levels, and the "Soyuz" People's Foundation was set up. A  presidium session has decided to hold the third congress of the  "Soyuz" movement at the end of July 1994.    We appeal to all members of the "Soyuz" deputies' group, to  people's deputies past and present of all levels, to all those  who support a strong, unified state -- a Union of peoples -- to  step up the work of our organizational structures in the  localities and enlist the public at large.    Today "Soyuz" is ready to cooperate with all parties and  movements that aim to revive our unified state for the sake of  national peace and harmony and for the sake of the well-being  and prosperity of our peoples.    It is still not too late, it is still possible to restore  our  common home -- the Soviet Union.    [Signed] G.I. Tikhonov, chairman of the "Soyuz" People's  Foundation; V. Alksnis; S. Baburin; V. Varennikov; G. Kadyrov;  N. Muradyan; F. Salmanov; A. Chekhoyev; V. Yakubov; B. Oleynik.</p>

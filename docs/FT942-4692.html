			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario offering may have pricing concession The Province of Ontario is expected to make some concession on pricing in order to ensure a successful launch for its first global offering of its new fiscal year. The issue, which could emerge today, is expected to raise around Dollars 1bn and have a maturity of 10 years. Syndicate managers reported only muted interest in the deal, due to Ontario's frequent presence in the market and its recent downgrading. As a result, the price talk centred around 65 to 67 basis points over 10-year Treasuries, even though Ontario's outstanding dollar bonds were trading at a yield spread of around 63 basis points in the secondary market. Salomon Brothers, which has been appointed joint bookrunner with Goldman Sachs, with RBC Dominion as joint lead manager, said the lack of a 10-year eurodollar benchmark would increase the attraction of Ontario's deal. There have been few eurodollar offerings with a 2004 maturity due to the volatility in the financial markets this year. Advance Bank Australia, a building society-turned-bank operating mainly in New South Wales, made its first appearance in the eurobond market yesterday with a Dollars 250m offering of floating-rate notes due 1999. The discounted margin on the notes was 40 basis points over Libor. Lead manager JP Morgan said the bonds were selling well, reflecting the extensive pre-marketing efforts and the bank's positive credit outlook. The bonds were kept in syndicate overnight. Elsewhere, a rise in the Canadian dollar and continued currency arbitrage opportunities prompted a further supply of short-dated Canadian issues yesterday as SNCF and Swedish Export Credit raised a total of Dollars 250m through offerings of five-year and three-year Eurobonds respectively. Investors were attracted by the relatively high coupons on both issues, the proceeds of which were believed to have been swapped into floating-rate dollars. Argentina's Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires will issue a sixth Dollars 20m tranche of six-month notes under its two-year Dollars 100m euro-commercial paper programme. West Merchant Bank and Banco Medefin are dealers for the programme.</p>

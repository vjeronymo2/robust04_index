			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Justifiably dollar shy Central bank intervention in currency markets is rarely effective when the problems of the currency in question reflect anxiety about the broader stance of monetary policy. Hence the general scepticism among traders and economists after Wednesday's intervention by the US Federal Reserve to prop up a dollar that was plumbing yet another post-war low against the yen. The short-term perception is that the Fed's policy stance is not restrictive enough to cope with inflationary pressures in the US and so pre-empt a further dollar decline. Yet it is a moot point whether even a significant increase in short-term dollar rates, perhaps after the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in mid-month, would provide the reassurance markets seek. Historically, the dollar has tended to strengthen late in the economic cycle, as the Fed has applied the brakes to an overheating economy and the rest of the world has moved into the recovery phase. Yet many of the international flows in the present cycle may continue to work against the gravitational pull of short-term interest rate differentials. One trend that could go unhelpfully into reverse relates to the growth in official dollar reserves. These have ballooned, most notably in Asia, in response to large capital inflows, as central banks have sought to offset the upward pressure on their currencies by purchasing dollars. Yet the cost of unsterilised intervention aimed at maintaining currency competitiveness is rapid money supply growth and accelerating inflation. With official reserves at record levels and inflation soaring, currency appreciation will come to seem the lesser evil. The dollar may thus have less support from this source in future. Progressive decline Portfolio flows in the US and Japan, meantime, have long been running in the opposite direction to what is needed to address the current account imbalance between the two countries. A less frequently observed phenomenon is the progressive decline of net direct investment out of Japan from Dollars 48bn in 1990 to less than Dollars 14bn last year. Why is the Japanese tradeable goods sector failing to respond to the appreciation of the yen against the dollar by investing more heavily in the US? One clue is provided by an article in the New York Fed's latest quarterly review, which points out that foreign firms' experience in the US has been dismal even when the dollar is stripped out of the equation. With assets of Dollars 1,800bn and sales of Dollars 1,200bn they failed to turn any profit on their investment in 1992. Transfer pricing Of course, any losses of Japanese companies within the aggregate figures may be less than they might have incurred on the same operation at home, because of the overvaluation of the yen. But since five out of six inward investment dollars have been spent on acquisitions rather than new enterprises, this looks academic. Nor do the New York Fed economists believe that transfer pricing - shifting profits to less heavily taxed overseas jurisdictions - accounts for more than a quarter, at most, of the difference between foreign and domestic profits. The more obvious explanation is that foreign companies went wild in the takeover boom of the 1980s, since by 1990 around half of foreign holdings in the US resulted from acquisitions in the previous five years. The Japanese in particular were taking advantage of their lower cost of capital to buy cheaply. Yet the advantage appears to have been nullified by poor selection of acquisitions and heavy reliance on debt finance. Post-acquisition profits have tended to collapse. In the past, direct investment profits have improved with age. Even so, recent experience will do little to reduce Japanese industrialists' dollar shyness. And in a climate of poor corporate earnings and depressed investment in Japan, the short-term enthusiasm for investment overseas is anyway limited. In due course the dollar may have its day. But as the American monetary pundit James Grant has pithily observed in Grant's Interest Rate Observer, the miracle of the dollar is that, after so many years of officially sponsored depreciation, it is still the world's top monetary brand name.</p>

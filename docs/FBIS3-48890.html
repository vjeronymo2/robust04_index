Stir Over `Firm Decision To Appoint Yusuke  Yoshinaga as Public Prosecutor General'"]    [Text] The appointment of Yusuke Yoshinaga (61 years old),  chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office, who is known  as "Mr. Special Investigator," to the top prosecutorial post,  public prosecutor general, on 10 December has been settled.  Opinion is rife that the investigation of general contractors  will gain momentum by the decision to make Yoshinaga public  prosecutor general, but judging from established practice up  till now, one can say that this appointment is an extreme  exception.    As the chief prosecutor in the Lockheed scandal, Yoshinaga  arrested and prosecuted former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, and  he later had a hand in the Douglas-Grumman scandal, the Recruit  scandal, and so on. But in November 1991 he became chief of the  Osaka High Public Prosecutor's Office, which was said to be "the  highest post that he will reach," so it was thought "there will  be no more times for Yoshinaga to appear on stage." But in July  1993 he astonished everyone by being appointed chief of the  Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office.    Moreover, after a mere five months he is succeeding to the  top post during the term of Public Prosecutor General Yasutaka  Okamura because Okamura abdicated his position. A person related  to the Public Prosecutor's Office explains this promotion.    "The one who was controlling prosecutorial appointments up  till now was Yasuchika Negoro, administrative vice minister for  justice, and he was also scheduled to assume office as the next  public prosecutor general. But confidence in him is at a low ebb  because in the Sagawa Kyubin scandal he allowed the prosecution  of Kanemaru to end with only summary legal proceedings. The fact  is, the prime mover was Negoro, who has close ties with  politicians. By this appointment, the chance for Negoro, who was  born in the same year as Yoshinaga, 1932, to assume the office  of public prosecutor general disappeared, and one can say that  it severed the union of the judiciary and politics."    It appears that prosecutors actively engaged in prosecution  gained further strength from this appointment; it is said "there  are many prosecutors who would like to do something to enhance  Yoshinaga's appointment as public prosecutor general. The  investigation of general contractors is winding down; at present  Kajima President Rokuro Ishikawa is the focal point, but the  exposure of politicians is also being narrowed to two  politicians and brought to a close" (a person connected with the  District Public Prosecutor's Office). It is really very  promising, but there is also a view which has misgivings about  an appointment to public prosecutor general that is too early.  Because a rumor that when Yoshinaga made a comeback to chief of  the Tokyo High Prosecutor's Office there was a secret agreement  between him and a powerful former public prosecutor general, is  widely believed among those connected with prosecution. The  secret agreement "was that the condition for becoming public  prosecutor general was that Yoshinaga retire midway in his term  and yield the post of public prosecutor general to Negoro. It is  rumored that there even exists a signed and sealed memorandum.  If that were true, it would mean that the highest post in  prosecution, which should be the most open and aboveboard, is  held in rotation by the same group by private agreement" (person  connected with the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office).    Attorney Kazuo Kawakami, former chief of the Special  Investigations Department of the District Public Prosecutor's  Office says this:    "Speaking from Yoshinaga's real ability, I think it was a  natural appointment. I would like him to hunt down great evil  for the full extent of his term, without being led astray by  such things as disputes over appointments."    There are signs that early this month the investigation of  general contractors will finally begin to move toward central  political circles. We also desire a thorough investigation in  order to negate the rumors of a secret agreement.</p>

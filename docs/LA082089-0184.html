			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SYMPHONY IS ONLY A PART-TIME JOB;  </P> <P> BUT MUSICIANS FIND MANY PAYING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REST OF THEIR TIME  </P> <P> So, you've sweated through the preliminary auditions, agonized through the  finals, endured the probation period and collapsed with happiness upon getting  the nod: You're a tenured member of the Pacific Symphony.  </P> <P> Now what? What's at the end of the rainbow?  </P> <P> The orchestra will be playing classical subscription concerts, pops programs,  family concerts and a summer series. It also will be playing for choral  concerts and for such visiting dance companies as the Kirov, San Francisco and  Joffrey ballets and the American Ballet Theatre.  </P> <P> If you play every one of these programs -- and, as needs vary, not every  musician is asked to play every program -- your take home pay will be about  $18,000.  </P> <P> Which won't make much of a down payment on a condo in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> But probably you will have other options. Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's  executive director, says that all the Pacific's concert dates and rehearsals  for them take up about 24 weeks out of the year, "roughly 50%" of one's time.  Which leaves "plenty of opportunity for doing other things."  </P> <P> In fact, even though the musicians have a contract with the orchestra, the  Pacific Symphony is essentially made up of free-lancers, according to Robert W.  Stava, secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Musicians Assn., the union that  represents them.  </P> <P> Even if the Pacific can't keep them busy -- and can't keep food on their tables  -- on a full-time basis, "all are full-time musicians" who also teach, play in  other orchestras or, if they're lucky, tap into the lucrative Hollywood studio  market, Stava said.  </P> <P> Granted, it's hardly the most stable and secure life imaginable. But, as Spisto  notes, this is the professional musician's lot in life. If anything, he said,  Pacific Symphony members have it a little better than most. "There are more  than 1,600 orchestras in the country," he said. "Only about the top 50 can  offer the type of contract we are."  </P> <P> The average Pacific Symphony member receives only about 50% of his income from  the orchestra. "The key," Spisto repeated, "is that they've got to be flexible.  They've got to be willing to do a variety of things and, if they are, they will  do very well. Many of our musicians make far more than the average major  orchestra player throughout the country. In fact, some musicians came to  Southern California to seek the diversity and income that goes with it."  </P> <P> A number of the musicians, he said, end up making more than the $67,000 he gets  as executive director.  </P> <P> "Some earn a great deal of money," he said. "Some basically are making a modest  living. But my sense is that they all are doing reasonably well." CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

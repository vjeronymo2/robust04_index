			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Banham risks row over boundaries Leicestershire will remain almost intact as a county, in spite of the government's wishes, and Rutland will regain its independence after a lapse of 20 years, under proposals from the Local Government Commission yesterday. The commission also suggested that the city of Leicester should become a unitary authority. However, Sir John Banham, commission chairman, risked confrontation with the government by recommending that the rest of Leicestershire should remain with two tiers of local authority - a county and seven district councils. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is a strong advocate of unitary local government but he cannot deliver a unitary reorganisation unless this has first been recommended by the commission. Sir John, speaking in Rothley, Leicestershire, yesterday, distanced himself from government policy favouring unitary authorities. 'In all the surveys we've done, the level of popular support for unitary districts in shire England is very low indeed. People in shire England do not want to see a Balkanisation of local government,' he said. The recommendations mark the beginning of a new round of proposals from the commission, which will announce plans for restructuring another 10 counties next week. The choices for Leicestershire reflect a general pattern in the commission's recommendations, Sir John said. New authorities will generally have populations of between 150,000 and 250,000 - fewer in urban areas and more in sparsely populated rural areas. But he stressed that there must be a demand for change, adding: 'If there is not a clear message, our duty is to recommend no change. We are not in the business of changing for its own sake - nor is parliament.' Leicester is one of the largest English cities without its own city council, and there is unlikely to be serious opposition to the plan to give it unitary status. Rutland was absorbed into Leicestershire as one of its district councils. The justification for making it a unitary authority, in spite of a tiny population of 33,000, is the strength of local community feeling, matched only in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, Sir John said. The commission will now seek public response in Leicestershire to its proposals, both by contacting every household with a leaflet and by conducting polls. It said it would be equally happy if Leicestershire abandons the county council and splits into five unitary authorities. Local authority organisations were divided over the recommendations. The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said it was 'particularly worried about the impact of the commission's preferred proposals on costs, services and accountability'. It suggested that creating a new Rutland authority could cost an extra Pounds 125 per household, and that it would be better that the historic county of Rutland should be recreated only for 'ceremonial purposes'. The cross-party Association of District Councils regretted that the commission had not proposed a unitary structure for the whole of Leicestershire.</p>

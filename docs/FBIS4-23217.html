			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision by the HNP [Reformed National Party]  not to participate in the Mandela election is already yielding  fruit. Whereas General Constand Viljoen compromised himself by  his part in the election, so that he was under obligation to  attend Mr. Mandela's inauguration, the HNP still stands aloof.  This stance gives it inner strength, with the result that it  can now embark on future plans without any prejudice. The  political struggle will now be transformed into a people's  [volk] movement. The recent election has clearly drawn the  dividing lines between right and left, between those that voted  and those that did not vote. Those that did not vote are  physically and spiritually geared to continue the struggle.    Mr. Marais stated in a circular to party members that the  veil has been lifted from the future the HNP is facing. This  future will be based on the principles of healthy nationalism in  which the HNP has firmly embedded itself since its creation.  This will now be given new content.    The HNP will enter the new phase of the struggle under the  motto: "Reconquer, Regain, Repair."    Mr. Marais states his case as follows: "The emphasis will  henceforth fall more strongly on the sentiments and values of  Afrikaner nationalism -- the Afrikaans language, the history of  our people's heroes, and the basic rights of a nation."    Mr. Marais further quotes from H.T. Colenbrander to indicate  that the onslaught against the Afrikaner has not subsided: "The  world has, despite the peace accord of 1902, not finished  dealing with the Afrikaner." He continues: "The struggle for  the existence of the people -- which did not start yesterday --  is not ending tomorrow....A tree with such roots does not get  pulled out of the ground easily. It might be standing bare  without any leaves due to an unfavorable season, but the sap  still goes up the stem and again it will have bear blossoms."    Mr. Marais is very determined that the HNP will continue to  work against the situation brought about by the reforms of Mr.  John Vorster, P.W. Botha, and F.W. de Klerk's "National" Party.  Right now there are new obstacles in the struggle, such as the  Bill of Human Rights and the interim constitution, but this will  not deter the HNP from the task at hand. He pointed out that  the HNP previously also had to put up with laws that impeded the  struggle. This did not discourage the HNP, and it will once  again continue, just as it has done over the past 25 years.    The whites presently find themselves in a similar situation  as the Boers found themselves after the Second War of  Liberation. They were impoverished and decimated by the British  massacre of 26,000 women and children in concentration camps.  Again they are impoverished and deprived of tens of thousands  of children and potential mothers through a drop in the birth  rate. The Afrikaner's struggle, however, had never been based  on the power of numbers, but rather on the faith we have in our  course, on our confidence in the God of our fathers, and on the  courage and the will of the minority to continue the struggle."</p>

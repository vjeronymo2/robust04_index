			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Key unions reject TUC's peace formula THE THREAT of a bitter row at next week's Trades Union Congress grew closer yesterday after two unions rejected a peace formula. This would have smoothed the return of the expelled electricians into the TUC as part of the AEEU engineering union. Both the Ucatt construction union and the TGWU general union voted at yesterday's TUC general council against the plan to deal with alleged union poaching of construction members. The council had previously endorsed the plan by 25 votes to 12. The AEEU executive council agreed yesterday by 12 votes to 8 to accept the TUC plan. Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said it was 'a step forward for trade union unity'. Under the deal, the AEEU has given the TUC an unconditional guarantee to abide by its rules and procedures; agreed to settle outstanding issues through TUC conciliation; and accepted all the TUC dispute awards rejected by the electricians six years ago when they were expelled. The final decision on whether to accept the formula for their return will rest with the delegates at the congress. Even if the TUC votes to accept the electricians, the AEEU must still obtain a 75 per cent majority of its executive council in order to change its own affiliation rules. The hardest part of the plan concerns construction. The TUC has told the AEEU that it must stop recruiting or seeking recognition from employers in building and civil engineering without consultation with other unions in the industry. Ucatt and the TGWU are concerned that under the plan the AEEU will not have to disband its construction section. Mr John Monks, the TUC's incoming general secretary, yesterday denied the proposed peace plan could breach the new employment law. However, from November 30 individual workers will be legally entitled to decide which union they want to join. It will be illegal for unions to deny membership unless their rule books explicitly limit recruitment to particular sectors. Employers are still negotiating recognition agreements with unions for collective bargaining despite the increasingly hostile climate towards trade unionism, according to a study published today in Labour Research magazine. A survey among 13 of some of the largest unions shows they have signed 103 such agreements since 1988. These brought nearly 18,500 workers into recognised trade unions. Forty-two of these, covering 11,320 workers, have been reached in the past two years. Over the same period 100,000 workers in 310 companies have lost representation.

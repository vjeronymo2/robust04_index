			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES: WALSH GETS HIS SHOT WITH CARSON  </P> <P> It's official. John Walsh is a Carson Colt.  </P> <P> The former West Torrance High quarterback checked into Carson High late last  week and began practicing with his new team Monday.  </P> <P> Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said he met with Walsh over the weekend.  </P> <P> "I just told him what we expected of him, as far as being a leader," Vollnogle  said. "I would like him to take charge and not sit back. He was very receptive  and very attentive. I think he's going to be fine."  </P> <P> Like any transfer, Vollnogle said Walsh will have to earn the respect of  Carson's players.  </P> <P> "If a kid comes in and proves that he's an athlete, our kids accept him,"  Vollnogle said. "If he's not an athlete, then our kids ignore him. They were  that way with Perry Klein."  </P> <P> Klein, an All-L.A. City quarterback who transferred from Palisades to Carson in  1988, proved himself by leading the Colts in passing and, in the process,  helping them capture the City 4-A Division title.  </P> <P> Unlike Klein, though, it doesn't appear that Walsh will have to split time. In  1988, Klein and Fred Gatlin alternated at quarterback after every series.  </P> <P> Vollnogle said Tarriel Hopper, who was being groomed for the quarterback job,  is more than willing to step aside and let Walsh run the show. Hopper, a 6-3,  220-pound senior, is more accomplished as a strong safety, the position he  played for Carson last season.  </P> <P> "Hopper is not disappointed," Vollnogle said. "He would rather play another  position. He will play quarterback if we need him, but he's not that  enthusiastic about being a full-time quarterback. He prefers hitting people  than being hit."  </P> <P> Moreover, Hopper has been bothered by a nagging elbow injury to his right  throwing arm.  </P> <P> "I think he has some tendinitis in his elbow," Vollnogle said. "He's been off  and on since spring football."  </P> <P> It all adds up to a clear shot at the starting job for Walsh.  </P> <P> Not only must West replace a quarterback, the school needs to come up with a  new slogan for the back cover of its football program.  </P> <P> "Once a Warrior, Always a Warrior" just doesn't cut it anymore.  </P> <P> Obvious comparisons have been made between Walsh's transfer and that of Klein  two years ago. There is one difference, however.  </P> <P> Klein and his family talked openly to the media. So far, the Walshes have been  tight-lipped about the quarterback's transfer.  </P> <P> Perhaps it has something to do with reports that Walsh's parents are getting a  divorce. Walsh apparently will live with his father in Carson.  </P> <P> Carl Franklin's name has been mentioned as a possible replacement for  Morningside girls' basketball Coach Frank Scott, who is expected to take an  assistant coaching job with the USC women's team.  </P> <P> But Franklin, the school's athletic director and co-coach of the boys'  basketball team, said the reports are premature.  </P> <P> "I would prefer to work with the boys," he said. "At this point, there are no  changes in my plans."  </P> <P> Although he announced to his team after last season that he probably would step  down, Franklin said he might return as coach.  </P> <P> Morningside should be encouraged after winning the L.A. Games football  championship last weekend, but it's probably not wise to get too excited.  </P> <P> North Torrance won the seven-on-seven passing tournament last year, then went  2-8 in the regular season.  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, a South Bay wide receiver was named most valuable  player of the tournament. Morningside's Arthur Washington, a 5-4 flanker, won  the award after the Monarchs defeated Canyon of Santa Clarita, 27-20, in the  final Sunday.  </P> <P> North's Eric Hansen, the South Bay's all-time reception leader, was MVP last  year.  </P> <P> How good is Stais Boseman, Morningside's highly regarded sophomore guard?  </P> <P> Co-Coach Ron Randle said he wouldn't be surprised if Boseman becomes the third  Monarch to play in the NBA, following in the footsteps of Byron Scott and Elden  Campbell, the rookie out of Clemson.  </P> <P> "He's probably the most exciting sophomore in the state of California," Randle  said. "If early indications are accurate, he's going to be awesome."  </P> <P> The 6-3 Boseman is averaging 21 points a game for Morningside during the  summer, and last week led the Monarchs to the semifinals of the L.A. Games.  They lost to Long Beach Jordan, 41-39, Sunday.  </P> <P> Boseman, who can play either guard position, averaged 8.5 points a game last  season as Morningside's sixth man. Randle said he expects Boseman to become the  team's catalyst next season, filling the role vacated by Clemson recruit Tyrone  Paul, the 1990 Times South Bay Player of the Year.  </P> <P> "He's doing everything Tyrone was doing, and probably a little more," Randle  said.  </P> <P> Boseman's talents are not limited to basketball. In addition, he plays wide  receiver and defensive back on the football team.  </P> <P> "We know he's a two-sport man," Randle said. "We hope we can utilize his  talents and not burn him out. All things aside, he's probably going to be the  best athlete Morningside has ever had."  </P> <P> They're still saying the same things about Campbell, the Lakers' No. 1 draft  choice, as they did when he starred at Morningside. Namely, that he lacks  desire and the ability to consistently play hard.  </P> <P> Randle argues that it's a misconception about the 6-11 center, who was  nicknamed "Eze" in high school.  </P> <P> "The stigma has stuck with him based on the perception of his style," Randle  said. "He's not a high-fiver or someone who is going to get excited. He keeps  everything in perspective.  </P> <P> "It's quite amazing for a lazy person to be the all-time leading scorer (at  Clemson) and the blocked-shot leader in the ACC for three years in row."  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Rolling Hills is looking for a varsity water polo coach. Prior coaching  experience is preferred. The season begins Aug. 20 and ends in November.  Applicants should contact Chris Bowles at (213) 377-4888. . . . Torrance  captured the girls' soccer championship at the L.A. Games with a 4-1 victory  over Chaminade of West Hills Sunday. The Tartars' Kim Blankenship was named  most valuable player. . . . Morningside won the girls' basketball title at the  L.A. Games with a 61-47 victory over Buena. Janet Davis, the Lady Monarchs' 6-4  junior center, was named to the all-tournament team. . . . Rolling Hills was  the third South Bay team to capture an L.A. Games title, winning the softball  championship with a 13-7 victory over Rubidoux of Riverside. Michelle Pfeiffer  of the Titans was MVP.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. : The company, largest single-family home  builder in California and third largest in France, said second-quarter net  income was up 74% to $19.9 million. Revenue was down 14.5% to $246 million. The  company said the decrease is attributable to the fact that 1988 revenue  included about $100 million from the sale of Atlantique Montparnasse, a  commercial complex to be developed in France. The improved earnings were  attributed to both the strong California and French housing markets and to a  continued emphasis on improving margins and quality control.  </P></p>

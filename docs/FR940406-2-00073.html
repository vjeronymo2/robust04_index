The program is designed to establish the DCP as a key component of an evolving health care environment. The conceptual framework within which successful applicants should operate is characterized by four areas of program activity: (1) Defining the nature, extent, distribution, and causes of the burden of diabetes; (2) Developing new, effective approaches for reducing the diabetes burden which complement emerging health care systems; (3) Implementing specific measures to ensure the widespread application of accepted standards, policies, and protocols to reduce the burden of diabetes; and (4) Coordinating the diabetes-related efforts of the public health system with private health care providers and payers, as well as with all appropriate governmental, voluntary, professional, and academic institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This announcement addresses two distinct levels of program support, both of which are consistent with the conceptual framework described above. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which defines basic diabetes prevention and control activities to be carried out through existing and evolving health care systems. The second is an Enhanced Program, which is intended to introduce additional, innovative elements to a State's diabetes prevention and control efforts, and is also carried out through existing and evolving health care systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led, national activity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is primarily related to Priority Area 17, Diabetes and Chronic Disabling Conditions_with particular attention to populations at disproportionate risk of developing diabetes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including minorities and the elderly. However, it also is relevant to other priority areas, including Physical Activity and Fitness, Nutrition, Tobacco, Educational and Community-Based Programs, Maternal and Infant Health, Heart Disease and Stroke, Clinical Preventive Services, and Surveillance and Data Systems. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under sections 301(a) and 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 241(a) and 247b (k) (3)] of the Public Health Service Act.

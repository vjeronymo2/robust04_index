			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Travel: Carnival and caribou . . . in moderation - Kevin Piley enjoys Quebec's winter frolics IF YOU have never found yourself in the middle of the night standing in 2ft of snow, chatting merrily to a 7ft snowman, you have not experienced hypothermic delirium or the Quebec winter carnival. The Quebec carnival is one of the world's largest. However, in terms of audience participation and organisation it still claims third place behind the Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans and Rio. Each February, 600,000 carnalveux (double the number of Quebec's permanent population) enjoy the show. It started in 1894. Since 1973 the carnival has been spread over 11 days and is held each year from the first Thursday in February to the second Sunday. This year's dates: February 4-14. It takes a certain insanity to enjoy a rave in sub-zero temperatures, but the Quebecoise attach great importance to their carnival. It is the highlight of their bitingly cold and unequivocally wintry winter. It is also their third-largest revenue-producing event. Rooms in hotels like the Chateau Frontenac and Hotel des Gouverneurs are at a premium and booked years in advance. Some families and companies have season tickets. Just as the Soviet Union used to parade its military might in Red Square, so the Canadians seize the chance each February to show off their enormous stockpile of red noses, roadside slush and joie de vivre. Innumerable bundles of teeth-chattering, feet-stomping, lurid and puce winter-wear line the streets of the Old Quarter drinking caribou, which tastes as if it is made from red wine plus the lubricants used in the city's snow-blowers. Caribou is traditionally drunk out of a long plastic hollow walking-stick topped with the face of Le Bonnehomme Carnival. It is powerful stuff and numbs you to the acute cold and all other manifestations of the outside world within seconds. The festivities are centred around the Ice Palace at the Place du Palais opposite the parliament building. It claims to be the biggest compacted snow structure in the world, measuring 70ft high by 60ft wide, and is the official residence of the ubiquitous Bonnehomme Carnaval, the world's first and - so far - only full-time professional snowman. He presides at all events, after which he embarks on a world-wide promotion tour. He looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy after a course of growth hormone therapy and his identity, from one year to the next, is a closely guarded secret. Le Bonnehomme is the official starter at the annual two-mile international canoe race across the St Lawrence which consists of teams of five masochists rowing and then carrying their boats across the ice floes to Levis and back for a cash prize. There are snowmobile races and a prestigious snow sculpture competition on the Fields of Abraham the scene of the battle between Wolfe and Montcalm in 1759. Quebec was founded in 1608 and in La Rue Petit-Champlain it has North America's oldest street. The French influence is maintained and cultivated. The best restaurants, like Restaurant Bonaparte, are found along the Grand Allee. Le Restaurant au Parmesan on Rue Saint-Louis is famed for its minestrone soup and for its owner, Cesar, who will towel down your hair for you when you arrive. He also has an interesting way of maintaining a swift turnround of covers: he employs an accordionist. Refresher courses in history and body heat retention are available throughout the day at the Battlefields Park Museum which offers audio-visual reenactments of various momentous sieges and Canadian capitulations down the ages. The carnival's climax is a parade consisting of floats which look like cars covered in brightly-painted tarpaulins strung with Christmas tree lights, which is exactly what they are. There are lots of marching bands with smoking trombones and frost-bitten clarinettists and high-kicking baton twirlers with goosepimples protruding through their hosiery. Canadians refuse to let either their economy or their social life stagnate in the depth of winter. If you are visiting Canada anyway, the carnival is worth taking in. As is caribou - in moderation.

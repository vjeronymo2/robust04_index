The  ministers, who have their homes in Tripoli, are thus forced to  remain in al- Kufrah.    The decision to move the venue of the cabinet meetings came  as a punishment from al-Qadhdhafi to the ministers after Prime  Minister Abu-zayd Durdah submitted a memorandum of reforms that  he prepared with 'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, who has secluded himself  in his home after al-Qadhdhafi refused to discuss the memorandum  with him.</p>

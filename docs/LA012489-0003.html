			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'OUR HEALTH CARE IS SICK'  </P> <P> Where can I sign up for that national health program? I am one of those 22% of  all Californians who have no medical insurance. I would certainly like to have  insurance, but I cannot find anybody who will sell me any at a reasonable  price.  </P> <P> Last year I decided to become self-employed -- the American dream. I am  responsible to myself. I love it. I earned more as a salaried worker, but the  satisfaction I derive from my independence more than makes up for the loss in  income. But the health insurance companies are not interested in me, not at  all.  </P> <P> I have been willing to pay my own doctor out of my pocket when he treats me for  strep throat or a cut foot, but I am concerned with the (I hope) remote  possibility of a serious accident or illness. Nobody wants to sell me insurance  that would cover such a catastrophe, except for an absurdly high premium of  upwards of $1,000 a month. So I'm stuck. And the state will be stuck for the  bill if I (God forbid) do require lengthy hospitalization, because I will have  to file for bankruptcy. That notion does not appeal to me at all.  </P> <P> Instead I would love to take part in a national health program, wherein I could  pay a fair share of my earnings in return for good health care. All I ask for  is the opportunity to participate in a health insurance program; at the moment  there is none which will have me.  </P> <P> CLEMENT SALVADORI  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GILL'S AGENT ACCUSES HORNET VP OF ABUSE  </P> <P> Kendall Gill's agent has sent a letter to the NBA office, accusing Charlotte  Hornets Vice President Allan Bristow of physically abusing him last week, a  Charlotte newspaper reported.  </P> <P> Arn Tellem, the agent, asked the league to fine, suspend or terminate Bristow  after an incident in Bristow's office, Hornets owner George Shinn said Sunday.  </P> <P> Tellem, of Los Angeles, declined comment and Bristow refused to discuss details  of the incident.  </P> <P> But Shinn told The Charlotte Observer each man's version of what happened.  </P> <P> "He (Tellem) said that Allan forced him up against the wall, choked him," Shinn  said. "Allan said Arn started yelling at him, and they got in each other's  faces. (Bristow) said, 'I did push my finger in front of his chest.' That's no  physical abuse. Geez, Allan drove him to the airport (afterward)."  </P> <P> Tellem was treated by his doctor in Los Angeles for a sprained neck, according  to a story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  </P> <P> Tellem declined comment, saying he does not want to disrupt negotiations that  are close to getting Gill, the Hornets' first-round pick, signed. Shinn said  the Hornets have made an offer of $1.8 million per season, plus incentives that  could raise Gill's salary above $2 million per year.  </P> <P> Due to Tellem's claim, Bristow has removed himself as lead negotiator for the  Hornets on Gill, a 6-foot-5 guard from Illinois. Hornets Vice President Spencer  Stolpen has replaced Bristow in that role.  </P> <P> "We both acted unprofessionally," Bristow said.  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Maxwell pensioners criticise City firms: Lilley defends Pounds 2.5m emergency aid limit - Campaigners confident on return of assets / Delay in appointing inspectors TWO PROMINENT city firms should have suspected in the year before Robert Maxwell's death that they were aiding in the disappearance of securities under their control, according to a High Court writ. By late 1990, the writ alleges, the two firms knew or ought to have known that transactions involving the securities had put the interests of pensioners at risk. In spite of that, the writ alleges, the firms failed to inform either pension fund trustees or regulators about those matters. In the interim the securities were used as collateral for loans to Maxwell's private interests. The writ, filed last week, seeks Pounds 88m from the fund managers as well as from Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse, two investment banks that received the securities allegedly stolen from the MGN pension scheme. The writ, from the present trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme, alleges that Invesco MIM and Capel-Cure Myers (CCM) failed to alert either pension fund trustees or regulators. Instead, they sought assurances from the people who gave the instructions that their activities were proper, the writ says. The two fund managers were allegedly told to hand over the pension scheme's shares portfolios to two other Maxwell-owned fund managers to be used for what was described as stock lending. The writs allege that the fund managers acted on instructions from people who had no authority to order stock lending and that all signs pointed to stock lending of a highly irregular nature. The document for the first time spells out in explicit detail just how the theft of assets from the pension funds was allegedly effected. It claims that, as early as October 18 1990, MIM must have had suspicions about the stock lending it was being asked to undertake because it wrote to London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management (LBI) asking to be released from all responsibility for the securities while they were in LBI's care. The writ says that on October 26 MIM's suspicions should have been further aroused because it learned that loaned securities, originally made out in favour of Bishopsgate Investment Management (another Maxwell fund manager), had been returned without being made out in the name of the borrower, as is the usual practice. The writ says: 'The plaintiff will contend that MIM knew at all material times after October 26 1990 that legitimate stock lending was not being undertaken by BIM or LBI and that therefore the delivered MIM portfolio was at risk.' Then, the writ says, at a meeting with several MGN pension trustees on December 3 1990, MIM was told stock lending would end and securities would be returned. But on December 18, in a letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Trevor Cook, secretary to the scheme, MIM was allegedly told lending would be extended to the end of January. Each month thereafter, MIM allegedly received a letter saying lending would be extended for yet one more month, that trustees were very happy with the stock lending programme and that hefty fees were being earned. The writ says that the fees were never passed on to MIM and were far larger than could have been earned through conventional stock lending activities. By April last year, it is alleged, MIM was so worried about stock lending that its compliance officer sought an outside legal opinion on the matter. An internal meeting was held that month, the writ claims, at which MIM officials recorded concerns that stocks were not being loaned through a conventional money broker. By August 15 1991, MIM allegedly knew that the assets it had passed to LBI for stock lending had been used as collateral - knowledge which the writ says should have tipped it off to the fact that its securities had been pledged as security for loans to a third party. The allegations against CCM follow a similar pattern. On October 8 1990, CCM was allegedly instructed by BIM and LBI to deliver a portfolio of stocks directly to Lehman Brothers. The writ says that because conventional stock lending must be conducted through recognised money brokers, CCM should have been suspicious. It says: 'CCM was aware that the delivery of the delivered CCM portfolio to Lehmans was to be used as 'loan collateral', which was plainly an improper purpose . . .' Indeed, the writ alleges, by December 12 1990, CCM's own file notes refer to the fact that it knew securities were being used as loan collateral. Lehman Brothers said it accepted the securities in good faith and intends to contest the writ. Invesco MIM said it believed at all times that it was following instructions of all the MGN pension-scheme trustees. The other two firms declined to comment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Penyagin, chairman of </F> the All-Russian State and Public Radioekologiya Fund, by an  unidentified correspondent; from the ``Utro'' program; date and  place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Chernobyl is our constant agony. Recently  mysterious things have been occurring in the disaster zone.  Specialists have to their own great surprise discovered the  radioactive element Americium-241, a substance dangerous to all  living things. This element should not have escaped the  sarcophagus. Nevertheless, this has happened. Americium-241 is  very dangerous since even in miniscule amounts it causes the  severest poisoning and mutations. Scientists are presently  wracking their brains on how to prevent the spread of this  element beyond the disaster zone.    Of course, there are many other very serious problems in  Chernobyl, and apparently the Ukraine will not be able to solve  them alone. That is why Ukrainian ecologists may be interested  in the work of the All-Russian State and Public Radioekologiya  Fund. Our Novosibirsk correspondent talks with Aleksandr  Penyagin, chairman of this fund. [video shows  correspondent talking with Penyagin who has a large map of  Central Siberia on the desk at which he sits]    Correspondent: Could you tell us what brought you  to Novosibirsk?    Penyagin: Well, you may recall the logic of  events. First Chernobyl, then the Urals -- I mean the problem  which we raised and elevated to the level of a state program  there. The third state program concerns the consequences of the  effects of the Semipalatinsk test range.    Correspondent: You mean the rehabilitation of the  population, yes?    Penyagin: Both of the population and the  territory, absolutely. The Semipalatinsk test range aftermath  affected the Altay, the mountainous Altay, and part of  Novosibirsk Oblast. That is the first point, and we consider  that it is necessary to begin solving radiation and ecological  issues throughout Siberia. Not many people are aware of it, but  the Yenisey -- that wonderful, beautiful, and mighty river --  has been polluted over almost 1,000 km. This problem will have  to be solved at the appropriate state level. The same problem  exists on the Tom River, and so forth. This involves underground  nuclear tests carried out for national economic purposes, and so  forth.    Correspondent: What do you mean by a state  program? Are there simply tasks or are their funds as well?    Penyagin: It is both tasks and funds. Everything  has already been scheduled, what everyone has to do. The prime  minister has already signed this and the organizations which are  implementing this state program have already been informed. In  other words, real assistance to the region is beginning.    Correspondent: Aleksandr Nikolayevich, I do not  want to make you into a kind of hero, as has been traditional in  our propaganda presentations, heaven forbid, but tell us, to  compile this kind of a map for yourself, a map showing the  unfortunate areas, a map of your activities, you must have  visited all these places, that is how I imagine it, yes? These  are all places which people would leave if they had the  opportunity, which they would probably flee. Yet you went  there. Tell us, how did you feel and how do you feel today  after all this?    Penyagin: First of all, I have had excellent  experiences. I did all my service on a nuclear submarine. So  radiation is something I am familiar with. On the other hand,  if a person decides to solve a problem which he is sounding out  for others as a state problem, then his personal choices must  take second place. If you have never been in these regions, if  you cannot recognize the situation with your eyes closed ...  [Penyagin pauses] Well, for a government official, a  bureaucratic attitude to people and the territory as a rule  turns into mistakes.    These mistakes have a very harmful effect on the budget and  on some categories of people who have been overlooked because a  bureaucratic outlook does not permit a comprehensive assessment  of the situation. So in this case, strange as it may seem, one  must visit these places, one must see how state programs are  being implemented, one must know how to set up a system to  verify state activities, and even to verify the activities of  the legislators themselves.    Correspondent: Aleksandr Nikolayevich, you  presently head a fund known as, which has the status of a state  public fund, the Radioekologiya Fund. What is this fund? What  do you have at your disposal and what are you doing with the  funds which you now have or will have?    Penyagin: First of all, our fund has narrowed  things down to four areas -- social, economic, ecological, and  moral rehabilitation of those areas which have suffered from the  effects of radiation. To implement the program of ecological  rehabilitation of radioactively contaminated lands, we have  established an entire specialized company which we call the  Bioflora Joint Stock Association. It has the high technologies  which are capable of cleaning lands with low radioactive  contamination.    Correspondent: Have you already begun working on  this?    Penyagin: Yes of course, we are working, and I  hope that the time will come when I can show you the results of  what we are doing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] The peacekeeping operation in Bosnia will continue  despite a move by the United States to block additional forces,  senior Government sources said today.    Washington -- which pays about 30 percent of all  peacekeeping  costs -- has been condemned for refusing to authorise the extra  8,500 soldiers because of uncertainty of financial support from  Congress.    Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said:  "The Americans have no troops on the ground in Bosnia. It is a  great pity that they are not willing to pay other countries to  do what they are unwilling to do themselves."    The United States already owes more than 50 million pounds  sterling for the Yugoslav operation, estimated at more than 600  million pounds sterling a year.    It is being urged to approve a compromise text to renew the  force for six months and authorise another 3,500 troops needed  immediately.    U.S. envoys startled Security Council members last night by  announcing that Washington needed another 30 days before it  could consider a resolution it had helped negotiate.    More than half of the extra troops are already in Bosnia,  including a 900-strong battalion group based on the Duke of  Wellington's Regiment and 2,700 troops from Turkey.    And diplomats reminded U.S. officials that the new troops  were to enforce ceasefires around Sarajevo and in central Bosnia  that the United States had helped negotiate. "There is a  momentum which has to be kept," Council President Jean-Bernard  Merimee said. "If it is impossible to deploy new troops, there  would be a risk of ceasefires being broken and agreements being  jeopardised."    A British Government source said: "There is no question that  the operation will not go ahead. The success of the  peacekeeping operation has gone too far. There is no way it  will be allowed to falter now."    Meanwhile, reports that Britain had offered to place 4,000  troops on permanent standby for peacekeeping operations around  the world were dismissed as "nonsense" by ministers.    British officials met UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali earlier this week to explain the kind of military  expertise the UK could make available in future operations.  "This was merely to give a flavour of what might be available,"  said a Whitehall source. "We are not going to see blue berets  on Salisbury Plain and there will be no troops on permanent  standby."    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, supported by service  chiefs, insists that troops will be selected to match the  specific type of operation on a case-by-case basis rather than  having earmarked peacekeeping forces.</p>

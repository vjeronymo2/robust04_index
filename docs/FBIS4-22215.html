			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with B. Mizrakhi, deputy head of administration </F> of Chelyabinsk Oblast, by Ye. Frantseva; place and date not  given: "B. Mizrakhi: `Everything Must Be Done To Bring Creative  People to the Duma...'"]    [Text] Work on the statutes concerning the oblast  Duma and procedure for election to it has been completed.  Confirmed by the oblast head of administration, the statutes  have acquired the force of local law according to which we will  henceforth be guided. The heated discussion and debate is behind  us...    Working in the oblast administration on the election  documents during their final stage of preparation was deputy  oblast administration head B. Mizrakhi.    [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, how did the work go with  regard to the statute on the oblast Duma and statute on the  election of its deputies? Were these efforts equally complex?    [Mizrakhi] It took longer to draw up the Statute on the  oblast Duma--we started working on it sooner and it was  confirmed later. It elicited a great many more disputes. The  statute on elections went smoother. The fact is--here we had  very detailed instructions from the Central Electoral Committee.  Essentially, 90 percent of the statute was finished. But  fundamental parameters were not indicated in the documents we  had to use for guidance in developing the statute on the oblast  organ of legislative authority. The numerical strength of the  body, for example. Just principles were presented, and arguing  over principles is more complicated. Perhaps it was easier,  therefore, to reach accord between entirely diverse parties and  movements developing their own draft parallel to the  administration effort.    It must be said that the edicts of the Russian president  that  were issued one after another concerning structures of power in  krays and oblasts--coming out in November, December, and  January--also left their mark on the process of preparing the  document on the Duma itself. They complicated our work. Edict  No. 2266, for example, significantly narrowed the provisions of  the Russian Federation Law "On the Kray and Oblast Soviet, Kray  and Oblast Administration." Specifically, the provision  disappeared according to which it was possible for the oblast  organ of representational authority to express a lack of  confidence in the head of administration. Like other aspects,  this factor had to be taken into account in drawing up the  statute on the Duma.    [Frantseva] Well, what articles in the statutes on elections  and on the Duma itself caused the most difficulties? What  elicited the greatest argument in drawing up the documents?    [Mizrakhi] The most problematic was probably the question of  principles for nominating candidates. What system should be used  in the election--majority-based or mixed? Or a proportional  system only, i.e., by party slates? The latter prospect was  rejected immediately. But the mixed system, the system used for  elections to the State Duma, had quite a number of supporters.    Guiding documents from the center recommended a  majority-based system--by single-seat districts. A mixed system  was also permitted, but on an experimental basis. We decided on  an election by single-seat districts. I am personally convinced  that under today's conditions a mixed system is not suitable for  the oblast. The parties that are represented in our oblast have  from 50 to 200 members. Can they represent the interests of  large enough groups of voters? Of course not! The  representatives of parties and movements agreed during the final  stage of work on the draft that ordinary elections--by  single-seat districts, would be appropriate today all the same  for the oblast.    There was disagreement as to how many signatures a candidate  for the oblast Duma should have to collect in his own support in  order to be registered. There were a great many proposals.  Agreement was reached that for the initial stage, no less than 4  percent of the total number of voters in the district had to  support a candidate.    [Frantseva] After the full oblast soviet, a Duma of 15  deputies is unusual. Why was it decided to have precisely this  number of deputies in the oblast's representative organ of power?    [Mizrakhi] Well, this too was one of the issues discussed to  a fairly great extent. There has been a strong trend in recent  times towards reducing the number of deputies in  representational organs of authority at all levels. But the  presidential edict provided us the opportunity to decide on the  Duma and on 50 deputies. We were interested in seeing what  decision was reached in other regions where elections had  already taken place. There was a great spread. In Moscow a Duma  of 35 deputies was elected, in Leningrad Oblast--of 20 deputies,  in Kurgan Oblast--25. While in Vologda, Kostroma, and Tambov  Oblasts, there were 15 deputies, and in Kamchatka--16.    We had proposals to elect 17 and 19 deputies to the Duma.  This question was examined very closely with the need to divide  the oblast into an appropriate number of electoral districts of  approximately equal value. We decided upon the figure 15 as a  result. All the same, I do not think the number is the most  important thing--this is not what will determine the  effectiveness of the representational authority. Everything will  be decided by which deputies we elect, on how prepared they turn  out to be for work in the Duma and how responsible they are. We  must do everything we can to see to it that the Duma assembles  true creators, people who favor specific deeds over words, who  enjoy the confidence of the people and have a rich experience of  organizational and administrative work. There are such people in  the oblast.    [Frantseva] What public proposals, including those of  parties  and movements, were taken into account in the final version of  the statute on the Duma?    [Mizrakhi] Articles were included providing for the Duma to  adopt oblast regulations and amend them. The Duma's right to  legislative initiative was not originally secured in the draft.  This was corrected. Also taken into account was the general  opinion concerning incompatibility of the status of deputy with  an official position or activity in state or other organs. A  provision was proposed and inserted into the final version of  the document to the effect that a candidate for deputy of the  oblast Duma need not reside in the territory of the electoral  district for which seat he is campaigning.    [Frantseva] It is not infrequently today that we hear it  said  that the executive authority is creating "under itself" a  representational authority in the oblast. And has even invented  a name for it...    [Mizrakhi] Well, the Duma can change its name. It is its  prerogative, as I have already stated, to adopt the oblast  regulations and amend them. Should the deputies consider it  advisable to introduce amendments to the statute on elections to  the Duma, they have the right to do so. By edict of the  president, the administration was charged with the  responsibility of setting elections to a new organ of  representational authority and this is what it did, just as  executive organs of authority have done in other krays and  oblasts. I have stated many times and wish to repeat here that  when you have a situation where one branch of power exists  without another, that is an abnormal situation. We need a  balance of power.    [Frantseva] But why has the election been put off for such a  long time--not set for March, as stipulated by presidential  edict, and not even for April, but for mid-May? And now it has  been proposed, as we recall, for June?    [Mizrakhi] The right to make a definitive decision here  belongs to the head of the administration. I do not conceal the  fact that opinions diverged on this account even within the  administration itself. I am one who worked in favor of the  election being held at an earlier time frame. But today, now  that the decision has been made, there is no place for argument  in my view. We must focus attention on preparations for the  election. Especially since the Central Electoral Commission has  postponed the election of deputies to the Council of the  Federation for our oblast to 15 May.    [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, the overwhelming majority  of participants in meetings with presidential representative V.  Seleznev, as well as members of the working group preparing  draft documents on the oblast Duma and elections to it, were  from the communist and national-patriotic parties and movements.  It is difficult to believe that the leaders of democratic  organizations were not invited to take part in these  discussions...    [Mizrakhi] Unfortunately, their activity level was truly  low.  The administration received proposals from only a few  democratically oriented parties and movements. Their absence  from meetings held by V. Seleznev, meetings I participated in,  even provided a pretext for accusing me of abandoning democratic  principles. Not true! It is simply that those whose views I  share failed to show the level of interest in drawing up  documents on the election which was exhibited by their  opponents. I did everything I could under my control. I engaged  in consultations, met with V. Kislitsin representing the Russian  Movement for Democratic Reforms, with N. Shchapin of the  Republican Party, and others. As a member of the executive  committee of Russia's Choice, I have fought and continue to  fight without reservation for democratic principles.    Without a doubt, democratic forces in the oblast must work  today to quickly surmount disunity. They must join forces. I  have great expectations of the recently established bloc Accord,  which unites adherents of reforms, including Russia's Choice. I  would like to believe that the efforts of this electoral bloc  during the election campaign will prove highly productive. [end  Mizrakhi]    This interview was conducted the end of last week, prior to  B. Mizrakhi's trip to Moscow where he participated in a  conference of the Social Chamber of the Russian Federation  president. Upon his return, B. Mizrakhi stated that the  conference was dedicated to elections of representational organs  of authority of Federation entities and elections of organs of  local self-government. Results of the elections were analyzed at  the locations where the elections were held. In some cases these  results are disturbing, it was noted at the conference. Serious  violations were uncovered with respect to the conduct of the  election in a number of regions. In certain oblasts, the  majority of deputy seats went to opponents of the president.  Great differences were noted in the election provisions of  organs of local self-government. A desire was expressed in this  regard reflecting the advisability of forming organs of local  self-government following the adoption of the appropriate  federal law. Conference participants also expressed support for  postponing the elections of representational authority in  Federation entities until June. Thus, the election in our oblast  is not an exception, but rather falls under the general trend.  Incidentally, the Central Electoral Committee today noted the  carefulness of preparations for the election in our oblast,  considering it greater than that exercised in many other oblasts.</p>

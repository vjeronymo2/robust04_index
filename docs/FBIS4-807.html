			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Luanda] </F>   [Text] The mediator met today with the government  delegation, which submitted a document on its views about the  conclusion of the elections. Sources close to the negotiations  say the government and the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed to the document  submitted by the mediator, which is based on proposals presented  yesterday by UNITA and today by the government, regarding the  conclusion of elections.    The document on national reconciliation will be discussed.  This is the final document, and it provides for UNITA's  participation in the various government echelons. Political  analysts say the document is very brief in that UNITA does not  discuss what the government has to offer. UNITA says it has  asked for nothing from the government, including the sharing of  power, because it was the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola that won the elections. UNITA will take part in the  government in view of the latter's offer in line with the spirit  of national reconciliation.</p>

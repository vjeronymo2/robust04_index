			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 14 Jun (AFP) -- The Nicaraguan Government  has endorsed Cuba's returning to the OAS and it rejected the  U.S.-imposed economic and political embargo against the island,  acting Foreign Minister Jose Pallais stated at a meeting with  the international media on Monday evening.    Pallais said that "we would be satisfied if Cuba returned"  to  the OAS, from which it was expelled almost three decades ago.  This topic will be considered along with the main agenda of the  Fourth Ibero-American summit that opened Tuesday in Cartagena de  Indias, Colombia.    The commercial embargo "is unilateral by the United States,  and we do not believe in such measures," Pallais stated. He  noted, however, that Cuba has still "not fulfilled the  prerequisites" to form part of the so-called democratic  countries, because it has not implemented "economic reforms and  political openness."    During the past decade the regime of Fidel Castro openly  supported the Sandinists in their war against the Contras, who  were armed and financed by the United States.    Violeta de Chamorro's Government, which replaced the  Sandinists in 1990, maintains diplomatic relations with Cuba,  although these relations have been quite reduced compared to  relations during the Sandinist period.</p>

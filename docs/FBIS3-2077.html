			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ji Bin (1213 2430) and Wang Yanbin (3769 6066 1755)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national  conference on helping poor areas through development today,  General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin said  so long as leading cadres at all levels always keep  poverty-stricken areas in mind; share weal and woe with the  people there; adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line; persist in helping poor areas through developing  production in line with actual conditions with necessary  assistance from the state and all sectors of society; work  persistently; and pay attention to efficiency, they will  certainly fulfill the plan to wipe out abject poverty by the  year 2000.    At the conference, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech  entitled: "Helping Poor Areas Through Development Is an  Important Strategic Task."    The conference, convened by the State Council, ended in  Beijing today. Attending were Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Wen  Jiabao, Li Guixian, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan. Also  attending were leaders of democratic parties and the Federation  of Industry and Commerce, including Li Peiyao, Feng Zhijun, Feng  Kexu, Chen Xunli, Song Jinsheng, Lu Rongshu, Chen Mingshao, Cai  Zimin, and Chen Jingxin.    Today's conference was presided over by Chen Junsheng, head  of the Leading Group for the Economic Development of  Impoverished Areas under the State Council. At the conference,  leaders of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  under the central government, including Yunnan, Xinjiang, Hebei,  Shandong, Beijing, and Ningxia, made reports on their plans to  implement the National Poverty Elimination Plan.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin began by affirming the great  historic achievements scored in assisting impoverished areas  through promoting development since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee. He said: The most important  experience China has gained from its progress in poverty  reduction is the establishment of a new aid-the-poor principle,  shifting from merely relief aid to aiding poor areas by  promoting social and economic development. Practice shows that  aiding poor areas through social and economic development by  heeding market demands, relying on the advancement of science  and technology, exploiting local resources, and developing  commodity production, will not only provide enough food and  clothes for poverty-stricken people, but will also help them  free themselves from poverty and become well-off. Thus, the  principle of helping poor areas through social and economic  development by combining state assistance to poor areas, and the  self-reliant spirit and hard work of cadres and people in the  impoverished areas, constitutes a fundamental change in this  work; it is an important creation which must be continued for a  long time to come.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: We are still faced with arduous  tasks in our effort to help poor areas. To solve the problem of  providing sufficient food and clothes for 80 million people in  the next seven years, the State Council has drawn up a national  poverty elimination plan. This is a good plan. The key is that  we must have the determination to tackle the problem and  resolutely continue the work for a long time to come.    Pointing out that it is necessary to further understand the  importance of aiding poor areas through social and economic  development, Jiang Zemin said: Elimination of poverty to  realize common prosperity is required by the essence of  socialism and is the embodiment of the superiority of socialism.  In leading the people in making revolution and building  socialism, the party aims at emancipating and developing  productive forces to enable people to become prosperous. Since  the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, we  have allowed and encouraged some people and regions to become  well-off first. The aim is that common prosperity can be  achieved in a better way because people and regions which become  well-off first will give an impetus to other people and other  regions to strive for prosperity. In developing a socialist  market economic structure, we should not only seek efficiency in  resource allocation but also take into account the principle of  fairness, that is, we should do better in adopting effective  policies to assist impoverished areas. Jiang Zemin said:  Elimination of poverty to realize common prosperity is required  by reform and opening up to the outside world, and is also an  important condition for maintaining stability. Development in  various areas is uneven; some areas are developing fairly  rapidly, while other are developing relatively slowly. This is  unavoidable. However, in this process we must keep an eye on  economic development in the impoverished areas and help them  free themselves from poverty and become well- off, so as to  achieve the goal of common prosperity.    Pointing out that to resolutely carry out the work of  assisting poor areas through development for a long time to  come, party committees and governments at all levels must  improve leadership over this work, Jiang Zemin said: Helping  poor areas through development is not only an important economic  task but also a political task concerning the masses -- which  includes the building of material civilization as well as  spiritual civilization. Party committees and governments at all  levels should, as always, strengthen leadership over the work to  aid poor areas. Jiang Zemin called on the principal leaders of  party committees and governments at all levels to show concern  for this work, attend to it, and regard it as an important means  of caring for the masses' hardships and improving ties between  the party and masses. He also called on them to make an overall  plan, concentrate on tackling weaknesses, and make frequent  visits to poor areas and nationality minority areas to help  cadres and masses there solve practical problems. He said:  Principal leaders should dispatch cadres, on a rotational  basis, to poor areas to help with their work. Cadres should be  selected from provincial, prefectural, and county organs, and  sent to impoverished townships and villages to work there for a  certain period of time. While there, they should publicize  party policies among the masses, assist them in improving  leading bodies, and help them find a way to free themselves from  poverty and become well-off by bringing in professional  personnel and technologies, and organizing them to develop  explorative undertakings. Achievements in helping poor areas  free themselves from poverty should be used as a criterion for  evaluating and promoting county and township leading cadres.    Jiang Zemin said: Party committees and governments should be  good at mobilizing and organizing all sectors of society to  bring about a new situation in the work of assisting poor areas.  When conditions permit, state organs, the People' Liberation  Army, the democratic parties, social organizations, and  enterprises and institutions, should, as always, actively  support and take part in the work of aiding poor areas to the  best of their ability. In aiding poor areas, investment is  necessary. Financial and other monetary departments should  render their support by providing funds on preferential terms.  They should also organize comparatively economically developed  areas and underdeveloped areas to help one another in order to  promote mutual benefit, common development, and common  prosperity.    Pointing out that it is necessary to give full play to the  innovative spirit of self-reliance and hard work of cadres and  masses in impoverished areas, Jiang Zemin said: It is  absolutely necessary for the state to provide some assistance to  impoverished areas and for all sectors of society to participate  in helping these areas. However, in the final analysis, the  poor areas should rely on themselves to solve the problem of  food and clothing, and to free themselves from poverty and  become well-off. This requires cadres and masses in  impoverished areas combat adverse natural conditions and develop  their economy by displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard  work. Difficulties can easily be overcome with a hard- working  spirit. This spirit is our party's fine tradition and also  constitutes our basic experience in helping poor areas become  well- off.    He stressed: While relying on our own efforts and working  diligently, we should think of new ideas for helping poor areas  through economic development. We should free ourselves from the  fetters of traditional concepts and forces of habit, genuinely  implement reform, open up to the outside world, and invigorate  the economy. We should emancipate our minds and find the  correct path. Many impoverished areas have suffered losses  because they have not sufficiently emancipated their minds and  have not sufficiently opened up ways to develop their economy.  While their barren hills, slopes, and land still remain  uncultivated, their surplus labor also remains idle. Excessive  labor should be taken as an asset, not a burden. To do a good  job in helping poor areas through development, it is necessary  to exploit local resources. At the same time, labor should be  exported in an organized and planned way. He said: Training  professional people by adhering to the spirit of self- reliance  and hard work is the key to success. It is necessary to  transform this innovative spirit into a material force.  Finally, it is necessary to rely on giving play to the wisdom  and intelligence of laborers. Therefore, importance must be  given to helping poor areas and developing intellectural  resources by relying on science and education. At the same  time, family planning must be carried out successfully.    Jiang Zemin pointed out emphatically: Whether the innovative  spirit of self-reliance and hard work can be carried forward  depends, to a large extent, on how in touch leading bodies in  poor areas are and how strong the basic organizations of these  areas are. It is necessary to strengthen work in impoverished  counties. In line with the needs of the work to assist  impoverished areas through development, outstanding cadres who  are capable, can endure hardships, and maintain close ties with  the masses should be promoted to assume the posts of county  party committee secretaries and county heads. Relative  stability regarding these posts should be maintained. It is  necessary to strengthen the organization of party branches in  impoverished villages. A good experience has been learned from  the work of assisting impoverished areas -- that is, "while  providing relief in money and material, it is more important to  build up a good party branch."    Li Peng began his speech by stressing that it is the  historical responsibility of the CPC and the government to  assist poverty-stricken areas to change their undevelopment  features through carrying out the plan to eliminate poverty by  the year 2000. He pointed out: Solving the basic food and  clothing problems of 80 million people in rural areas and  assisting them to become comparatively well off during the next  seven-year period are historical responsibilities which  communists of this generation and people's governments at all  levels must not evade. We must ensure the success of this major  strategic plan, which has political as well as economic  significance. Leading comrades of party committees and  governments at all levels and persons in charge of all  departments must consider this project as an important task,  attend to it earnestly, and accomplish it according to schedule.    Li Peng stressed: Implementing the plan to eliminate poverty  by the year 2000 and assist poverty-stricken areas to develop  their economy is a strategic measure for gradually reducing the  differences between the eastern and western parts of China. He  said: Over 80 percent of the nation's 80 million people -- for  whom basic food and clothing problems have yet to be totally  resolved -- live in central and western parts of China, with the  majority living in southwest and northwest parts of China. In  this sense, solving the basic food and clothing problems of  people in impoverished areas and helping them shake off poverty  and become comparatively well off is an issue of reducing the  developmental differences between eastern and western parts of  China. He said: Differences do exist objectively. While it is  impossible to totally eliminate the differences within a short  time owing to historical, natural, geographical, social, and  economic factors, we must exert positive efforts to gradually  reduce and eventually eliminate the differences. We uphold the  policy of encouraging some people and some regions to become  affluent ahead of others through honest labor and legitimate  businesses and then guide and assist the less developed areas in  development. This is for the purpose of achieving nationwide  prosperity. If we all are poverty-stricken, then nobody is able  to assist anybody. Only when some regions have developed first  and have developed a stronger economic ability can they be in a  position to assist the less developed areas. He said: We have  accomplished a great deal of work in reducing differences and  achieving common prosperity. From a vertical point of view,  both developed areas and poverty-stricken areas are developing;  and from a lateral point of view, the differences between  poverty- stricken areas and developed areas are still widening.  Thus, party committees and governments at all levels must  attach great importance to this problem and take effective  measures to reduce the regional differences.    The eight measures which Li Peng mentioned in his speech  are:  Encouraging the prosperous and developed coastal areas and the  large and medium cities to guide and assist the poverty-stricken  areas; the state will provide poverty-stricken areas with  adequate financial and monetary support; the state will give  poverty-stricken areas preferential treatment with regard to  major construction projects; gradually rationalizing through  reform the prices of raw and semi-finished materials and primary  goods; improving the competence and scientific and technical  proficiency of people in poverty-stricken areas; carrying out  open, experimental aid-the-poor projects on the basis of  carrying out developmental aid-the-poor programs; mobilizing  people in all social quarters to support developmental and  construction projects in poverty-stricken areas; and encouraging  poverty-stricken areas to foster the spirit of self- reliance  and arduous struggle.    Li Peng stressed: To implement the plan to eliminate  poverty by the year 2000, graduated responsibilities, especially  responsibilities discharged by provincial governors, will be  carried out under the centralized leadership of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. This means that principal  leading comrades of provincial party committees and provincial  governments must be concerned with aid-the-poor programs and  properly attend to these programs. One point must be clear:  Provincial governors must take personal charge. Executing the  plan for eliminating poverty and resolving the masses' basic  food and clothing problems by the year 2000 is a systems  engineering project involving economic activities of financial,  banking, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, industrial,  and commercial sectors as well as operations of departments in  charge of culture, education, public health, and planned  parenthood. Thus, the government must have an overall plan and  make comprehensive arrangements. He pointed out: Whether this  plan can be accomplished according to schedule so that the basic  food and clothing problems in impoverished areas can be resolved  is a specific target which leading cadres at various levels must  meet to see whether or not they really do things which are in  the interest of the people and whether or not they care for the  plight of the people. When we judge the performance of a  province, a region, or a city, we cannot simply look at its  economic growth, we must also examine how good the results are,  how fast the people's living conditions have been improved, and  how the basic food and clothing problems in impoverished areas  have been resolved. Leading comrades at various levels should  not only pay attention to developed areas, but more importantly,  we must show concern for the problems of the people in  poverty-stricken areas. In accordance with the plan to  eliminate poverty in poverty-stricken areas by the year 2000,  all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must draw  up their individual plans. Moreover, they must check their  progress and performance every year. By no means should efforts  be slackened in the least. All government departments must  continue to consider the fulfilment of aid-the-poor  developmental programs as their own responsibility and draw up  their respective aid-the-poor programs in accordance with the  plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000.    Present at today's meeting were persons in charge of  governments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions; and persons in charge of relevant central departments  and committees.</p>

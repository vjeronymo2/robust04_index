			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S AUTHORITY FIGURE;  </P> <P> SOCCER: MIDFIELDER TERRY DAVILA GIVES THE PLAYOFF-BOUND MATADORS A HARD-NOSED  ENFORCER.  </P> <P> By his own count, Terry Davila was suspended from school at least three times a  year from the time he entered fourth grade until he completed his sophomore  year of high school.  </P> <P> Twice, and almost a third time, he was kicked out of schools. He fought. He was  rowdy.  </P> <P> But, in his mind, he always was right.  </P> <P> "I hated authority," Davila says. "I thought I was an authority."  </P> <P> Watch Davila play soccer and you see many of the same traits.  </P> <P> Davila is animated, aggressive and so confident that he seems to dribble the  ball with a swagger. With battle-scarred legs and a soiled uniform, he is easy  enough to spot.  </P> <P> "Terry is our dirtiest player," Cal State Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad says  with admiration. "Look at him after a game. . . . Look at his shirt, his legs,  his knees. He gives us all he has to give."  </P> <P> The same holds true off the field, as the energy Davila long struggled to  control seems finally to be channeled in the proper direction.  </P> <P> "I was a great student in the 11th and 12th grades when I found out I had to  be," Davila says. "I wanted to go to college and play soccer at Northridge.  I've always wanted to come here. When I was 15 and I would come and just watch  the team practice. There were so many great players."  </P> <P> Davila, a sophomore, can be counted among them. As a freshman, he started at  sweeper for a team that advanced to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  Division II championship. This season he starts at midfielder and has played a  key role in the Matadors' advance to Saturday's West regional final against Cal  State Hayward at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, when Northridge clinched its sixth consecutive California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship, Davila was involved in the key play.  </P> <P> With CSUN and Bakersfield knotted, 1-1, in a match that would decide the CCAA  title and the recipient of the conference's automatic playoff berth, Davila  took a pass at the left side of the 18-yard box, dribbled in, turned his back  toward the goal to position himself for a pass, and drew a tripping call that  resulted in a penalty shot that was converted by Don Imamura with 23 seconds  left.  </P> <P> "That's him," Ass'ad says, recalling the play. "He hits it right before you  tackle him. He's so quick. Boom, he hits it."  </P> <P> Davila, who has three goals and an assist, has extra incentive to perform well  during the playoffs. His younger brother, Teddy, a freshman defender, has been  sidelined because of a broken left leg.  </P> <P> "It really broke my heart when I saw him get hurt," Terry says. "I wanted to  share our great season with him. Before a game I can still feel his excitement  and it gets me going that much harder."  </P> <P> Terry also has been battered and bruised at times this season, but he has  managed to play through it.  </P> <P> Against San Diego State, a highly ranked Division I team, Ass'ad planned to  rest Davila, who had a severely bruised leg. But Davila, who had been snubbed  in recruiting by San Diego State, would have none of it.  </P> <P> Says Ass'ad: "Terry says, 'Coach, I'm ready.' I said, 'You're not going to  play.' "  </P> <P> Not satisfied with his coach's answer, Davila sent a barrage of trainers,  assistant coaches and teammates to plead his case.  </P> <P> "So I don't start him, but I put him in later and he hurts his toe," Ass'ad  says. "The next day I pull him aside and say, 'You know, you . . . me off. You  shouldn't have played.'  </P> <P> "It's great to have a player like that. He's hungry, you know? Aggressive."  </P> <P> Davila credits his father, Tony, CSUN's women's tennis coach, for that  characteristic.  </P> <P> "He's the one who taught me to go hard," Terry says. "He always said, 'If  you're going to get hit, hit the other guy harder because then you won't get  hurt.' "  </P> <P> However, it is Ass'ad who Davila credits with changing his life.  </P> <P> "I respect him totally," Davila says of his coach. "Every decision he's made  concerning me and our team has been the right one. I listen to Marwan and he  guides me.  </P> <P> "I just give it all I've got. I respect Northridge, the tradition. That's why I  try to act the best I can, because I'm wearing the Northridge uniform."  </P></p>

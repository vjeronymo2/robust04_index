			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: South becomes cornerstone of House takeover - Southerners have previously said that they would 'rather vote for a yellow dog' than a Republican The cornerstone of the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives was a sweeping change in the southern US. Ever since the Civil War, the South has traditionally shunned President Abraham Lincoln's Republican party. Most southerners said they would 'rather vote for a yellow dog' than a Republican. Southern Democrats stood far to the right of their northern colleagues in their political views, blending social conservatism with heavy pork barrel spending. Since the 1960s, when the Democrats became more closely identified with the fight for black civil rights, the Republicans have made inroads in the Deep South and the border states such as Kentucky and Missouri. They started with presidential elections, in which southern states have generally favoured Republican candidates from Senator Barry Goldwater onwards, and continued in statewide elections for governor and senator. That trend carried on in Tuesday's elections, with Republican candidates taking over as governors in Alabama, Tennessee, Kansas, and with both Tennessee Senate seats moving into the Republican column. Tennessee's new governor is the first the state has ever elected who was born north of the Mason-Dixon line, the traditional divide between North and South. Perhaps as telling, the Republicans were able to hold on to the governorship of South Carolina, though by the narrowest of margins, even though their candidate, Mr David Beasley, aroused hostility with radical rightwing positions backed by a Christian evangelical coalition. One rare success for the Democrats was Governor Zell Miller's successful campaign for re-election in Georgia, defeating the strongest challenge the Republicans have mounted in that state since the Civil War. But Republicans have in the past found it much more difficult to make headway at the local level, leaving the Democrats dominant in the House of Representatives, as well as in state legislatures and county courthouses. 'Used to be, if you wanted to win, you ran in the Democratic primary,' says Mr Bernie Castleman, who is the only Republican commissioner elected in his Tennessee county in the last hundred years. That began to change in this election. Helped by the retirement of old Democratic legislators such as Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, the Republicans gained 11 House seats in five deep South states, three more in Oklahoma, two in Texas and one each in Tennessee and Kansas. The biggest swing came in North Carolina, where the cigarette tax proposed in President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan added to the Democrats' problems in tobacco-growing districts. North Carolina also provided perhaps the most striking evidence of a lasting change in the South's party alignment: a Republican takeover of the state house and Senate - the first time this century that they have controlled a state legislature in the South. They also won control of the Florida Senate. Many southern Democrats have voting records in Congress that are closer to the Republicans than to the rest of the Democratic party, and some are expected to follow Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama's party switch yesterday. Congressman Newt Gingrich has warned that the Republicans will target conservative southerners who do not switch sides in the 1996 election. And with the 'yellow dog Democrats'' stranglehold broken, new candidates will feel in years to come that they can run as Republicans and have a good chance of winning. Southern Democrats are now as likely to be relatively leftwing black or Hispanic politicians as conservative 'boll weevils'. The South's realignment could also move the Democratic party further to the left.</p>

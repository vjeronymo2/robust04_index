			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Au Printemps to acquire Conforama for FFr4.83bn PINAULT, the French industrial concern which recently won control of the Au Printemps department store group, has agreed terms to sell Conforama, France's largest chain of furniture stores, to Au Printemps for FFr4.83bn (Dollars 867m). The decision to sell Conforama, which Pinault bought last year from the Au Bon Marche retail group for FFr4.4bn in an ingeniously financed deal, forms part of the long-standing strategy formulated by Mr Francois Pinault, chairman, for the Au Printemps group. Mr Pinault has just emerged from the cloud of controversy that greeted his partial bid for Au Printemps. The bid caused a storm of complaints from minority shareholders frustrated at being excluded from the deal. It is one of the chief catalysts for the French government's ongoing review of takeover legislation. The sale of Conforama  - at a higher price than that paid by Pinault in May last year  - will help the group to defray the cost of buying its majority stake in Au Printemps. Conforama  - France's biggest single furniture chain and the second largest electrical retailer after the Darty group  - saw its net profits slip by 13 per cent to FFr260m on sales of FFr7bn last year.</p>

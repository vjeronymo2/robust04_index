			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China's northwestern  Gansu Province has attracted a series of international  cooperation projects in its efforts to alter adverse natural  environmental conditions and improve agricultural  infrastructures.    The projects have brought about "remarkable changes" in  rural  development in this region, the provincial authorities said.    The Guanchuan river valley in Gansu was notorious for its  arid land, scarce vegetation, suffering from constant soil  erosion and frequent natural disasters.    The World Bank extended a low interest loan of 7 million  U.S.  dollars in 1987 to help this place. Now 73 percent less sand  and soil is deposited into the already silty Huanghe river by  the Guanchuan river, thanks to the cooperation projects with the  bank.    Forestry and grass cover 42.5 percent of the land in this  region today, up from 8.5 percent in 1986. And grain production  is increasing 4.5 million kilograms every year.    A local official said, "the rural population in this river  valley have almost ended poverty."    The UN World Food Program provided 61.18 million U.S.  dollars  in aid to help construct six large irrigation projects along the  Huanghe river. The former drought-stricken highland has been  turned into a grain production base.    In 1987, the World Bank also financed what has been called  China's most difficult and costly water diversion project with a  loan of 123 million U.S. dollars, relieving the repeated  interruptions caused by a shortage of funds and complicated  geological conditions.    Italian and Japanese companies are participating in the  construction. It is expected to be finished this year and to  irrigate 13,000 hectares of land this winter.    To further alleviate the water problem in Gansu, the UN Food  and Agriculture Organization and the European Community offered  aid packages of 200,000 U.S. dollars and 3.58 million European  currency units respectively to set up two hi-tech water-saving  irrigation experimental zones.    Promoting social development has also been an important  aspect of cooperation with world organizations in Gansu.    Medical bodies in the countryside in 15 counties have been  receiving aid from the UN Population Fund, children's fund and  some Canadian institutions. Many rural clinics have been set up  under the aid program.    The World Bank loaned Gansu 20 million U.S. dollars to  improve rural education in some poverty-stricken areas in 1987.  China's first pilot center aided by foreign funds to wipe out  rural illiteracy was established in Longxi county recently. The  UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization provided  25,000 U.S. dollars in aid for the center.</p>

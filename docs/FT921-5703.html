			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Carlsberg launches DKr1bn cash call CARLSBERG, the Danish brewing group, which is proposing to merge its UK brewing interests with those of Allied Lyons, is to strengthen its finances by a DKr1.06bn (Pounds 95.24m) rights issue. The Danish group is relatively small. Sales last year were DKr10.2bn, but it has a world-wide reputation as supplier of the Carlsberg and Tuborg lager brands. It has breweries in the UK, Germany, Portugal, Malawi, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Turkey as well as in Denmark. The group has increased its profits in every year for the past decade. Last year post-tax profits were DKr789m, a return on equity of 13.8 per cent. Carlsberg and Allied Lyons took the markets by surprise last year when they announced a joint venture to bring together their UK brewing interests to create a group with a strong portfolio of beers, including Carlsberg and Tuborg, Castlemaine XXXX, Skol and Lowenbrau, as well as Tetley Bitter and Draught Burton ale. The merger, proposed last October, is still under the scrutiny of the UK competition authorities. The venture will encompass Allied's six breweries and wholesaling operations, and Carlsberg's brewery at Northampton, one of the most efficient in the UK, together with its distribution network. Carlsberg has not specified what the new funds will be used for but Prof Kristof Glamann, supervisory board chairman, told the annual meeting in December, when hinting at a share issue, that increasing international competition made a strong financial position necessary. He said that Carlsberg needed capital for acquisitions and investment in new technology and sales and marketing. The issue of one new A or B share for 11 existing shares will be priced at DKr200 per share with a denomination of DKr20. This is well below the stock market price. The market traded the Carlsberg B share down by DKr22 to DKr319 and the A share by DKr18 to DKr333. The issue will open for subscription on March 30. The issuing banks have underwritten the issue. The Carlsberg Foundation, which has a controlling interest in the group, has guaranteed to subscribe 51 per cent of the issue, which is for A shares with a face value of DKr58.7m and DKr47.7m for the B shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis,  leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition,  claimed Russia's plans to create military bases in Latvia are "a  political aggression resembling Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's (Russian  ultranationalist) statements."    Commenting on the Russian president's recent decree,  Landsbergis said "Russia's intention to create military bases in  neighboring countries is a new imperialistic defiance of the  international community and civilized norms accepted in it,"  Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Thursday [7 April].    The opposition leader expressed regret that the Russian  president has to assent to demands of the military. "Latvia's  ascription to a group of states where Russia acts as if at home  is very dangerous to the international law."</p>

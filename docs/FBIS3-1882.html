The Defense Department sent 75 U.S. military personnel and  20  top-of-the line fighters, bombers and other military aircraft to  Asian Aerospace '94, a five-day international aircraft  exhibition that ended yesterday, according to THE WASHINGTON  POST.    The aircraft the Pentagon dispatched to Singapore included  the three F/A-18s, an Air Force F-15C strike plane and four U.S.  Army helicopters, totalling 13 types of fighter planes.    The industry officials consider the strong U.S. military  presence at the Singapore exhibition as a major boost the their  [as received] sales efforts in Asian arms market.    An official from the industry described the participation of  U.S. flight crews as an invaluable promotional tool because it  showed to foreign governments that in buying U.S. aircraft they  also were engaging in a relationship with the United States  military.    The U.S. participation in the exhibition is a sign that  Clinton government may reverse previous administration practice  of tighter controls on U.S. weapons exports, the newspaper said.    U.S. arms control officials said the Clinton administration  wants to boost American arms exports to make up for declining  production at home.    The result is that the Clinton administration is undermining  its own efforts to curb weapons exports, the U.S. Arms Control  Association said in a statement.    "In publicly reversing its own policy, the administration  sends the wrong signal to other suppliers and undercuts the  prospects for controlling weapons proliferation," the  association said.    "This is another indication that the administration is  giving  a higher priority to economic concerns than security concerns,"  it added.    THE WASHINGTON POST pointed out that the United States  already sells for more weapons abroad than any other nations.    U.S. defense firms secured 32.4 billion dollars in overseas  sales agreements during fiscal 1993, according to figures  compiled by arms control groups.    U.S. arms exports in 1992 accounted for nearly half of all  arms sales worldwide by all countries combined, the newspaper  said.</p>

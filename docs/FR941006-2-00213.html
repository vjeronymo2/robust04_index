			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the sale of products occurs during the project period, the costs and income generated by the sales must be reported on the Quarterly Financial Status Reports and documented in an auditable manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whenever possible, the intent to sell a product should be disclosed in the concept paper and application or reported to the Institute in writing once a decision to sell products has been made. The grantee must request approval to recover its product development, reproduction, and dissemination costs as specified in section X.V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other project income shall be treated in accordance with disposition instructions set forth in the project's terms and conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Payment of Grant Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The procedures and regulations set forth below are applicable to all Institute grant funds and grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Request for Advance or Reimbursement of Funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grantees will receive funds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval of a Request for Advance or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will be issued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request for Advance or Reimbursement, along with the instructions for its preparation, will be included in the official Institute award package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of submitting Requests for Advance or Reimbursement, recipients of continuation and on-going support grants should consider these grants as supplements to and extensions of the original award and number their requests on a project rather than a grant basis. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payment requests for projects within a package grant may be submitted at the same time, but must be calculated separately by component project. The alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) should be appended to the grant number in Block 5 of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Termination of Advance and Reimbursement Funding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When a grantee organization receiving cash advances from the Institute:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or project goals, or to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guideline requirements or special conditions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> the Institute may terminate advance financing and require the grantee organization to finance its operations with its own working capital. Payments to the grantee shall then be made by check to reimburse the grantee for actual cash disbursements. In the event the grantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right to suspend reimbursement payments until the deficiencies are corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

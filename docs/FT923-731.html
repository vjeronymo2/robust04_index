			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Taxing, but intellectual too Sir, Your article, 'Students say no to taxing careers with the Revenue' (September 22), highlighted the alleged unpopularity of the Tax Inspectorate as a graduate career. The reality is a little different. In 1992 alone we have received over 5,500 applications from honours graduates for just 30 vacancies. These applicants have realised that a career in the Tax Inspectorate offers what most graduates actually want: good training and career development, intellectual challenge, and progression on merit. All this in a dynamic culture. S Mitha, assistant director (recruitment), Inland Revenue, 22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NT</p>

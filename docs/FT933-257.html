			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Kohl stalls again on move to Berlin THE GERMAN government faces internal criticism after again postponing a decision on when the seat of government will move from Bonn to Berlin. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has been accused of distorting the costs of the move, prompting fears that the longer Chancellor Helmut Kohl puts off the decision, the greater the scope for wider divisions in the government and the Bundestag. The dithering over the move, which was agreed by the Bundestag on June 20 1991, is not only prompted by costs, which Mr Waigel claimed would be between DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) and DM30bn. Sections of the CDU fear a move in 1998 would alienate voters in the Rhineland, whose interests are tied to the government in Bonn. Mr Dietmar Kansy, a CDU deputy and chairman of the Bundestag's construction commission, said Mr Waigel's estimates for the move to Berlin were 'total nonsense' and he was using these figures simply to prevent it. In particular, Mr Kansy said the finance minister had included the cost of building 12,000 apartments, which he said were not supposed to be included in the costs, as well as transport, which in any case was going to be upgraded regardless of the move. Industrial orders in eastern Germany fell by 14 per cent in July compared with the previous month, with the manufacturing sector registering the sharpest fall, the federal Ministry of Economics said. Ministry officials said the decline was partly caused by seasonal factors as well as an unexpected 21 per cent increase in orders in June. Meanwhile the annual rate of inflation in western Germany dropped by 0.2 percentage points to 4 per cent last month, the federal statistics office reported yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Heidi West, who helped Francis Parker High School to three state division 1-A  volleyball titles, said Wednesday night she will attend Georgetown University  on a volleyball scholarship.  </P> <P> West, a 6-foot-1 middle blocker, selected Georgetown over William and Mary. She  also took trips to Virgina and Oregon State.  </P> <P> "It was the hardest thing in the world," she said. "I debated for two days."  </P> <P> West, a three-time all-section player, said she choose Georgetown for its  strong academic reputation and its inner-city environment.  </P> <P> "I felt it would be a bigger challenge going (to Georgetown)," she said.  "William and Mary is in a small college town. I think after four years it might  be too safe and too easy and become too comfortable."  </P> <P> Suzy Biszantz, a right-side hitter from section 3-A runner-up Torrey Pines,  will attend Tulane University on a volleyball scholarship.

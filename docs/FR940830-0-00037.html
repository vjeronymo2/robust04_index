			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A stipulation between the MDHES, the Lincoln County Commission and the Libby City Council was signed on March 18, 1993, to delineate responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and the local authorities. On March 19, 1993, the MBHES held a public hearing and (a) approved the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission control plan for the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area, and (b) incorporated the Lincoln County local air pollution control program and the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission control plan for the Libby area into the Montana SIP, and (c) issued a board order effectuating the program. The ordinances, stipulation, and board order were submitted to EPA with the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State also submitted a State Assistant Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to enforce any state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES issues a board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lincoln County ordinances are in effect now, as is the State's permit modification for Stimson Lumber Company. The State of Montana has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP are adequately enforced. EPA believes that the State's and Libby's existing air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this action contains further information on enforceability requirements, responsibilities, and personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Contingency Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. These measures were required to be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Libby nonattainment area SIP contains contingency measures that address re-entrained road dust (use of liquid de-icer and expansion of sanding and sweeping area to Air Pollution Control District boundaries) and residential wood combustion (prohibiting burning except under specified permits for the entire period between October 1 and March 31 each year). In a May 27, 1994, letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA advised the State that additional language was needed in the triggering mechanism for the contingency measures. The State is working with the local governments and health department to adopt the necessary changes. EPA will take separate action on the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contingency measures. See the TSD for this action for a more detailed discussion of the contingency measure deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP submitted to EPA on May 24, 1993, with final technical corrections dated June 3, 1994, for the Libby, Montana nonattainment area, with the exception of the contingency measures. Among other things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that the Libby moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area will attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is also approving the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, which was included in the Libby SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments, this final approval is made without prior proposal. However, in a separate document in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective October 31, 1994 unless, by September 29, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , nonattainment new source review program requirements) are due independent of the SIP requirements addressed in this action. EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OMB has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASTROS SAVING $3 MILLION BUT LOSING TALENT;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HOUSTON'S FOUR ON-FIELD LOSSES ARE LEAVING GAPS THAT WILL BE HARD TO  FILL.  </P> <P> Saving money is costing the Houston Astros talent.  </P> <P> In less than two weeks, the Astros have lost two of their top relievers,  all-time save leader Dave Smith and Juan Agosto. They've also said goodby to  Franklin Stubbs, their top RBI producer of 1990, and reserve outfielder Terry  Puhl.  </P> <P> Deducting the four players' combined 1990 salaries saved the Astros $3.2  million, but the on-field losses left holes that will be hard to fill.  </P> <P> Owner John McMullen is trying to sell the team and has installed a tight  financial rein while their NL West rivals, especially San Francisco and the  Dodgers, have opened their wallets for trades and free-agent signings.  </P> <P> The revolving door away from the rebuilding Astros spun a little faster today  when free-agent pitcher Danny Darwin signed a four-year contract with the  Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> "This is a players' market right now, and we're sticking with our philosophy,"  General Manager Bill Wood said after Smith signed a two-year, $4.9-million deal  with the Chicago Cubs on Monday.  </P> <P> Smith and Darwin became new-look free agents as the result of the collusion  settlement between owners and the players' union. Houston's tight-money  policies also could lead to problems in signing first baseman Glenn Davis, who  can become a free agent after the 1991 season.  </P> <P> Houston's rebuilding project -- the Astros finished fourth in the NL West with  a 75-87 record -- started before the season ended. The Astros dealt veteran  reliever Larry Andersen to Boston and sent longtime second baseman Bill Doran  to Cincinnati at the trading deadline, receiving minor-league prospects in both  deals.  </P> <P> Smith was 6-6 with 23 saves last season and leads all active pitchers with a  2.53 ERA. He has 199 career saves, fourth among active pitchers.  </P> <P> Smith, 36, said he left the Astros, for whom he had played his entire  big-league career, because he wants to play for a contender.  </P> <P> "If I thought they had a chance to contend, I would have signed with them for a  lot less money," Smith said. "But I don't see that team contending for the next  two or three years. . . . I understand that's what you have to do when you  rebuild.  </P> <P> "It just wasn't a situation I was prepared to go through for the next two or  three years."  </P></p>

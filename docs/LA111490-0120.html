			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> GAMBLING CLUB ALLOWED TO REOPEN  </P> <P> The Fillmore City Council on Tuesday approved a permit for a card gambling club  in the city.  </P> <P> On a 5-0 vote, the city gave the go-ahead to Bud and Betty Burton to reopen the  Pan Pad Club for poker and pan games on the site of the old Perkos Restaurant  on Ventura Street.  </P> <P> The Burtons bought the restaurant earlier this year.  </P> <P> The Pan Pad Club had operated between 1971 and 1986, when the city brought the  club's building on Fillmore Street and transformed it into a senior citizen  center.  </P> <P> In exchange for agreeing to sell the building, Burton was allowed to renew his  gambling license, Councilman Roger Campbell said. Gambling was outlawed in  Fillmore soon after the Pan Pad Club was licensed, but the Burtons were allowed  to keep their license because they had opened the club before the ban went into  effect, Campbell said.

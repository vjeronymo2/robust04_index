			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CAMINO REAL, OCEAN LEAGUES;  </P> <P> SHOOTER, REBOUNDER LEAD ST. BERNARD PAST SEGUNDO  </P> <P> Point guard Terry Sullivan scored 19 points and center Wyking Jones had 16  points, 17 rebounds and four blocked shots Wednesday night to lead St. Bernard  to a 66-59 win over visiting El Segundo in a Camino Real League basketball  opener.  </P> <P> It was the first game in the competitive league for new member El Segundo, and  St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune thought the Eagles played well.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen everybody in the league yet, but they're a good team," McClune  said. "They're patient, they're well-coached and you don't get any offensive  rebounds against them."  </P> <P> St. Bernard (6-5 overall) opened a 35-23 halftime lead and maintained a  comfortable margin through the third quarter. But El Segundo (6-7) rallied  behind guard Scott Panfil to pull within six in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Panfil scored a game-high 28 points and had five three-point shots, two coming  in the fourth quarter when El Segundo hit four three-pointers. Scott Talanoa,  the Eagles' brawny 6-5 center, had 14 points and did a good job on the boards.  </P> <P> Morningside 111, North Torrance 70 -- The Monarchs opened defense of their  Ocean League title in a big way, jumping out to a 14-1 lead and never looking  back in a convincing performance at North.  </P> <P> Senior forward Tyrone Paul scored 30 points to help Morningside (10-3 overall)  snap a two-game losing streak. Guard Martel Bland added 18 and 6-6 forward  Arthur Savage had 12 and played well near the basket.  </P> <P> "They played super and we played very poorly," said North Coach Jim Nielsen,  whose team dropped to 5-7 overall. "I thought they were the best team (in the  league) before the game, and nothing happened to change my mind. Nobody is  going to touch them, I think."  </P> <P> Forward John Tymick paced North with 25 points.  </P> <P> Mira Costa 59, West Torrance 35 -- A hot shooting hand by guard Chris Hobbs  helped the Mustangs rally from a two-point deficit in the first quarter and  open the Ocean League season with a win at West.  </P> <P> Trailing 13-11, Mira Costa outscored West, 22-12, in the second quarter behind  Hobbs, who hit four three-point shots in the period and scored 20 of his  game-high 22 points in the first half. The Warriors shadowed Hobbs with a  box-and-one defense in the second half.  </P> <P> The Mustangs (7-3 overall) extended their lead to 44-27 in the third quarter  behind forward Canyon Ceman, who scored nine of his 14 points in the period.  Center Mike Ashenfelter added 10 points for Mira Costa, whose leading scorer,  forward Chris Davis, was ineffective because of foul trouble.  </P></p>

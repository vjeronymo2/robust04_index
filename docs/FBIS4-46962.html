			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent S. Kasatyy: "Attack on Debtors"] </F>   [Text] The slump in traffic volume is continuing in  the region serviced by the Volga Railroad. In April for example  it was 36.7 percent of the level of the corresponding period of  last year. Noticeably less petroleum products, chemical  fertilizers, cement and ferrous metals are being presented for  shipment. Unfortunately a tendency for passenger traffic to  decrease was noted in January as well.    However, as railroad chief Yu. Tsittel noted at a recent  sorters' conference, there are still considerable unutilized  reserves in the Volga Railroad. The freight shipment and  dispatch system leaves something to be desired. Adequate  attention is not being devoted to freight and passenger train  schedules.    Yuriy Ivanovich also cited the figures for losses from  failure to meet qualitative indicators. Because of reduced  locomotive productivity 210 million rubles were lost, almost  R180 million were lost because the average freight train weight  target was not met, and R83 million were lost because of too  high a percentage of empty runs. As for the total, R1.3 million  were lost.    Even today, clients owe the railroad over R75 billion for  shipments, while it owes R80 billion. Two out of four  divisions--Yershov and Saratov--are already operating at a loss.    Here are two examples of irresponsibility.    It took 10 days for car No 63782270 to get from Duplyatka  Station to the freight recipient in Yelshanka. The railroad  received R1.235 million from the client in accordance with the  rate schedule, but it then returned 720,000 to him for late  delivery--over half of what it earned. And there were no reasons  for the delays--just the usual laxity.    A second example. Passenger cars have been set up at large  terminals as hotels on wheels. There are some at Astrakhan-1  Station. An inspection of just one car by financial auditors  revealed that only 11 of the 19 people spending the night there  were accounted for. Conductor Koteva pocketed the R28,000 she  received from the others. And you can imagine how much slips by  the railroad's cash registers because of hitchhikers in  passenger and commuter trains!    All of this needs to be fought decisively, since otherwise  the railroad's income will fall no matter what the situation.    Special attention is now being devoted on the Volga Railroad  to reducing operating expenses. Fulfillment of the corresponding  order of the railroad chief made it possible to save as much as  over R8 billion since the beginning of the year.    But there still are even more reserves. The position of  division deputy chief for economics was introduced in the  Volgograd Division, as being the largest and most important, in  order to concentrate the efforts of financial experts and  economists. Several months have gone by, but to what end? The  results are almost invisible. Obviously the railroaders are  simply waiting for the clients themselves to pay what they owe  for shipping, out of the goodness of their hearts. And these  debts are sizeable--64 percent of what the enterprises owe the  railroad.    In a critique at the railroad administration, it was  revealed  that the Volgograd Division received from its clients only 40  percent of what they owe for shipping. This indicator is lower  than that of the railroad as a whole. In the meantime the  Yershov Division received over 90 percent in April. How they  were able to do this will be explained below.    Volgograd Division deputy chief for economics V. Sabina and  financial division chief V. Plyushch were severely rebuked at  the critique. After this, the owed money began flowing better  into the division's account.    But let's return to the Yershov Division. The aggressive  position taken by its chief, S. Khlobystov, had the result that  the most delinquent debtor--the Irgiz Joint-Stock Company in  Balakovo--finally dipped into its wallet and paid its debt of  over a billion rubles for transportation services.    It should be noted that the experience that has been  accumulated in settling mutual accounts with clients is also  proving to be useful. Together with chief economist A. Yelashova  and financial service chief A. Korolkov, the railroad's  specialists developed and are successfully using a system under  which the Volga Railroad pays what it owes for diesel fuel and  electric power to keep the trains moving with fuel oil obtained  in turn from its debtors. The Saratovenergo Joint-Stock Company  recently paid off its entire debt in this way.    The railroad's contract relations with clients are also  growing noticeably stronger. They can now influence them with  the ruble, by demanding and collecting prepayments for  shipments. While it owes no debts to the railroad, the Saratov  Oil Refinery has taken it upon itself to prepay the State  Committee for Petroleum Products for fuel received by the  railroad.    "We found a way to demand payment of debts through State  Arbitration," said chief economist L. Yelashova. "As you know,  the presidential edict on collection of payments without  acceptance has been invalid for a long time. Now arbitration is  providing good assistance. Things have only just started moving,  but our legal service has already joined the effort, and I think  that the changes accountants and lawyers of the Yershov and  Saratov divisions have accomplished will very soon become  possible in all of the railroad's divisions.    "For a small fee we use the services of the Saratov Kapital  Firm, which takes promissory notes from debtors and transfers  them to us."    Debts are also being paid off with commercial products. The  railroad has received fuel, electric power and construction  materials worth R31.7 billion from debtors.    The way in which these acquired industrial products are  being  sold off will be discussed in a separate article.</p>

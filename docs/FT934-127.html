			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Kohl takes a sober view of the new year Chancellor Helmut Kohl today said Germany was moving out of recession, but tempered his optimistic forecasts for the new year with warnings of more spending cut-backs, and a slow recovery in the labour market. In his annual new year's eve television address, and an article in the end-of-year issue of Handelsblatt, the economics daily, Mr Kohl identified unemployment as the most worrying single issue among Germans. By the end of the year, 8.7 per cent of the labour force, or 3.44m people will be unemployed - the highest levels since the second world war. They include 2.28m from western Germany and over 1.16m from the eastern states. Mr Kohl said a package of radical reforms at the work - place was needed to help guarantee existing jobs, create new ones, and improve Germany's competitiveness. 'Securing the future forces us to make more cuts. . . what we need is courage and realism, initiative and confidence,' he said. In a sober broadcast, and reflective article, the chancellor gave priority to domestic issues, instead of focusing on European Union affairs as in previous speeches this year. The shift reflected his agenda for next year's marathon round of state and parliamentary elections. Mr Kohl insisted that the government's two-track strategy of reforms in western Germany and large financial transfers to eastern Germany would ultimately create jobs and counteract the social costs of unification. But he warned that even after the recovery it would 'take a considerably longer time until positive aspects are felt on the labour market'. He explained that one of the reasons for Germany's lack of competitiveness, and consequent high unemployment, was a sense of delusion about the effectiveness of the country's social and economic structures, which postponed any fundamental discussion about reforms. 'The creation of 3m jobs over the past years tempted us into believing there was no need to become more competitive,' he said. He added that the recipe for competitiveness hinged on the workplace, a theme the government has constantly repeated over the past year. He said reforms would include 'flexibility in working hours, and particularly more job sharing', underpinned by reducing costs.</p>

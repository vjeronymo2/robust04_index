			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The head of the powerful  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) expressed  support Monday [13 June] for the planned abolition of a  provisional law regulating imports of oil products.    It is natural to abolish the law in line with economic  deregulation, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the elite business  club, told a news conference, referring to a plan by the Trade  Ministry to abolish the law.    He said deregulation is a major task to be tackled and  should  be pushed ahead by all means.    Toyoda, who is chairman of Japan's top automaker Toyota  Motor  Corp., said he was not confident enough on an economic recovery  although there were some bright signs.    He said the present value of the Japanese yen is too high in  view of Japan's fundamental economic conditions and it should be  brought down to an optimum level, or around 110 yen to the  dollar.</p>

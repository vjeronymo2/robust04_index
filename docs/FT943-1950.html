			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Naples politicians accused of Mafia link Mr Antonio Gava, a former Christian Democrat interior minister and a big political figure in Naples, was yesterday arrested on charges of alleged association with the Camorra, the Neapolitan Mafia. The arrest was one of 76 ordered by Naples magistrates on charges of association with the Camorra. Those arrested included two other former prominent local politicians. A further 22 arrest warrants were issued in the same inquiry for various types of corruption. Naples magistrates first sought to implicate Mr Gava on similar charges in March 1993. Parliament subsequently agreed that his immunity should be waived. However, the magistrates have waited a good six months before moving to arrest Mr Gava who was widely known as the most powerful Christian Democrat figure in the Naples region for much of the past two decades. He now becomes the second former minister from Naples to be arrested. But his colleague - former health minister Francesco Di Lorenzo - only faced corruption charges. But the Gava case is the most serious accusation linking the world of organised crime with politics since that of former prime minister Giulio Andreotti. As interior minister from 1988-92, he had direct control over the fight against the Mafia. Earlier in 1987 as finance minister he had responsibility for the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. Mr Gava is alleged to have been part of the clan of Carmine Alfieri, the leading figure in the Camorra, who was captured in September 1992 after having been on the police wanted list for ten years. Naples magistrates claim that at the time of his capture Alfieri was running an empire which spanned illicit construction and investment activities alongside drug dealing, extorsion and racketeering with a combined annual turnover of L1,500bn (Dollars 965m). Extensive information on the Alfieri empire has been supplied by Pasquale Galasso, a former close associate who has been under police witness protection since December 1992. Galasso's evidence has already led to hundreds of arrests and has been the principal means of implicating the bulk of the former ruling elite on the Naples city council as well as leading business figures and national politicians. Mr Gava is alleged to have developed his Camorra links in the early eighties. This was in the wake of the transfer of vast funds to Naples and the surrounding region to make good the damage caused by the devastating Irpinia earthquake. These funds were diverted for political use and business investment which required Mafia protection, the magistrates allege. In return for such protection the politicians headed by Mr Gava agreed to provide political cover for the Camorra. The majority of journalists in RAI, Italy's state-run broadcasting corporation, yesterday staged a 24-hour stoppage in protest at government-imposed changes in the editorial control of the three television channels and national radio network, writes Robert Graham. The changes were agreed over the weekend and reflected efforts by the Berlusconi government appointed management board to shake up the existing editorial structure. The RAI main union claimed the new board had failed to observe proper procedures and was determined to place government-friendly journalists in key positions of editorial control.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON RESOLUTION  </P> <P> Once again Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) showed his ugly racist  character by vehemently objecting to "a resolution calling for California  schoolchildren to be taught that the Japanese internment during World War II  was a violation of human rights. . . ." (The Times, Aug. 25). Ferguson is a  self-styled anti-communist, yet he finds comfort in emulating Soviet Russia's  rewriting of history to eliminate unsavory events. A veteran of three wars,  Ferguson asked the 80-member Assembly for "one-week postponement so he could  rally veterans groups against the resolution."  </P> <P> As a veteran, I urge my fellow veterans to ask Ferguson, in turn, why it is Tom  Hayden, whom he wants ousted from the Assembly, and not him, who is fighting  for the welfare of the veterans as shown by Hayden's bill signed by the  governor in 1984 to aid victims of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> The veterans groups should stop supporting Ferguson's contemptible ideas --  this time, to lie outright to our children and future generations about  history.  </P> <P> SAM CASTELO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM plans powerful addition to range of minicomputers INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday announced additions to its range of AS/400 minicomputers, one of the company's few strong sellers over the last year. The AS/400 was introduced in 1988. IBM said the new computers were up to 70 per cent more powerful than the current generation of AS/400 machines, and incorporated several technology advances, including a new generation of 16-megabit memory chips. 'It represents IBM's first step in applying this new technology across our product line,' said Mr Paul Low, IBM vice-president and general manager, technology products. 'We plan to introduce 16-megabit technology in new products this year and beyond, taking advantage of the increased capacity and performance this new chip provides.' The new top-of-the line AS/400, the model E90, is the first to use IBM's one-gigabyte 3 1/2 inch disk storage device. IBM said this would significantly reduce the cost of data storage for its minicomputer users. The company announced new AS/400 software, including a new version of the operating system, which it said would make them more open and easy to use. In the US, IBM announced a rebalancing of prices on memory and peripheral options for the AS/400 line. Prices of displays, memory and disk storage were reduced by up to 40 per cent. US prices for the new E model processors are the same or slightly increased over current models. Typical configurations, including peripherals and software, provide 30 per cent better performance at 10 per cent less cost, IBM said. The new models will be available next month, US prices range from Dollars 38,000 to Dollars 1.2m. IBM's UK subsidiary has decided to dispense with list prices for the new mid-range machines, writes Alan Cane. The move seems an extension of a trend of the past few years where the price paid by a customer for an IBM mainframe has had little relation to the list price. It is thought to be the first time IBM has thrown away the price book for low-cost machines. The UK market is thought to be IBM's toughest, and the company is taking the opportunity to test new marketing methods and pricing policies.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: World crashes in on soccer's prodigal genius  -Diego Maradona's spectacular tournament comeback has been obliterated by a positive drug test The world's best-known soccer delinquent, Argentina's Diego Maradona, was booted out of the World Cup yesterday for taking a common - but banned - anti-asthma medication which is also a powerful stimulant. In a two-part drugs test, Maradona tested positive for ephedrine and was expelled from the tournament. Immensely talented and super-rich, Maradona had clawed his way back to the pinnacle of international soccer at this World Cup following a career marked by wine, women, drugs and song - plus suspension for cocaine abuse. Fifa, soccer's governing body, announced Maradona's suspension minutes after Argentina had withdrawn him from the competition anyway. Maradona led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986. This was his fourth appearance in the tournament - he should have made a World Cup record 22nd match appearance, against Bulgaria, late yesterday. Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Association, originally claimed that the incident might be a 'minor issue,' but blamed Maradona's private dietician for allowing the star to use ephedrine during World Cup play. Dietician Daniel Cerrini had prescribed the drug and was 'very sorry because it was something that was done unintentionally.' Ephedrine is a common nasal decongestant available over the counter in Maradona's home country. It is used to treat asthma, hay fever and allergies and acts on the body much like adrenalin, increasing blood pressure and heartbeat. It was ephedrine that caused American swimmer Rick DuMont to be stripped of a gold medal at the 1972 Olympic Games. DuMont said he was taking ephedrine only under a doctor's prescription for a long-standing asthma condition. Maradona, in the midst of a spectacular World Cup comeback after cocaine almost blotted out his career, led Argentina to victories in their first two games of the present competition. Late yesterday Argentina were playing Bulgaria in the last of their first-round matches at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas. They have already qualified for the next round. This is not the first time the flamboyant Maradona has failed a drugs test. He was banned from international soccer for 15 months in 1991-92 by Fifa after testing positive for cocaine, following a game for Napoli of Italy in March 1991. The next month he was arrested in Buenos Aires and charged with possession and use of drugs. Scornful of critics who said he was as 'fat as a pig,' Maradona shed 26lb and nursed himself back to health and fitness so as to join the present Argentine side. He had been making an impressive come-back when  - yet again  -he ran off the rails. Sources close to Fifa said that it normally considered drug offences 'on a case-by-case basis.' Fifa has declined to join a world-wide effort to standardise drug punishment in sport sponsored by the International Olympic Committee. The IOC's accord generally splits drugs into two groups - those such as caffeine, which can act as a stimulant if taken in large doses, and others such as anabolic steroids, taken only to enhance performance. Argentina would remain in the World Cup, with or without Maradona, Grondona said. Two players have been banned by Fifa for positive dope tests at previous World Cups: Ernest Jean-Joseph of Haiti, in 1974, and, four years later, Scotland winger Willie Johnston, who tested positive for an illegal substance he used medicinally. He was sent home. Simon Kuper adds: Prior to his latest troubles, Maradona had felt himself part of the best Argentine side he has played for - better, even, than the World Cup teams of 1986 and 1990. In 1986 Maradona more or less was Argentina. In 1990 their line-up was Maradona, Claudio Caniggia - and nine thugs. 'We've got the stuff that makes world champions,' Maradona said of the present team. Napoli, Boca Juniors and Bolivar of Bolivia have been jostling to sign him. The big question is why, at 33, after nearly a year out of soccer, Maradona bothered to turn up for his fourth World Cup. This is a man with nothing more to win - so full of cortizone injections that he could end up in a wheelchair and so rich that 'my daughters will eat caviare every day for the rest of their lives.' He keeps going because he is not only rebellious but intensely competitive. He said that on the night Argentina scraped past Australia to qualify for this World Cup, he 'wanted to be the last guy to leave the stadium. I wanted to turn off the lights and walk out with the last fan.' Maradona had talked of managing the Argentine side soon, but it was hard to see that working. Somehow he will have to find something else to keep him off the streets.</p>

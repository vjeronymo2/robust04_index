			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: How to spot the talent Companies must try harder to attract, develop, and retain their 'gold collar' workers, according to a new study*. Superior ability to manage talent provides a significant and sustainable competitive advantage, argue its authors Philip Sadler and Keith Milmer of Ashridge Management College. Drawing on case studies from organisations across seven countries, the report presents a strategy for getting the best out of people. For example, companies are advised to: Provide a common sense of purpose or direction and a set of shared beliefs and values. Top managers want more from their organisations than pay, security and a chance to develop their skills. Companies commended in this respect include Merck, Glaxo Group Research, ICL and Rockwell. Develop an appropriate organisational framework. Care must be taken not to stifle creative people, while at the same time ensuring management control. Understand your culture. Cohesive work teams, elites without elitism, openness and trust, and encouragement of innovation and risk-taking will be features of a talent-nurturing culture. Identify long-term requirements for high-talent personnel. The report suggests too many companies adopt a short-term, financially driven approach. Motorola, though, gets top marks for its 'strategic' vision. Develop recruitment and selection strategies. Some companies in the study betrayed 'a relative lack of sophistication' but National Westminster Bank stood out in its use of full-scale assessment centre procedures at the recruiting stage. Manage for performance. Ensure that talented people know what is expected of them in terms of output, and involve them in setting their own performance standards. Do not take motivation for granted. Evaluate your talent. For an organisation employing large numbers of talented people the authors say the opinion survey is an indispensable tool. *The Talent-Intensive Organisation.

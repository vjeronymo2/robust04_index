			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURNING OUT FOR PRINCESS AND COUNTRY  </P> <P> Two centuries after Paul Revere warned that the British were coming, they were  greeted with cheers and merriment here Saturday.  </P> <P> Marching to the strains of "Bonnie Dundee," the Royal Highland Fusiliers  pipe-and-drum band led a procession down Town Center Drive to officially start  the two-day Great British Food Fest at Town Center Park.  </P> <P> The outdoor festival -- an admission-free event ending today -- is part of the  monthlong celebration honoring the culture and arts of the United Kingdom.  </P> <P> The crowd cheered and cameras clicked as Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra,  a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and a descendant of King George V, took  her seat on stage, where she watched the procession.  </P> <P> American fascination with royalty aside, the loudest round of applause during  the parade went to a Marine Corps band. Other procession units included classic  British automobiles and the Orange County Firemen's Assn.'s classic orange fire  engine.  </P> <P> The princess, who was accompanied by her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, smiled but  did not address the audience after receiving proclamations and Costa Mesa's key  to the city -- an omission that disappointed county resident Delpha Cadogan,  who was born in England.  </P> <P> "I was real disappointed she did not speak," Cadogan said. "We have a real  great affection for her, and I think that it would have been nice if everybody  could have gotten to see how down to earth she is."  </P> <P> After the procession and a tour of South Coast Repertory, the princess quickly  moved through the festival grounds, where 9-year-old Amy Terrell of Costa Mesa  got what she came for: a chance to greet a member of the British royal family.  </P> <P> "She's pretty," the young girl said. "I mainly watched her say 'hello' to other  people."  </P> <P> The aroma of grilled beef patties, Indian somosas, fish and chips and other  fare filled the air, while comedians and musicians entertained.  </P> <P> Show tunes from "My Fair Lady" and "Oliver!" were performed by Ray Cooper, a  one-man band.  </P> <P> And on the main stage, the "British invasion" in 1960s popular music was  revisited by Rain, a four-member band that performs songs by the Beatles.  </P> <P> A few yards away, Derk Jaeger, 3, bounced up and down to the beat of "Roll Over  Beethoven" as an ice cream bar melted in his small hand.  </P> <P> Although enjoying the rock music, the toddler said, "I like the pipers the  best."  </P> <P> Newport Beach resident Mario Narro said he lived in England for three years in  the 1970s but did not get to enjoy much of the culture back then.  </P> <P> "That's why I'm coming out today," he said. "I thought I would catch up on lost  time."  </P> <P> John Keys of Oceanside looked like any other tourist until he introduced his  13-month-old son, Johnny, who was wearing a kilt. Keys, of Scottish descent,  pulled out a wallet and proudly showed a photo of his son a month after he was  born, wearing a kilt and lying on a plaid blanket.  </P> <P> "It's great so far," Keys said of the festival, which he hopes will be an  annual event. "We would be here every time they held it."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro  Saito hinted Monday [31 January] that his ministry may soften  its stance on the issue of whether to deal together an income  tax cut and a consumption tax hike.    "I have never explained the definition," Saito told a  scheduled news conference.    He declined further comment, noting a joint economic forum  of  the government and ruling coalition parties was dealing with the  tax issue. Saito said the ministry "will respect the decision  made by the forum."    On the stock market that staged a sharp rally, Saito said  there would be "no direct effects" on the state of the economy  because market prices are determined by supply-demand conditions  which do not necessarily reflect economic fundamentals.</p>

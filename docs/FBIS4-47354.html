			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E.F. Kaminskiy, I.T. Kozlov, and S.G. Ashitko, </F> All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining;  UDC 665.6(470).001.7]    [Abstract] The former Soviet Union was always one of the  world's leading petroleum exporters, and most of its proved oil  reserves were located in Russia. In the mid-eighties, however,  oil recovery in Russia began declining and will likely continue  to decline until the end of the century. In the near future,  Russia may thus anticipate an oil shortage. Because Russia had  never experienced the oil crises encountered in many  industrially developed countries, the development of  energy-saving technologies and intensification of the degree to  which oil is processed were never emphasized as in the West. At  the beginning of the nineties, the depth of oil refining in  Russia averaged just 65 percent versus 82-82 percent in  developed countries. At the same time, many Russian petroleum  products are inferior to their foreign counterparts from both  ecological and performance standpoints. The use of leaded  gasoline, in particular, is a serious ecological problem. Only  59 percent of diesel fuels produced in Russia may be classified  as low-sulfur. Furnace residual fuel oil remains Russia's  highest-volume petroleum product, and it accounts for 13-13.5  percent of the fuel used to produce electric power. The quality  of motor, industrial, and transmission oils produced at Russian  oil refineries is inferior to that of their foreign  counterparts. Russian oil refining industry is capable only of  meeting the fuel needs of its obsolete machine tool park,  vehicle fleet, and inventory of mobile and stationary power  generating units and is not equipped to handle the technological  breakthroughs anticipated in such sectors. The technological  structure of most of Russia's oil refineries cannot support  production of the required amounts of products meeting current  quality levels, much less future ones. The All-Russian  Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining has been  collaborating with leading institutes in the different petroleum  product-using sectors to develop the first scientifically  substantiated forecast of Russia's future petroleum product  needs. The forecast developed to date indicates a face-paced  increase in the number of diesel-fueled motor vehicles and  increases in the quantity and quality of high-octane gasolines.  The following changes in Russia's production and utilization of  petroleum products were recommended: increasing use of winter  grades of diesel fuels until it accounts for 30 percent of all  diesel fuels used, reducing the maximum sulfur content of diesel  fuel used in vehicles driven in cities or areas of high air  exchange from 0.2 to 0.05 percent, increasing the quality of  other petroleum products such as bitumen and coke, and  increasing the depth of oil refining to 72-75 percent within the  next 5 years and to 82-85 percent within the next 20 years.  Meeting these goals will require the construction of new  complexes to process mazut into motor fuels and the redesign of  existing facilities. The enormous capital investments required  for such massive construction/reconstruction can only be  achieved with adequate government support of the sector. Machine  building-related R&amp;D and facilities that have been freed up  as a  result of conversion could be used to construct modern  facilities permitting deeper processing of petroleum, which  could in turn reduce expenditures of foreign exchange on  imported petroleum products. The government must protect the  sector's scientific research institutes to keep them from  disappearing; restore destroyed scientific complexes of  scientific research institutes, affiliates, and pilot plants;  and modernize the sector's scientific research and design  institutes and link them with machine building plants in  integrated complexes.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Nimbyism - the growing cost One might suppose that monetarism had been studied to the point where it was difficult to add anything new. Yet at the History of Economics Society Conference in London yesterday, something of a fresh angle emerged. This may just have been in the eye of the beholder; but the fresh approach did seem to me to throw light on a variety of matters, including quite homely questions such as the relation of the supply of building land to inflation and economic recovery. The place to start is the emerging distinction between the modern monetarism used in forecasts and monetary targets and the historical Quantity Theory of Money as developed by John Locke, David Hume, the early Milton Friedman and others. In what follows I am almost certainly taking the distinction further than the speakers intended, but it is still worth drawing out implications. The Quantity Theory of Money relates inflation to the amount of money in circulation in a loose and long-term way. The original Quantity Theorists allowed plenty of room for time lags, changes in velocity and transitory effects on output, and were not dogmatic on how quickly or by how much a given percentage increase in money would raise prices. They also allowed for institutional changes and shocks from outside the monetary system. All that the Quantity Theory needs is the general proposition that money matters and that monetary changes can cause price changes and not just reflect them. The policy implications will depend on place and time. Moreover, until the breakdown of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s no country attempted to target the money supply directly. The latter was regulated automatically by the gold standard and by the structure of bank deposits and credits erected on the gold base. To the extent that monetary authorities, like the US Fed, attempted an independent national policy, it was geared to interest rates. Modern monetarism, by contrast, insists on a stable demand for money related to a few variables such as prices, real incomes and interest rates. Rightly or wrongly, it has shared in the discredit into which would-be scientific economics has fallen. In any case, its evaluation is reserved for econometric experts. The immediate point of drawing the distinction is that something like the very tight British system for limiting land for building development would not be regarded as relevant to inflation by many modern monetarists. But there would be a place for it in a broader Quantity Theory. This theory is normally stated in terms of the identity MV equals PT. The quantity of money, times its velocity of circulation, equals the average price per transaction, times the total number of transactions. Some adjustments are required to apply the identity to national income statistics, but it will do for exposition. Too much of the modern discussion has centred on the definition of M or stability of V. A shrewd central banker like Alan Greenspan, US Fed chairman, will allow for changes in the financial system and try to stabilise the total flow of money spending, MV, without necessarily worrying too much about the components. More interesting is the breakdown of PT, the price level times the level of economic activity. The pioneering economists of the 18th and 19th centuries would have known well enough that an interruption to production and trade, such as the Napoleonic wars or a bad harvest, would reduce T and thus raise the price level. These reflections came to my mind in relation to the complaint in Tuesday's Financial Times by Mr David Wilson, chairman of the house builders Wilson Bowden, that land prices for high quality housing sites had risen by an average of 25 per cent in the past 12 months and by up to 50 per cent in the south-east. Why has this happened so alarmingly early in the recovery? An unreflective reaction might be that monetary policy is too loose and stoking up demand. A more reflective Quantity Theorist would, however, wonder whether something had happened on the side of T to restrict supply and therefore stoke up inflation from the other end. The quick answer is that something has indeed happened. This was a tightening of planning restrictions in the early 1990s, which has reduced the potential supply of building land. Kevin Cammack, of Smith New Court, predicted nearly two years ago that the Town and Country Planning Act of 1990 and another act of 1991 would make it harder to secure planning permission for building sites and make appeals almost impossible. Builders are now convinced that local authority development plans are at the mercy of residents who say 'Not in my backyard' (Nimby) and are supported by the government. This was not noticed before, because of the recession. Now that activity is rising, however, it is coming up against much tighter zoning restrictions. When rising demand collides with an inelastic supply, it does not take a genius to see that the result must be higher prices. To spell out the causation: recovering demand leads to rising house prices, which in turn boosts the price of land. But as land with planning permission is a speculative asset, owners and investors do not wait for the chain of events but start marking up prices when recovery is in the air. The effect of any given rise in the demand for homes on both house prices and land values will depend on how responsive the supply of land is to building demand. A purist might object that house prices are only one element in the general price level. But they are an important one. And they usually move in the same direction as factory and office rents. An attempt to force other prices down to offset rising property values could be very painful. A comparison might be with what would have happened if governments had attempted to force other prices down to offset the oil price explosions of 1973 and 1979. Moreover high and rising house prices are believed to have a multiplier effect on inflation through the perception of increased wealth they bring to their owners. The shadow now on economic recovery is still no larger than a man's hand. But that is the time to watch it. Good house prices indices are difficult to find. The Department of the Environment and the Inland Revenue Valuation Office indices look very different. But the general trend is clear enough. Urban land prices were rising even in the recession of the early 1980s and quintupled between 1983 and 1989. Since then they have fallen by about a half, but are now on the rise again. A small recovery shown in the Valuation Office index between the spring and autumn of 1993 is widely regarded in the construction industry as too low. At present prices, land accounts for some 20 to 30 per cent of the price of a new house and up to 50 per cent in the most favoured parts of the south-east. Consumer expenditure related to housing is about 10 per cent of the total shown in the National Income Blue Book. If house prices were to double over a few years, the effect on people's perception of inflation would be severe, even though the retail prices index gives too much weight to interest rates and not nearly enough to house prices. If the government sticks to its anti-inflation objectives, the effect will be felt on economic activity instead. Alas, if the Bank of England puts on the brakes because of inflationary signals from the property market, this will inhibit growth and recovery much earlier on than if there had been a plentiful supply of land. Indeed, the effect on inflation and on official interest rate policies are in the last resort symptoms. The underlying process is that obstacles are being put in the way of business development and of places for workers to live. There is almost no link between the 'green' policies of the Department of the Environment and the growth and price stability objectives of the Treasury and (one hopes) the Department of Trade and Industry. Even if folly cannot be stopped, it should at least be exposed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Pilati] </F>   [Excerpt] The economic team is studying the possibility of  including the shares of public companies in the composition of  the funds that will back the new real currency. "That is what we  are currently discussing in the economic team," Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero admitted. He added that he has yet not made a  decision on how to back the new currency, but he said he is  "open" to this possibility. "It already has been decided that  the reserves will be an essential part to back the new currency,  or perhaps they will be the only backing, but we are studying  several ideas," he added. Some economic team members already  have adopted a favorable position regarding the inclusion of the  public companies' shares. "I will listen to them because they  have been at this longer than I have and I have no opinion yet"  on the subject, he said.    Ricupero denied that the economic stabilization program  being  implemented by the government entails the dollarization of the  Brazilian economy, as Workers Party presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva has said. "That term would be more  appropriate for the Cavallo Plan in Argentina," Ricupero said.  The reserves, he added, are not made up only of dollars, but  also Japanese yen and German, Swiss, and French marks, among  other currencies.    "The real backing of the new currency will be a healthy  Brazilian economy," Ricupero said, meaning the capability of  Brazilian companies to compete in the international market and  export, thus obtaining a trade surplus. Ricupero nonetheless  said that he is willing to study the ideas suggested by the  presidential candidates. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia will deliver the first of the seven  cryogenic engines it is to supply to India in 1996. This was  disclosed by the Russian first deputy foreign minister, Mr.  Anatoliy Adamishin, in an interview to UNI TV during his visit  to New Delhi recently. Mr. Adamishin, however, said under the  terms of the recent agreement the technology for the cryogenic  engines will not be transferred to India. He said India and  Russia are likely to sign a comprehensive agreement on  cooperation in the field of space technology during the  forthcoming visit of the Indian prime minister to Russia. In  reply to a question, Mr. Adamishin said Russia has been  supplying spares for India's defense equipment. He said the two  countries are discussing a proposal to set up joint ventures to  manufacture military spares.</p>

On the same day, a "P-3" anti-submarine plane staged an  exercise for striking submarines with mines, torpedoes and depth  bombs in the sky above the East Sea of South Korea [Sea of  Japan] under the support of formations of pursuit planes.    Armed bandits of the puppet army took the combat positions  in  Chorwon county, South Korean Kangwon Province and staged a  military rehearsal near the demilitarized zone, firing bullets  and shells.    This is part of premeditated military provocations of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to bring the  situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain.</p>

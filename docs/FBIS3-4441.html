			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Hong: "Beijing, Seoul on Path to </F> Friendship"]    [Text] The Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam's trip  to China this week marks another major milestone in a  relationship still in its infant stage, just 19 months old.    Although close neighbours in Asia, China and ROK remained  distant from each other over four decades for complicated  historical reasons.    When the two regional powers agreed to open diplomatic links  in 1992, the world responded with great enthusiasm.    The international community believed that the establishment  of Sino-ROK ties has closed another chapter of Cold War  hostility and paved the way for regional prosperity.    World affairs observers noted that it has also had a  positive  impact on peace and stability in Northeast Asia.    On the part of China and ROK, the new relationship has  started an era of contacts and opened wide prospects for  co-operation between the two countries, especially in trade and  investment.    Present Sino-ROK relations can be characterized by steady  growth, frequent exchange of visits at all levels and  substantive two-way trade.    Following the establishment of diplomatic ties between the  two nations, a host of top ROK officials toured China. Only one  month into the new era, then ROK President No Tae-u made an  historic visit to Beijing. The latest senior ROK official in  China was Yi Man-sop, speaker of the National Assembly, who  visited Beijing earlier this year as the guest of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.    In return, senior Chinese leaders also have paid official  visits to Seoul. They included Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Tian Jiyun,  Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.    Leaders of the two countries believe that friendly Sino-ROK  relations have suited the fundamental interests of the two  peoples and could also help peace and stability in Northeast  Asia and the continent at large.    Apparent political significance aside, China and ROK benefit  a great deal from their fresh ties in terms of trade.    When Vice-Premier Li Lanqing toured Seoul last year, ROK  President Kim Yong-sam told him that the two countries have  complementary economies and their co-operation has great  potential.    Kim's view has been shared by Li and other senior Chinese.  leaders. Increasingly, ROK is betting its economic future on  China's booming market as they become two of Asia's most crucial  trading partners.    China has emerged as ROK's third-largest trading partner  after the United States and Japan, with their trade doubling  last year to $8.3 billion.    Analysts predict the volume will grow 33.2 percent annually,  to $28 billion by 1997.    Presently, Sino-ROK co-operation is expanding from trade  links into investment and technical fields.    China is the top counts for investment among many ROK firms.  Accumulated investment in China is expected to quadruple from $1  billion, on an approval basis, at the end of 1993 to $4 billion  by 1997. A researcher with a top Seoul think-tank was recently  quoted as saying that China is an opportunity for ROK, which  faces increasing difficulties abroad, caught in between advanced  and developing nations.    Kim Yong-sam's visit, which began on Saturday, is seen as an  opportunity to invigorate industrial ties between the two  economies.    Leaders of the two countries have expressed their  satisfaction over growing relations between Beijing and Seoul.  They agreed to build stronger links, in particular closer trade  and economic ties.    When No Tae-u was in Beijing, the two governments signed a  package of agreements on the promotion of bilateral trade and  the protection of investment.    The agreements served as a solid legal foundation for  further  growth in bilateral co-operations.    When Kim is in town this time, another major investment  protection document, on avoidance of double taxation, is  expected to be hammered down.</p>

The three bodies were found  in Mafikeng's Main Street on Friday afternoon following days of  bloody conflict in Bophuthatswana.    The two men and a woman, with half her face shot away, lay  in  the street near the Mafikeng Town Square for at least three  hours and were still there at 6pm.    Heavily armed white rightwing insurgents, who entered the  homeland early on Friday with the aim of assisting  Bophuthatswana security forces in quelling the popoular  uprising, finally left the Bophuthatswana Defence Force airfield  at about 4.30pm.    The rightwing action backfired badly on them -- during the  course of the day at least three rightwingers were shot dead,  and five were wounded by Bophuthatswana soldiers.    Shops inside the flashpoint Mega City shopping complex were  set alight on Friday afternon following more than 24 hours of  running battles between looters and people responsible for  keeping them at bay.    A vacant lot behind the complex, adjacent to the  Bophuthatswana government buildings, has been used as a site for  burning garbage and tyres.</p>

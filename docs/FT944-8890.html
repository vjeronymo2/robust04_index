			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (6): Enjoying one of its best years  -Tourism and business travel In tourism and business travel, Massachusetts is a state which makes a virtue out of its modest proportions and understated charms. It has no choice. On their initial trip to the US, few foreigners are drawn to the cobble-stone streets of Boston's Beacon Hill or to historic Plymouth rock, where the Puritans landed in 1620. The first time out, only the most independent spirits venture north to Walden Pond or west to the autumnal splendor of the Berkshire mountains. Instead, they gravitate to the bright lights of New York, the glitz of Hollywood or the sunshine and spectacle of Florida. 'It's very difficult to compete with Mickey Mouse,' says Mr Fred Clifford, European marketing manager at the state's Office of Travel and Tourism, referring to the phenomenal appeal of Disney World in Orlando. Likewise, convention planners most often turn to places such as Chicago or New York when booking the kind of events which attract tens of thousands of visitors. Compact Boston - one of the few American cities which is best enjoyed on foot - simply lacks sufficient size to accommodate the biggest shows. The Hynes convention centre, its main venue, has only half the floor space of the grand exhibition hall recently opened in Philadelphia. Yet despite these handicaps - if indeed they can be characterised as such - tourism and business travel are powerful economic engines in Massachusetts, generating an estimated Dollars 12.5bn in business and Dollars 200m in state and local taxes a year. In Boston alone, hotels, restaurants and hospitality businesses employ more than 10 per cent of the workforce. The travel industry is now enjoying one of its best years since 1986, when the regional economy was near the peak of an unsustainable boom. The growth is not nearly as explosive as it had been a decade ago, but the robust trend is encouraging for a state that is still shaking off the lingering effects of a severe recession. By the end of 1994, the Greater Boston Visitors and Convention Bureau estimates that nearly 10m people will have visited the city, up 16 per cent from the 1991 trough. The extra business is especially welcome during a period when some sectors of the city's economy - particularly healthcare - are just beginning to undergo a painful contraction. There is evidence that the state is becoming a destination of choice for more foreign travellers. An informal survey of London tour operators conducted by the state shows sales so far this year are 10 to 25 per cent ahead of 1993. The number of German airline passengers visiting Massachusetts last year jumped 54 per cent, according to the US Travel Data Centre, which compiles tourism figures for the federal government. What explains the state's growing appeal? The price is right, for one thing. The weak dollar has made travel to the US much cheaper for both Europeans and Japanese. At the same time, fewer Americans can afford to book holidays abroad. Instead, they are planning shorter vacations closer to home, a trend which has benefited Massachusetts - with its wealth of quiet, family attractions - more than most states. On the symbolic level, at least, that orientation was underscored by the decision of America's 'first family' - the Clintons - to spend their summer holidays on Martha's Vineyard, the exclusive island resort off Cape Cod. Even though accommodations there are booked solidly, year-in and year-out, the publicity was priceless for the state's tourism industry as a whole. But Massachusetts has more going for it than the vagaries of macroeconomics and a brush with celebrity. The state has stepped up its overseas marketing programmes in an effort to attract the growing body of Europeans who have visited the US more than once and who are now ready to book something more sophisticated than a trip to a theme park. In view of this burgeoning potential market, 'Massachusetts is about to explode as a holiday destination,' predicts Mr Clifford. 'It's a place which has really come into its own.' In attracting such visitors, diminutive Massachusetts cannot be viewed in isolation from its five neighbours in the New England region. Typically, foreign tourists will fly into Boston, spend a few days sight-seeing and shopping, and then head north by car to the fishing villages of Cape Ann and the state of Maine. The next stops on the circular tour are rugged New Hampshire and rolling Vermont, before turning south into the Berkshires, world renowned for their autumn foliage and summer arts festivals. After a brief foray through Connecticut and Rhode Island, many usually find themselves at the sandy beaches of Cape Cod, before completing the loop back to Boston. Foreign travellers going to Massachusetts for business most often stay in Boston, and their numbers are climbing. About 10 per cent of delegates at the city's medical conferences and meetings now come from outside the US, up from 1 per cent a decade ago. Indeed, medical conferences held in the city often have record attendance. Celebrity speakers affiliated from the state's prestigious schools and hospitals are a big draw, but there are other reasons which have nothing to do with Boston's renowned medical establishment. 'We have all the things that convention delegates tend to like,' says Ms Leslie Matthieu Hogan, marketing director for the convention bureau. Many visitors enjoy the fact that the airport is only minutes away from downtown Boston. First-class hotel rooms are plentiful, the restaurants sophisticated. Best of all, walking around the city is easy. Last year, it became even easier with the opening of the Boston Convention Complex. The project actually involved no significant new construction. Rather, the 'complex' was formed by unifying the existing Hynes convention centre, three hotels and some 200 shops and restaurants by means of a network of glass-enclosed walkways. In part, the ad hoc complex represents an effort by the city and state to compensate for its lack of a big exhibition centre. While the Boston metropolitan area is the country's seventh-largest, the city ranks 41st in terms of available space for meetings and trade shows. That reality has forced the city to concentrate on booking smaller events. A controversial plan to build a gigantic convention centre and stadium, probably on the southern fringes of downtown Boston, is now working its way through the Massachusetts Legislature. But it is a little surprising that the scheme is garnering so much political and public support, given the success tourism officials have enjoyed in promoting the city as a leading host of small business meetings. The number of events booked this year is expected to reach 220, up from just 120 in 1991. Meanwhile, the average number of people attending each function will have dropped from 5,000 to 1,500, underlining the shift in emphasis. But for the city's economy, it is a fair trade, considering that the number of hotel-room nights booked by people attending meetings climbed nearly 40 per cent over the same period. Indeed, Boston appears to have found a profitable niche, and one that seems most appropriate to its character as a small, intimate city.</p>

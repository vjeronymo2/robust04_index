			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / New charter airline to fly A320s THE LAUNCH of a UK charter airline yesterday gave the European Airbus consortium a psychological boost as the new carrier announced that it would start operations in May with three A320 airliners. The highly computerised twin-engine aircraft has been at the centre of controversy after the crash of an Air Inter A320 in France last week in which 87 people died. But Mr Bob O'Donnell, the managing director of the new charter airline, Excalibur Airways, said he had no doubts about the integrity of the A320's systems. In two previous crashes the aircraft, its systems and engines had been cleared, and Mr O'Donnell said he expected the aircraft to be exonerated again in France. The airline is the first UK charter carrier to operate the A320 on charter services. British Airways operates 10 A320s on scheduled routes. Investigators are trying to discover the cause of last week's A320 crash, but the French civil aviation authority said an initial examination of the aircraft's flight recorders had yielded no reason to ground other A320s. The new airline has been constituted after a management buy-out of Trans Europe Airways UK, the British charter subsidiary of the collapsed TEA Belgian airline. TEA, one of the victims of the decline in air travel caused by the Gulf war and the economic slowdown, went into bankruptcy last year. Although its UK subsidiary was profitable, it was forced to suspend operations last September after the demise of its Belgian parent company. The new airline is the second UK carrier to have been reconstituted from the collapse of previous airlines. The other is Euroworld Airways, the Gatwick-based commuter airline, part of the failed Air Europe group. It started operations again under new management last year and renamed itself Cityflyer Express last week. The management of the former TEA UK charter airline has been backed in its buy-out by 3i, the investment capital group, and Air Malta. Both 3i and the Maltese national airline are taking a 30 per cent stake each in Excalibur Airways, with the former TEA UK management team taking the remaining 40 per cent. Mr Albert Mizzi, Air Malta's chairman, said yesterday his airline had been seeking to invest in another carrier. Excalibur Airways is to start operations in May with two A320s based at London Gatwick and one at Manchester international airport. The airline, whose headquarters is East Midlands international airport, expects to carry half a million passengers in its first 12 months and is planning to expand its fleet next year. Excalibur is leasing the three A320s from GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group. The three aircraft are together worth about Pounds 85m. Master of good timing, Page 25</p>

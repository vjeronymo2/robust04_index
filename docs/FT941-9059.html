			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: European turnover peaks in January It might have been time for equity investors to pull their horns in, after an extremely profitable 1993. In fact, January saw European bourse turnover go from strength to strength. The numbers showed vigorous growth for the second month in succession, up 15.3 per cent over December for the eight markets monitored by NatWest Securities, after gains of 12.2 per cent in December and 2.9 per cent in November. Aggregate turnover hit a record high for the period since NatWest started compiling the figures in the late 1980s. Mr James Cornish, European market strategist with the brokers, notes that the January growth accompanied a 3.8 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries Europe index in January, as markets prolonged their year-end rally on hopes of a further cut in German interest rates. International investment activity climbed again after an apparent decline in December: volume in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London rose 16.4 per cent in January after a 2 per cent fall the month before. There had been a flood of domestic liquidity in December, and the US concentration on Far Eastern and other emerging markets in the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, says Mr Cornish, French investors had a direct tax incentive to invest in their own market before the end of last year, and German investors were on a deadline, too, if they wanted to avoid fiscal punishment for bringing their money back from Luxembourg. The market which probably believed least in the prospect of a Bundesbank interest rate cut in January was Germany itself, where equities fell by 1.8 per cent and turnover showed the smallest rise of the month, up 3.9 per cent. Elsewhere, there were sizeable advances, with the Netherlands in the lead, up 37.8 per cent on the month. Mr Cornish says that a number of individual stories gave volume an extra lift: in the Nedlloyd shipping group, on share price considerations; and in Hoogovens, on aluminium price prospects. The Netherlands, too, reflected directly the return of international investors. There was some large-scale dealing in London, says NatWest, but Seaq international volume fell as a proportion of the domestic market, suggesting considerable activity by US institutions dealing directly in Amsterdam. The other top countries included Italy, up 30.3 per cent in turnover terms and 49.9 per cent ahead of the average of the previous three months, as the Milan market pushed up by 6.9 per cent and confidence rose in the political situation. Switzerland registered an 8 per cent gain in share prices and turnover up 26.8 per cent. This may have been a surprise for the strategists. The Swiss stock market has had three excellent years, and even its fans thought the time for some extended profit-taking had arrived at the beginning of 1994. As it happens, this was delayed until the first full week of February, last week, when the Swiss market led Europe down with a loss of 5.7 per cent, only Italy standing out against the general downtrend in share prices. This, it seems, has finally reflected itself in bourse activity. 'Volumes,' says Mr Cornish, 'have been falling so far in February as the going gets tougher.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              Oct       Nov       Dec       Jan           US                    1993      1993      1993      1994    dollarsbn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           77.87     78.39     91.60    107.56         3.00 France           201.93    191.05    218.65    251.96        42.58 Germany          183.24    177.99    211.05    219.29       125.74 Italy          31,410.0  35,092.8  41,385.6  53,924.0        31.76 Netherlands       25.10     27.20     25.40     35.00        17.92 Spain          1,042.89   1,384.6   1,267.5  1,521.82        10.81 Switzerland       28.30     29.60     31.30     39.70        27.07 UK                49.32     52.61     55.79     65.31        98.03  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

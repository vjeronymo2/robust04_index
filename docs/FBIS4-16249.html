			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM-TASS correspondent Larisa Lazar] </F>   [Text] Minsk 15 April, TASS -- Byelorussia [Belarus] is  deeply concerned about the new aggravation of the situation in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, caused by the NATO air raids on Bosnian  Serb positions near Gorazde.    The republican government stresses in a statement, released  on Thursday, that the "Belarus Republic again declares its  consistent adherence to peaceful methods for settling the  conflict. In light of the recent positive tendencies towards  the solution of outstanding problems through negotiations, any  escalation of armed interference will by no means contribute to  the stabilisation of the situation on the Balkans and may entail  unpredictable consequences.    "Belarus holds that it is the prerogative of the U.N.  Security Council to make decisions on the use of armed force to  settle differences among the conflicting sides in Bosnia and  Herzegovina.    "Taking into account the dangerous consequences of the armed  confrontation," the statement says, "Belarus urges all the sides  involved in the conflict to stop hostilities and to continue  negotiation in order to achieve peace on the territory of former  Yugoslavia," according to the document.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Live animal trade curbs urged The European Commission is facing calls from animal welfare groups to restrict the trade in live animals between member countries as it prepares a transit directive for discussion at the next meeting of agriculture ministers on December 13. Pressure groups throughout Europe have formed a committee to urge the commission to lower maximum journey times for animals sent to slaughter across country borders. Livestock can currently travel for 24 hours non-stop across the European Union although the UK imposes its own limit of 15 hours before lorries have to stop to feed and water the animals. Animal welfare campaigners are calling for journey times to be cut to 8 hours, although the Germans want to go further and impose a 6-hour limit on journeys. Denmark and the Netherlands are believed to be sympathetic to the proposals. In Britain, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been running a series of emotive advertisements about conditions experienced by UK lambs heading for the continent. 'Before they're roasted in garlic and rosemary, they're soaked in urine and excrement,' runs the text of one. 'We have scientific evidence that shows journey times over 8 hours cause significant stress in the animals,' an official said. The RSPCA says public opinion over the transport of live animals is running high, but it has so far received little support from the UK government for its campaign. Separately, Labour MPs have joined the RSPCA in calling on Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, to ban the export of lambs from the UK to Spain following revelations about inhumane conditions in abattoirs. Although it costs more to transport live animals than carcases, the trade in living animals, particularly shipments of lambs from the UK to France and Spain, has grown in recent years. Exporters have been encouraged by demand for live lambs in France following shortfalls in home production. If lambs are slaughtered in French abattoirs, they can be classed as home-produced and command higher prices than imported carcases. This can more than cover the costs of exporting. The trade in live animals from the UK, particularly sheep, destined for slaughter has grown from around 2m animals last year to an estimated 3m this year following changes in rules that made exports more competitive. The UK lifted a ban on the export of live lambs to Spain at the beginning of the year with the introduction of the EU's single market. The government is fighting a claim for damages of more than Pounds 1m from Hedley Lomas, an Irish exporter based in the UK, which was refused export licences for live sheep from 1990 to 1992. The RSPCA says the government could act unilaterally to ban the export of live animals to Spain again on moral grounds. The UK government says the commission must enforce rules on slaughter methods in Spanish abattoirs.</p>

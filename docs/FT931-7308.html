			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson criticises moves on ERM LORD LAWSON, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday criticised the government for failing to consult the German central bank before taking sterling into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Giving evidence to the Commons' foreign affairs committee, Lord Lawson said that failure to agree a level for sterling with the Bundesbank ahead of entry contributed to Britain's forced withdrawal last year from the semi-fixed currency grid. 'In 1990 there was no agreement of the rate at all,' he said. 'The Germans had to take it or leave it. That was not a sensible basis.' Lord Lawson, who was chancellor for six years under Mrs Margaret Thatcher, said he had reached a tacit agreement with the Bundesbank when he was preparing sterling's entry in 1985. Thatcher vetoed the move. When Britain finally joined the ERM in October 1990 under his successor as chancellor Mr John Major, the Bundesbank thought the level was too high and was not prepared to support sterling when it came under intense pressure from speculators, he added. Lord Lawson, who resigned as chancellor in October 1989 in part over disagreements with Mrs Thatcher on sterling's ERM entry and other economic issues, called last September's ERM withdrawal a 'humiliation and a defeat for Britain'. He said it led to a collapse in confidence within the British economy, adding that he would agree with pundits who dubbed the day 'Black Wednesday'.</p>

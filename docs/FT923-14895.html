			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Britain to review role in EFA: Treasury fears German withdrawal will lift cost of European joint venture A CABINET battle over the European Fighter Aircraft was foreshadowed yesterday as the government confirmed it was reviewing the Pounds 20bn project's future following Germany's refusal to give the go-ahead for the aircraft's production. Treasury ministers are putting strong pressure on the Ministry of Defence to reappraise its needs in the light of the extra cost involved if Germany pulls out. Downing Street is saying any cabinet decision has to await clarification of Germany's intentions but the row is already reviving painful echoes of the 1986 cabinet crisis over the Westland helicopter company. Then the conflict was also over a European versus US project, over Britain's strategic defence requirements, and over support for British industry. About 40,000 jobs would be at risk if EFA collapsed. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is fighting hard to save the project and would be backed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Rifkind will meet Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, on Monday and reinforce attempts by Mr John Major to persuade Germany to reconsider. Meetings with the Spanish and Italian governments, also partners in the project, will follow. Britain argues that Germany's plans for a cheaper fighter are not feasible. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, wants the tightest grip possible on public spending and would insist on a full review of the EFA project. Other cabinet ministers who fear spending squeezes may be anxious for the defence budget to be cut instead. Mr Heseltine denied a cabinet split. He said: 'The cabinet will come to a decision on these matters in the light of the advice that we get. We haven't yet had the advice so it is not possible for us to be divided about it.' The MoD, which is working on revised cost estimates, concedes that with three partners instead of four, costs will escalate - mostly because of the withdrawal of German capital investment in production. But it says the project should remain within the original budget, helped by savings from fewer production lines. Delays in developing EFA have already forced the MoD to postpone a decision on who should supply a new medium range surface-to-air missile (MSAM) system worth at least Pounds 500m. The MoD said the postponement was the result of administrative problems with EFA and difficulties with the aircraft's flight control systems. It underlines how much EFA has become part of UK defence strategy: its delay or cancellation would have a knock-on effect on other defence contracts. Lex, Page 24</p>

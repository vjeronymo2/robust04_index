			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Daily Mail declines 5% to Pounds 22.8m SHARPLY LOWER input from exceptional items resulted in a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust in the six months to March 31. Sales rose from Pounds 313.3m to Pounds 326.7m, but after a reduced exceptional credit of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 8.7m) the pre-tax figure was Pounds 22.8m, against Pounds 23.9m in the previous first half. The reduced exceptional mainly reflected lower sales of Reuters shares. Newspapers increased their contribution to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 28.3m). The group's three main titles, published by Associated Newspapers, are the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard. The performance benefited from increased revenues from circulation and display advertising combined with lower raw materials costs. The group also includes Northcliffe Newspapers, Euromoney Publications and Harmsworth Media. Trading profit of other media activities jumped to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 700,000) on sales of Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 27.9m). Revenues increased from Euromoney magazines and contributions improved from new areas such as energy, law and tax publications. Other activities lost Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 200,000 profit) on lower turnover of Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 22.7m). Income from associated undertakings fell due to lower trading profits at Bristol Evening Post and Whittle Communications in the US. The pre-tax figure also included the sale of the company's wharf in Purfleet, east London, which produced a profit of Pounds 10.4m. However, there was also a property provision of Pounds 8.1m reflecting the state of the London office property market. Net borrowings fell Pounds 8m since the year end to Pounds 370m at March 31. An extraordinary item of Pounds 5.5m accounted for the sale of Argus Shield, the security services business, to Pinkertons of the US and Adverkit, the graphics arts business. The interim dividend is 32p (29p) on earnings of 155.2p (196.3p) per share.</p>

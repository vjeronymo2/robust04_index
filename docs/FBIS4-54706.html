			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting of the Solidarity Hard-Coal Council has  been held in Katowice. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski  took part in the meeting, which ended in the early hours of the  morning.    [Correspondent Witold Orzech] The trade unionists have sent  a  letter to Trade and Industry Minister Marek Pol, registering  their vote of no-confidence in the boards of all coal companies.  They think that the boards are not coping with the current  situation. The Miners Solidarity has also called on the minister  to take measures aimed at removing the causes of conflicts and  tensions in the mining industry.    The hard-coal miners' assessment of the agreement between  their colleagues in the lignite-mining industry and the  government was sceptical. They adopted a resolution that the  strike at 16 hard-coal mines in Katowice province and three zinc  and lead mines should continue.    Karol Luzniak, the hard-coal section chairman, announced  that  miners from several other mines will join the strike starting at  0600.    Marian Krzaklewski expressed the hope that the national  industrial action starting today will prove successful for both  Solidarity and the government, that the strike will make the  government understand that it should not aim at confrontation  with the union. As a result, when the government finally comes  to understand this, [Finance Minister] Mr. Kolodko will have not  60 but 120 or more days of peace, Marian Krzaklewski said. He  did not rule out the possibility of using the strike fund for  payouts to strike participants.</p>

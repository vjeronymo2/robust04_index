			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ANDREWS SISTER THINKS YOUNG  </P> <P> Maxene Andrews, one-third of the boogie-woogie Andrews Sisters, is singing the  praises of staying youthful by staying active.  </P> <P> "People say to me, 'When are you going to retire, Maxene?' I say, 'Well, when I  retire, you'll only know I'm retired when you see them carrying me off the  stage,' " the 72-year-old singer said this week during a visit to Nebraska.  </P> <P> While in Nebraska she will make speeches, including one at a dance to raise  money for senior centers.  </P> <P> "I love doing these things," Andrews said. "I talk to them (senior citizens)  about not getting old, if you know what I mean. Just because you've passed that  mark, you don't have to think that the world is leaving you behind."  </P></p>

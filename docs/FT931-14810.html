			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Haitian avalanche 'ready to fall on US' AN EXPECTED 'massive influx' of Haitians may be one of the first foreign policy crises President-elect Bill Clinton has to face, Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, said yesterday, AP reports. 'The evidence is there that thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of Haitians are in fact preparing to descend upon Florida' as soon as Mr Clinton takes office, Mr Cheney said. Meanwhile, Haiti's deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is urging his country's military-backed government to accept a large force of international observers to restore order in the Caribbean nation and prevent a mass exodus. US officials said on Wednesday that Mr Aristide was sending a letter to Haiti's rulers in an attempt to break the logjam in international efforts to restore the democratically elected president to power. Aides to Mr Aristide said the letter - written under pressure from the Bush administration and Clinton associates - would be conveyed to the heads of the Organisation of American States and of the United Nations. The OAS will send an emissary with the letter to Haiti's government in Port-au-Prince, said Mr Michael Barnes, a former congressman and now council to Mr Aristide. Mr Barnes said the letter would call for the immediate dispatch of hundreds of UN and OAS observers to oversee the restoration of order and civil rights. It would also call for Haiti's parliament to approve an interim prime minister who would work for Mr Aristide's return. Once parliament approved the interim prime minister, the US and its allies would lift the trade embargo they imposed on Haiti after Mr Aristide was ousted by a military coup in September 1991. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state-designate, said at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that the intensive efforts to bring about an agreement in Haiti 'are quite promising this week'.</p>

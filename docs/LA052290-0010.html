			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ASTRONOMER'S VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE;  </P> <P> ASTRONOMER BY CHANCE BY BERNARD LOVELL BASIC BOOKS $24.95, 381 PAGES  </P> <P> For more than a decade now, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has sponsored the  publication of first-person books (I hesitate to call them autobiographies) by  major scientists, who have written about their lives, their work, the practice  of science, the nature of knowledge and what they've learned along the way.  </P> <P> Almost all of them have been very good books, distinguished by their warmth,  eloquence and richness of tone. Freeman Dyson's "Disturbing the Universe," the  first in the series, set a high standard of personal and scientific insight.  Lewis Thomas' "The Youngest Science," Francois Jacob's "The Statue Within" and  Francis Crick's "What Mad Pursuit" have been among the best first-person books  by scientists in recent years. (Jacob's book was particularly unusual in that  the author, a French Nobel Prize laureate in medicine, did not discuss his  scientific work until nearly three-quarters of the way through. Nonetheless --  or as a result? -- the book was riveting.)  </P> <P> "Astronomer by Chance," Bernard Lovell's story of his life as a physicist,  radiophysicist and astronomer, is the 15th book in the Sloan series, and it is  as good as the rest. Lovell, the founder of Jodrell Bank, Britain's center of  radioastronomy, speaks in the now-familiar voice of a successful scientist. He  writes with awe about the scientific enterprise and about the ability to know  the universe by reason. But that's not all he has to say on that subject.  </P> <P> The Sloan books have varied in approach and style, but they have all looked at  the world through the eyes of the Enlightenment. They tend to be reverential  about science and the scientific method. Reason is the way to knowledge.  Liberal discourse between well-intentioned people acting in good faith leads to  the truth -- or at least gets you closer to it.  </P> <P> In a sense, this remains the central belief of our age, and there is much  evidence to support it. Lovell writes from within this tradition. It infuses  his reasonable prose. But he also writes with another voice:  </P> <P> "The arrogant belief prevalent in my youth in the ultimate power of science to  explain the universe and all that lies within has passed with the experience  that the search for solutions uncovers ever deeper mysteries. Today the world  of the scientist is less hostile to the view that science does not have the  sole prerogative of acquiring ultimate knowledge."  </P> <P> Toward the end of the book, in the chapter titled, "My Life and Thought,"  Lovell tells us of his interest in "the interfacing regions of theology,  philosophy, and science." He acknowledges that readers may be surprised to hear  him say it, given the general tone and view of the book so far, but, he says,  "science has never claimed the whole of my existence."  </P> <P> A discussion of theology ensues, with references to the writings of Karl Barth,  Paul Tillich and Alfred North Whitehead. "Perhaps as I age I shall agree more  and more with Paul Tillich that God is Being itself," Lovell writes. He goes on  for a few paragraphs to explain this. Readers interested in the details may  turn to Pages 353 and following for a full discussion of the matter.  </P> <P> But I'm misleading you. Most of the book doesn't have anything to do with  theology. Most of it has to do with the development of radioastronomy, whose  findings have opened conundrums that are at the heart of modern astrophysics  and cosmology. As in many areas of science, our ability to gather data about  the structure of the universe outstrips our ability to put it together in a  coherent account.  </P> <P> Lovell, who was born in 1913, was an undergraduate physics student at the  University of Bristol when the revolution in physics got going. He saw  certainty give way to uncertainty. In his first two years at Bristol, he went  to lectures in classical physics. In his last two years, he went to lectures in  quantum mechanics.  </P> <P> "The superb clarity and beauty of these lectures remain a vivid memory," Lovell  recalls. "The determinate and certain world of common experience disappeared  before our eyes as the probability functions of the wave equations became the  new world of science that we were to inherit."  </P> <P> He spent World War II helping to develop radar, and then wound up with  equipment that he deposited at Jodrell Bank, a tract of land provided by a  botanist colleague at the University of Manchester.  </P> <P> Lovell's eye for detail and memory for vignettes add texture to his measured  and considered prose. There is much to learn here.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton: The Secret  Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama Sutra, and Brought  the Arabian Nights to the West" by Edward Rice.  </P></p>

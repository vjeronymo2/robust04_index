			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / French left discovers green bolthole: But political re-grouping spells trouble for recently formed ecologist coalition - Assemblee Nationale Election '93 MR BRICE Lalonde, the energetic head of Generation Ecologie, is plastered all over the French press these days. He is pictured breakfasting with his children for Paris-Match, cycling with his wife in Le Nouvel Observateur, and even sniffing a spring of parsley on the cover of VSD. The publicity is scarcely surprising. Mr Lalonde, 47, who resigned last year as socialist environment minister, is a pivotal figure in the French electoral campaign. Some polls suggest that GE's alliance with the idealistic Greens could win second place, ahead of the socialists and behind the conservatives, in next month's parliamentary elections. Mr Lalonde is also in the limelight as a central player in the 'political big bang' announced last week by Mr Michel Rocard, former premier, to create a centre-left coalition of socialists and ecologists. Until now, Mr Lalonde has steered an independent path, spurning the socialists' suggestions of an electoral alliance and flirting inconclusively with the conservatives, but he has been much more positive in his response to Mr Rocard, the man who appointed him to the French cabinet in 1988. Mr Antoine Waechter, 44, head of the Greens, immediately rejected the Rocard proposals. Mr Lalonde praised his former boss and cordially invited him to join GE in the current campaign. The split between Mr Lalonde and Mr Waechter over the Rocard plan is the first significant sign of strain between the two ecologist parties since the start of the parliamentary campaign and could mark the return of their old rivalry. The Green party was the dominant force in French environmentalism until Mr Lalonde formed GE in 1990. But whereas the Green party sees itself as an ideological movement, GE is a product of contemporary French politics. It is committed to environmental issues. Mr Lalonde, former head of Friends of the Earth, left the cabinet after a row over conservation. But GE is far less radical than the Green party in key areas, notably nuclear power, where it advocates tighter regulation of waste, rather than an outright ban. Mr Lalonde has cleverly positioned it as a bolthole for socialist sympathisers who are disillusioned with their own scandal-scarred party after a decade in power, but who can not bring themselves to vote conservative. Even before the Rocard plan he made no secret of his hopes that GE would eventually be a linchpin in re-grouping of the French left. Until recently the two ecologist parties were at loggerheads. The crunch came at last year's regional elections when they clashed in separate campaigns and won a combined 14 per cent of the vote, a significant advance on the Greens' 3.8 per cent in the 1988 parliamentary elections and even on their 10.6 per cent in the 1989 European elections. Mr Waechter, well aware that other ambitious Greens, such as Ms Dominique Voynet, the 34-year-old party spokeswoman, were snapping at his heels, agreed in November to join forces with GE for the parliamentary poll. So far the campaign has gone smoothly. Mr Lalonde, Mr Waechter and, increasingly, Ms Voynet, have presented a united front. There have been no ideological squabbles, possibly because the emphasis of campaigning has been on possible liaison with the established parties, rather than on the ecologists' own policies. The ecologists have also benefited from the steady stream of scandals and gloomy economic news that has haunted the socialists. The latest polls give theecologists 15-20 per cent of the vote, leaving them, thanks to idiosyncracies of the French electoral system, with between 2 and 12 of the 577 parliamentary seats. The pollsters have not yet had a chance to gauge the impact of Mr Rocard's proposals. The ecologists are confident it will give them another boost in the polls. It may well do so. But once the elections are over and Mr Rocard starts to assemble his alliance, his 'political big bang' may prove just as explosive to the ecologists' coalition, as to his prime target, the socialists. Brice Lalonde, 47, Parisian journalist who founded Generation Ecologie in 1990. Previously in mainstream politics as the Socialists' environment minister. Stormed out of cabinet last year, in protest at its conservation policy. Has since concentrated on GE, helped by his wife, Patricia, his communications director. Greens see him as political opportunist. Antoine Waechter, 44, classic product of 1968 student riots, now heads the Greens and embodies idealistic side of French environmentalism. Was president of the local nature group at 16 and read ecology at university. After career in environmentalism, now faces toughest challenge. Has to stave off threat from Generation Ecologie, and from within his own party.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / German coalition falls into disarray ATTEMPTS by Germany's governing coalition to elect Mr Steffen Heitmann as president were thrown into disarray at the weekend when the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner, implicitly rejected him as a candidate, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. Without support by the FDP, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, its sister party in Bavaria, could not gain a majority of votes in a special congress convened next May to chose a successor to Mr Richard Von Weizsacker. The opposition Social Democrats have already nominated Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and FDP leader, said in an interview at the weekend that 'Heitmann is not our man.' Mr Heitmann is justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony. The FDP, backed by many women deputies in the Bundestag or Lower House, is increasingly swinging behind Ms Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, the author and former secretary of state at the foreign ministry. The party had earlier asked Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, but he refused. Although Ms Hamm-Brucher, 72, is not from eastern Germany, she is seen as someone who would help the psychological integration of the two Germanies in Europe. The FDP's reluctance to support the government stems from Mr Heitmann's views over Europe, in which he criticised the way in which the Maastricht Treaty has been imposed on the member states of the EC. The party is also deeply sceptical about his views on German unification. Mr Kohl had chosen Mr Heitmann because he is from eastern Germany. But officials in Saxony conceded it was a mistake. 'This is a token gesture for the east Germans, who increasingly feel bitter about how they are being used in this campaign,' a Saxon government official said.</p>

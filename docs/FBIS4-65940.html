			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rm."-attributed commentary: "A Lesson"] </F>   [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is  complaining loudly about the fact that its candidate, [Johannes]  Rau, will not be the president, although he is more popular  among the people than Herzog. An inappropriate complaint. If  the Basic Law had wanted the person with more adherents among  the people to become head of state, it would have been written  there: The president is elected by the people. However, our  constitution entrusted a representative body with the election,  the Federal Assembly. If the German state wants to introduce  the election of the president by the people, it can do so  anytime. Those who advocate it do not want "a new republic" for  that reason alone, as the chancellor thinks. However, what the  Basic Law determines today is valid today. This should also be  the guideline for criticism from a party whose candidate was  defeated in the presidential election.    Losing hurts. How hard it was for Rau to get over the defeat  in the vote is indicated by his reproach that part of the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] was not interested in electing  the right candidate. That can only mean that he, Rau, is the  right candidate. Apparently, such propaganda for oneself is  part of the last ramifications of the first presidential  election campaign that our state went through. The parties  struggled; but the candidates also struggled, as if the last  vote had to be pressed out of the reservoir of voters in the  countries. In these weeks, what the president's office requires  and what has to be demanded of its bearer is being rehashed  everywhere in a conformist way. However, one does not hear  anywhere what would have to be said above all after the  experiences of the year 1984 and again since last autumn: The  office of president is nothing that one may strive for like a  Bundestag mandate, a ministerial office, or a state secretary's  post. It is not suited to be the subject of a career plan.  Therefore, it cannot be found in books that are entitled "How To  Work One's Way Up" or "The Road to the Top."    Readiness is the only thing that someone whom a party wants  to be its candidate should have. He is to wait patiently until  the election act in the Federal Assembly; every word in public  that he does not speak in this time is gold, for, afterward, the  person who has been elected will not be intoxicated with his  victory and the person who has not been elected will not be  depressed.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Bonds: Mortgage-backed deal revives investor interest AN unusual mortgage-backed offering, structured to assuage the credit concerns which have dogged the sector, revived interest in the sterling mortgage-backed market yesterday. The Pounds 170m deal was backed by mortgages originated by Union de Credit pour le Batiment (UCB), the UK mortgage arm of Companie Bancaire, the French financial services group. Dealers said it met strong demand, due to the shortage of paper in the market and attractive pricing of both public tranches of the issue. The deal is the first securitisation of UCB's mortgage book, which totals Pounds 4bn, and is designed to allow the company to increase its business in the UK mortgage market by freeing up capital. However, there is speculation that other foreign mortgage lenders who want to pull out of the market are also looking at securitisation. The sterling mortgage-backed market has been hit by growing credit concerns, due to the high default rate as the UK housing market continues to sink. Credit concerns have been heightened by the difficulties faced by pool insurance providers such as Sun Alliance and Eagle Star, since many deals were structured so that their triple-A ratings were based on the credit quality of the insurance. The UCB deal, dubbed LEO 1, does not rely on pool insurance for its triple-A credit rating, but on its subordinated structure. The deal was divided into three tranches; the third tranche consists of Pounds 12m of subordinated notes. In the sterling bond market, Hammerson Property, the UK property group, became the third borrower in a week to tap the long-dated sterling market. Dealers said the market, with its small investor base of UK institutions, mainly insurance companies, was becoming overloaded with paper. The unsecured bonds were priced to yield 227 basis points above the comparable gilt.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Private coal company in rescue bid BUDGE Mining, the UK's biggest private coal producer, yesterday said it wanted to talk to the government about a plan to save 'a significant number' of the 31 collieries earmarked for closure. The company, based in Retford, Nottinghamshire, said it had the backing of a number of leading financial institutions. Mr Richard Budge, company managing director, said the proposals had already been put informally to British Coal and the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Budge has been known to be interested in buying into British Coal for some time and has said he was prepared to buy the whole corporation. His company - which employs about 1,000 people - is part of the consortium put together by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers to bid for 25 per cent of the corporation.</p>

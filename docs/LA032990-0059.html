			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRINGTON TAKES JOB AT COLORADO;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CS LONG BEACH COACH SAYS HE WANTED A CHANCE TO COACH IN THE  BIG EIGHT.  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said Wednesday night that he has  accepted an offer to become the basketball coach at the University of Colorado.  </P> <P> "I did it for two reasons," Harrington said. "For a chance to coach in the Big  Eight, a great basketball conference, and because Colorado reminds me of where  I went to school, at the University of Maryland."  </P> <P> Harrington, 44, who went to Long Beach from George Mason University in Fairfax,  Va., was 53-36 in three seasons with the 49ers, turning around a program that  had been down for years.  </P> <P> This season he guided Long Beach to a 23-9 record -- its best in 16 years --  and a National Invitation Tournament appearance.  </P> <P> Harrington had a second interview at Colorado Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "It's a situation similar to the one I had when I took over at Long Beach,"  Harrington said. "They (Colorado's team) have been last in the conference the  last five years."  </P> <P> Harrington, who replaces Tom Miller at Colorado, had also been a leading  candidate for the coaching job at the University of Miami.  </P> <P> Harrington did not say whether he received an offer from that school, but said,  "I could have gone to Miami. I had a choice."  </P> <P> The Miami job, which includes a shoe contract, was reportedly worth $200,000,  almost three times what Harrington made at Long Beach.  </P> <P> He did not reveal the terms of his Colorado contract, but said it was  comparable to the salary at Miami.  </P> <P> "It wasn't easy to leave Long Beach," he said by phone from Denver. "But this  is what I've worked for, to coach at a place like this. I just couldn't pass it  up."  </P> <P> Long Beach Athletic Director Corey Johnson said a decision on a new coach may  be made today.  </P> <P> Seth Greenberg, who has been Harrington's assistant, would appear to be the top  candidate.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- People for Nuclear  Disarmament, an anti-nuke organisation of Australia, sent  letters to Russian and Japanese ambassadors to Australia some  time ago in protest against the dumping of a large quantity of  nuclear waste in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific by these  countries.    The letter to the Russian ambassador said that the  irresponsible acts in throwing 900 tons of nuclear waste from a  nuclear submarine base near Vladivostok into the East Sea of  Korea on October 17, 1993 are arousing deep apprehensions among  the Korean people and their neighbouring countries.    The nuclear waste poses a grave threat to the health and  existence of the peoples of Korea and neighbouring countries,  the letter said, urging a stop to the dumping of nuclear waste  in the sea for the stable life of mankind and for the protection  of the ecological environment of the sea.    The letter to the Japanese ambassador recalled that Japan  started dumping radioactive substances in the sea from 1955 and  had thrown 1,661 200-litre drums packed with venomous wastes  into surrounding seas in the period from 1959 to 1969. It  strongly urged an immediate halt to such dangerous acts.</p>

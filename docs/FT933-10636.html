			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Germany Those who suspected that the Bundesbank was never keen on the single currency project will doubtless view the events of the past week as significant. Germany is now free to pursue an anti-inflationary policy in support of the D-Mark without a gaggle of aspirant strong currencies struggling in its wake, which is probably what some in Frankfurt wanted all along. The effective collapse of the ERM will in all probability slow the pace of German rate cuts. THis is in part because the massive intervention in support of the ERM will make the money supply data pretty grim reading in the next few months. But the recession is still biting deep in Germany. Inflationary pressures, and interest rates, will be easing by the autumn. As with the UK, the appreciation of the D-Mark will be at least partly offset by stronger export markets. Indeed, exports are likely to lead the German recovery next year, especially as the D-Mark has been been falling against a strong dollar and stronger yen in 1993. Other components of growth will, however, offer little help. The public sector deficit is already too high, while wage growth will be sluggish, limiting domestic consumption. And with capacity utilisation low, there is little incentive to invest in plant. Exporters may thus be the most attractive area of the stock market, whatever the short-term rise in the currency may suggest.</p>

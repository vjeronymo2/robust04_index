			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima 24 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori called U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal  to Congress that U.S. support to Peru for the detection of drug  trafficking from the air be reestablished positive. Fujimori  said, however, that "with or without support," Peru is carrying  out a firm and constant struggle against drug trafficking.    He recalled that the contribution made by the U.S. AWACS and  Orion airplanes with modern equipment for detecting airplanes  had been very effective when they were cooperating with the  Peruvian Air Force, until May when the U.S. Government decided  to withdraw that support.    In a news conference, Fujimori said that with that help,  "our  airplanes were able to persecute and shoot down" the airplanes  of Colombian drug traffickers entering the Peruvian jungle  region to pick up the basic cocaine paste gathered by drug  traffickers. Fujimori added that the U.S. radar installed in  the jungle region, which was also deactivated, was not effective  as it is obsolete equipment used during World War II.    He said that the reestablishment of the aid for detecting  the  airplanes of drug traffickers would be a positive step. He  reiterated that the struggle against drug trafficking is an  international problem, which is the responsibility of drug  producing and consuming countries.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTING: ESPRESSO MACHINES POUPLAR GIFTS  </P> <P> Almost all of the espresso machines on the market can be divided into two  categories: steam systems and pump systems. Because these appliances are so  often bought as Christmas gifts, they are timely candidates for this column.  </P> <P> Six steam units and eight pump units were borrowed from their manufacturers for  evaluation. The 14 machines included models manufactured in Italy, Switzerland,  Taiwan and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Prices of the units range from $66 to $500. (Dollar amounts listed are  suggested retail prices; units can often be purchased at reduced prices.)  Although machines within each of the two categories operate similarly, there  are subtle differences and it's important to read and follow the manufacturer's  instructions.  </P> <P> Steam units currently account for about 70% of espresso machine sales in this  country. They are the least expensive, ranging from $66 to $200.  </P> <P> In steam machines, water heats in a chamber until enough pressure has built up  to force it through the ground coffee. In most steam machines, the entire  amount of water in the chamber flows through at once.  </P> <P> These units produce coffee that is denser than that made in a drip or filter  coffee maker, but do not produce the crema, or tan-colored foam, that is a sign  of high-quality espresso (Please see Tips for Using an Espresso Machine on Page  47 for a full explanation). Steam produced by these machines typically  increases the volume of 1/4 cup of milk to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.  </P> <P> Five of the six steam machines tested offered the option of producing either  two or four cups of espresso, plus steam for frothing milk to make cappuccino.  The sixth unit, Neon Cafe Amore, had the capability of producing from one to  six cups of espresso plus steam.  </P> <P> Only one of the machines provided much space for overflow. This is not a  problem when the coffee flows into a carafe, but it can be when a two-cup  adapter is used and the unit produces more than two cups of liquid. It was also  a problem when the coffee valve on one Neon Cafe Amore machine malfunctioned.  </P> <P> Pump machines are more expensive than steam machines ($235 to $500). In these  units water is stored in a reservoir then heated and sent under pressure  through the coffee grounds. Pump machines offer the option of making one or two  cups of espresso at a time. The steam generated by these machines typically  increases the volume of a 1/4 cup of milk from 1/2 to a full cup.  </P> <P> All of the units tested had good overflow space and removable drip trays. This  is important since the machines tend to drip water and coffee.  </P> <P> For optimum flavor, the temperature of the water should be just below boiling  when it comes in contact with the coffee grounds.  </P> <P> CONCLUSIONS:  </P> <P> It takes time and experimentation to produce the best espresso/cappuccino from  any machine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions plus the guidelines on Page  47 for selecting and grinding coffee.  </P> <P> If you truly care about good espresso, you won't be satisfied with a steam  machine, even though they are less expensive, easy to use and typically have  fewer mechanical problems. They cannot produce a high-quality espresso with  crema, so are best used for making cappuccino.  </P> <P> Pump machines produce better to excellent quality espresso with crema. These  are higher in price, more complicated and messier to use and subject to more  mechanical problems.  </P> <P> EVALUATION:  </P> <P> With the exception of units that had mechanical problems, all machines were  tested several times, following the manufacturer's directions as closely as  possible.  </P> <P> STEAM SYSTEM MACHINES  </P> <P> BRAUN ESPRESSO MASTER (7) -- Makes two or four cups espresso. To prepare  cappuccino, half the espresso is brewed, the milk is steamed by moving a lever  to the steam-only setting, then returned so the remaining espresso is brewed.

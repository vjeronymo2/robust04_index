			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Federal Aviation Regulations in parts 121 and 135 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations contain rules which specify training program requirements for air carriers and certain commercial operators. Those rules specify the qualification requirements of crewmembers, flight and simulator instructors, check airmen, aircraft dispatchers, and other operations personnel. The most detailed and rigorous training and qualification requirements are those contained in subparts N and O of part 121. Although subparts N and O have been amended a number of times in recent years, most of the amendments concern the use of simulators, training devices, or specific training requirements such as security and the transportation of hazardous materials. No comprehensive changes have been made to these subparts since December 1969. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA's most immediate concerns regarding the training and qualification regulations in part 121 and part 135 are twofold. First, compared to part 121 training regulations, part 135 training regulations do not provide a balanced mix of training and checking. Second, current parts 121 and 135 training regulations do not incorporate recent knowledge about the significance of human performance factors (e.g., communication, decision-making, leadership, management) in safe flight operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December, 1986, in response to a Safety Recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the FAA specifically addressed the human factors training issue by initiating an aviation behavioral technology program. This ongoing program consists of projects that, among other things, increase the use of line operational simulations (LOS) to improve cockpit/cabin communication and coordination skills, and pilot decision-making skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June 1988, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A&hyph;88&hyph;71 concerning CRM training. The NTSB issued the recommendation as a result of a Northwest Airlines crash on August 16, 1987, in which 148 passengers, 6 crewmembers, and 2 people on the ground were killed. The NTSB noted that both pilots had received single-crewmember training during their last simulator training and proficiency checks and the last CRM training they had both received was 3.5 hours of ground school (general) CRM training in 1983. The NTSB implied that the accident might have been prevented had the flight crew received adequate CRM training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After soliciting ideas from other government agencies and from the aviation community, the FAA published a proposed Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) and accompanying draft advisory circular (AC) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (54 FR 7670, February 22, 1989). These documents proposed a voluntary, alternative method of complying with the training requirements in current regulations. The voluntary alternative training is called an ``advanced qualification program'' (AQP). After considering comments received, the FAA issued a final SFAR 58, Advanced Qualification Program, and an accompanying advisory circular (55 FR 40262, October 2, 1990). This voluntary program applies to certificate holders operating under part 121 or part 135 who elect the alternative requirements of AQP which includes CRM training and evaluation, increased use of LOS, use of training centers, and the evaluation of flight training devices and flight simulators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To date, the larger and more sophisticated air carriers have taken advantage of the voluntary program. The FAA expects this to be the case for the foreseeable future. The FAA recognizes that many operators, particularly smaller operators, may be unable to take advantage of the voluntary program. Since these operators will elect not to participate in the voluntary AQP program and will instead comply with current training requirements in parts 121 and 135, the FAA proposes to amend the current training requirements of parts 121 and 135 to address the most immediate concerns regarding improved aircrew training and qualification standards. In particular, all certificate holders operating under part 121, and those certificate holders operating under part 135 who are authorized or required to follow part 121 training and qualification requirements, would be required to include CRM in their training programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another recommendation from other government agencies and the aviation community was that commuter air carriers conducting operations under part 135 with airplanes that require two pilot crewmembers should also be required to comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of part 121. Many regional air carriers operate under both parts 121 and 135. The Regional Airline Association, on December 10, 1991, petitioned the FAA for an exemption to allow its members to train, check, and qualify their pilots under part 121 rather than under part 135. The FAA granted exemption No. 5450 on May 8, 1992, and now over 60% of those certificate holders that operate under both parts 121 and 135 have obtained approval to train, check, and qualify their pilots pursuant to part 121. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has issued two NPRM's that are relevant to this rulemaking. Notice No. 92&hyph;10 (57 FR 35888, August 11, 1992) relates to the use of training centers by certificate holders who do not elect to come under an AQP. The second NPRM, Notice No. 93&hyph;1 (58 FR 15730, March 23, 1993), is of particular importance to those certificate holders who operate under part 135 that would be affected by the mandatory requirements of this proposal. If the pilot operating and experience requirements proposed in Notice No. 93&hyph;1 are adopted, the new crew pairing and consolidation of knowledge and skills requirements would apply to those part 135 operators who are required or who elect to comply with the requirements of subparts N and O of part 121. Therefore, affected part 135 certificate holders are invited to consider the applicability of Notice No. 92&hyph;10 and Notice No. 93&hyph;1 to their operations when commenting on this notice. By this notice, the FAA is not reopening the comment period for those NPRM's. The FAA could adopt the proposals in those NPRM's and still consider whether to apply those provisions to part 135 certificate holders in this proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

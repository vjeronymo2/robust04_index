			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA RULE THREATENS SAFETY ABOVE LAX, PILOTS' GROUP CHARGES  </P> <P> The busy airspace over seven U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International  Airport, has been declared "critically deficient" in safety by an airline  pilots' group because of an FAA rule that gives air traffic controllers more  latitude in determining how far apart to keep planes.  </P> <P> The seven locations -- areas of rigidly controlled airspace called Terminal  Control Areas -- were placed on a "Black Star' list by the 70-member  International Federation of Air Lines Pilots Assns., meeting this week in  Washington.  </P> <P> The change was instituted at the seven locations in 1988 as part of a two-year  test program.  </P> <P> Under previous FAA rules, planes were required to be at least three miles  apart. Under the change, which the pilots' group says was quietly instituted by  the FAA, the controller "can now let aircraft get as close as he wants, as long  as in his judgment they will not collide," according to Capt. Henry Duffy,  president of the U.S. Air Line Pilots Assn., which is associated with the  international group.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles spokesman for the federal agency Wednesday defended the FAA's  actions.  </P> <P> "It is not a compromise of air safety," FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said.  "This was done with full cognizance of the airlines in 1988. It's a test  program. The objective is to reduce the near-midair-collisions possibility,  increase service to the pilots and to handle more air traffic."  </P> <P> Duffy said in a prepared statement that the newly adopted Black Star  designations were aimed at the controlled airspace at the seven locations --  not the airports beneath them.  </P> <P> "The Black Star rating does not mean that these Terminal Control Areas are  'unsafe,' " he said. "It simply means that they now have a safety deficiency  that warrants notification of airline pilots worldwide."  </P> <P> Though the FAA instituted the change two years ago, the pilots' association did  not discover the "positive separation" rule change at LAX and the six other  sites until late last year, Duffy said.  </P> <P> Besides Los Angeles, the Terminal Control Areas added to the "Black Star" list  include Charlotte, N.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth,  Philadelphia and Phoenix..  </P></p>

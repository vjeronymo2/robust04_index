			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Granada deal welcomed THE superlatives which greeted the announcement of Granada Group's purchase of the Sutcliffe catering group from P&amp;O were matched by the advance in the share price, with analysts confidently predicting more of the same. 'This is a superb deal at a very good price,' said Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court. Most other leisure specialists were equally excited and buy recommendations and profit upgrades quickly lifted the share price. Sentiment was boosted in early trading as the market heard that the placing of 42.4m new shares, issued to part-fund the Pounds 360m deal, had been oversubscribed by over four times. Hoare Govett, Granada's joint broker, placed the stock with institutions at 350p a share, a discount of only 4 per cent to the opening market price of 365p. By the end of the day, the shares had jumped 20 to 385p in turnover of 4.4m. Smith New Court, reiterating its buy stance, said the shares are some 10 per cent undervalued. The positive mood was linked to the business background of Granada's chief executive, Mr Gerry Robinson, who joined from another leading catering concern, Compass Group. Analysts said that the 10 per cent margin per contract enjoyed by Compass compared with a margin of around 4 per cent at Sutcliffe, and most were confident that Mr Robinson would be able to repeat his success. The market was also supportive from a strategic perspective, judging that one of the chief criticisms levelled at Granada, namely that its long-term earnings growth was in doubt, had now been satisfied. NatWest Securities, a bear of the stock, moved from an underperform stance to hold. It also raised its profit forecast for 1994 - the deal being earnings neutral in 1993 - from Pounds 164.9m to Pounds 187m. Hoare Govett went to Pounds 200m, while Smith New Court moved to Pounds 207m. The deal also took speculative pressure off Compass and Yorkshire Television. Both had been rumoured bid targets of Granada's. Compass tumbled 19 to 590p and Yorkshire 5 to 150p.</p>

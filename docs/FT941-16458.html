			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon Dollars 80m senior loan note issue EFM Dragon, an East Asian investment trust, has issued Dollars 80m (Pounds 54m) of 15 year senior loan notes. It is believed to be the first UK investment to make this kind of issue, writes Bethan Hutton. The notes, which have a fixed coupon of 7.26 per cent, were placed with US institutional lenders. The trust currently has net assets of about Pounds 350m and only a small amount of gearing. Once the proceeds of the issue, arranged by Hambros Bank and Robert Fleming, are invested, the trust will be approximately 20 per cent geared, a relatively high level for its sector. Mr Hamish Buchan, an investment trust analyst with NatWest Capital Markets, said the deal appeared to be designed to avoid currency risk. 'They are borrowing effectively in a matched currency, because so many currencies and economies in the East Asia region are dollar denominated or dollar linked', he stated. Mr Michael Balfour, manager of the trust, described the coupon of 7.26 per cent as 'very attractive', in the light of projected growth rates for economies in the region of 7 to 8 per cent a year. The issue will give the trust flexibility to buy into markets at times of weakness. Mr John Szymanowski, an investment trust analyst with SG Warburg, noted that current investment regulations meant that the interest would have to be paid out of dividend income rather than capital growth from the fund. Dividend levels on shares in south east Asian markets tend to be low, but the effective rate of about 1.5 per cent spread over the whole fund should be possible to meet, he said. The impact on dividend income to shareholders should be outweighed by improved capital gains.</p>

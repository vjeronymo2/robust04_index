			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> UCI RADIO TO MARK ITS 20TH YEAR  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, KUCI, UC Irvine's student-run radio station, was born.  </P> <P> Beginning Sunday, the station will celebrate its 20th anniversary with a week  of special programming and reminiscing, with KUCI alumni serving as guest disc  jockeys from about 6 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> Many of the alumni have stayed in touch through the KUCI newsletter and through  personal contact, keeping alive memorable events in the station's 20-year  history.  </P> <P> "I love that place. That place gave me everything," said Sue Simone, a former  KUCI general manager and now the national sales director for Disctronics Inc.  </P> <P> KUCI alumni, she said, have "taken it upon ourselves to be like the old ancient  Indians who pass all the myths down verbally, but you just keep passing it from  generation to generation. . . . For 20 years that has continued and, still,  (the current) management can recite the whole history of the station and it's a  wonderful thing."  </P> <P> It was during Simone's stint as general manager that KUCI almost went dark.  </P> <P> In the winter quarter of the 1981-82 school year, the Federal Communications  Commission allowed radio station KCRW, which shared KUCI's frequency, to  increase its power. KUCI, operating under 10 watts of power, was easily  overcome by KCRW. Simone remembers it vividly.  </P> <P> "That midnight I got a call from the person on the air. They couldn't pick up  the station in the studio . . . all of a sudden, everything stopped that day,"  Simone said.  </P> <P> Intent on keeping the station alive, Simone began a campaign to persuade the  FCC to change KUCI's frequency. Three months later, the station changed from  89.9 to 88.9 FM, ensuring its survival.  </P> <P> "The inspiration at the staff level today is a direct reflection of the spirit  that we had to bring the station back on the air," Simone said. "And it's 10  times better than it was then."  </P> <P> Another former station manager, Nick Roman, remembered 1974 when 15 students  ran naked across campus -- a fad called "streaking" -- and when Edmund G. Brown  Jr., debating Houston Flournoy on campus in their campaign for governor,  refused to allow KUCI to broadcast the debate live.  </P> <P> Former general manager Mike Duffy, who worked at the station from 1981 to about  1987, also had his share of memorable events, which included continuing his  show during a few earthquakes.  </P> <P> "You have to hold tight and hope," Duffy said.  </P> <P> At the end of the anniversary week, a banquet will be held in the Bren Events  Center on the UCI campus for alumni and campus representatives, followed by a  reception which is open to all on campus.  </P> <P> "Since we've been on the air for 20 years, we're trying to make the people more  aware" of the station's history and role at UC Irvine, Danielle Michaelis, the  current general manager, said.

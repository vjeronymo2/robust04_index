			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Out of sync with their partners: Pressure to devalue the Greek currency will not abate while the economy is unbalanced Greek investors, some carrying attache cases filled with cash, crowded into banks and brokers' offices yesterday to take advantage of the highest interest rates of the postwar period. The drachma crisis has sent short-term rates soaring, with commercial banks offering returns on deposits that match the Socialist government's issue of a new series of high-yielding bonds. The Greek currency has survived more than two weeks of speculative pressure, but at a heavy cost. The sharp increase in interest rates on tax-free government securities is the latest move in the battle to avert a devaluation. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist prime minister, insists devaluation must be avoided because it would fuel inflation and undermine confidence. He sounded optimistic at the weekend, asserting: 'The battle for the drachma is still continuing and it is critical, but it has effectively been won.' The drachma slipped yesterday, closing at 148.1 against the D-Mark compared to Dr147.9 on Monday. But it is still supported on a cushion of foreign currency from overseas investors attracted by the government's series of 'superbonds'. A one-month zero-coupon bond was issued at 27 per cent, while the three-month Treasury bill, offered last month at 16.5 per cent, now carries a rate of 25.5 per cent. Greece's currency crisis was triggered by the government's decision on May 16 to lift all remaining controls on capital movement, six weeks ahead of the deadline set by the European Union. There has been no flight of capital, because of high domestic interest rates and the introduction by the central bank of complex regulations for transferring funds abroad. But liberalisation provoked immediate attacks on the drachma. Financial markets expected that the government would devalue rather than exhaust Greece's modest Dollars 9bn foreign exchange reserves in trying to support the currency. The reasons for the drachma's problems, however, go deeper. Because of its chronically high inflation rate, Greece was not able to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The central bank's 'hard drachma' policy, allowing the drachma to depreciate against other EU currencies at a slower pace than inflation, has made the currency appreciate in real terms: most estimates suggest the drachma is overvalued by at least 20 per cent. Another reason for the drachma's current weakness is the failure of recent governments to reduce the public sector deficit, which this year could reach 17 per cent of gross domestic product. With spending exceeding economic growth for the past decade, Greece's accumulated debt is now equal to about 150 per cent of annual GDP. This month, the government must raise some Dr450bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from domestic and foreign investors to pay interest charges on this debt. 'The debt is deterring investment. Servicing costs are so large that interest rates cannot come down. And the new bond issues will lock the government into maintaining even higher interest rates,' says Mr Peter Doukas of Citibank, the US bank. Mr Papandreou's decision to defend the drachma by raising short-term interest rates comes at a particularly awkward moment. Unless measures to boost income are taken quickly, a shortfall in tax revenues through evasion will increase the government's borrowing requirement this year to 18 per cent of GDP, against a budget target of 12.8 per cent. The need to improve revenues has forced the Socialists to abandon their ideological opposition to privatisation. Unbundling the state is now a priority, with public offerings being planned for several utilities, starting with OTE, the state telecoms monopoly. The flotation of 25 per cent of OTE later this year should raise Dr250bn, enough to cover half the projected revenue shortfall. More drastic measures, however, will be needed to restore the drachma's stability. Economists are calling for both short-term measures to boost revenues and structural reforms to reduce the annual public sector deficit. 'Now that capital controls are gone, the drachma can come under pressure at any time. The only serious defence is to address the underlying problems - the yearly deficits and the total debt,' says Ms Miranda Xafa of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, the finance minister, claims that renewed efforts to collect tax arrears will yield an extra Dr200bn later in the year to cover the rest of the expected shortfall. With European Parliament elections less than two weeks away, the Socialists are reluctant to incur the political cost of launching an emergency fiscal package. Mr Papadopoulos argues that the benefits of short-term measures such as price increases for petrol and utilities would be outweighed by their impact on the inflation rate. Since their return to power last October, the Socialists' main economic task has been to bring inflation down to single digits during 1994. But in April the year-on-year inflation rate crept up from 10.2 to 10.4 per cent, ending a steady 10-month decline. Nevertheless, the government is under increasing pressure from its EU partners to introduce structural reforms. The rising deficits and debt are pulling Greece further from the Maastricht economic convergence targets. The gap with the rest of the EU will widen again this year, with GDP growth in Greece forecast at less than 1 per cent. Mr Henning Christophersen, the European Commissioner for economic affairs, has proposed that Greece should use its position as EU president to win approval at this month's Corfu summit for an economic package. To reduce the public sector deficit, it should include deep spending cuts. With payroll and pension costs accounting for 40 per cent of budget outlays, there seems no alternative to shutting loss-making state enterprises and eliminating a large proportion of the 50,000 civil service jobs. Like their conservative predecessors, the Socialists are unwilling to adopt such unpopular measures. Yet they could pay a high price for ignoring the Commission's advice. Greece is already unpopular with its partners for failing to implement two previous stabilisation plans since 1990 and over its blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The Commission is preparing legal action against Greece for violating Treaty of Rome requirements on EU trade with the embargo. Recovery in Greece is based on the assumption of increased inflows of EU assistance, amounting to Ecu16.8bn over the next five years. As well as promoting growth through grants that will cover up to 80 per cent of financing for large infrastructure projects, the funds will help to keep Greece's current account deficit at manageable levels - about 2 per cent of GDP. But if Greece fails to make progress towards the Maastricht targets, some EU financing may be withheld. Such progress may be difficult because the chances for economic recovery are now threatened by the turmoil on Greek financial markets. Triple-digit interest rates on the interbank market are creating a liquidity squeeze for Greek banks, now being reflected in soaring interest rates for corporate borrowers. The banks' most reliable customers saw interest charges on 'working capital' jump from 25 to more than 40 per cent last week, while new borrowers were turned away. Moreover, the liquidity problem is likely to continue as deposits are siphoned off into high-yielding government securities. 'It's impossible to hold money market rates at such high levels for more than a couple of weeks without disrupting the whole economy,' Ms Xafa says. Few economists believe the drachma can withstand prolonged pressure. Given Greece's underlying economic imbalances, the question of devaluation is likely to resurface. In the medium-term, the 'hard drachma' policy will have to be relaxed to accommodate a faster slide than the 6 to 7 per cent projected for this year. But the longer the government delays the needed fiscal stabilisation, the greater the risk that the decline of the currency will become totally out of control. As Mr Doukas says: 'The question is not whether, but when and by how much the drachma will come down.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Carlos Uribe, who successfully treated [soccer  player] Pibe Valderrama's knee injury, operated on President  Cesar Gaviria yesterday morning.    The Presidency Information and Press Secretariat reported  Gaviria "is recovering from the surgery he underwent."    According to the medical report, "the surgery lasted one  hour  and 50 minutes, and it freed the posterior tibial nerve, which  was restrained at the tarsus tunnel of his right foot. This is  why the operation could be satisfactorily performed."    Presidency sources also reported the chief of state was  hospitalized at 0630. One hour later, he was transferred to the  operating room, where he underwent surgery until 0930. Gaviria  remained unconscious until noon due to the anesthesia.    Dr. Uribe said the president remained under medical  supervision all day yesterday.</p>

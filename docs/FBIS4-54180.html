			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- The basic line of  building the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is to establish the  monolithic ideological system of the party, stresses NODONG  SINMUN in a by-lined article today.    The article says:    The work published by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  on  May 25, 1967 is of great importance in the efforts of the WPK to  firmly establish the monolithic ideological system of the party.    The historic work expounds that the fundamental principle of  party building is to firmly establish the party's monolithic  ideological system as required by the law governing the party  building of the working class and the reality of party  ideological work. The work also comprehensively systematizes  all theoretical and practical questions in establishing this  system.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il comprehensively  embodied  the idea and theory of the great leader's May 25, 1967 work in  party ideological work and all spheres of the revolution and  construction so that a turn has been effzcted in the work and  life of the party members and other working people.    The exploits of the Workers' Party of Korea in establishing  the monolithic ideological system of the party are that all the  party members and other working people have been firmly prepared  to be true revolutionaries of chuche type with intense loyalty  to the party and the leader.    The dear leader expounded that the basic requirement and  criterion of loyalty are to hold the leader in high esteem,  absolutize the leader's authority, make the leader's  revolutionary idea and instructions and the party's lines and  policies one's body and soul and unconditionally carry them out.  Then he paid deep attention to letting all the party members  and other working people live on that basis.    The greatest exploit of our party in establishing the  party's  monolithic ideological system is that it has trained all the  party members and working people into staunch revolutionaries  who always share their destiny with the party and defend the  party and the leader with their lives.    Another exploit is that an unbreakable unity around the  illustrious leader has been achieved.    In strengthening the unity of the party, the dear leader  directed deep attention to inheriting the party's tradition of  unity and strengthening it.    In Korea today, the tradition of unity has been creditably  carried forward and the singlehearted unity of the leader, the  party and the masses has been consolidated.    Another exploit is that the ideological position of  Korean-style socialism has been cemented.    To cope with the vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and  reactionaries in recent years, the dear leader took measures to  direct greater efforts to the ideological education of the party  members and other working people than ever before and published  many famous works, providing a powerful ideological and  theoretical weapon to solve every problem our own way.    It is because our people are resolute ideologically and a  powerful ideological position has been built in Korea that our  socialism is making a long drive, not wavering in any storm and  stress.    Impregnable is our socialist ideological position built by  the dear leader.</p>

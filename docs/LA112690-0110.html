			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> SHOWMANSHIP ECLIPSES ARTISTRY IN VASARELY  </P> <P> Before the Vasarely cuff links, the Vasarely wristwatches, before the  mass-produced Vasarely serigraphs and acrylic sculpture, there was a Vasarely  of more humble intentions. Before the flamboyant visual gymnastics, there was a  gentle stretching of the boundaries, a limbering of the optical muscles, a  prodding of convention and expectation.  </P> <P> The current exhibition of Victor Vasarely's work at Circle Gallery (2501 San  Diego Ave., through Dec. 3) shows us both the artist and the athlete, but it is  the latter, the showman, who prevails and casts a dishonorable shadow across  the entire oeuvre.  </P> <P> The Hungarian-born artist, now in his 80s, is featured in a series of  exhibitions at four Circle Gallery branches across the country. Collectively  titled "Victor Vasarely: A Retrospective Exhibition/Selections From 50 Years of  Artistic Achievement," the shows can be seen in New York, San Francisco and Los  Angeles, in addition to the show in Old Town.  </P> <P> Vasarely moved to Paris in 1930 and began to experiment with geometric  abstraction while working in advertising. Not until after the war, however, did  he resume his interest in the illusory spatial effects he could muster through  the basic tools of line and color.  </P> <P> Several series of drawings from the early 1950s, on view in the local show,  possess a fresh, spirited approach to line. Among them are the "Denfert" period  drawings, inspired by the cracked tiles in a train station that the artist  frequented, in which organic shapes embrace and overlap with modest but  appealing energy. The "Naissance" series ventures further into the realm of  illusion and suggestion, terrain that Vasarely has since exhausted mercilessly.  In these early works, the artist has filled each page with parallel lines that  dip or buckle toward the center of the image. The detour is often slight, but  enough of a deviation to imply movement and depth on the static, flat page.  </P> <P> The paintings and collages that follow immediately after these works are  equally unpretentious. They play with the ambiguity of positive and negative  space, the secret depth of flat shadows, the power of repetition and echo. But,  by the 1960s, Vasarely had all but discarded the subdued tones and organic  origins of his early work for images of a tightly controlled geometry in a  range of searingly bright colors.  </P> <P> His efforts to make the flat surface breathe, to coerce straight lines into the  appearance of curves and to make the static page feel animated and alive gave  birth to a popular style coined Op Art (short for Optical Art) in the early  '60s. The delightful infidelities of line and color have preoccupied the artist  ever since. His tour de force paintings and prints of the past few decades  feature patterns of circles, squares and diamonds that, through their spacing  and coloration, create the illusion of bulging, pulsating, stretching forms.  </P> <P> Ironically, these highly synthetic-seeming exercises were inspired, according  to Vasarely's writings, by the natural world, with its still, stable surface  concealing a microcosmic beehive of activity. Since the early line drawings and  collages, however, nothing in the artist's signature style even hints of the  organic. Their artificially vivid greens, oranges and purples, as well as their  seamless surfaces, reveal as little of the human hand as of the human soul.  </P> <P> The Circle Gallery show does contain a few pleasant surprises, even in the  later work -- such as the simple but engaging collage, "Elo" of 1989 -- but the  bulk of Vasarely's art is merely dazzling and dry.  </P></p>

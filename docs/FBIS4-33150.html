			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Thaw"] </F>   [Text] Brazil took exactly 17 years to sign the Tlatelolco  Treaty for the denuclearization of Latin America. The signing of  the treaty by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in Mexico City on 30  May closed a period that was filled with distrust and  misunderstanding. This period was fueled by the Cold War, the  Brazil-Argentina rivalry, alignment and misalignment, and an era  that -- in the end and hopefully for a long time -- was buried  after the fall of the Berlin Wall.    Brazil and Argentina signed the treaty in 1967 but did not  ratify it. Brazil informed the preparatory commission that it  considered that Article 18 of the treaty authorized signatory  countries to make nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes  including "the detonation of devices similar to the ones used in  military weapons." This interpretation clashed with that of the  United States, which was outlined during the signing of the  additional Protocol 11. This disagreement lasted almost two  decades.    But the world has undergone such big changes with the  deterioration of one of the superpowers -- the Soviet empire --  that it did not make sense to insist on the same points, as if  the Cold War were still polluting the diplomatic atmosphere.  Everything began with the 1962 missile crisis involving Kennedy  and Kruschev, when the USSR attempted to install a nuclear base  in Cuba.    The Tlatelolco Treaty set a world precedent, hailed by the  UN  secretary general as a "major factor in the long and difficult  fight for disarmament." A treaty had been signed in 1959 to  preserve Antarctica. The accumulation of nuclear weapons in  space was banned in 1966. The Tlatelolco Treaty made Latin  America the first inhabited region to be declared a banned  territory for the production of nuclear weapons and weapons of  mass destruction.    The safeguards demanded by Argentina and Brazil, however,  seemed unacceptable to the United States, which did not agree to  including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the "banned  area" because of the existence of U.S. bases in those places.  Then-Panamanian chief of state Omar Torrijos said the United  States kept nuclear weapons in stock in the Panama Canal zone.    Furthermore, at the end of the 1960's, when the treaty was  signed in the Mexican city of Tlatelolco, Brazil and Argentina  were in the middle of an arms race to be the first to detonate a  nuclear bomb. The regional thaw began in 1985 when [Presidents]  Sarney and Alfonsin visited Argentina's nuclear facilities,  reaching a climax when [Presidents] Collor and Menem opened  their nuclear facilities to mutual inspection. Last month, two  days before Brazil decided to fully join the treaty following  the Senate's approval, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario  Cesar Flores said: "If we do not want to produce a nuclear bomb,  there is no reason to fear ratifying the treaty."    In the end, as Celso Amorim said in Mexico City, the  Tlatelolco Treaty was freely signed by each of the 30 signatory  countries "without any imposition whatsoever." Gone is the "Cold  War period, full of tension, distrust, and uncertainty," and the  denuclearization commitments that "entailed arbitrary limits on  the use of nuclear energy and sophisticated technology for  legitimate purposes."    Brazil could not have done otherwise at a time when the  United States and Russia have agreed to no longer aim their  long-range missiles at cities and strategic targets in each  country. The 21st century has practically begun.</p>

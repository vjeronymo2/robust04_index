			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Russian army prepares for final push on Grozny The Russian army is grouping for a final push into Grozny, the Chechen capital, to end a war that is straining the fabric of Russian society and threatening the government's stability. General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, told the Interfax news agency yesterday that Russian forces would 'push deep into the city to seize weapons and liquidate armed formations'. Commenting on the apparent contradiction between that intention and the statement by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, that the city would not be stormed, Gen Grachev said it would not be a 'storming in the classic sense, using all means at our disposal and launching an initial bombardment of shells and rockets for several hours'. According to the Moscow daily newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which printed what it said was the text of a report on Monday by Gen Grachev to the security council - the state body that oversees all security matters - the council has agreed to take Grozny no later than January 15. It was clear that the Russian military, in spite of continued stiff resistance, has advanced steadily and has largely blockaded the city - although a fight for the town of Argun, which commands the road from Grozny to the east, was raging fiercely. Interfax said that General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, had called for talks without preconditions - possibly a sign of growing desperation, although one that met no response from Russia. Having lost the support of Mr Yegor Gaidar, his long-time ally and former prime minister, Mr Yeltsin is now receiving his most vocal backing from Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the neo-nationalist Liberal Democratic party. Mr Zhirinovsky supplemented the president's call to the army to finish the job in Chechnya with an appeal of his own: 'The motherland has called you at a difficult hour to fulfil your noble duty. The time of serious trial has come for Russia . . . as well as bandits, journalists and politicians are shooting you (the troops) in the back.' Editors of newspapers that oppose the war demanded an explanation from the president of his allegation that they were financed by Chechens. The government press service accused journalists covering the war of putting soldiers' lives at risk. Mrs Elena Bonner, widow of the physicist and human rights campaigner Andrei Sakharov, resigned from the president's human rights commission saying the conflict 'marks a return to totalitarianism'. Mr Emil Pain, an adviser to Mr Yeltsin who has been the most outspoken of the liberal-inclined aides, deplored the gap between the president's promise to end the bombing and the attacks yesterday and the previous night. That was also taken up by the French foreign ministry, which said that 'contrary to what has been announced (by Yeltsin) we have observed that the fighting in Chechnya has intensified'.

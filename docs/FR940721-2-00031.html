The types of information sought include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information, quantified data, or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identification of and information from any other environmental assessment, environmental impact statement, or similar document or study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the Des Moines River Basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present actions and effects of the projects and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For example, fish stocking/management histories, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat losses or proposals to develop land and water resources within the basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identification of any federal, state, or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass the Des Moines River Basin with information on when they will be implemented, if known. For example, proposals to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, water diversions, or implement fishery management programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation that would support a conclusion that the actions or a project(s)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> does <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> does not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contribute to cumulative adverse or beneficial effects on resources and therefore should be excluded from further study or excluded from further consideration of cumulative effects within the Des Moines River Basin. Documentation should include, but is not limited to: how the projects interact with other projects within the river basin and other developmental activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and reports from federal, state, and local agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be useful in preparing the draft EA, the requested information must be received by the Commission no later than 30 days past the date of this notice. Address all communications to: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All correspondence must clearly show at the top of the first page ``Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project, FERC No. 11346''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When filing scoping comments, you should submit an original and 8 copies; this will assure that staff receives your information quickly.

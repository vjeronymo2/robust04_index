In approximately one  year FDPC members could state with justification that the main  conclusions of the theses and the proposals they contained have  been proven correct and almost fully implemented.    The theses came into being because of FDPC members' concern  over the fact that the national leadership lacked a minimally  systematic understanding of Russia's interests and goals in the  foreign policy sphere, as well as fears that a demonstratively  one-sided pro-Western policy orientation could not only damage  Russian Federation [RF] interests in other foreign-policy  directions, but also would cause an inevitable hard reaction on  the part of public opinion inside the country. The theses were  aimed at convincing national leaders that the policy needed to  be adjusted and this reaction softened.    The changes in the Russian foreign policy course that have  taken place since the end of 1992 have made it much more  balanced and restrained, and somewhat softened this reaction but  could not avert it entirely. There are increasingly numerous  signs that the pendulum of Russian public opinion and Russian  policy already is passing the "golden middle" and is moving in  the direction of a policy potentially much more dangerous that  the one conducted in 1991-1992.    The explanation lies not only in past events and mistakes.  There are forces that exist and operate in Russia, which strive  to provoke a crisis in relations with the outside world, to  create again a hostile environment without which they cannot  even dream of coming into power.    The firmer tone and better defined positions that have  manifested themselves lately in Moscow's foreign policy lead to  formation of a normal, more equal and respectful nature of  relations with the leading powers. One cannot fail to notice,  however, the revival and intensification of xenophobia as well.    Under these conditions a number of FDPC members came up with  an initiative to draft new theses. They have been written by the  working group of council members who as a rule currently do not  hold official positions in the bodies of executive authority.  (Footnote 1)( The working group included: Yu.Yu. Boldyrev,  deputy of the Federation Council of the RF Federal Assembly;  L.I. Vainberg, president of the Association of Joint Ventures  and International Associations and Organizations; A.P.  Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; A.C. Grachev, member of the  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI founder's council; O.V. Kiselev, chairman of  the board of directors of AO [joint-stock society] Mosexpo;  Ye.M. Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute of Strategic  Studies; V.P. Lukin, doctor of historic science, professor;  I.Ye. Malashenko, general director of NTV; M.V. Masarskiy,  president of the Association of Enterprise Managers; N.V.  Mikhaylov, president of Vympel Interstate Joint-Stock  Corporation, doctor of economic sciences, professor; I.M.  Khakamada, deputy of the RF Federal Assembly State Duma; I.Yu.  Yurgens, first deputy chairman of the General Confederation of  Trade Unions; S.N. Yushenkov, chairman of the RF State Duma  Federal Assembly's Committee on Defense). The group's work  was coordinated by S.A. Karaganov, a deputy director of the  Europe Institute of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] and  the chairman of the FDPC collegium, and V.T. Tretyakov, editor  in chief of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In the process of preparing  these theses, the council has conducted a number of seminars  with the participation of noted specialists and politicians of  Russia, Ukraine, the United States, Germany, China, Japan, and  other countries. Among the materials used were official  documents, as well as theoretical work of a number of noted  Russian specialists. (Footnote 2)( Members of the working  groups used especially extensively the work of the following  specialists: A.G. Arbatov, D.A. Danilov, P.Ye. Kandel, I.M.  Klyamkin, A.V. Kortunov, V.V. Naumkin, V.A. Nikonov, K.E.  Sorokin, S.M. Rogov, P.T. Podlesnyy, V.V. Pazuvayev, D.V.  Trenin, and K.O. Sarkisov. The authors would like to express a  special appreciation for A.K. Pushkov, who was a co-author of  one of the important parts of the report.    (Members of the working group would like to thank the  FDPC Executive Director T.V. Borisova and Deputy Executive  Director A.A. Belkin for organizational and academic help in  preparing the theses.)    The theses were discussed at the meeting of the FDPC  Assembly  on 12 May of 1994 and the results of the discussion were  incorporated in the draft.    Not all planks of the theses necessarily reflect the views  of  each member of the working group who put his signature under  them. Rather, they reflect a broad consensus on their underlying  philosophy.    The authors almost fully reaffirm the appraisal of the  international situation and the prospects for our country's  development presented in the 1992 "Strategy for Russia" theses.  The new theses do not represent an attempt at an  all-encompassing appraisal of the international situation and  detailed recommendations on Russia's foreign policy strategy. We  are gratified to see that state bodies now have engaged in doing  this. The purpose of the theses is to influence several key  long-term elements in Russia's policy, first and foremost with  respect to the countries of the former USSR, as well as attempt  to warn against some dangerous trends that have emerged in the  Russian policy.  <H8>  1. New Elements in Russia's Foreign Policy Situation </H8>   1.1. A perceptible trend has developed in Russia's foreign  policy toward a shift from the old one-sided alignment with the  West to the defense of real national interests. However, it has  been accompanied lately by great-power rhetorics on the part of  high officials, aimed first and foremost at domestic  consumption. This rhetoric, not supported by real economic,  political, and military levers, can only exacerbate suspicions  that Russia is aiming for an "imperial revanche" in both the  near and far abroad. There is presently a danger that Russia may  start moving from the old policy of unconditional alignment with  the West and neglect of its relations with neighbors in the  former USSR to a policy of political confrontation and  suspiciousness, on the one hand, and high-handedness of  strength, on the other.    1.2. Suspicious attitudes toward Russia undoubtedly are on  the rise around the world, but at the same time we see a decline  of interest in it; quite a few signs of lack of respect for  Russian interests can be detected.    The main reason is the progressively weakening Russian  economy and the lack of a strong economic strategy capable of  taking the country out of the crisis and starting an economic  upturn. Russia is relatively weak. But most important, so far no  short-term prospects for its stabilization and strengthening are  in sight.    The West fears a revival of Russian expansionism. Many do  not  want even a partial restoration of Moscow's influence in the  world policy. It should also be noted that there are many in the  outside world who are interested in retaining on the territory  of the former USSR, strategic counterbalances free of Russian  influence.    1.3. For the West, there also are reasons that are purely  internal as to why a shift has began in relations with Russia.  To a considerable extent, West Europe temporarily lost the  capacity for active outward-aimed action because of  post-Maastricht difficulties, Germany concentrating on  "digesting" eastern lands, the economic decline, and another fit  of "Europessimism." There is an increasing desire to shut  oneself off from the problems whose resolution requires  political will and economic expenditures. Similar processes and  orientation, first and foremost toward domestic affairs, also  are developing in the United States, albeit in a less explicit  form. The West has demonstrated its inability to seriously  assist in the Russian reforms or to assist Russia effectively in  averting and settling crises in the post-Soviet space. (Limited  aid in both the former and the latter is being rendered,  however).    The inevitable erosion of security structures set up during  the years of the Cold War begets fears among a part of  traditional Western elites, the desire to slow down or turn back  these processes, including with the help of the "rallying  factor"--by reviving the perception of an outside, that is,  Russian threat. Both in the West and in Russia there are forces  that want us to "slip" and provoke a beginning of a new "cold  war."    1.4. At the same time, the forces that wish a return to the  Cold War do not have an upper hand either in Russia or in the  West.    Moreover, numerous analyses, including those conducted under  the auspices of the FDPC, show that the conflict between Russian  vital interests of primary importance and those of the largest  countries in the West is not great. In most cases these  interests either coincide or do not contradict each other. The  conflict emerges only in connection with implementation of  interests that are of clearly secondary importance. Thus, there  is no deep underlying reason for worsening relations.    1.5. Nevertheless, we face the possibility of such worsening  in relations, which will mark the beginning of the  third--"farce"--"cold war" (the first one fell in the  1950's-1960's, and the second in the beginning of the 1980's).  It cannot be either deep or intense. But for Russia, in its  current state of overexertion and weakness, another  confrontation with the West will cost extremely dearly and may  derail economic reforms. This--and only under the best-case  scenario--will lead to stagnation and considerable worsening of  general conditions of life for Russian citizens as a minimum for  the lifetime of one generation, and make integration processes  on the territory of the former USSR more difficult. Moreover, in  the event the confrontation exacerbates, the West may attempt to  recreate the system of military-political isolation of Russia  that will diminish even more its ability to influence the  outside world, to defend its interests in it. It is conceivable  that the West also has the ability to contribute to its domestic  destabilization.    The new isolation will be much more damaging than the one in  which the USSR lived during the years of the first Cold War.    1.6. Even without a serious worsening in relations, there  exists a real threat of qualitative and long-term increase of  geopolitical isolation of Russia and weakening of its  international positions, especially if a decision is made to  expand NATO that would exclude Russia.    1.7. Russia has broken out of confrontation. It does not  have  any enemies in the foreseeable future and this is a gigantic  plus in its current geostrategic situation. It is quite obvious,  however, that the hope of acquiring new allies, first and  foremost in the West, so far have not materialized. We have not  succeeded in creating a new effective security system that would  replace the collapsing two-bloc system and in which Russia could  feel at least relatively comfortably. At least for the next few  years Russia will be compelled to live without clear allies and  be in a "suspended state" in a geostrategic sense.    1.8. A qualitatively new situation is developing in most  "near-abroad" countries. The mood in favor of integration is  growing. At the same time, the trend toward strengthening  independent statehood is being replaced by another one--most  states become weak. An unstoppable economic decline is taking  place. Many states already are destabilized (the Transcaucasus,  Tajikistan); others are moving in the same direction. Only the  Baltic countries, and also (for different reasons) Turkmenistan,  constitute clear exceptions. One may reach a preliminary  conclusion that many, if not the majority, of countries that  formed after the USSR's disintegration, are proving their  inability to survive as completely independent states outside of  very close cooperation with Russia, its and each other's support.    1.9. There are many reasons for this. The new structure of  prices, under which Russia stopped playing the role of an  economic donor, has led to a sharp redistribution of resources  between former Soviet republics. Little countries suffer to a  relatively greater degree from the disruption of traditional  economic ties. All of them experience in most cases a shortage  of specialists capable of adopting to new economic conditions,  manage on a macroeconomic level, conduct a reform, and this  cannot be made up for even in an intermediate-term future. In  most CIS countries, for all practical purposes market reforms  are not being implemented. The result of all this is that they  not only progressively fall behind in relation to Russia, but  also develop in different directions. The former USSR countries  (with the exception of the Baltics and Turkmenistan) not only  are growing increasingly poorer as compared to Russia, the  differences in the structure of their economies keeps increasing  as well.    1.10. Of particular concern is the situation in Ukraine. Its  economy is disintegrating fast; there is the absence of  consolidated political will and minimum accord, and perhaps of  the ability to implement a resolute reform; the population is  getting increasingly more impoverished. The disintegration  process has gone far. As early as within the next one to three  years Ukraine may have to face a social explosion and the  beginning of political disintegration. There is a growing mood  among the population, especially in the southern, eastern, and  central oblasts, in favor of unification with Russia, as well as  distrust and rejection of the policy associated with Western  Ukraine. Most elites at the same time would like to preserve  some level of state independence. In the foreseeable future  calls for unification possibly will be coming from individual  regions or oblasts, which may provoke internal clashes. A stream  of illegal emigration to Russia is swelling. The manageability  of the Ukrainian armed forces is declining dangerously.    1.11. The situation in Ukraine (but not Ukraine itself)  currently presents the most serious long-term external challenge  to the security and internal stability of Russia. Economic  degradation, internal conflicts portending the threat of mass  migration, technotronic catastrophes, loss of control over  nuclear weapons and arsenals of conventional weapons.    1.12. Against the backdrop of weakening neighboring states,  Russia public opinion and political circles, along with the  general growth of nationalism, manifest an increased perception  of imaginary omnipotence of Russia. This perception is very  dangerous. It may result in drawing Russia into a considerable  number of conflicts aimed at supporting stability in one or  another country or region or at supporting unification  processes. Russia, however, does not have either the social,  military, or economic potential for it. Russia itself is in a  critical economic situation. A quick overexertion is almost  inevitable, and with it--increased social instability and  renewed disintegration tendencies. Russia may very quickly  follow the road of the USSR and fall apart because of excessive  strain and insufficient resources.    1.13. At the same time, the experience of the last few years  showed that a complete separation from the republics of the  former USSR--as had been proposed by radical democrats--is  impossible. Neither does it seem possible to effectively  regulate by traditional methods of international diplomacy the  set of problems that are emerging on the territory of the former  USSR: sociopolitical conflicts; the legal and economic situation  of almost 70 million persons living outside their ethnic  homelands; economic development; borders. Integration with many  states of the former USSR in a strategic perspective is almost  inevitable. There is simply no other solution. It is only a  question of its forms and terms.    1.14. No strategy for defense and promotion of national  interests in the foreign arena--even the most elementary  one--can be implemented given the current state of the bodies  whose job it is to develop and implement this strategy. What we  have is a discordant chorus, where each bureaucrat affords  himself the luxury of his own policy, which weakens the  country's foreign political positions and quite often  embarrasses it. This is one of the greatest challenges facing  the country's foreign policy. A top to bottom reform of the  executive branch has not been completed. The capabilities of the  president's apparat still are not commensurate with the  president's constitutional prerogatives.    1.15. The shortcomings of the current system in the foreign  political sphere per se in a most general sense boil down to the  following:    1.15.1. So far the president had not devoted sufficient  attention to the issues of foreign policy and national security;  in many respects, he removed himself from the dialog with  society on the foreign policy issues; he clearly does not have  sufficient bureaucratic capabilities through which he could, at  least in principle, exercise effective control over the  formation and implementation of an integrated foreign policy  strategy.    1.15.2. There is still practically no system of strict  planning and coordination. The Security Council staff over the  past half-year has increased potential capabilities for  coordination. It cannot carry out this function effectively,  however. The key role in defining the policy is still played by  relevant agencies, which, with all the constant bickering  between them, are united in one point--the reluctance to  subordinate to anyone. As a result, the already meager potential  of the country, the capabilities of the president and the  presidency in the matters of foreign policy are being sharply  diminished.    1.15.3. A continuous, anticipatory dialog between the bodies  of executive authority and legislative authority has not been  set up. As a result, additional impulses are generated for the  confrontation of two branches of power, as well as obstacles on  the road of forming a foreign policy consensus.    1.15.4. Because of the largely negligent attitude, the  cadres  corps, whose task is to serve foreign policy and national  security, is in a sad state. To a large extent this is true of  counterintelligence. But an especially alarming situation exists  with respect to the professional corps of the MFA [Ministry of  Foreign Affairs]. It is seriously demoralized and losing people.  As a result, not just the quality of diplomacy suffers. The  country is losing human resources that cannot be replaced in the  foreseeable future.    1.15.5. Another alarming point is the level of knowledge the  society and broad leadership circles possess with respect to  foreign policy problems. There is a shortage of both serious  analysis and popular coverage of these problems in the mass  media. As a result, the mind of the public and policy-forming  circles is filled with myths, falls prey to search for "simple  solutions" and the worst examples of party propaganda.  <H8>  What To Do </H8> <H8>  2. General Considerations </H8>   2.1. Russia will inevitably see its foreign policy positions  worsen, and in the future perhaps will face direct threats to  its territorial integrity unless the national leadership manages  in the next year or two to self-organize and advance a viable  concept of national development--first and foremost, for getting  out of the economic crisis: a new industrial policy designed for  the long-term perspective, the rescue of scientific-technical  intelligentsia and advance technologies, the restoration of law  and order, and the restraint of corruption. The key formula of  the entire Russian strategy must be "accumulation of strength"  or, using A.M. Gorchakov's formula, "concentration." Without it  Russia will not be able to ensure the well-being and freedom of  its citizens and take the place of a respected and  self-respecting power in the world.    2.2. One of the possible ways to stimulate such  consolidation, such "accumulation of strength" is to create a  nongovernment National Strategy Commission. This commission  could also include representatives of the current  administration--however, not for political oversight or guidance  but just to enrich the unrestricted analysis of possible  alternatives with information and ideas not available to people  who are not part of the ruling structures. This commission could  produce a long-term program of national development, around  which a platform could emerge for uniting responsible and  future-oriented economic and political leaders, the active part  of the society. We have to honestly admit that so far none of  the parties, nor the government, nor the president in his  message to the Federal Assembly have been able to advance such a  long-term program, although they have identified many of its  essential elements.  <H8>  3. Policy Toward Former USSR Countries </H8>   It is no longer possible to conduct any policy toward the  countries of the former USSR without defining clear strategic  goals. Russia must decide in the very near future what it wants.  Effective and long-term solution of the second-tier  tasks--maintaining stability, establishing economic and  financial cooperation, ensuring human rights, military-political  interaction, and so on--is impossible unless these tasks are  built into the overall strategy and subordinated to a single  goal. The low efficiency of Russian policy over the past two  years with respect to CIS countries and the fact that the  organization is in a skid is a vivid testimony to this.    3.2. The disintegration of the USSR, despite likely being a  historic inevitability, brought deprivation and a decline in the  standard of living and quality of life for most people of the  former USSR and has led to a succession of conflicts that has  yet to reach the end. But such a conclusion should not push us  toward a policy that may lead to even greater losses and  suffering.    3.3. The boundaries of Russia's strategic choice are  extremely narrow if we keep in mind first and foremost the  progressive weakening of the majority of neighboring states, the  growing instability in them, which has exceeded or is about to  exceed the critical mark, the shift of the moods there in favor  of integration, and the emerging balance of attitudes in the  ruling groups in Russia itself. The different direction of  Russian economic development and other countries of the former  USSR; the lack of ability or desire to coordinate its interests  with long-term interests of all countries; the lack of real  experience of modern integration; and the political, social, and  military-political instability make the idea of creating a  EU-type community on the territory of the greater part of the  former USSR increasingly less realistic even in the  intermediate-range term.    3.4. Essentially, Russia is left with just one alternative:  Either a course toward reuniting with the considerable number of  former USSR republics--or in the event of their disintegration,  with their regions--and creating a new federative state; or a  course toward preserving political independence of these states  in exchange for unlimited access to their markets of goods,  services, and capital, creating an effective defensive  military-political union, and providing a single legal space for  all ethnic minorities that will ensure their full rights. That  is, integration not through territorial and political  unification, but through creation of political,  military-political, and other conditions for economic  interaction and interpenetration, which in turn should ensure  and support political and military-political interests of Russia  on the territory of the former USSR. Of course, the policy  should provide conditions for such an integration as well in the  event this trend becomes objectively predominant.    3.5. The goal of creating (or recreating) a federative state  is too costly in political terms and especially in economic  terms. Absolutely unacceptable are ultranationalists'  recipes--reunification through strong-arm expansion, by  undermining in a controlled way the stability of neighboring  states. Such a policy is not only immoral--it is also  impractical: Instability will inevitably spill over into Russia  itself. However, the course toward reunification may turn out  counterproductive even when purely economic and political levers  are used: It will require gigantic infusions of money into  frequently collapsing economic entities, direct subsidies to  prop the population's standard of living in the neighboring  states in order to make it at least comparable with that in  Russia. Russia is in danger of turning again into an economic  colony of states it will unite around itself. Considering the  current standard of living in Russia itself, its inevitable  sharp decline may lead to an explosion of social discontent and  increased disintegration trends in Russia itself, when the  regions, in order to avoid dramatic destabilization of the  social situation, will be compelled to resort to a save-yourself  policy. In this case, any industrial policy will be doomed from  the start, society's modernization will be reversed, and a  national strategy of accumulation of strength and restoration  will be impossible. Overexertion is almost inevitable, and  because of this overexertion and the shortage of resources,  Russia may quickly go the way of the USSR.    The policy toward unification will cause inevitable sabotage  and resistance on the part of a considerable part of local  elites. Besides, they will be to a considerable extent absolved  of the responsibility for economic disintegration,  impoverishment of the population, and instability. They will get  an opportunity, even greater than before, to shift the  responsibility onto Moscow.    Finally, an open course toward full integration, especially  with Ukraine, may cause tensions in relations with the outside  world, and the rise of already-obvious anti-Russian moods. This  will create difficulties in utilizing outside sources of growth:  technologies, capital, societal management and social  development expertise. The probability of NATO's expansion will  sharply increase, and the danger of overexertion will increase  even more.    3.6. Russia should not support just any integration--only  that which will be beneficial for Russians and the Russian  state. We also have to recognize the right of our neighbors to  such a policy of "enlightened egotism."    3.7. The policy aimed at creating around Russia a system of  friendly states, nonconfrontational toward Russia and  economically open to it, also is not going to be cheap--both  from the standpoint of political effort and from a purely  economic standpoint. But this strategy is qualitatively cheaper  and more profitable. Russia will not have to bear direct  responsibility for maintaining the standard of living of the  population of neighboring states. It will be able to avoid a  return to the position of economic donor, and will be able to  utilize to the full extent its advantages--natural resources,  the technological potential, on average more skilled labor force  and managerial cadres. It will have access to the natural,  economic, and human resources of neighboring countries on a  basis relatively more advantageous for it. The goal of  such policy is not to restore with some modification the  situation that existed before the disintegration of the USSR,  but to modernize these relations in a way advantageous for  Russia, whereby it will retain many advantages of its former  geostrategic position and at the same time create for itself a  much more advantageous economic position in the new commonwealth  of states. The philosophy of this approach is "leadership  instead of direct control."    3.8. Russia has the right to propose development of some  model of interaction with the neighboring countries, but it  should not impose it the hard way. And especially so by force.  The people and the leadership of the neighboring countries must  make their own choice. But the price of refusal also should be  made quite clear from the very beginning: reducing the  incentives for economic, political, or military-political  support on the part of Russia.    Such a formula will probably cause less resistance in the  outside world, since it will not lead to a qualitatively greater  military-political power of Russia and at the same time will  ensure the opportunities for stabilizing the situation in the  space of the former USSR.    Apparently, only after getting out of the crisis,  successfully implementing economic reform, and achieving a sharp  rise in economic might and prosperity will Russia be able to  afford a closer integration with those former USSR republics  that will want it and if it is advantageous for Russia itself.    3.9. The concrete directions of Russia's actions in  implementing the policy based on the "leadership instead of  control" philosophy could be the following:    3.9.1. Insist on removing all restrictions on the movement  of  goods, on creating conditions for the capital of all countries  to participation in privatization; transfer of industrial and  other assets in exchange for debt. Active support on the part of  all states for interpenetration of capital.    3.9.2. Create an effective system of mutual clearing, first  on a bilateral basis, and then possibly by creating a clearing  union with a reserve currency. At the same time, complete  integration of financial systems should be avoided. The example  of Belarus should be an exception rather than the rule (although  its repetition cannot be completely precluded) because of the  closeness of this country to Russia and its strategic position.  It is necessary to attentively study the experience, benefits,  and costs of economic integration with Belarus.    3.9.3. A course at creating a close military-political union  of a considerable part of the former USSR states in the future,  possibly with unified armed forces.    3.9.4. A course toward the right of all former USSR citizens  to have a second citizenship (Footnote 3:) (On the issue of  second (or dual) citizenship, the opinions of FDPC members were  polarized. This thesis is left in the text more as an indication  of a problem than as a commonly recognized version of its  solution), and protection from any discrimination.    3.10. These goals might be achieved through following means:    3.10.1. The main principles of the policy must be  flexibility. In addition to several fundamental principles, the  policy with respect to each country should be formed on the  basis of concrete conditions and concrete interests of Russia.  The line toward strengthening the CIS must be continued, but it  will not bring effective results without a stronger emphasis on  bilateral forms of interaction in relations with former USSR  states. Multilateral diplomacy within the CIS framework should  develop on the foundation of new bilateral relations, in which  Russia occupies stronger positions than in the system of  multilateral contacts.    3.10.2. Within the framework of general strategic  principles,  Russia has to have a separately developed line with respect to  each of the states of the former USSR. These lines may differ  substantially from one another.    3.10.3. A consistent and energetic interaction with the  responsible political forces of neighboring states.    3.10.4. Conduct policy aimed at preventing disintegration of  neighboring states, preserving the main internationally  recognized attributes of their statehood. At the same time,  Russia cannot become a guarantor of preservation of the regimes  that have shown the inability to govern their countries or that  violate the rights of ethnic minorities, including the Russian  one.    3.10.5. Limit interference in internal affairs other than in  instances of gross and mass-scale violations of human rights, or  unleashing civil wars that require peacekeeping measures in  keeping with the UN Charter. The concept of Russia's special  responsibility should not lead to a sharp expansion of Russia's  participation in settling the conflicts. Moscow should stick to  the principle: the less direct involvement, the better. At the  same time, this principle cannot be made into an absolute--as  experience shows, in some instances early intervention may  prevent protracted conflicts with serious bloodshed.    3.10.6. All possible support for the export of capital to  spheres profitable for Russia; support for establishing direct  ties between oblasts, rayons, cities, and enterprises.    3.10.7. Purposeful efforts aimed at preserving the positions  of Russian language; increasing at state expense the training of  specialists from neighboring states in Russian institutions of  higher learning.    3.10.8. Russia's policy toward the countries of the former  USSR must be aimed at protecting the rights of all ethnic  minorities. The Russian flag, Moscow must become symbols of  guarantees of minority rights, protection from aggressive  nationalism, from wars and violence. At the same time, on its  own it needs to direct its policy toward the protection of  rights and interests of Russian abroad. In this connection it  appears expedient to create a special state organ coordinating  the work of relevant ministries and agencies.    3.10.9. Taking into account the specificities of history,  geography, and culture of the Baltic states, Russia must have a  special policy with respect to these countries, aimed at  building good-neighbor relations with them as they proceed with  a civilized solution of the problem of ethnic minorities there  and on the condition of taking into account legitimate interests  of Russian security.    3.10.10. The course on "leadership instead of control" is  far  from ideal, including in the opinion of the authors of these  theses. However, it represents the least evil. At the same time,  of all politically available realistic options it seems to meet  to the greatest extent the interests of both Russia and  Russians, and those of citizens of neighboring states interested  ((as published--line(s) missing))  <H5>  4. Policy Toward the Outside World </H5>   4.1. A slow but steady erosion of the security system  created  over the years of the Cold War; the diverse and broad geographic  spread of Russia's political and economic interests; its current  relative weakness; the obstacles preventing quick rapprochement  with the West, which have become apparent by now, require that  we conduct a flexible policy of balancing between the centers of  power, build dynamically the balance of force with individual  states and individual regions that would be advantageous for  Russia.    4.2. The line of rejecting the costly globalist policy must  be continued. The policy must be maximally economical and  commensurate with current abilities. At the same time, Russia  must boost its policy of cooperation and presence in those  regions where there is interest in such cooperation and where it  may bring economic dividends and increase the country's general  political influence. This includes, for example, India, Greece,  Bulgaria, Southeast Europe as a whole, and the Near East.    We need to continue the policy aimed at developing relations  as friendly and close as possible with China.    There is the potential for Russian foreign policy to boost  its presence in the Asian-Pacific region, and interaction within  it with the United States, China, and Japan.    4.3. At the same time, because of historic, geographic, and  cultural specificities of our country, the economic and  technological might of the West, as well as the fact that Russia  at this point does not have natural allies in the South and the  East, its long-term goal should be to establish a stable  realistic partnership, and in the future perhaps a strategic  association, with the northern belt countries--from the United  States and Canada to Japan, gradually involving in it China and  other states. We should continue the course toward including  Russia--and later possibly China--in the activities of the "Big  Seven"--first on a political level.    4.4. It is necessary to conduct a policy aimed at avoiding  the unneeded increase of tensions with the West and, on the  contrary, to aim at establishing with it as close an interaction  as possible in the areas where it is possible--not, however, at  the expense of Russia giving up its own interests, but through  their greater coordination. The dominant contents of relations  should be stable cooperation while expanding the field of  partnership where our interests and the concept for a problem  resolution coincide (for example, nuclear nonproliferation and  other spheres of military-strategic interaction, especially with  the United States). Nor should we preclude a limited and  controlled competition along certain lines (for instance, arms  trade).    4.5. The interests of avoiding isolation and preserving  influence in relations with West Europe, preventing a return to  a military confrontation in Europe, and creating in the future  an effective system of common European security of which Russia  would be a full-fledged member, require preservation of the  semi-demilitarized belt of states that has emerged in the center  of Europe, preventing NATO's expansion, and broadening the  dialog between Russia and NATO, which in the future would make  the issue of expanding the bloc without Russian participation in  its activities moot. Expansion of the zone of prosperity and  stability to include the countries of Central and East Europe  and the fastest possible inclusion of these countries into the  EU would be in Russian national interests overall.    4.6. It is necessary to sharply increase the intensity of  Russian policy in Europe and the efforts aimed at creating in a  long-term future an effective system of collective European  security or at least at preventing the creation of a system that  would exclude Russia to some degree. Keeping in mind the  possibility of NATO's expansion without Russian participation,  it is necessary to increase the efforts to search for  alternative ways to ensure Russia's security and political  interests in Europe.    4.7. Also necessary are special efforts to support and  expand  an intensive dialog and interaction with the leading countries  of the West, especially with Germany and the United States.    4.8. In order to attenuate possible irritants in relations  with the outside world associated with the activation of  integration processes on the territory of the former USSR, it is  expedient to involve the West and other states in an intensive  bilateral dialog on these problems.    4.9. We should not allow the necessary shift in Russian  diplomacy's tone in relations with the West in the direction of  greater independence and equal standing to become a goal in  itself, and the enchantment with words to lead to a new  alienation between Russia and the most advanced and powerful  countries. Russia's realization of its status as one of the  leading great powers must proceed on the basis of restoration of  its economy, the use of existing and the creation of new levers  to influence the situation, the strengthening of Russia's  positions on the territory of the former USSR rather than  through aggressive rhetoric that inflicts direct damage on the  national interests.  <H8>  5. Organizational Measures </H8>   5.1. The main task is to create conditions for the maximum  concentration and coordination of resources and actions of all  agencies toward protection and advancement of foreign policy  interests of the society and the state. Building an effective  structure of organs whose task is to protect the national  interests in the foreign arena is a task of no lesser priority  than developing the policy itself. Specifically, we consider it  expedient to take the following steps:    5.1.1. Considerably increase the president's attention to  foreign policy issues. Dramatically increase the role of  presidential structures in its formulation and coordination,  while retaining the democratic balance and constitutional  responsibility of all branches of authority, including a strong  parliament.    5.1.2. Create in the president's apparat--with the possible  utilization or involvement of the Security Council's apparat, or  on the basis of it--structures capable of effective policy  coordination, possessing personnel capabilities commensurate  with the task and, most important, a proper authorization from  the president. We do not want to preclude the possibility of  raising MFA potential in matters of foreign policy coordination.  Experience tells us, however, that its potential is limited,  especially in the part associated with the policy toward the  countries of the former USSR.    5.1.3. For the president's apparat and under the president's  supervision, to develop, with the participation of agencies and  interagency commissions of the Security Council, continuously  updated directives on individual lines of security policy, in  particular, on foreign policy. After being approved by the  Security Council and the president, these directives must become  mandatory. Violation and nonfulfillment of them without the  president's concurrence on each individual issue must lead to a  practically automatic dismissal of officials permitting such a  violations.    5.1.4. Create a sufficiently powerful structure that would  be  commensurate with the task, capable of formulating in a  comprehensive and effective manner and coordinating  implementation of the policy toward each of the countries of the  former USSR. This may be done by creating a corresponding  department with country desks in the president's apparat, in the  Security Council apparat, by raising the status of the Ministry  on CIS Affairs and creating in it country desks possessing  personnel capabilities and prerogatives to coordinate the  activities of agencies, or through a corresponding strengthening  of the MFA. There probably are other options. One thing is  clear--it is impermissible to continue the status quo.    5.1.5. It is expedient to set up a special unit in the  president's apparat that would conduct state information  activities on the issue of foreign policy in strict coordination  with the MFA.    5.2. Special measures of an organizational, as well as a  financial and moral nature, must be implemented in order to save  and strengthen the cadres corps of the diplomatic establishment,  the officer corps of enforcement ministries, whose role at the  current stage of our history will inevitably grow not only from  the standpoint of maintaining internal stability, but also in  conducting a policy of prevention and regulation of crises in a  number of regions of the former USSR, collection of relevant  information, and support of the political and economic interests  of Russia.    5.3. Keeping in mind the increasing influence of the armed  forces in modern political life of Russia, the state leadership,  and first and foremost the Ministry of Defense itself, as well  as the leadership of other enforcement ministries, should not  only facilitate development of civilian control over the armed  forces, but also develop and implement a program for integrating  the officer corps into civilian society. It is also necessary to  develop a comprehensive program for raising the social status  and prestige of military service. Rapprochement with and support  for the officer corps is also a task for new elites, first and  foremost entrepreneurs, who have a stake in the country's stable  development.    5.4. Members of the working group do not claim that the  recommendations on reforming the bodies involved in foreign  policy are exhaustive. It is clear, however, that a reform is  long overdue. The current situation inflicts serious damage on  the country's international positions and prestige, and weakens  its national security.</p>

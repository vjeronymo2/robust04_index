			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Steady hands deliver a bucket of cold water / Sizing up the attorney-general AFTER THE excitable scenes surrounding Tuesday's Commons attack on the Serious Fraud Office by Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, it fell yesterday to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to throw a bucket of cold water over the smouldering affair. He did not disappoint. Sir Nicholas, as attorney-general the government's senior legal adviser and the man charged with policing the processes of prosecution outside Scotland, is not one of Westminster's more charismatic characters. Aged 54, he is the epitome of the cool top-drawer barrister who, it could easily be forgotten, is also a politician. He has a dual role which has increasingly prompted some lawyers to question whether it is any longer appropriate to have someone elected on a party label who is also on hand to provide key legal advice. Regarded as a paid-up member of the 'safe pair of hands' club, he restored an air of considered calm to yesterday's Commons proceedings, praising the SFO for its record and pledging a system of prosecution conducted without 'fear or favour, affection or ill-will'. Only once, in response to a jibe from Mr Dennis Skinner, did he raise his voice, admonishing the Labour MP for Bolsover for asking 'idiotic questions'. Before entering parliament for super-safe Hemel Hempstead - now Mid-Bedfordshire - in 1979, Sir Nicholas specialised in commercial and industrial law and gained a reputation as a tenacious if somewhat unglamourous advocate. He became attorney-general after last year's general election. His previous jobs were social security minister and solicitor-general. Sir Nicholas has attracted his fair share of controversy. He came under attack for his advice to ministers in the Matrix Churchill case that they had no alternative but to ask the courts to prevent publication of official documents where publication was against the public interest. He was also criticised for his advice over the social opt-out clause of the Maastricht bill and for his handling of the row over whether the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations apply to the contracting-out of public services. Sir Nicholas's standing among barristers remains high. Since entering parliament he has been given credit by the Bar for having appeared in court far more often than his predecessors. One QC said: 'His main disadvantage is that he didn't gain much experience at the Bar in the administrative and regulatory issues that he is now having to deal with.' Not everything has gone smoothly for Sir Nicholas away from Westminster. He is one of a number of senior Conservative politicians who face huge losses as a result of their membership of Lloyd's. Sir Nicholas became a Name in 1973 and last year was a member of 23 syndicates - including two which have made big losses.</p>

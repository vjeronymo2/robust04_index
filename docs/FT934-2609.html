			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Banks criticise new Basle committee plan Leading banks have stepped up their criticism of proposals from the Basle-based committee of international regulators to make them set aside additional capital to cover risks in foreign exchange, securities and derivatives trading. A report from the Institute of International Finance, the Washington-based group representing 175 international banks, said the proposals would make it harder to compare banks' financial soundness. It is the strongest criticism of the proposals on market, foreign exchange and interest risk which the Basle committee put forward this year to complement capital adequacy rules for credit risk. Produced by a group including several banks most heavily involved in securities and derivatives trading, the report says a 'significant weakness' of the proposals is that they could undermine the clarity of the capital adequacy framework. Under this framework, banks must hold capital equivalent to 8 per cent of their assets weighted by credit risk. But the new Basle risk proposals could vary this figure depending on an individual bank's exposures in areas such as foreign exchange and derivatives. The report suggests this problem could be eased either by banks disclosing the capital they must hold for each risk, or by market risk capital requirements being converted to the same formula as that for credit risk so a single capital adequacy figure is retained. The report says a number of changes are needed to satisfy the aim of establishing a level playing field for banks trading in securities, derivatives and foreign exchange: Banks with better risk management systems than that proposed by the Basle committee should not have to operate parallel systems. Banking conglomerates should be allowed to consolidate risks and capital requirements across their trading entities. Banks should not have to report daily to supervisors on their risk exposures and capital position. Financial options should not be weighted by risk purely according to changes in the price of the underlying asset. Banks should not have to set aside capital to cover interest-rate risks which are already covered by market risk capital. Mr John Haseltine, the institute's deputy managing director, said banks wanted to avoid having to duplicate risk management systems, which would place them at a cost disadvantage to securities houses or unregulated non-financial institutions. The Basle proposals coincide with growing concern among bank regulators over the potential risks in derivatives trading.</p>

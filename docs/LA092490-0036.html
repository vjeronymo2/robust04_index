			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Designing Sendak: Original paintings by artist Maurice Sendak created for the  L.A. Music Center Opera's new production of Mozart's "Idomeneo" will go on  exhibit Tuesday at Every Picture Tells a Story . . . , the Los Angeles gallery  devoted to original art from children's literature. Sendak, who has created and  illustrated more than 30 books, including "Higglety Pigglety Pop," "In the  Night Kitchen" and "Where the Wild Things Are," said he has had a lifelong  ambition to design the Mozart opera, an epic tale of the Trojan War.  </P> <P> The opera will also premiere Tuesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Sendak  has created sets for other operas, including works based on "Where the Wild  Things Are" and "Higglety Pigglety Pop," which also have been presented by the  Music Center Opera.

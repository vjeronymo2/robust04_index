			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burton in Pounds 153m property sale Burton, the clothing retail group which includes Debenhams, Burtons and Dorothy Perkins, is ending its foray into the property business with the sale of its four remaining shopping centres to Prudential Assurance for Pounds 153m. The group yesterday also revealed increased pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to February 26 of Pounds 36m. However, last year's Pounds 24.7m was after restructuring costs of Pounds 11.9m. Prudential effectively completes the policy of Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, of withdrawing from the property market. Burton's property ventures began in the 1980s. But it has written off almost Pounds 340m against its office blocks and shopping centres since 1990. With its remaining property portfolio - including an office block in St Albans still to be sold, and an office development being sold for Pounds 14.5m - in the books at Pounds 122m, the expected net surplus from the shopping centre sale is Pounds 20m. That will be taken in the full-year profit and loss account. The property deal overshadowed continued problems in the retail businesses, where group sales fell to Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 1.07bn). Sales at Debenhams, where Mr Hoerner began his 'recovery programme' before moving to head the group, increased by 5 per cent, but sales in the high street chains fell 5.5 per cent. Trading profits at Debenhams rose from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 44.2m, but the multiples slid from a Pounds 18.5m profit into a Pounds 4.5m loss. Trouble spots were Top Shop and Top Man, where an attempt to focus on 16 to 19-year-olds proved popular with the target audience but alienated older customers. A 6 per cent fall in sales transformed a Pounds 1.8m profit into a Pounds 7.3m loss. Mr Hoerner added that a refit and new range at Principles, which proved to be too upmarket, had led to a 16 per cent fall in sales. Losses grew to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 2.9m). 'The one thing I will say about Burton is our mistakes have been beautifully executed,' he joked. Sales and profits also fell at Burtons and Dorothy Perkins, due to the upheavals of modernising shops and repositioning ranges, but revamped stores were trading well. Evans, the chain aimed at larger women, increased profits to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 4.1m). Gross margins fell by 1.6 percentage points in the period, mainly because of increased mark-downs. Efforts towards recovery include Townprint - a review and restructuring of the store portfolio. The interim dividend is held at 1p, with earnings up from 1.4p to 1.9p a share.</p>

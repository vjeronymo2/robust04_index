			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unclear route ahead for transport leaser - Andrew Bolger looks at Tiphook's proposed disposal of its container operations Will Tiphook, the transport leasing company, have any future after it has sold off its main asset to reduce a crippling debt burden? That is the question which shareholders and US bondholders were wrestling with yesterday, as they considered long-awaited details of the proposed disposal of Tiphook's container business to Transamerica, the US financial services group. The answer is by no means clear. The group's current debts of Pounds 1.1bn will be substantially reduced by the proceeds of the sale, even although the price has fallen from the surprisingly high Pounds 830m first announced in November to the latest figure: a minimum of Pounds 690m. A further Pounds 44m will be placed in an escrow account, but that will be subject to further claims by Transamerica. Even the sale is not yet certain, since it is subject to approval by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on March 10. In reality, they have little choice: the accompanying circular makes it clear that should the disposal be blocked, the group would be forced into liquidation - leaving investors with nothing. The group's main banks - led by National Westminster and Commerzbank of Germany - have decided to soldier on, although some of the smaller and more restive banks have had their loans paid off. One analyst said: 'The big lenders realise that if any one of them puts the company into receivership, it would just cause a financial meltdown.' A greater threat comes from US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m (Pounds 479m) and as unsecured lenders are in a more exposed position. Seeking to deflect the bondholders' anger, Tiphook has proposed that up to Pounds 193m of the sale proceeds be used to purchase 40 per cent of the US bonds at par. The tender offer is more than some bondholders had expected at this stage, but the group still faces litigation in the US from bondholders claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions about Tiphook's prospects. The group's debt was downgraded to so-called junk-bond status within months of issue last year. Tiphook's circular warns that a class action launched by US bondholders could, if successful, make the group liable to the full Dollars 700m raised in the US. One analyst said: 'If they were to lose anything like that sort of amount, it would all be over.' Even assuming shareholder approval for the container sale and the avoidance of a doomsday judgment in the US courts, Tiphook's future looks precarious. After the disposal, Tiphook will still have debts of about Pounds 500m and shareholders funds will fall to about Pounds 40m, minus whatever the company loses in the second half to April. A refinancing will therefore be necessary sooner rather than later. The circular says plans for the remaining group rest on a number of key assumptions: There will be a general economic recovery throughout Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany, and trading performance would improve in line with improved conditions; The group will reduce its overheads significantly, and improve working capital management; The group will realise Pounds 25m from the disposal of surplus and obsolete portions of its fleet and excess properties; About half of the Pounds 44m placed in escrow for the containers will be released in due course to the group. The document further emphasises that the group has commitments to buy Pounds 160m worth of trailers in 1996, for which it will have to find finance. It could also suffer material losses from its currency exposure, since it will have dollar-denominated debt unmatched by significant dollar assets or income. One analyst estimated that the reduced trailer and rail rental business employs about Pounds 500m of capital and should be able to make operating profits of at least Pounds 60m. Assuming interest payments of Pounds 40m, that would yield pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m. Observers have also been struck by the extent of the boardroom clear-out. Apart from Mr Rupert Hambro, who joined in 1990 and will become non-executive chairman, and the resilient founder, Mr Robert Montague, only two members of the board survive. Mr Andrew Chandler, 37, joined the board last August as finance director, while Mr Kenneth Dick, 81, has been a non-executive since 1986. Legal reasons concerning the group's new arrangements with the banks were cited as the case for the resignations of two non-executives - Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who is also a non-executive director of National Westminster, and Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman of Commerzbank. Tiphook will appoint a new permanent chairman and will also seek further non-executives. Given the huge financial and trading uncertainties which the group still faces, these may not prove easy jobs to fill. One analyst said: 'Tiphook will have a big credibility problem for the foreseeable future.'</p>

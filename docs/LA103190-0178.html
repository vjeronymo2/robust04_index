			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TYSON ASSAULT CASE GOES TO JURY  </P> <P> The Mike Tyson assault case went to the jury today after the fighter's attorney  accused the woman who sued of concocting the allegations as a way to get rich  quick.  </P> <P> Her lawyer, however, urged jurors in closing arguments to believe her version  of events because she had the "courage and guts" to take on the former world  heavyweight champion.  </P> <P> Sandra Miller, a 26-year-old computer operator from Queens, claims that Tyson  grabbed her buttocks and breasts, cursed at her and threatened to punch her  after she refused his advances at a Manhattan dance club Dec. 10, 1988.  </P> <P> Tyson, who testified during the three-day trial, acknowledges that he was at  Bentley's Disco that night but denies knowing or ever touching Miller.  </P> <P> Miller is seeking up to $3.5 million in civil damages for assault and battery.  </P></p>

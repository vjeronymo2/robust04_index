			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Zurich Insurance lifts income and payout ZURICH INSURANCE said both its life and non-life businesses contributed to an 11.7 per cent rise in net income in 1991 to SFr431.8m (Dollars 284.00m). The group is raising its dividends and launching a one-for-eight rights issue to raise SFr310m. The voting and bearer shares and participation certificates will then be split, so as to double the number of shares and PCs issued. Gross premiums rose 13.2 per cent to SFr19.2bn last year, with acquisitions contributing about a third of the growth and the weakening of the Swiss franc another third. Investment income rose 15.5 per cent to SFr3.7bn with total investments amounting to SFr59bn at the end of the year compared with SFr50bn. Consolidated capital and surplus rose 15 per cent to SFr6.9bn before appropriation of the 1991 profit. The directors propose dividends on the old equity base of registered and bearer shares of SFr70, compared with SFr66, and on the participation certificates SFr35 compared with SFr33. The rights will cost around SFr1,100 for each SFr100 par value registered and bearer share, and SFr550 for each SFr50 participation certificate. Most of the proceeds of the issue will be applied to doubling the par value of the shares and PCs. They will then be split two-for-one. Zurich has also decided to remove its ban on registering foreign owners of its registered shares, but has established in its place a 3 per cent limit on any individual holding of the registered shares. Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said the transactions were aimed at improving liquidity of the group's equity and providing shareholders an additional tax efficient return on their investment. The funds were being raised now because stock market conditions were favourable. They would be used to finance current business.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Investors may be given a chance to buy large Ashanti Gold stake INVESTORS MAY soon be able to buy into Ashanti Goldfields Corporation of Ghana, which operates one of the world's biggest and richest gold mines. But Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate which owns 45 per cent of Ashanti, will not provide any of the shares. Lonrho, which is being pressed by the City to reduce its debt, had no intention of disposing of any of its Ashanti holding - 'not in the medium, or the long-term' - insisted Mr Sam Jonah, managing director of the gold mining company, at a meeting of the Association of Mining Analysts in London. Mr Paul Tarsh, the Lonrho director responsible for its mining operations, added: 'Not only would we not sell, we would love to buy some more of Ashanti.' Mr Jonah revealed that the Ghana government, which owns the rest of Ashanti, was exploring the possibility of selling some or all of its stake in the company - perhaps by floating Ashanti on the local stock exchange to encourage this fledgling institution. 'The initiative is coming from the government, not Lonrho,' Mr Jonah said. Ashanti produced 569,452 troy ounces of gold in the year to September 31 at a cash cost of under Dollars 170 an ounce, placing it among the world's lowest-cost producers. Mr Jonah said that production would increase to 630,000 ounces this year, and added that the company had sold forward about 25 per cent of this at an average of Dollars 375 an ounce. Gold's price closed in London on Friday at Dollars 341.85. Ashanti was about the start a Dollars 300m expansion project to boost output to 1m ounces of gold a year by 1995 at a cash cost of Dollars 168 an ounce. Half the finance would be generated internally and the rest would be borrowed. Ashanti's debt at present was only 20 per cent of equity and the company was talking to five banks willing to provide project finance. Mr Jonah said Ashanti now had proven and probable gold reserves of 9.5m ounces. Total reserves, including those in the 'possible' category, were 22.1m ounces of gold or 97m tonnes of ore with 7 grams of gold per tonne. Ashanti's mining concession covered 125 square miles and 'we believe we have touched only a small part of the resources. We will continue to explore aggressively because there is even greater long-term potential.'</p>

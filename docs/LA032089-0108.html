			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO GREEN LIGHT TO TIGHTENED MONEY POLICY;  </P> <P> BRADY DISCOUNTS INFLATION FEARS IN PRICE HIKES  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady today played down last Friday's 1% rise in  February wholesale prices, saying that some other economic indicators have  shown softness recently.  </P> <P> "Some are up, some are down . . . the balance is in the middle right now,"  Brady said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show.  </P> <P> Brady noted that retail sales and the operating rate of American manufacturing  industries had both declined in February.  </P> <P> "I'm very optimistic right now," he said about inflation.  </P> <P> Recent reports have also shown declines in imports and industrial output,  further indicating a slowing economy.  </P> <P> Asked whether the rise in wholesale inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve  to raise interest rates, Brady described Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as  competent and said, "I have great confidence in him. He has to do what he has  to do."  </P> <P> Pressed to elaborate, Brady said he is not giving a green light with his  comments to the Fed to tighten monetary policy.  </P> <P> The Administration and the Fed have had a running battle over inflation and  interest rates since President Bush took office.  </P> <P> The Administration for its part must work to reduce the federal budget deficit,  Brady said.  </P> <P> The stock market fell sharply Friday after the Producer Price Index was  released, but Brady said he was not worried.  </P> <P> "Stock markets go up and down. We'll just have to watch," Brady said.  </P></p>

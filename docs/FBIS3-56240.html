"In the three months that have passed  since the Ukrainian president issued the directive on the  privatization of unfinished construction facilities and their  land, virtually nothing has been done," stated Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy. Of the 9,200 unfinished construction facilities  earmarked for privatization, in the words of State Property Fund  Chairman Volodymyr Pryadko, only 3 have been sold after three  months.    The following were named by the participants as being among  the causes suppressing progress on this matter: The  privatization scheme is bulky; there are no potential buyers or  investors due to the financial and payment crisis; privatization  is being carried out in tough conditions and there is nothing to  gain financially.    The opinion of Ukrainian Construction and Architecture  Minister Yuriy Serbin's is that, in holding up the privatization  of unfinished construction facilities, "it has turned out that  the culprits are state administrations that are unwilling to  give up the facilities they think they need, though lacking  funds to complete their construction."    One of the ways to speed up privatization, Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy  believes, is through "personal responsibility of local leaders  regarding the implementation of presidential directives." He  added: "Our president is very liberal. One should punish  administratively rather than trying to talk them round."</p>

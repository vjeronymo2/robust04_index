			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The technical correction that has been under way in the London Metal Exchange TIN Market over the past week continued yesterday when the cash price fell by another Dollars 175 to Dollars 6,820 a tonne. Dealers said the fall, which took the fall over the last six trading days to Dollars 340 a tonne, was also influenced by Chinese and Brazilian selling. For NICKEL, in contrast, Chinese buying was an underpinning factor as the cash price regained another Dollars 70 of its recent fall to reach Dollars 7,495 a tonne. The GOLD price maintained this week's uptrend with a 70 cent rise to Dollars 352.55 a troy ounce. At the London Bullion Market's morning fixing it had reached a 5-month high of Dollars 353.15 an ounce, prompting one dealer to comment: 'People are looking for excuses to hold gold whereas before they were looking for excuses to sell it'. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA was back on the downward path, with the September delivery position closing at Pounds 584 a tonne, down Pounds 13 on the day. Dealers said trading was subdued and thought the market was set for a period of consolidation after retreating Pounds 48 from Monday's 2 1/2 -month peak. Compiled from Reuters</p>

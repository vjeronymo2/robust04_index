			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASEBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> NAY'S PITCHING HELPS RANCHO SANTIAGO ADVANCE  </P> <P> The ease with which Rancho Santiago College dispatched Mt. San Jacinto from the  Southern California Regional playoffs Saturday was impressive.  </P> <P> Rob Nay pitched a five-hitter and the Dons won, 12-0, in the second game to win  the series two games to one. Rancho Santiago had won, 6-4, Friday.  </P> <P> The Dons were overpowering in the second game Saturday after struggling in the  first game, an 8-7 loss.  </P> <P> In the loss, Rancho Santiago had only seven hits and left eight runners on base  in the final four innings.  </P> <P> But Mt. San Jacinto, the 15th-seeded team, was out of pitching in the second  game and Rancho Santiago, the No. 2 seed, still had Nay, a sophomore  left-hander.  </P> <P> Nay (6-1) allowed hits to the first two batters he faced, but got a double play  to help escape the jam. The Rancho Santiago infield turned double plays in the  second and fourth innings as well.  </P> <P> Nay had two walks and five strikeouts and Mt. San Jacinto (21-23) advanced a  runner to third base only twice.  </P> <P> "Nay did another (good) job for us," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said.  "He's done it when we needed him most. He had a good fastball and he kept them  off balance with his curve."  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago (34-10) scored three runs in the third and four in the fourth.  Conrad Colby had a sacrifice fly and Jeff White added a two-run single in the  third.  </P> <P> Brian Criss had an RBI double, Shaun Sterling had an RBI groundout and the  final two runs were scored on an error and a wild pitch in the fourth.  </P> <P> Colby had RBI singles in the sixth and the eighth and Greg Martineau hit a  three-run home run in the eighth for Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> Martineau, who hit a three-run home run in the first game as well, has seven  this season.  </P> <P> Martineau hit fourth in the second game as Sneddon continued to shuffle his  lineup.  </P> <P> Marty Neff, who had been hitting fourth most of the season, was moved to the  sixth spot because of a slump. He was one for 12 with two RBIs in the three  playoff games.  </P> <P> Chris Floth hit fourth and Martineau fifth in the first game, but it was  Floth's failed bunt that hurt Rancho Santiago in the first game. Rancho  Santiago trailed, 8-7, in the ninth, but Steve Grack singled and Colby walked.  Floth took two strikes before flying out.  </P> <P> Martineau hit into a force play and Neff grounded out to end the game.  </P> <P> Jay Hassel (6-2), pitching in relief of starter Matt Lackie, took the loss.  Lackie, who had pitched once in the last three weeks before Saturday because of  a viral infection, allowed eight hits and five runs, four earned, in three-plus  innings.  </P> <P> The second round, which starts Friday, is double elimination and will be played  at two sites. The pairings will be announced today. The tentative schedule is  Rancho Santiago playing Riverside and Moorpark against Fullerton at Riverside;  at Cerritos, L.A. Harbor will play Rio Hondo and Golden West will take on San  Bernardino Valley.  </P> <P> In other playoff games:  </P> <P> Golden West 8, Cuesta 2 -- James Hutchins (6-2) pitched a four-hitter to lead  host Golden West (27-12-1). Mark Magrann had four hits and Steve McKowen, Gary  Christopherson, Gerad Cawhorn and Mike Willey had two hits for Golden West.  Shelby Hart also had two sacrifice flies.  </P> <P> Fullerton 3-9, Canyons 7-5 -- Fullerton rallied in the second game to advance.  Canyons led, 5-1, after three innings in the second game, but Fullerton's Jim  Short had a sacrifice fly to give Fullerton a 6-5 lead. Tom Wilson added an RBI  single.  </P> <P> Crosby Spencer and Jeff Manship hit home runs in the eight for Fullerton  (26-14).  </P> <P> Matt Lipscomb (3-3) pitched a six-hitter, allowing only one hit after the  third. It was his first complete game this season.  </P></p>

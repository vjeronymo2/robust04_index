			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US clampdown on rose imports The US has imposed an anti-dumping tariff on Ecuadorian and Colombian roses. The US Commerce Department has determined that US growers had suffered injury by Ecuadorian and Colombian producers and penalised them with 50 per cent and 33 per cent tariffs respectively. Ecuadorian flower growers argue that the US Commerce Department incorrectly applied its standards. Because no comparable domestic market exists for the type of roses they export, three of the four companies investigated by the US were judged by a third country comparison. The new tariff comes only a year after the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) eliminated import tariffs on flowers from the Andean region. The tariff is a blow to efforts to promote alternative crops intended to replace the cultivation of coca. Ecuador exported approximately Dollars 30m worth of flowers last year and expected sales of Dollars 45m this year, of which approximately 70 per cent are roses. Colombia's total flower exports equalled Dollars 381m in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAUBLES, BANGLES AND BRAIDS  </P> <P> Long hair is still in style, and it's anything but boring -- innovative hair  ornaments made of everything from silk to marble are becoming a must. Gone are  high-maintenance, moussed hairdos -- replaced with clasped, knotted or pinned  sculptural ponytails, braids and chignons.  </P> <P> Astute jewelry and beauty-industry designers are creating ornaments rich in  color and baroque in shape to match current fashion trends. Materials include  fabric, wood, metals, wire, acrylics and gold leaf. Bejeweled or sculpted hair  sticks secure a bun or French twist, while the common hair bow adopts the more  sophisticated look of stainless steel mesh. And don't settle for a plain old  rubber band to hold hair in place -- go for a wired silk rope or spiral of  copper, which lends elegance to even a simple ponytail. LISA THACKABERRY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Two Thousand Residents Take to the </F> Streets Demanding That China Release Xi Yang"]    [Text] A "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" organized by 123  groups staged a demonstration yesterday. About 2,000 residents  started from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong Branch  of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to lodge a protest and urge the  Chinese authorities to release MING PAO reporter Xi Yang. This  was the largest protest since the sentencing of Xi Yang.    The demonstrators first held a brief gathering in Chater  Garden and set off at 1530. About 2,000 demonstrators, holding  a dozen or so streamers and a large number of placards, chanted  slogans like "Release Xi Yang," "Release Tian Ye," "Defend Press  Freedom," and "Oppose Black Box Operations" along the way. With  representatives of organizations and legislative councillors  holding a large black steamer at the front of the procession,  they set off from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in Happy Valley through  Queensway, Hennessy Road, and Percival Street.    The demonstrators included MING PAO staff members and  workers, people from other press agencies, three-tier  councillors, mass organization members, and residents. Along  the way they chanted slogans and sang songs, including "We Shall  Overcome" and "Unity," while at the same time distributing  leaflets and asking onlookers to join. While they were  marching, a large number of pedestrians stopped to watch and  people in residential buildings stuck their heads out to look.  Some pedestrians joined the demonstration to express their  support.    The police made special traffic arrangements along the way  so  that the demonstrators could pass through.    The demonstrators sat down on the opposite side of the  XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY on Queen's Road East, where they held a gathering,  during which four speakers spoke. Subsequently, a member of the  joint action read out a statement.    In the statement, the "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang"  demanded that the Chinese authorities immediately rescind all  the charges against Xi Yang and Tian Ye and release them; it  should announce all the details of the case and affix the  responsibility for this; it should revise the relevant law and  practice freedom of the press.    In her speech at the gathering, Li Yuet-wah, chairman of the  Hong Kong Journalists' Association, said: As the 1997 power  transfer is approaching, Hong Kong reporters will face heavier  pressure and this is something to be expected, but unexpectedly,  these reporters will have to carry out 12 years of combat for Xi  Yang's sake.    She continued: The Xi Yang case has sounded the alarm for  the prospects of Hong Kong's press freedom, but as long as Hong  Kong residents and reporters work with one heart and one mind,  there will still be hope for Hong Kong's press freedom.    MING PAO employees' representative Lam Man-chong said: The  Xi Yang case is not an unfortunate matter for Xi Yang alone, nor  is it only a concern of MING PAO employees, it is an important  matter of how to maintain Hong Kong people's free lifestyle.    Legislative Councillor Szeto Wah and Lau Shan-ching, a pro-  democracy activist who had been jailed for 10 years by China,  also said at the gathering that China's secret trial of Xi Yang  violated Chinese law, was unfair to Xi Yang, and affected Hong  Kong's press freedom.    After the reading of the statement, more than a dozen mass  representatives marched to gate of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY amid  slogans and songs, and stuck the statement and a streamer on the  gate. The gathering ended at 1800 and the 2,000 demonstrators  peacefully dispersed.    Yeung Ying-wai, assistant police commander of the Wanchai  District, indicated that the police had sent about 180 policemen  to the scene to help open a route for the demonstrators, adding  that the demonstration proceeded in good order.    The "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" will hold a candle-lit  night party in the Clock Tower square in Tsim Sha Tsui this  coming Saturday for Xi Yang's release.</p>

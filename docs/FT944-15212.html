			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sprint soars 29% in term as cellular side surges Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company, claimed an 'outstanding' third quarter with net income up 29 per cent to Dollars 230m, or 66 cents a share. The fastest growth came in cellular operations, where operating profits were almost tripled at Dollars 32m. This was almost 30 per cent more than the division made in the whole of 1993, Sprint said. Profits from long-distance calls were up 31 per cent at Dollars 165m, with intense competition in the consumer market offset by growth in business services. The long-distance division had made record sales and operating profits for nine quarters in a row, Sprint said. In local calls, sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.11bn, with the number of local access lines installed up nearly 5 per cent. However, operating profit was ahead only 1 per cent as a result of lower call charges. 'In the fourth quarter, we will continue to adjust prices to position ourselves more competitively in the market-place,' Sprint said. The number of Sprint's cellular customers grew 64 per cent year-on-year to 882,000. This was the eighth successive quarter in which numbers had grown by more than 50 per cent, Sprint said. Group sales rose 13 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 3.23bn. Interest payable fell 14 per cent to Dollars 99m, and operating cash flow was Dollars 837m. Sprint said it was confident its planned Dollars 1.9bn capital investment programme could be carried out without recourse to external finance.</p>

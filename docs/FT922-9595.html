			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: RBS sinks to Pounds 48m after more debt charges - Decision to sell all or part of Charterhouse confirmed A FURTHER rise in provisions for bad debts hit pre-tax profits at Royal Bank of Scotland in the six months to March 31. The charge increased Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 168.1m and pre-tax profits fell 34 per cent from Pounds 72.4m to Pounds 48m. But the bank said that the figures were a slight improvement compared with the second half of last year, and is maintaining its dividend at 2.8p. Earnings per share fell to 2.9p (6.1p). Profits before provisions and tax rose by 5 per cent from Pounds 206.7m to Pounds 216.1m. Branch banking, the bank's biggest sector in terms of capital employed, saw its contribution drop from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 7.8m, although profits from corporate and institutional banking rose from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 36.5m. Mr George Younger, chairman, said the last year had experienced the worst world recession in post-war years. There were no clear signs of an end to recessionary conditions, and the rest of the financial year would be difficult, with bad debt provisions likely to remain high. However, the restructuring, which involved the loss of 1,000 senior posts, had achieved its aim of introducing a new culture to the bank. Costs were being brought under control and lending procedures improved. Mr Younger confirmed the bank's decision to sell all or part of Charterhouse, the merchant bank which achieved a marginal increase in profits from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.3m. Charterhouse would benefit from 'a larger European dimension.' Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said that owning a merchant bank was not 'synergistic' with a clearing bank and prevented the latter from developing services. He would not comment on progress in selling Charterhouse, beyond saying 'we are moving forward in measured fashion.' The financial services division increased its profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 7.9m. There was good growth from Direct Line, the motor insurance company, and Royal Scottish Assurance. In the US, Citizens Financial Group increased its profit from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 8.9m despite higher provisions. Royal Bank's total expenses rose 7.9 per cent. Reduced staff numbers helped offset a 7 per cent pay rise. The cost:income ratio rose from 64.9 per cent to 65.6 per cent. Assets rose to Pounds 34.2bn (Pounds 32.2bn). Mr Mathewson said the bank's performance would improve as the economy recovered and reduced bad debts, insurance earnings rose - to account for 20 per cent of pre-tax profit by 1995, and higher fee income and lower costs, particularly in branch banking.

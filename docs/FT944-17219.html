			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Financial sector growth falters A picture of faltering recovery emerges from a survey of the financial services sector released today by the Confederation of British Industry. The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey finds business activity in the sector flattened in the third quarter in spite of expectations of a marked rise in the previous quarter. Expectations in the sector are the least positive since March last year, although growth is expected to resume in the next three months after sustained growth in the first half of the year. Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the CBI, said: 'The pause in activity may well be only temporary, particularly if expectations of moderate growth in the months ahead are fully met.' The results show a mixed picture in the industry. Banks, fund managers and finance houses reported the strongest increase in business in the last quarter while life insurers and building societies reported the sharpest falls. Mr Alan Wooley, head of financial services marketing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said confidence remained lowest among building societies because of the lack of recovery in the housing market. Overall, profitability rose for the 11th consecutive quarter and at the fastest rate since the end of last year because of falls in costs combined with rises in income. Employment rose slightly following the trend set in the last quarter after almost four years. The CBI concluded that demand would continue to be the main constraint on business prospects in the year ahead. Export orders for manufacturers in the West Midlands have continued to rise, but domestic demand is flat, says a survey by the chambers of commerce in the region.

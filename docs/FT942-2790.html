			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: From airwaves to across the waves It has been a busy and expensive week for Emap. On Monday it announced plans to make a bid for local radio group Trans World Communications which would see it pay about Pounds 50m for the 70 per cent it does not already own. Then yesterday the media and exhibitions group announced it faced a likely bill of over Pounds 108m after a shopping spree in France's magazine market. Emap intends to fund the acquisitions with debt, pushing its gearing to a level that would usually raise City eyebrows. Although it will take the French magazine titles on to its balance sheet at cost it is unlikely to do so with Trans World's radio licences, which have a fixed term. The resulting goodwill write-off would leave it with gearing of about 100 per cent at the end of March 1995. In August this year, the low point of its cashflow cycle, the figure will be higher still. But Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that gearing was 'totally irrelevant' for Emap and pointed to likely interest cover of seven times this year. 'This should prove a very good long-term deal for Emap although it will be dilutive this year,' said Mr Blackley who has trimmed his current year forecast from Pounds 56.5m to Pounds 55m. The main acquisition, Editions Mondiales, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m for 1993 on turnover, after discounts, of about Pounds 111m. Its accounts were qualified by the auditors but Emap said this related to goodwill write-offs and unspecified rationalisation costs which were irrelevant to its valuation of the business. About 40 per cent of turnover comes from Tele Poche, one of France's top five TV listings magazines. It is also strong in the women's, outdoor pursuits and motoring sectors where Emap has similar titles in the UK. The acquisitions, which together employ some 800 people in Paris, will come under the control of Mr Kevin Hand, chief executive of Emap's consumer magazines division.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francois Jeanne: "Language: Object Mechanisms </F> Enhance New Ada Norm"]    [Text] The Ada 9X norm, due for release around the  end of 1994, includes the object mechanisms it was lacking to  really compete with a language like C++. Ada's promoters now  envision a planetary future for it.    In step with its upgrades (Ada 83 in 1983, Ada 9X next  September), the Ada language, invented by the French around the  end of the 1970s for the DOD (the U.S. Department of Defense),  has been jogging along in its quiet way.    But watch out! This time, urged by its large-scale  industrial  users worldwide, its additional features have to do with  object-oriented programming and enhancement of the language's  real-time characteristics. Ada thus becomes a serious challenger  to C++, in the object-oriented language sphere as well as in  that of real time.    After the hopes to which the start of the preceding decade  had given rise, the Ada market never really took off. Different  estimating methods put it today in the vicinity of $220 million  annually (see box). "The fault lies with serious marketing  problems," says Marie-France Mignon, communications director at  Alsys. "Ada can be installed only by specialists; and efforts  aimed at students have been insufficient. We are seeking to  remedy this situation, since it is they who open the doors for  us to new accounts where force of habit, indeed lack of  information, tend to result in the use of C++."    C++! Voila their nemesis. Still reluctant to acknowledge it  though, the extraordinary success Bjorn Soustrup's language  enjoyed during the 1980s is sufficiently solidly based to rouse  the passions of Ada's supporters. All precautions were taken  from the very outset with respect to standardization and  responses to the needs of users. C++'s gains are all the more  infuriating in that "historic" Ada clients, specifically the  defense industries, are gradually surrendering to the fad.    The Ada 9X norm project, once accepted (for the moment, it  is  being examined by the ISO [International Standards  Organization]), is expected to respond, at least from the  technical viewpoint initially, to the advances C++ has achieved.  "This new edition is in keeping with a contractual requirement  for a review of Ada every 10 years by the ISO," says Pascal  Plisson, who heads the defining of Ada products at Alsys.    Specifically, Ada 9X will enhance the language in two  principal directions. Object-oriented programming occupies a  preponderant place, since Ada will now have more robust  inheritance capabilities and polymorphisms of execution, two  essential characteristics for valid support of the object  archetype. Prototyping tests, which in particular enabled the  DOD to launch the Ada Gnu product, revealed compaction gains by  a factor of 5 with respect to the code of certain Booch software  components (named after the American creator of the method).  This should greatly improve its reusability and readability  characteristics.    Real-time applications can also be expected to benefit from  recent work that takes into account asynchronous models through  the addition of a type of protected codes. Alsys reports gains  in execution by a factor of 3 during recent prototypings, with  respect to the so-called "rendezvous" mechanism used in Ada 83.    In addition, Ada 9X will now support the 8-bit international  ASCII character set, which is expected to open the doors of the  Japanese market a little wider to it. The language is also to be  further opened to the outside world, possibly giving rise to  programs written in Fortran and C, for example.    And recent disclosures indicate that, upon submitting  application for certification, each supplier will be asked to  choose an applicative option. The choices offered will be:  parallel processing, scientific computing, or distributed  systems. "Approximately 90 percent of the kernel of a compiler  will be common to all; the remaining 10 percent will depend on  the option chosen by the supplier," says Pascal Plisson.  <H5>  9X Products Beginning in 1994 </H5>   Alsys plans to launch a first product under the new norm  around the beginning of 1994. Verdix prefers to more cautiously  await a justification of this shift, based on demand by clients  loyal to Ada (generally speaking, Americans, who are very  sensitive to the recommendations of the DOD). "We do not want to  run the risk of disappointing them with products that may lack  sufficient robustness," says its director for Europe, Olivier  Roubine. The strategy that Verdix (Vadspro line) and its new  partner Rational (Apex, under UNIX) intend to follow will be to  provide real-time extensions to their compilers, beginning in  the second quarter of 1994, and object-language extensions in  the third quarter.    The 9X movement, and Ada's intent to offer C++ serious  competition within two years from now, can nevertheless be  deemed to be already under way. A study by French consultant  Jean-Francois Guenon forecasts that by 1995 these two languages  will clearly dominate the world of real time, to the detriment  of C. It remains to be seen whether the promoters of Ada will be  able to impose their language on the computer community as a  whole. Nothing is less certain. The DOD, of course, has  committed several million dollars to promote Ada. But there is a  possibility that this effort may not reach beyond a clientele  consisting of big industrial and defense accounts that are  already users of the language. Alsys, which makes no secret of  its militancy in favor of the Ada cause, has decided to market  Proada compilers under Windows at less than 5,000 French francs  [Fr], around mid-1994.    But essentially, the suppliers' rationale revolves around  the  problems of development. "Ada has always sought to incorporate  the leading software engineering ideas of its time," says Pascal  Plisson, adding by way of further clarification, "Ada is not the  largest of the existing compilers. It is the smallest software  development environment."    Rational, with its Rose environment, and Alsys, having taken  over the activities of IGL Technology, a Thomson subsidiary  specializing in software engineering, have made no secret of  their intent to rapidly attain critical mass, no longer in the  Ada market (where the two groups represent close to 50 percent  of the market), but rather in the software engineering market.  And with a telling argument: "Particularly in the real-time  domain, our products offer already integrated development  facilities, while the vendors of C and C++ computers position  themselves in this market mainly as sellers of accessory tools  for refurbishing a workshop," says Marc Richard-Foy, who heads  pre-sale activities at Alsys.    It remains to be seen whether this integrative and, on the  whole, globalizing rationale will not penalize Ada 9X as  compared with the supposed flexibility of use of a C++ compiler.  The trend does not yet favor Ada 9X, which, in particular, has  not managed to penetrate the small and medium-sized enterprises  sector. The suppliers are hoping not to regret, some few years  hence, not having dared to name Ada's new upgrade Ada++.  <H5>  [Box]: Still a Confidential Market </H5>   Worth only $220 million annually, the Ada world market is  dominated by the two recently formed groups: on the one hand,  Rational and Verdix; and on the other, Alsys and Telesoft. The  first of these groups today accounts for around $65 million of  the market, and the second for around $50 million.    These two entities have incontestably far outdistanced their  immediate pursuers: Tartan, DCC, and especially DEC, which  mainly sell compilers. But in addition to their size, they are  also characterized by their interesting positioning in the world  software engineering market, where they easily rank among the  top 10, and where they are pitted against the more generalist  development environments of Cadre (Teamwork) and IDE (Software  Through Pictures).</p>

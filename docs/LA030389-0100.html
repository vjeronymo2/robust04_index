			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOGGING THE MEMORY;  </P> <P> MAKING THE EYE A BETTER WITNESS  </P> <P> One intruder had on a blue backpack. The other was wearing tan slacks. Or was  it a green backpack and brown slacks?  </P> <P> It happened so quickly -- less than a minute -- that 42 witnesses could not  agree on such vital details when asked about the robbery two days later through  conventional police interview techniques. The witnesses had been assembled by  UCLA psychologists ostensibly to view a slide show. But during the viewing, two  participants in the experiment barged into the room, turned on the lights and  made off with the projector.  </P> <P> Then the interviewers changed tactics, with remarkable results. They didn't  just ask, "What happened?" Rather, they told the witnesses to first recall the  physical setting and their own frame of mind at the time of the robbery. They  told the witnesses to omit no detail, no matter how trivial. They told them to  reconstruct the crime in a variety of orders, not just from start to finish.  Finally, they told the witnesses to re-create the incident not only from their  own perspective but also from that of the robbers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cognitive Interview'  </P> <P> This "cognitive interview" technique, pioneered by UCLA psychologist R. Edward  Geiselman, elicited up to 35% more details about the crime -- all of them  accurate and many of them crucial, according to the researchers.  </P> <P> With little notice, psychologists have been developing new and relatively  simple ways to jog the human memory, raising the potential of making eyewitness  testimony far more reliable than previously thought possible.  </P> <P> These advances may also prove useful well beyond the world of criminal justice,  they say. For instance, such memory-enhancing tools can aid public health  officials in tracing partners of people with venereal diseases, said Ronald  Fisher, a psychologist at Florida International University. The techniques can  even help a person locate a missing wallet or keys, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enhance Recall'  </P> <P> "We've known for a long time how to increase learning, but until now little has  been known about how to enhance recall," Fisher said.  </P> <P> The cognitive interview, in particular, has been adopted by many law  enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service and the  Metro-Dade Police Department in Florida.  </P> <P> "I really believe in this technique," said John S. Farrell, chief of detectives  at the Metro-Dade Police Department. "This is a whole different ballgame."  </P> <P> Researchers in Florida and Minnesota have also found that false identifications  at police lineups can be reduced by as much as half when witnesses view  suspects one at a time instead of six simultaneously, which is the prevalent  practice.  </P> <P> Scientists elsewhere have shown that memory can be significantly affected --  for better and worse -- simply by the way a witness is asked about crime  details.  </P> <P> These emerging insights are timely because many scientists now believe that  hypnosis is far less reliable than most people assume. And courts across the  country, including in California, are placing severe restrictions on its use in  criminal cases.  </P> <P> New ways to increase eyewitness reliability are especially important because  juries tend to give great weight to eyewitness testimony -- sometimes without  realizing how unreliable such witnesses can be.  </P> <P> "The confidence of the eyewitness is the most powerful predictor of verdicts,"  said Brian L. Cutler, a Florida International University psychologist. Yet  research shows that confidence is "only weakly correlated with identification  accuracy," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cause of Wrongful Conviction'  </P> <P> "Faulty eyewitness testimony, in my opinion, is the major cause of wrongful  conviction in this country," added Elizabeth F. Loftus, a University of  Washington psychologist. She estimated that as many as half of such wrongful  convictions may be due to faulty eyewitness testimony.  </P> <P> Loftus has found in experiments that 18% of mock jurors voted to convict in a  case involving only circumstantial evidence; but after a positive eyewitness  identification is introduced, the conviction rate shot up to 72%.  Interestingly, a third jury voted to convict by nearly the same proportion --  68% -- even after it was told that the eyewitness had "very poor vision" and  was not wearing glasses at the time of the crime.  </P> <P> Any memory-improving techniques would be a welcome addition in the fight  against crime, especially in places such as California, where many criminal  cases drag on for years without adjudication.  </P> <P> With every court delay, prosecutors and defense lawyers alike are faced with  the problem of fading memories on the part of key witnesses, making cases  increasingly difficult to prosecute or defend.  </P> <P> For instance, in the current Night Stalker murder trial in Los Angeles Superior  Court, numerous witnesses have been unable to recall potentially important  details. One woman, who survived a shooting from point-blank range in a  darkened garage nearly four years earlier, was unable on the witness stand to  positively identify her assailant, as she had done during pretrial proceedings  years earlier.  </P> <P> In another much-delayed Los Angeles case involving the 6 1/2-year prosecution  of Virgil Byers for two fatal drive-by gang shootings, two key eyewitnesses now  have such conflicting accounts of the killings that they seem to be describing  entirely different events, Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman said.  </P> <P> How the human memory process operates is still much debated. Some believe that  it operates much like a tape recording or video recorder that can be stopped or  played back, perhaps aided by tools such as hypnosis. Others say memory is an  incomplete abstraction that can be highly susceptible to distortion.  </P> <P> "Models of the mind in general, and theories of memory specifically, seem to  follow the latest advances in gadgetry," such as the telephone switchboard or a  computer, according to Loftus.  </P> <P> She said recollections not only fade with time but also become increasingly  susceptible to alteration by subsequent information or subtle cues, including  questions posed by investigators.  </P> <P> Her own research has shown that witnesses to a complex event, such as a crime  or accident, often make serious mistakes, including misidentifying the color of  a car, remembering a yield sign where a stop sign had been and even placing  non-existent items at the scenes, something as conspicuous as a barn.  </P> <P> Such distortions, she added, can cause "ripple" effects that lead to wholesale  contamination of the original memory. And once such alterations occur, it is  almost impossible for a witness to retrieve the original memory, Loftus said.  </P> <P> She and other researchers, including Steve Penrod, now at the University of  Minnesota, have found that the accuracy of identifications is also  significantly affected by the value of a stolen object.  </P> <P> Similarly, research subjects who learn that an offender may be treated severely  are more likely to make positive identifications than those who learn that the  offender may be treated mildly.  </P> <P> Other scientists have confirmed in recent experiments that cross-racial  identifications generally are more difficult than same-race identifications, a  little-understood phenomenon, according to Cutler.  </P> <P> Another major factor that influences recall is the stress associated with  witnessing a violent event, which alone can lead to poor retention of details.  Loftus and others demonstrated this phenomenon in a series of experiments  involving the viewing of two short films depicting a shooting, one graphically  violent, the other far less so.  </P> <P> In the violent version, which portrayed a boy being shot in the face, only 5%  of the viewers could recall the number on the boy's jersey. But almost 28% of  those who saw the less-graphic version could recall it.  </P> <P> All these findings come at a time when hypnosis is generally falling into  disrepute as a courtroom tool.  </P> <P> "Hypnosis does not lead to accurate recall," said Dr. Martin T. Orne of the  University of Pennsylvania. "Indeed, the memories obtained prior to hypnosis  are considerably more reliable than those obtained during hypnosis."  </P> <P> Hypnosis can induce "pseudo-memories" that can become "extremely dangerous in  the courtroom" because they can make "honest liars" out of well-meaning  witnesses, he said.  </P> <P> But Orne agreed with hypnosis proponents that hypnosis can still be a valid  investigative tool under certain, limited circumstances, such as when it might  lead to evidence that can be independently corroborated.  </P> <P> One promising alternative to hypnosis involves research on how police lineups  can be more effective. Cutler and Penrod, for instance, have found that  sequential lineups, in which one suspect is viewed at a time, can reduce false  identifications by 50%.  </P> <P> In their study, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology last May, they  had hundreds of college students view videotapes of staged robberies.  Afterward, when the lineup included six suspects appearing simultaneously, 39%  identified an innocent person. But the error rate dropped by half when the same  suspects were viewed one at a time.  </P> <P> As a way to enhance accurate identifications, Cutler and Penrod suggest that  suspects in a lineup be asked to move about and to speak.  </P> <P> These methods may become even more effective if enhanced by the cognitive  interviews, especially in cases in which suspects wore disguises, the  scientists found.  </P> <P> For now, the most promising memory-enhancing tool appears to be the cognitive  interview, a technique developed by UCLA's Geiselman. It already has been  incorporated into the training programs of the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI.  </P> <P> In addition, Geiselman has given training sessions on the technique in Chicago  and throughout California, including to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> Other hallmarks of the cognitive interview include asking whether a suspect  reminds the witness of anyone he or she knows and, if so, why. If a name had  been mentioned during a crime, a witness is asked to think of the first letter  by going through the alphabet, and then repeat the process with syllables.  </P> <P> If numbers come into play, a witness is asked whether the number had been high  or low, and how many digits. Witnesses are also asked about a suspect's speech  characteristics.  </P> <P> Geiselman and his colleagues have demonstrated the efficacy of the technique in  numerous experiments, many of them using students at UCLA as well as people  from all walks of life.  </P> <P> Often, the technique is more effective than taking a witness back to a crime  scene because such scenes rarely remain unchanged, Geiselman said.  </P> <P> More recently, the interview technique, with further refinements, was  field-tested by Miami detectives investigating more than 70 actual armed  robberies in 1988. It produced 50% more details than conventional techniques,  researchers reported.  </P> <P> Some of Geiselman's latest research also suggests that the technique can help  witnesses recall license plate numbers, when used in conjunction with a  license-plate simulation device.  </P> <P> In one study, Geiselman found that witnesses on average were able to recall  3.85 (out of seven) characters on license plates. Without these tools, study  subjects could recall only an average of two characters.  </P> <P> Such improvement would dramatically reduce the number of possibilities from  676,000 license plates to 260, he said.  </P> <P> In other studies related to the cognitive interview, psychologist Martin Safer  at Catholic University of America in Washington has shown that eyewitnesses are  able to recall significantly more details when questioned several times within  the first 48 hours of a crime rather than in just one sitting. He said the  findings challenge the assumption that witnesses are able to recall all the  first time around.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Effective, Efficient'  </P> <P> The best thing about the cognitive interview, Geiselman said, is that it is "a  viable memory-enhancement technique that is effective, efficient and legally  acceptable." And it is easy to teach; his workshops typically take four to six  hours.  </P> <P> Cutler and Penrod believe that the emerging memory-enhancing experiments  provide sound justification for courts to allow experts to testify more  frequently on the unreliability of eyewitness identifications.  </P> <P> "In order to minimize these errors, courts and lawyers must familiarize  themselves with the developing knowledge base provided by the social sciences,"  Loftus said.  </P></p>

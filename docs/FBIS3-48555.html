			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2332 GMT on 22 January, in its regularly scheduled  "News 2001" program, carries a live interview with former Prime  Minister Toshiki Kaifu of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The program begins with a brief introduction of Kaifu as the  man who holds the key to whether the LDP stays together or  further breaks up with tension expected to mount between LDP  groups having differing views on the political reform bills as a  result of the rejection of the bills in the upper house of the  Diet on 21 January. The program also seeks to have Kaifu explain  what he has in mind to have the bills enacted during the current  Diet session.    Asked what he feels was the greatest cause of the defeat of  the political reform bills in the upper house, Kaifu says  although ruling coalition parties and the opposition LDP held  last minute talks to reach a compromise, they failed. He  stresses: "They should have tried to move just one step closer  to arriving at a compromise."    Regarding the reemergence of arguments that the political  reform bills be treated separately and that bills on preventing  political corruption be taken up first, Kaifu points out that  past efforts at preventing political corruption have been  unsuccessful. He says that the LDP worked out its political  reform outline during his term as prime minister. Bringing out  papers on which the outline has been laid out, he explains that  the current election system is at the root of political  corruption. He says a problem can only be solved by attacking  it at its roots, not just at its limbs, citing a college  professor under whom he once studied. He thus asserts the  political reform bills should be taken up as a single package.    Kaifu then points out that since the parties which formerly  opposed the LDP political reform outline are now agreeing to  bills which basically agree in principle with this outline, the  LDP should also try to move toward a compromise. He feels the  ruling coalition parties and the LDP should work out a  compromise and that he believes this can be done. He further  points out that since the leaders of Sakigake (Harbinger) and  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) worked together with him in  drafting the political reform outline, they should be well aware  of the principles involved, and, therefore, things can be  settled by holding a thorough discussion at a joint meeting of  both houses of the Diet.    Asked how he would act in case the political reform bills  were put to the vote again in the lower house, Kaifu says this  is undesirable and unlikely since there is the option of working  out a solution at a joint meeting of both houses.    Freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura says ruling coalition  party officials should refrain from suggesting that the  coalition is willing to accept the LDP-proposed bills "in whole"  (marunomi) so that political reform bills can be enacted during  the current Diet session. He warns they should be wary of using  delicate terms which could decisively determine the fate of the  political reform bills, pointing out the use of the term  "marunomi" could anger many coalition members since it would  offend their pride to accept the opposition's proposals.    At 2341 GMT, Hirotaka Akamatsu, secretary general of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), is called up via remote  hookup to comment on what has been said so far in Kaifu's  interview. He says it is the responsibility of all politicians  to have political reform brought about during the current Diet  session, and, therefore, a compromise should be worked out at a  joint meeting of both houses where representatives of the  various parties will be present.    Asked to say a few words to Kaifu, Akamatsu points out that  comments LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made earlier in the  program indicate that the LDP leadership wants to put off the  political reform bills rather than work out a compromise at a  joint meeting of both houses. He asks that Kaifu exercise his  leadership to bring together pro-reformist LDP members for a  joint cooperation toward bringing about political reform during  the current Diet session. Akamatsu vows that he and his  associates would do their best.    Kaifu is asked what he intends to do. He says immediately  after the bills were rejected at the upper house, he and his  associates held a discussion and decided to ask the LDP  leadership to promptly take steps toward holding a joint meeting  of both houses of the Diet to work out a compromise. He says  this is necessary since Japan is in the midst of an economic  slump and this matter also warrants immediate attention. He  says as soon as a compromise is worked out on basic points, then  the government can start working on other problems.    On reports that some LDP members plan to demand the  resignation of the party leadership if it agrees to a joint  meeting of both houses, Kaifu denounces such moves, saying that  the party adopted its political reform outline in 1989 and has  campaigned in subsequent elections with this outline as a party  platform. He mentions that, at the time, he was the leader of a  task force on political reform and current LDP President Yohei  Kono was acting leader then. He says they both toured the  country to explain the party's political reform outline. He  says since this has been the party's platform, it is only proper  that the party's leadership seek a compromise with the coalition  that would bring the political reform bills as close to the  party's proposals as possible. He says this can be accomplished  by holding a joint meeting of both houses, and, therefore, it is  improper to denounce the party leadership for agreeing to  holding such a meeting.    Asked how he feels about some people calling for a top-level  meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP  President Kono to resolve the situation, Kaifu stresses the  problem should be solved by holding a joint meeting of both  houses to work out a compromise.    Regarding rumors that some junior members of his group may  leave the LDP should the situation fail to be resolved, Kaifu  says the Federation of Dietmen for Political Reform members have  resolved to concentrate all their efforts now on political  reform, not more and not less.    The interview concludes with Kaifu stating his continued  determination to help bring about political reform, calling for  utmost efforts by all politicians toward this end.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / First 125 years of TUC 'WE STUMBLE on,' Norman Willis declared in a speech which was supposed to sum up the TUC's first 125 years and point to the future. But, Robert Taylor writes, the delegates sat mostly in suppressed mirth as journalists wrestled with its meaning. It was a dismal end to a nine-year reign during which the TUC general secretary denounced violence on the picket lines during the miners' strike in 1984, in response to which a noose was dangled in front of his face. Four years later Mr Willis, as an enthusiastic supporter of the European Community, brought EC president Jacques Delors to speak to the 1988 Congress, a move that more than any other turned Mrs Thatcher against the social charter. Union leaders want a fresh start with a clear sense of direction, after the government's marginalisation of the unions during Mr Willis's reign. So Mr John Monks will be making the keynote speech at congress on Wednesday - two days before he officially takes over from Mr Willis.</p>

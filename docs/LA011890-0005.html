			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> "Sweet 15," the season opener for the PBS series "Wonderworks," tells the  heartwarming story of a 15-year-old Latina, who -- by helping her father gain  his U.S. citizenship through the amnesty program -- gains new appreciation of  her Mexican heritage and her father's courage. It stars Karla Montana ("Stand  and Deliver"), Tony Planta ("Romero") and Susan Ruttan ("L.A. Law"). Airing on  KCET, the second segment of the two-part production will be shown Jan. 21 at 8  p.m.  </P> <P> Singer-composer Apollonia's LP is so successful in Asia that she was invited to  headline the spectacular two-day New Year's Eve inaugural concert of the  12,000-seat National Indoor Stadium in Singapore. Although Apollonia was born  in Santa Monica and attended San Pedro High School, her parents are from Mexico  City and she grew up speaking Spanish. The former star of "Falcon Crest"  visited San Diego's Barrio Youth Center during Christmas week, encouraging  troubled Latino teen-agers to follow a positive direction.  </P> <P> Upcoming segments of Univision's new series, "Fama y Fortuna" ("Fame and  Fortune"), will feature visits to the homes of Mexican superstars Veronica  Castro, Lucia Mendez and Emmanuel.  </P> <P> Abbe Lane (who last month celebrated her silver anniversary of marriage to  cable-TV company owner Perry Leff and the wedding of their oldest son), is  penning an autobiographical novel for Warner Books. As some of you might  recall, Lane was appearing on Broadway when discovered by bandleader Xavier  Cugat (whom she later married). Through their popular stage act and motion  pictures, the sultry entertainer became the first musical crossover artist --  introducing Latin cha-cha and rumba rhythms to American and European audiences  in the 1950s -- music that remains popular to this day.  </P> <P> Speaking of "crossovers," Spanish-language rock has come to L.A. in a big way.  It all began with Miguel Mateos, whose recent local sellout concerts paved the  way for Mecano and Soda Stereo. And it now looks as if more Latino rockers will  be rollicking across our stages throughout 1990. In fact, Mateos (who is in  town putting the finishing touches on his latest album) kicks off the new year  by headlining a "Rock en Espanol" ("Rock in Spanish") 20-city U.S. tour, which  includes concerts in Anaheim and Hollywood. Argentina's Mateos is joined by  Spain's Duncan Dhu on the tour.  </P></p>

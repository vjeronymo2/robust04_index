			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RIVERA JOINS GROWING CAST OF RED SOX STARS  </P> <P> About a month ago, the Boston Red Sox were struggling. Except for Roger  Clemens, they didn't seem to have much pitching. They had lost bullpen ace Jeff  Reardon for the season.  </P> <P> They didn't have much power, either. They had to scratch for runs and they were  battling to stay close in the American League East.  </P> <P> But as the season heads into its final month, the Red Sox are the one team that  seems to have everything.  </P> <P> Backup shortstop Luis Rivera, who hit only five home runs in his first 268  at-bats, hit his second in two games Friday night at Boston. It was a grand  slam, the first for Boston this season, and it carried the Red Sox to 7-3  victory over the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> The victory was the Red Sox's eighth in a row. Winner Greg Harris (12-5) is  merely one of a number of pitchers who have taken some of the pressure off  Clemens.  </P> <P> Harris gave up two hits in eight innings before tiring in the ninth. He wound  up with a 4-1 record in August.  </P> <P> Both Harris, who has thrived as a starter after a long career in the bullpen,  and Rivera were merely hoping to make the club in the spring. Now they are key  players in the pennant drive.  </P> <P> Rivera's grand slam on a 2-and-0 pitch broke open a tight game in the eighth.  </P> <P> "I think it was the best feeling I've had in all my career," said Rivera, a  26-year-old utility infielder. "When I hit the ball I didn't think it was a  home run. I thought it was a long fly that would bring in a run. It's a very  exciting time."  </P> <P> Rivera, who has been subbing for the injured Jody Reed, is six for 12, has  scored five runs, hit two home runs and driven in eight runs in his last three  games.  </P> <P> Oakland 4, Texas 2 -- Willie McGee went 0 for 4 in his debut for the Athletics  at Oakland, but still made a big contribution.  </P> <P> In his first at-bat in the American League, McGee, who left St. Louis as the  No. 2 hitter in the National League, drove in a run with an infield out.  </P> <P> His speed accounted for another run in the eighth. He reached first on a  fielder's choice. Pitcher Kenny Rogers made a wild pickoff attempt and when the  ball sailed down the right field line, McGee scored.  </P> <P> Bob Welch gave up one earned run in 7 1/3 innings to improve to 22-5.  </P> <P> After left-hander Rick Honeycutt retired the last two batters on three pitches  in the eighth, Dennis Eckersley retired the Rangers in the ninth for his 40th  save.  </P> <P> Toronto 12, Cleveland 8 -- Rookie Luis Sojo had to take over at shortstop for  the Blue Jays when Tony Fernandez developed a shoulder problem.  </P> <P> Sojo made three errors in the game at Cleveland, but he drove in five runs with  his first home run and a double.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays remained 6 1/2 games behind the Red Sox.  </P> <P> The Indians took a 4-0 lead and Sojo's first two errors contributed to runs.  </P> <P> Sojo's two-run double helped the Blue Jays pull even in the fifth and his  three-run homer highlighted a six-run sixth.  </P> <P> Detroit 12, Minnesota 6 -- There were 13 extra-base hits in this game at  Minneapolis, with the Tigers building a 9-1 lead in three innings.  </P> <P> Although Cecil Fielder didn't get one of the four home runs, the home run  leader hit one of three triples, driving in two runs, and now has 111 runs  batted in.  </P> <P> Lou Whitaker and Lloyd Moseby hit home runs for the Tigers.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 4, Baltimore 1 -- Ron Robinson (8-3) pitched an eight-hitter at  Milwaukee for his third complete game in his last six starts. In those six  starts, he is 4-0.  </P> <P> Greg Brock drove in two runs for the Brewers with a sacrifice fly and his sixth  home run.  </P> <P> The Orioles, who have won only three of their last 11, trail Boston in the East  by 13 1/2 games.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ostankino TV company covers relations between  Ukraine and Russia tendentiously. It does not provide authentic  information and therefore fails to promote neighborly ties  between the two countries. President Leonid Kravchuk made this  statement on Saturday, commenting at journalists' request on the  decision to deprive several Ostankino reporters of their  accreditation in Ukraine.    Earlier the press service of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry  deprived Ostankino reporters in Donetsk, Kharkov and Odessa of  their accreditation.    Nevertheless, President Kravchuk said that Ukraine is not  against a unified information space. It only wants the coverage  of events in that space to be objective.    Leonid Kravchuk also criticized some Ukrainian news media  for  having a penchant for "hot" facts and for failing to present a  complete picture of developments and processes in Ukraine. He  did not specify precisely what publications he meant.</p>

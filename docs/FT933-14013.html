			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major and Clarke hail 'recovery' BRITAIN was coming out of recession and leading Europe into recovery, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was also in buoyant mood when, while stressing that the content of his November Budget had yet to be decided, he sought to reassure Tory backbenchers alarmed by the possibility of increases in income tax. Both the prime minister and the chancellor emphasised the significance of the continuing fall in unemployment, coupled with the lowest rate of inflation for nearly 30 years. Latest figures show unemployment falling for the fifth month in a row, on top of yesterday's unexpected drop in inflation to 1.2 per cent. Mr Major commented: 'Taken with the remarkable figures on Tuesday on manufacturing output, I think we can now say with some certainty that there is clear evidence of a recovery gathering pace.' Reaffirming his determination to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement, the chancellor said he shared the instincts of the rightwing Tory MPs in the 92 Group that public expenditure restraints should be the first consideration. He responded in dismissive terms when Mr Robert Sheldon (Lab Ashton-under-Lyne) suggested that an increase in the top rate of income tax could make a contribution to reducing the 'horrendous' PSBR. Mr Clarke described as 'slight' the additional revenue which would be raised by increasing the 40p rate, and recalled that higher yields had resulted from the cuts made in the 'extraordinary high levels' of taxation imposed by the last Labour government. He accused Labour MPs of always wanting to put up taxation 'on somebody or other', while, as a Conservative chancellor, he was being reminded by backbench colleagues of their party's commitment to continue to reduce income tax 'when it is prudent to do so'. Calling on the chancellor not to 'prostrate himself' on the altar of the PSBR Sir Peter Tapsell (C Lindsey East) said estimates like those which had produced the figure of Pounds 50bn were notoriously unreliable. Mr Clarke answered that he had 'never drunk of the pure milk of monetarism'. But the PSBR did constitute a serious problem and the monthly figures were running in line with the forecast. He added: 'I take the view that if the PSBR falls faster than I am at the moment expecting I can probably deal with any problems that may cause with considerable ease.'</p>

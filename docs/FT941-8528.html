			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finland softens stance over EU farm subsidies Finland yesterday softened its opposition to European Union proposals on how to integrate Nordic and Alpine agriculture once Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland join the EU. The shift comes as the 12 and the four applicants start make-or-break ministerial talks on Monday to finish the enlargement negotiations by the end of this month. Finland, along with Austria and Norway, opposed EU plans to cut their farm prices - 25 to 100 per cent higher than the EU norm - to fit in with the Common Agricultural Policy. Brussels advocates direct compensation to Arctic and Alpine farmers for the income lost, paid for by the applicant countries. The Finns, Norwegians and Austrians want to apply the traditional EU system of border rebates for farm price differences, to ease the transition to EU price levels. The European Commission and the 12 reject this as reinstating the frontiers done away with by the single European market. Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finnish foreign minister and former farmers' leader said yesterday that Finland was willing to examine the direct compensation plan if border rebates were ruled out. 'If border rebates are not possible then we will have to look at it,' he said, referring to the Commission plan. Finland, like its Nordic partners, insists on a permanent regime to assist Arctic farmers. That, and how much the EU should contribute to the direct compensation payment will be at the heart of next week's negotiations. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said yesterday that the negotiations should concentrate on the big remaining issues. He confirmed Mr Haavisto's shift, saying 'we are ready to discuss that but after we know what the permanent arrangements for Arctic farmers are.' Mr Aho also revealed that Finland would probably hold its referendum on membership in September, if next week's talks succeed. Since Finland is the Nordic country most likely to vote yes, this could have a positive effect on more sceptical public opinion in Sweden - where a referendum will probably not take place before November - and even in Norway, where anti-EU sentiment is strongest. The Norwegian referendum is likely to take place much later.</p>

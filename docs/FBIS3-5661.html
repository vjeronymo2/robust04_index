			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Form Large Economic Groups Which Are Strong </F> Enough To Compete"]    [Text] Soon after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo,  American-made Pepsi soft drinks have begun to be produced in  Vietnam. For many years, they were imported from foreign  countries to meet popular demand. Thus, the production of Pepsi  did not take place in Vietnam until after the lifting of the  U.S. trade embargo and a spectacular yet harsh competition has  already occurred in the Vietnamese market between Coca-Cola and  Pepsi. The question to ponder is: Two major U.S. soft drink  companies are already operating in Vietnam. What will happen to  our soft drink companies? Will they survive or die?    Some 20 U.S. construction companies have tendered bids for  the construction of many segments of National Highway No. 1 with  loans and funding from various international monetary and  financial institutions. Dozens of other U.S. companies  specializing in different sectors have also brought their goods,  machinery, equipment, and technology to the Giang Vo Trade Fair  in Hanoi. More American companies are expected to do business  in Vietnam. Research results released by some American  companies indicate that within the next two years, business  activity in Vietnam will reach as much as 2.7 billion dollars.  Needless to say, there will be harsh competition among American  companies themselves, between American companies and other  foreign companies, and between American companies and Vietnamese  companies.    Therefore, it can be said that with the lifting of the U.S.  embargo, we enjoy an opportunity and also face a challenge. It  is an opportunity because the lifting of the trade embargo  provides us with a very good chance -- provided that we are  smart and vigilant -- to have access to capital and modern  technology to develop new trades and occupations, increase  economic activities, and generate more jobs, thereby turning the  strong points of the outside world into our own strength.  Meanwhile, we face a not-too-insignificant challenge. American  companies all have huge financial assets with billions of  dollars at their disposal. Furthermore, they have the best  technology in the world. As for our companies, it is difficult  to compare them with their American counterparts in all  respects. Therefore, as far as direct business transactions are  concerned, it will be very easy for us to lose if we are not  wise enough.    As for macro-management, to be strong enough to compete in  future business activities, we need to initiate the following  tasks as soon as possible:    -- Forming large economic groups which are financially  strong  enough to compete. Each group must have at least several  thousand billion dong as capital.    -- Taking urgent steps to train a contingent of management  cadres who are highly professional, business-wise, and quick at  mastering modern technology.    Good cadres and capital are the minimum basic conditions for  new business activities.    To succeed in forming large economic groups, the first  decisive factor rests with unity. In wartime, all of our people  remained united in the struggle to wrest back independence and  do away with the shame of losing our country. At present, let  all of us unite in the struggle to make the country powerful and  eliminate poverty and backwardness. Let our economic units  merge into large groups to work toward our common goals. The  workstyle that we have followed so far in which small-scale  business activities prevail, every businessman is for himself,  and everyone pursues short-term profits at the expense of common  interests will only harm us and weaken our potential. That  workstyle is no longer suitable with large-scale business  activities in the days ahead.    It is also worth noting that while doing business in  Vietnam,  all major foreign economic companies or groups of companies must  abide by Vietnamese law. Therefore, in macro-management, it is  necessary for the state to perfect the legal system and where  necessary, work out incentives to encourage foreign business  people to invest in those preferred foreign-funded projects and  limit investment where local investors can manage or in those  projects which do not meet Vietnam's conditions and economic  development requirements.    Competition plays an essential role in the market mechanism.  Business operations are under state management. Nonetheless,  the decisive factor of success rests primarily with the strength  of each economic unit and with the potential of our country as a  whole.</p>

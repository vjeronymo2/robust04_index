			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuliya Pshenko: "Social Nationalists Are Not </F> Eager To Assume Power"]    [Text] The Ukrainian Social National Party [SNPU] was  noticed for the first time in the summer of 1992 when its  leaflets appeared in Lvov. It was not so much their contents as  the party's symbol, which looked very much like a swastika, that  attracted particular attention. At that time, the SNPU backbone  was comprised of members of "Rukh's Guard" -- youngsters that  used to be bodyguards of former dissidents some time ago. When  the "Guard's" militants were all done performing their  functions, they were "befriended" by a Yaroslav Andrushkiv (he  used to be responsible for the physical fitness program for  "Rukh's Guard" members), who realized that he could capitalize  on those boys. After some time, the new organization began to  attract the Lvov youth. Its ranks were joined by members of  other organizations, such as "Spadshchyna," [Heritage] "Plast,"  [Scouts] and "Studentske Bratstvo" [Student Brotherhood].    However, it was last summer when the party became especially  vocal. Let us just recall the furious reaction of Lvov  residents to the Black Sea Fleet Treaty signed by L. Kravchuk.  The entire city was rocked then by a wave of rallies, where  SNPU members showed themselves in all their glory. At one of  them, a party's member said out loud: "I dream about staging the  Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day for Russians, but we don't  have enough strength, so far." It was, however, just enough for  them to form the "Committee for Protection of Nation and State"  that included all far right organizations. The Committee  actively engaged in forming "people's detachments" ready to  execute any order of their leaders. At their rallies, the  nationalists yelled that Ukrainian tanks would shoot at the  Kremlin. So far, they have managed to get away with it -- maybe  because no one takes them seriously? But the newly emerged  Nazis continue to spread their wings, increasing their profile.  Unidentified thugs shattered windows in all of the Russian high  schools in Lvov and left as a keepsake slogans that read:  "Moscow mugs, get out of Ukraine!" It is not difficult to guess  who were the most immediate suspects. Later last fall, SNPU  members assaulted the building of the URP [Ukrainian Republican  Party] oblast department, cracked down on one of the local  organizations of the "Student Brotherhood" (by that time, the  Lvov student community had split into those who joined the SNPU  and those who declined). And very recently, the SNPU boys  instigated a brawl in the "Postup" cafeteria, where they often  dropped in. They explained later that it was not them, and that  the bartender simply managed to identify the cafeteria's  habitues only.    However, all those "little pranks" are nothing compared with  the Social Nationalists' intention of vigorously participating  in the upcoming elections. Although the party is not officially  registered -- and it will hardly be in the nearest future -- its  21 candidates were proposed for legislature in the Lvov Oblast  districts. The Social Nationalists are sure that this time,  people should vote for the true nationalist patriots, and not  for those who joined only recently. They believe that all  present legislative deputies must resign, except for S. Khmara  or I. Kalynets.    The Social Nationalists are not eager to seize power today.  They understand that their time has not yet come. But they do  not doubt that it eventually will. The SNPU leader Andrushkiv  said: "We will just wait until people are tired of anarchy, and  will ask us to grab power. And you bet, we will!"</p>

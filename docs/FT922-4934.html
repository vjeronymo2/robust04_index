			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Thames Water profits rise 11% THAMES WATER, Britain's largest water company by number of customers, yesterday announced modest increases in profits and dividends and defused potential criticism about directors' salaries with a 10 per cent cut in pay and bonuses. Thames reported an 11.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 212.3m to Pounds 236.3m in the year to March 31. The increase was due to price rises and cost-cutting, but was held back slightly by interest payments and recession. Mr Roy Watts, chairman, said the performance was 'highly creditable'. However, he said the results did not meet targets set by the non-executive directors and directors' pay and bonuses would be about 10 per cent below last year's total of Pounds 847,000, itself a 70 per cent increase on the previous period. Turnover increased 7.6 per cent to Pounds 899.3m. Turnover in the core water and sewage businesses increased 11.5 per cent, in spite of price rises of 12.2 per cent. The slight shortfall was due to lower measured water usage from recession-affected industrial users. Operating profits increased 23.8 per cent to Pounds 234m. Profits from property disposals were unchanged at Pounds 11m. Interest costs were Pounds 9m, compared with interest earnings of Pounds 12m, as Thames launched a borrowing programme to fund capital investment of about Pounds 4bn. Net borrowings increased to Pounds 327m from Pounds 88m and took gearing to 21 per cent from 6 per cent. Capital investment, which includes the London ring main, increased 4.1 per cent to Pounds 409m. Earnings per share increased 9.4 per cent to 54.8p. The company is recommending a final dividend of 12.8p (against 11.5p) to make a total of 19.2p, an increase of 9.7 per cent. The results were in line with market expectations, and followed a 4 per cent increase in interim profits to Pounds 118m. Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said Thames' non-core, non-regulated businesses had annualised turnover of Pounds 250m and the company had spent Pounds 90m on acquisitions since privatisation. UTAG, the east German contracting and consultancy acquired in January, was not consolidated in Thames' results. Thames shares fell 1p to 444p. Lex, Page 20</p>

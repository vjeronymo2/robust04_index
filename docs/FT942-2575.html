			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft raises DM1.2bn in sale Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German mining, metals and industrial group, has raised DM1.2bn (Dollars 706m) from the sale of its near-80 per cent stake in Buderus, an engineering and building supplies subsidiary once regarded as a jewel in the Frankfurt-based conglomerate's crown. The sale, handled by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, was conducted through an international placing of 2.03m Buderus shares at DM600 each. Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor to Metallgesellschaft, said the placing had been oversubscribed in spite of poor market conditions. Applications for shares had to be scaled down. The proceeds, less commission for the two big banks, will initially flow to Metallgesellschaft, although it is highly likely the money will find its way back to banks which are owed a total of about DM9bn. Deutsche and Dresdner banks, both big shareholders in Metallgesellschaft, will be the main beneficiaries. The banks have security over Buderus's assets dating back to December last year when they advanced an emergency loan to Metallgesellschaft. The group came to the brink of bankruptcy in January after running up DM2.3bn losses in US oil derivatives trading. Metallgesellschaft said it would realise an extraordinary profit on the Buderus sale. It did not quantify the gain but bankers close to Metallgesellschaft said it would offset fresh provisions arising from the involvement of MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New York-based trading subsidiary, with Castle Energy, a north American oil-refining company in which MG Corp has a large minority stake. Deutsche Bank yesterday denied rumours that Mr Rolf Breuer, a board member who is also chairman of the German Stock Exchange, would be resigning as head of the bank's securities trading activities. In spite of the denial, shares in Deutsche Bank dropped DM10.60 to close at DM721.10.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guy Daloze: "New Prime Minister in Early July?"] </F>   [Text] Let us dare to paint a striking scenario and  hypothesize that, on 24 and 25 June in Corfu, Jean-Luc Dehaene  will be appointed president of the European Commission by his  fellow heads of government, replacing Jacques Delors.    Let us assume he wins out over his Netherlands colleague  Ruud  Lubbers, who is too widely suspected of Atlanticism and bias  toward the United States.    Let us say that two weeks previously the Belgian coalition  in  power is rudely shaken by the results of the imminent European  elections announced in our Friday editions by our exclusive "LA  LIBRE BELGIQUE Marketing Unit" poll, showing the liberal union  to be the leading force in the country, the PS [Walloon  Socialist Party] to be in collapse, the CVP [Flemish Christian  People's Party] not to have undergone the "Van Hecke" effect and  now to be suffering a fresh identity crisis.    Let us imagine Jean-Luc Dehaene resigning from his prime  ministerial duties in early July with a view to taking up his  European duties on 5 January 1995. However, he knows that  before then he must use subtle mixtures and extensive  international contacts to appoint his enlarged team of  commissioners.    For purely logical reasons, he is also aware that he will  have to pass on the baton to his Belgian successor during the  summer, when the 1995 budget will be drawn up, with all its  political implications.  <H5>  Most Likely Successor </H5>   The party chairmen hold a meeting. Their first decision is  not to hold a general election -- otherwise scheduled for the  end of December 1995 -- too early, and above all not to hold it  at the same time as the local elections due in October: The  stakes are too different... and Christian socialists and  socialists risk losing too many municipal citadels if the two  types of elections are mixed.    Consequently, the resolution is adopted to continue with the  same alliance for a limited period of time - say, spring 1995 -  and on the basis of a well-defined and stabilizing program which  must enable each individual to gain more weight.    The most likely successor, the CVP's Herman Van Rompuy,  declines the offer. It is too early, his party is way down deep  in the doldrums, and he does not (yet) feel cut out for the job.  So everyone turns to Melchior Wathelet [deputy prime minister]  of the PSC [Christian Socialist Party], the unhappy and unlucky  candidate back in the winter of 1991.    No more "sand trap" full of treacherous little phrases,  however: People turn to him as a symbol of "an alternative, of  another way" and as a "great communicator." It is up to him to  boost the prestige of the coalition. Melchior Wathelet accepts,  but there is no question of him simply serving as a temporary  solution: He demands a solid program from his partners. And a  formal commitment.    Even if he only takes up his post for less than one year,  (let us say nine months, because his traumatized coalition  partners cannot be asked to do the impossible), the new  government will have to govern the country and avoid repeated  internal crises.    Political fiction? No. The scenario we have just painted is  being considered within various party headquarters. And not  only within the PSC.</p>

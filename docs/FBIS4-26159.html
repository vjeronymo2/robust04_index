			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kiwi Lee in Zhuhai] </F>   [Text] Workers at the factory that collapsed in Zhuhai on  Friday killing 17 people say they were threatened with pay cuts  if they refused to go back into the gutted building to search  for undamaged cloth. About 200 workers were inside searching  for material when the Hong Kong-Chinese joint venture factory  collapsed. Ten people are still missing and people at the scene  said five supervisors from Hong Kong were among those still  buried under the rubble.    The injured Yu Xin Printing and Dyeing factory workers, who  asked not to be named, said they had been told to check the  six-storey building for unburnt cloth 10 hours after flames left  it a burnt-out hulk. "About 300 workers were lined up outside  the burnt building at around 1 pm," one woman said. "Our  manager told us to collect any unburnt material, otherwise our  salaries would be deducted." A number of workers ignored the  management's order. "Some of the workers and I were picking up  some of the unburnt cloth on the second floor," the woman said.  "An hour later the building suddenly collapsed and I was  buried."    The woman, who was admitted to the Zhuhai Municipal  Government Hospital suffering from minor head and leg injuries,  said she was lucky to escape alive. "Nobody came to rescue me.  I climbed out from the debris by myself. I don't know how many  of my colleagues have been buried," she said.    According to Shenzhen Municipal Authority spokesman Yang  Shuiping, 17 bodies had been recovered by last night and the  search for other victims was to continue today. She said the  workers had heard nothing from the Hong Kong owners about  compensation for their injuries although management had sent two  people to visit the victims several times telling them to "take  care".    Other workers at the hospital said a Hong Kong factory  manager gave the order to enter the building to salvage cloth  and begin a site clean-up. The woman said: "Even the factory  fire did not kill anybody. But his order did."    The spokesman, a Mr Yang, [as received] said of the 158  people hospitalised, 101 were still receiving treatment while  another 15 were in a serious condition.    Yesterday piles of debris from the collapsed factory reached  the third floor of an adjoining building. Smoke still poured  from the rubble despite heavy rain and the fire being  extinguished more than 24 hours beforehand. Witnesses said half  the building was like "carbon" and believed heavy rain  contributed to its collapse.    It was the second time in as many weeks that an industrial  building in China's most dynamic region collapsed. A  partially-built Shenzhen factory collapsed earlier this month  killing 11 people. The Governor of Guangdong province, Zhu  Senlin, visited the disaster scene yesterday.    Mr Yang said the government had vowed to find those  responsible for the disaster. He said three welders had been  arrested. The workmen allegedly caused the fire when sparks  from equipment they were using to install fire safety measures  ignited cotton bales. The fire broke out on Thursday in the  factory's number three workshop. No one was injured in the  blaze which was put out by Friday morning.    The Yu Xin factory, located inside Zhuhai's Qianshan Textile  City, is a joint venture between a Hong Kong merchant and the  Zhuhai Qian-shan Industrial Co.</p>

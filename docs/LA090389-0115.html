			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS;  </P> <P> GETTING A TASTE OF THE FRENCH WINE COUNTRY  </P> <P> Question: We're planning a tour to the French wine country. Where are the  tasting centers and what do they charge?  </P> <P>  Answer: Most growing areas and vintners have tasting facilities. The principal  wine-tasting services are at Beane, Burgundy; the Champagne Information Center  at Epernay, and the Wine Information Center at Bordeaux. Tasting is free. You  can also sample wines for a modest fee at Academie du Vin, 25 Rue Royale,  Paris.  </P> <P>  Q: What merchandise made from birds or other animals in the Caribbean may not  be brought back by travelers?  </P> <P>  A: Crocodile leather, sea turtle shells and spotted cat skins are forbidden  items. Some islands also ban the export of coral.  </P> <P>  Q: We'd like to tour Canada's Northwest Territories and Yukon late this summer  or early fall, using campgrounds. How long are those areas open?  </P> <P>  A: Some operate from May to October, others are open all year. Contact Travel  Arctic, Government of Northwest, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada X1A  2I9, and Tourism Yukon, Box 2703-AT, Whitehorse, Yukon Y1A 2C6.  </P> <P>  Q: I'm planning a motor trip. Should I use a travel agent for hotel  reservations or rely on automobile clubs?  </P> <P>  A: Agents can book your accommodations but usually aren't geared to do as much  for motorists as AAA and similar organizations that provide maps, counsel,  emergency and other services.  </P> <P>  Q: Traveling on smaller aircraft, I noticed the space between first-class seat  rows is no greater than in economy. Shouldn't the higher fare provide more  room?  </P> <P>  A: Such spacing differs among airlines. Though first- and business-class seats  are wider, they may not have more reclining space than in economy class.  </P> <P> </P></p>

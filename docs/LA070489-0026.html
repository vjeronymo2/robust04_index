			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.: The Costa Mesa-based drug maker said earnings fell  46% to $3 million in the second quarter. Sales were up 9% to $44.5 million. ICN  said the unfavorable quarter-to-quarter comparison in net income resulted from  debt repurchases and gains in the company's investment portfolio in last year's  second quarter, as well as substantially higher research and development  spending by Viratek Inc. in this year's second quarter. It said both its  pharmaceutical and biomedical operations registered solid gains in the quarter.  </P></p>

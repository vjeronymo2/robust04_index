			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: World recovery gathers pace - Steady growth and low inflation forecast but unemployment remains a serious concern Economic recovery is now well under way in the industrialised world, with the US, Japan and Europe all forecast to see steady growth and low inflation over the next two years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports in its latest half-yearly outlook. At the same time, turbulence in the world's financial markets could be eased if monetary authorities in the industrialised world make more effort to underline their commitment to low inflation, the OECD says. It also cautions that the forecast growth may not be enough to solve the longer term problem of government debt, and the industrialised economies will need to expand more rapidly than in the last two decades if they are to return to a period of high employment. The Paris-based body, which represents 25 industrialised nations, paints an upbeat picture of current prospects. For the first time since 1991 the OECD has revised its forecasts of growth upwards, with the industrialised economies expected to expand by 2.5 per cent this year and nearly 3 per cent next. Its last forecast, made in November, envisaged 2.1 per cent growth this year and 2.7 per cent in 1995. The US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand are at the forefront of this growth, with recovery there now well entrenched, the report says. But the outlook for Japan has also brightened. And though domestic demand remains weak in continental Europe, rising exports are expected to lead to steady growth and a significant turnaround in Europe's trading position. European OECD countries reported a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) trade deficit in 1992, and a Dollars 66.7bn surplus last year. The trading position is expected to rise to a Dollars 112.7bn surplus this year. However, in spite of this optimistic forecast, the OECD insists that 'this is not the time for any relaxation of policy effort'. 'The most pressing basic policy problem remains high, and in Europe still rising, unemployment,' Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said yesterday, echoing the OECD's jobs study released earlier this year. Although unemployment is projected to decline slightly next year, most of the improvement will be in the US. The report warns that unemployment in Europe will remain at some 12 per cent of the labour force. Another cloud on the horizon is the high level of government debt, which seems set to be a continued drag on economic growth, the report adds. During the recent recession government budget positions across the industrialised world weakened by, on average, 3 per cent of GDP, the report notes. In the short term the OECD believes that this deficit will drop slightly because recovery should boost budget positions and most OECD countries - with the notable exception of Japan - have tightened fiscal policy since last year. But even if the governments stick to these fiscal measures, this will still only stabilise the deficit at 1-2 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a level that would leave the total public sector debt running at around 75 per cent of GDP for the OECD as a whole, well above the 60 per cent levels seen in the late 1980s, the report warns. And if growth slows - a distinct possibility, according to the OECD - the debt position could be far worse. 'Only slightly lower growth - by half a percentage point per year - could lead to debt levels in 2000 averaging close to 85 per cent of GDP,' the report says. A third worrying sign, the OECD says, comes from the recent rise in long-term interest rates on financial markets. The policy implications of this rise vary for different countries, the OECD says - though the increase in rates may reflect rising inflation expectations or public sector debt concerns in some countries, it is also being driven by greater market volatility and increased risk-aversity among market traders, the report says. In the US, where recovery is strong and spare capacity levels low, a 'neutral' policy is needed to ward off inflation, the report suggests. In other countries such as the UK and Canada, which are also seeing recovery but with higher levels of spare capacity, the same forces that pushed up US interest rates will increasingly come into play. But in countries where recovery has barely begun - such as Japan - there may be more room for easier monetary conditions. Nevertheless, the OECD concludes: 'In all countries, insofar as real long-term interest rates are considered to be too high, the solution is more likely to be found in more ambitious reduction of budget deficits.' Mr Shigehara said that the recent rise in long-term interest rates, and the broader market turbulence, suggested that governments should make more effort to emphasise their commitment to low inflation, without overreacting to every market movement. 'More effective articulation of clear commitments to sound public finances and price stability, and, where necessary, decisive corrective actions . . . would contribute importantly to the stabilisation of market expectations,' he said. Although Mr Shigehara declined to point the finger at any particular government, the OECD's outlook suggests that the US may be one country where such clearer commitments would be particularly welcome.  -------------------------------------------------------- OUTLOOK FOR THE MEDIUM TERM  -------------------------------------------------------- Summary of projections Seasonally adjusted at annual rates  -------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP (% change)                  1994    1995    1996  -------------------------------------------------------- US                                    4.0     3.0     2.0 Japan                                 0.8     2.7     2.8 Germany                               1.8     2.6     2.8 OECD Europe                           1.9     2.8     2.6 Total OECD                            2.6     2.9     2.6  -------------------------------------------------------- World Trade (% change) 1              6.7     7.2     6.9  -------------------------------------------------------- Inflation (% change) 2 US                                    2.1     2.8     3.2 Japan                                 0.8     0.8     1.1 Germany                               2.8     2.0     1.9 OECD Europe 3                         2.9     2.4     2.4 Total OECD 3                          2.1     2.3     2.5  -------------------------------------------------------- Unemployment (% of labour force) US                                    6.3     5.8     6.0 Japan                                 2.9     2.8     2.8 Germany                              10.0    10.0     9.9 OECD Europe                          11.7    11.8    11.6 Total OECD                            8.5     8.3     8.2  -------------------------------------------------------- Budget balance (% of GDP) 4 US                                   -2.6    -2.1    -1.6 Japan                                -1.9    -1.7    -1.1 Germany                              -2.9    -2.8    -2.8 OECD Europe 5                        -6.1    -5.2    -4.4 Total OECD 5                         -4.0    -3.3    -2.7  -------------------------------------------------------- Current balance (% of GDP) US                                   -2.1    -2.1    -2.1 Japan                                 2.8     2.5     2.3 Germany                              -0.7    -0.2    -0.1 OECD Europe                           0.7     1.0     1.1 Total OECD                            0.1     0.1     0.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Arithmetic average of growth rates of world import and export   volumes. 2 GDP deflator. 3 Excluding Turkey. 4 General government financial balance as % of nominal GDP. 5 Excluding Iceland, Luxembourg, New Zealand Switzerland and Turkey.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Editorial Comment, page 19 OECD Economic Outlook No. 55.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / High cost of a cleaner Europe: Environment policy is facing funding constraints Europe's environment policy, one of Brussels's most popular achievements, is coming under fire from many directions. Britain's water companies have criticised stringent and expensive directives on the standard of water; several governments complain that the Commission is failing to enforce the same standards throughout the Community; farmers in south-west France are furious about a Brussels threat to ban even the shooting of crows. The criticisms come against a background of national unease about Brussels's influence on Europe's day-to-day life. They threaten to undermine the EC's ability to tackle environmental problems and, by creating unequal environmental costs, to undermine the workings of the single market. The present difficulties follow a period of unprecedented environmental regulation. In the past two decades the Commission's environmental directorate, known as DG-11, has issued some 200 directives on everything from filtering factory smoke and protecting wild birds to muffling lawnmowers. The case for a strong European environmental policy has won support from both the public and governments. In areas such as water quality, people have not trusted their governments to set adequate standards. In other areas, such as acid rain, governments have turned to Brussels to bring each other into line. 'It is a bit like disarmament inspections - where countries have little confidence in each other's role, the Commission has a legitimate role,' says Mr Ken Collins, member of the European Parliament and chairman of its environment committee. But while the need for a European environmental policy is broadly accepted, time is running out if Brussels wants to be taken seriously. The Commission and the EC member countries are jeopardising the most valuable parts of their huge legislative effort by over-enthusiasm, and by their failure to enforce the rules, or even to discover that they are being broken. The charge against EC policy by governments, industry and some rival Brussels directorates  - is that it has been naive and over-ambitious, backing many rules that should not have been passed, which many EC members now cannot afford to meet. Criticism of Brussels's record has increased as part of the debate about subsidiarity  - the extent to which decisions should be taken at a local level rather than by the EC. Moreover, the full costs of meeting some of the directives are only just becoming clear, and have stimulated complaints. Governments, faced with footing large clean-up bills during economic recession, have noticed that some of their neighbours have not complied with the rules, and are asking: 'Why should we?' Several charges against EC policy are well-founded  - the 1980 drinking water standards directives could head the list. Though they have performed a service by ruling that lead, pesticides, nitrates and bacteria are undesirable in drinking water, they insist that every trace of most of these elements is removed, even though health risks from tiny concentrations are unproven. The rules have been coupled with others which improve water colour but do not affect its safety. Water companies have protested that, while the cost of 'the last few steps towards perfection' is huge, the benefits are far from clear. Mr Karel van Miert, EC environmental commissioner, acknowledges that environmental policy has not been determined by scrutiny of costs and benefits. 'We have certainly saved lives and prevented sickness but I am not tempted to try and guess how much.' Mr Grant Lawrence, an adviser to Mr van Miert, argues too that not all environmental issues lend themselves to cost-benefit analysis. 'It is very hard to calculate the benefit side of the equation. One can point to tourism revenue and to reduced healthcare costs but in the end you can't put a price on a clean beach.' The result of the EC's hectic activity is a hefty bill for member countries, much of it still to be paid. According to the Commission's latest figures, annual environmental spending, apart from on the nuclear power industry and water, has grown to about Ecu45bn (Pounds 38bn). The Commission has no firm estimates of the cost of the water directives, but they could raise considerably the total bill, judging by the UK water companies' Pounds 45bn investment programme, nearly half of it needed to meet EC rules. Some Mediterranean countries are saying, in effect: 'We would comply but we can't afford to.' Mr van Miert acknowledges that 'it would be irresponsible not to accept that there are difficulties with financing'. Although he concedes that 'perhaps we have been over-ambitious', he points out that ultimate responsibility for meeting the cost of the directives lies with national governments, and that all but three were passed unanimously by the 12 EC member countries. The high cost of some early directives can partly be attributed to the enthusiasm and political ambition of national environment ministers  - there are few votes in negotiating looser standards. In part, too, it follows from the optimism of the poorer EC countries that the richer ones would help them foot the bill. In the case of the 1975 bathing water directive, according to Mr Lawrence, 'there was a lack of attention to costs because countries had 10 years to comply'. Lack of money is one reason why present compliance is so patchy. The highest standards are usually found in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, while the bottom band includes poorer countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and sometimes Italy. But the Commission's biggest handicap in enforcing its rules is ignorance. Although environmentalists are fond of accusing countries of being 'the dirty man of Europe', there are no figures to substantiate the accusation. The Commission claims that countries have 'transposed' 85 per cent of its directives into national law, although it says: 'The delays in Italy (transposition of only 59 per cent) and Greece (76 per cent) continue to give cause for concern.' But it has no comprehensive figures on whether countries then enforce the laws. It believes that the two laws which are infringed most frequently are the requirement to investigate the environmental impact of building projects and to designate special protection areas for wildlife. The Commission has at some point started legal action against all EC member countries for failure to curb water pollution. In the past five years 67 cases  - many of them concerning water standards  - have been referred to the European Court of Justice. In all but a few cases the Court has found in the Commission's favour. But such action can only follow complaints from the public, and it tends to reflect public awareness rather than the number of infringements. There is no easy solution to the problem of compliance, but repealing directives and leaving environmental standards to national discretion is unlikely to be the answer. In response to the mounting criticism from EC countries, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, suggested ripping up nearly two dozen EC directives in the name of subsidiarity, including those on bathing and drinking water. Since then, Mr Delors appears to have backtracked on this view and Mr van Miert, who is adamant that standards should not be lowered, argues that 'it would be politically impossible'. He says: 'The member states that complied a long time ago such as the Dutch and the Danes would object.' Instead, the answer to enforcing EC standards almost certainly means bringing the question of costs into the open. Northern European countries will have to decide whether to accept the burden of helping southern ones meet the rules, and if not, to force discussion on which directives should have priority. None of these debates can start without better information on compliance. Mr van Miert says: 'Most countries simply won't buy the idea of green policemen'  - a UK proposal for a European inspectorate which would send its own officials to monitor pollution. But EC members have reached a broad consensus for a European Environment Agency which would have the right to demand information from national regulatory authorities. However, the creation of the agency has been delayed by a dispute about its location, itself part of a wider tussle over the future location of EC organisations. Despite the problems of cost and enforcement the outlook for the EC's environmental policy is not uniformly grim. Some change is already under way, with a more realistic breed of bureaucrat replacing the environmental missionaries. This trend is exemplified by the succession of Mr van Miert in July to the colourful Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, described by one official as an 'irritant' to Mr Delors. The directorate has also begun speaking the language of economics and of the other Brussels directorates  - adopting 'cost-benefit analysis' as a new buzzword. It is looking at financial instruments such as taxes rather than regulation as a way of achieving policy objectives. Mr Ranieri di Carpegna, director of financial instruments and international affairs at DG-11 and one of the new breed of realists, says: 'The advantage of a tax is that the costs are transparent, although that makes it politically unpopular. There is also no problem with enforcing it. The regulatory approach is costly, too, but no one is aware of that at the time.' Mr di Carpegna is one of the architects of EC proposals for taxes on energy, carbon emissions and on vehicles to help reduce the risk of global warming, arguably more important than some of the issues championed in the past. The costs are undeniably great: in its November 1991 report DG-11 estimated that the proposed energy tax would cut 0.25 per cent off EC real GDP growth in the second and third years after introduction, and 0.07 per cent over the first 13 years. But realism at this stage increases the likelihood that if countries adopt a tax they will adhere to their commitment. Such commitments and the fact that EC countries made environmental policies an important part of both the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty show that they take it seriously. The next few years will show whether they take it seriously enough to enforce it and pay for it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PAYING FOR LESS POLLUTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Environmental  Environmental       Success rate of              expenditure*   expenditure    transposing EC directives              Ecu bn         as % of GDP    to national laws by Dec 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium          na           na                  81% Luxembourg       na           na                  86% Denmark          1.0            1.1                   98% Germany         16.5            1.6                   92% Greece           na           na                  76% Spain            1.8            0.6                   93% France           8.3            1.0                   89% Ireland          0.3            1.0                   84% Italy            5.7            0.8                   59% Netherlands      2.7            1.4                   95% Portugal         0.3            0.8                   94% UK               8.7            1.2                   85%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total         **45.3          **1.2                   86%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Excludes nuclear industry, water production and household work ** Excludes Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: The State of the Environment in the European Community vol III, EC Commission, March 1992 (compiled from 1988 figures, the most recent available)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

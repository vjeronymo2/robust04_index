			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Russian Communists are still  hesitating about signing Boris Yeltsin's memorandum on Civil  Peace and Accord. The ceremony is scheduled for April 28.  Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party  representing the moderate branch of the movement, said on  Wednesday that the final decision on whether to sign the  memorandum will be taken at a party national conference on April  23-24.    However, speaking at a news conference today, Zyuganov  expressed doubts that any true accord could be reached if  signing to a document is limited by one fixed day. "If we take  (civil) truce and accord seriously, I stand for a gradual  approach towards such a variant which, instead of ideology,  would rather focus on the national and state interests and take  into account Russia's traditions, contain a mechanism of  stabilizing the situation", the communist leader said. Zyuganov  reiterated his support of the idea that "a government of  national confidence should come to power by democratic means" in  Russia.</p>

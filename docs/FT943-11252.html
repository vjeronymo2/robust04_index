			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Russian 'working poor' increasing An increasing number of Russian workers are receiving no wages for months at a time, creating a 'working poor' in enterprises deep in debt and often barely able to continue production. The working poor, a class likely to continue to grow as credits for enterprises are slashed, have been highlighted by Goskomstat, the state statistics office, which suggests that workers at 33,000 enterprises, of which 20,000 are collective farms or agro-industrial corporations, regularly receive no pay for months at a time. The overall indebtedness of enterprises to their workers in the Russian economy stands at around Rbs3,400bn, and is growing steadily - by 16 per cent in June alone. The hardest hit regions appear to be Siberia and the far north. In seperate figures produced last week by the Labour Ministry, the number of Russians living below the official poverty line or susbistence minimum is 24m, or 16.4 per cent of the population. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was harangued by such workers on his trip last week round Siberia, with women in one plant claiming to receive only Rbs20,000 a week. The Labour Ministry data indicates that 3 per cent of workers receive less than Rbs61,500, the level below which absolute want is reckoned to exist. People living below this are believed to spend 80 per cent of their income on food. As well as the absolute poverty suffered by the lowest paid section of the populaion, the ministry figures show a rapidly widening gap between rich and poor. The richest 10 per cent of the 148m Russians receive 23 per cent of incomes, with the lowest 10 per cent receiving 3 per cent of incomes. The Russian budget, approved this month by both houses of parliament, is kept within the deficit limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund only by the severest pruning of expenditure - increasingly showing up as non-payment of wages.</p>

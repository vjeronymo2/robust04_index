			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Filippov: "NATO: Its View of Moscow. </F> Regarding the Results of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  Session in Istanbul"]    [Text] The session of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council [NACC] which was held last week in Istanbul has  demonstrated both the definite desire of the NATO states and a  number of East European countries, primarily Russia, to find  spheres of cooperation in the new situation following the Cold  War, and also the difficulties of implementing them.    The present session is called upon to determine its attitude  toward the Russian Federation within the NATO system, NATO  Deputy Secretary General Sergio Ballanzino stated at its  opening. This question, he said, is the most important one on  the agenda of this exceptionally important forum. Russia is the  only superpower in Europe and it will continue to maintain this  position in the future. We attach great significance to  cooperation with Russia.    For his part, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  indicated certain features in Russia's understanding of the  position and dynamics of the development of military-political  structures in Europe.    The creation of a new architecture of security in Europe  cannot take place without Russia's participation, and still  less, be aimed against it, the French LE FIGARO writes. The  NATO countries, according to the newspaper, have determined a  strategy for their actions which would meet two objectives:  First of all, the establishment with Moscow of a "broad,  individual, and far-reaching partnership program" based on  "dialogue about common objectives in those spheres in which  Russia is making a specific and important contribution." The  second task, the newspaper believes, is "not to give in to  pressure from the Russians," who take a dim view of "NATO's  right to adopt its own decisions." Moscow will not be given the  right of veto.    According to the Russians' ideas, Radio Liberty said in a  broadcast, NATO should be subsumed into a new collective  security system under the aegis of the CSCE. This would  automatically place Russia on the same level as other  participants in this organization, notably the United States.    Having theoretically decided for itself the question of the  need to strengthen cooperation with NATO, and in particular  through the "Partnership for Peace" program, Russia, which still  possesses the acknowledged status of a nuclear superpower, is  demonstrating its desire to play a fitting role in partnership  relations with the North Atlantic alliance. Time will tell to  what extent the NATO leaders will take this into account in  their strategy.</p>

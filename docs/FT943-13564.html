			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Algeria's agony 'The status quo is no longer tenable.' That remark about Algeria was made some weeks ago by Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. It is the nearest France has come, in public, to admitting the failure of its policy in that country - a policy of backing the present military regime on the grounds that, whatever its faults, it is preferable to the Islamic alternative. The thinking behind that policy is easy to follow. Islamic militants have been increasingly ruthless and indiscriminate in their use of violence, and increasingly intolerant in their social attitudes, especially towards emancipated women and secular intellectuals. Some of their leaders have openly rejected democracy as incompatible with Islam. Others' espousal of it may be purely tactical or, if sincere, might not survive once they were in power and facing serious opposition. An Islamic victory even by democratic means - such as was about to happen in January 1992 - could easily be a case of 'one man, one vote, once', as an American diplomat has said. It could also trigger the flight en masse of Algeria's westernised middle class, most of which would head for France. But the policy is not working. Two and a half years after the elections were cancelled, Algeria is further than ever from civil peace. Foreigners, including diplomats, have become regular targets of terrorism, and the regime seems powerless to protect them. Attempts at dialogue with the imprisoned leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have been abortive, even though those leaders have now more or less abandoned the conditions - release of all political prisoners and new elections - on which they were insisting earlier in the year. Many observers believe President Liamine Zeroual is prevented from pursuing this option by the the hardline group of 'eradicateurs' around the chief of staff, Gen Mohamed Lamari. The methods favoured by that group may be said to have 'worked' in Syria, when President Hafez al-Assad destroyed the ancient city of Hama and killed tens of thousands of people in 1982. It is highly questionable whether they can work in Algeria, or if they can whether the price is worth paying. For the moment they have produced a civil war in which no quarter is given, in which terrorists enjoy the legitimacy of frustrated democrats, and in which Algerians of liberal persuasion are as likely to be victims of one side as of the other. Many have already fled to France, ostensibly as visitors, or are trying to get visas to do so. Unpleasant facts must be faced. The longer Mr Juppe's untenable status quo is maintained, the more bitter and uncompromising an eventual Islamic regime is likely to be. French, European, and indeed western policy should now be directed at ending the violence and ensuring a smooth transition. Further economic aid to Algeria should be made conditional on the early holding of free elections, with this time firm guarantees that the result will be respected whatever it is. If the result gives power to the FIS, its leaders will then have both instruments and incentives to curb extremist violence, which at present they lack. They would also have a strong incentive to maintain good relations with the EU. (The EU takes 70 per cent of Algeria's oil and gas exports, on which in turn the country depends to feed and employ a population growing at 2.7 per cent annually.) Algeria would not for some time be a liberal democracy, or a paradise for westernised intellectuals. But it could stop being the hell for all its inhabitants that it is now.</p>

Kolpakov, President of International </F> Metallurgist Union]    [Text] On 24 July 92, the Russian Federation Ministry of  Justice registered the charter of the International Metallurgist  Union, and this date became the official birthday of the new  public association. During several months preceding this event,  the group of sponsors and the coordination council made a great  effort in learning the metallurgists' opinions about the  expediency of merging into a union and its likely tasks, status,  and functions. These efforts culminated in the founding congress  held on March 27,1992 in Lipetsk which unanimously adopted the  resolution to set up the union and discussed its charter and  management bodies.    The adoption of this resolution was prompted by the actual  situation characterized by the negative consequences of  disrupted economic links and the breakup of a single  metallurgical complex into components. The output volumes of the  principal types of production throughout metallurgical  enterprises of CIS countries in 1992 decreased by 17-24%.  This  drop in production continued in 1992 and in relation to 1991 at  Russian Federation enterprises amounted to 12.5% for  steel and  15% for rolled products. The situation in ferrous  metallurgy in  Ukraine and Kazakhstan is no better. In nonferrous metallurgy in  the former USSR republics, the drop in production in 1991  amounted to 7.7% for primary aluminum and 30.6%  for secondary  aluminum, 24.4% for refined copper, 14.4% for  nickel, 24.\1%  for zinc, and 19% for rolled nonferrous metals. The  unavoidable  metal product price rise (by 26.5 times during the first nine  months of 1992) proceeded in a jump-like fashion without  correlation with production costs, which aggravates the gap  between the financial position of the enterprises even further  and forces many of them to limit wage increases, cut back  production staff, and lose skilled personnel.    The long-range metallurgy development plans produced earlier  with a balanced coordination among the subindustries and at a  territorial level lost their real basis when the former union  republics became sovereign. The metallurgists understand that it  would be unreasonable simply to discard them and forget. A joint  search for new nontraditional decisions is necessary.    The database support for the enterprises in the fields of  production, science and engineering, and economic situation in  the industry and at the enterprises is continuously shrinking,  which is fraught with unpredictable consequences even for the  most well-meaning initiatives of individual enterprises to  expand their production. At any moment, they may find themselves  without supplies of the necessary ferroalloys, billets, and  refractory and other materials.    At the founding congress which gathered representatives from  many enterprises, scientific research institutes, and  metallurgical organizations from all regions and a number of CIS  countries, an unambiguous admission was made that their  separation is a serious obstacle on the road to overcoming the  crisis and further developing the industry. We need a  unification vehicle which would not repeat former command  administrative links but would be consistent with today's  principles of independent economic activity under the conditions  of market relations.    The historical experience and today's foreign practices  attest that such associations are possible and are already  successfully functioning and justifying the hopes of their  founders and members.    The Society of German Metallurgists founded in 1860 is one  of  the oldest in the world. According to its charter, its  objectives are assisting in the technical, scientific-technical,  and engineering efforts in the field of pig iron, steel, and  associated material production. Using its own resources, this  society is carrying out a broad spectrum of scientific and  engineering research, ensures legal protection of their  findings, assists young workers in increasing their skill  levels, and carries out expert (arbitration) activity in its  sphere. Because of its practical activities, the society has  acquired a good reputation, its opinion is taken into account by  the government in adopting resolutions pertaining to German  metallurgy, and its influence in the structures of the European  community is noticeable.    The rapid development of the industry, power generation, and  mining in the second half of the 19th Century in Russia  necessitated the development of societies with a professional  orientation. Russian technical and physical-chemical societies  were formed and several years later--the Russian Metallurgical  Society and a number of others. Large regional associations of  engineering and technical personnel sprang up. The societies did  not limit themselves to educational and information  dissemination activity but carried out extensive organizational  work and defended the interests of the society members in  various spheres. They took coordinated positions, e.g., in the  issues of providing industrial credits and securing government  orders for domestic enterprises, the development outlook of the  iron ore and bituminous coal base in the new industrial regions  of the country, involvement of foreign capital and protection  from foreign competition, and improvement in the working  conditions in the mining and metallurgical industry and the  status of workers and their insurance. The activity of the  Russian Metallurgical Society is directly related to the names  of such prominent metallurgists as Chernov, Kurako,  Grum-Grzhimaylo, and Pavlov who exerted significant influence on  the development of the metallurgical production science and  practices.    The authority of the newly developed International  Metallurgist Union includes enterprises and organizations in the  metallurgical industry in CIS countries; collective (enterprises  and organization) and individual members from these as well as  other foreign countries may join it. This is a public  organization which unites on a voluntary basis engineers,  scientists, experts, production managers, and social work  organizers in the metallurgical and mining industries. In its  activity, the union is guided by Russian Federation legislation  and international legal standards and the legislation of the  states which house union departments, as well as its own charter.    The union provides representation and protects the interests  and rights of its members before the authorities and assists in  effectively utilizing the most recent achievements of science  and engineering in order to increase the ferrous and nonferrous  metallurgy production quality and competitiveness. Union  functions include drafting and submitting to government bodies  proposals on issues of metallurgical and mining industry  development strategy, international division of labor which is  based on carrying out the necessary research, expert  examinations, and assessments of domestic and world trends.  Another important form of activity is supplying union members  with scientific and engineering and other types of information,  conducting exhibits, seminars, and symposia, and helping to  improve business skills.    The principal governing bodies--the union council and  auditing committee--were elected at the founding congress.    The Council of the International Metallurgist Union began  its  practical activity immediately after its election by the  congress. In the initial phase, the sponsoring group consisting  of the council members was forced to carry out extensive work on  formalizing in an established order the charter documents and  registering the charter at the Justice Ministry. For greater  promptness, a council presidium consisting of 17 members and six  standing committees were set up from among council members at  the first meeting; the standing committees deal with the  structural and economical reorganization; modernization  development strategy and engineering progress; social problems;  finance and economics; juridical and legal affairs; and  relations with mass media. One more committee--on foreign  economic relations--was recently set up.    The structure of the union and its regional organizations is  still being formed while negotiations on cooperation with other  public organizations, foreign representatives, and companies are  underway. Relationships with the organizations which form the  metal products market, i.e., trading houses, brokerage  associations, and the Roskontrakt Russian contracting authority  are being established. Proposals to set up specialized banks for  servicing the market for metals and raw materials for their  production are in a preparatory stage.    Today, we have reached the stage in the union operation  where  it is necessary to concentrate the intellectual potential of the  scientists and experts on generating proposals to bring  metallurgy from the critical condition and find ways and forms  of their realization through management bodies. I would like to  outline several problems on which the International Metallurgist  Union (MSM) is currently working and which, in our opinion, are  especially urgent.    The problem of shipments under intrabranch cooperation is  very acute. For many decades, the metallurgical industry has  developed under the conditions of rigid economic relations and  has formed a single technological and economic complex. Many  enterprises are rather narrowly specialized, so the exchange of  metal products among the regions has been carried out on a scale  measured in tens of millions of tons, most of which was made up  by billets for subsequent conversion into rolled products,  pipes, and hardware. Today, these cooperation links are  disrupted. The emerging metals market does not yet have the  necessary structures and attributes and does not create  favorable conditions for trading relations. On the contrary,  bereft of reasonable controls allowing for the objective factors  through a differentiated taxation system, customs duties, and  quotas, our market has opened up a broad avenue for large-scale  export of conversion metal to noncontiguous foreign countries  and made it unprofitable to ship it to enterprises inside Russia  and to CIS countries. The International Metallurgist Union is  promoting an initiative to correct this situation. We need a new  approach which would ensure that the enterprises have incentives  to ship billets to conversion plants first and foremost.    The first problem is directly related to the second--the  metallurgical enterprises' incentive to improve the quality of  end products and expand its production for shipment to the world  market. Today, trading involves primarily metal with a low  degree of readiness: pig iron, scrap metal, and blanks. Yet even  quality types of production are often sold at prices 30%  below  those in the world market. One of the reason is the fact that  this production lacks quality certificates issued by specialized  companies, as is the case with foreign practices.    In recent years, work on developing certification centers in  Russia was undertaken by the ``Sapem-sertifikat'' Joint Stock  company, one of those founders is the International Metallurgist  Union. In October 1992, Russia's State Standard Board gave  ``Sapem-sertifikat'' the authority and entrusted it with the  functions of the central body of the certification system for a  group of similar goods among which metal products play a  prominent part. Cooperation in this field with known foreign  companies has already begun. The union intends to expand these  efforts in the framework of the functions stipulated by the  charter aimed at improving the metal products export efficiency  by adopting a number of governmental resolutions dealing with  allocation of quotas, export, re-export and licensing rules, etc.    Supplying metallurgy with secondary raw material has always  posed a complex problem here. Today, the situation became simply  catastrophic. The enterprises and individual persons are no  longer interested in turning in scrap metal while large  quantities of scrap metal already procured are exported,  primarily its most valuable and scarcest types. Scrap purchasing  and processing enterprises were left without the resources  necessary for reproducing fixed capital and guaranteeing current  operations. A real danger has developed that secondary metal  enterprises may pass to the hands of private persons who will  increase scrap exports. Today, dramatic measures are necessary  for effectively utilizing this very valuable type of raw  material which, in essence, is a part of the national treasury.  In our opinion, a special resolution must be made in this regard  at a governmental or presidential level, and we are actively  pursuing these goals. Special commissions have been set up for  examining the situation and drafting proposals.    Metallurgy in CIS countries is in need of serious  modernization. The strategy which was developed earlier for this  purpose is largely unacceptable today due to a change in the  role of the state, forms of property, and economic activity of  enterprises. The International Metallurgist Union intends to  discharge its state obligations of comprehensively assisting  metallurgy modernization in Russia and other CIS countries.    Mindful of how stressed state budgets are, we think that it  is possible to find new approaches to financing this metallurgy  modernization by combining it with certain state support. We are  talking about setting up an off-budget technological development  and modernization fund whose draft proposal has been prepared  and approved by the International Metallurgist Union council.    Our metallurgy has been developing largely on the basis of  scientific developments from domestic scientific research  institutes whose scientific output is highly regarded throughout  the world. Due to the lack of state financial support, the  metallurgical science has found itself today in an extremely  difficult situation. We think that it is possible to extricate  ourselves from it by setting up national scientific ferrous and  nonferrous metallurgy centers on the basis of existing  scientific research institutes. The International Metallurgist  Union may take the initiative to develop large industry-wide  metallurgy modernization programs with the participation of  these centers. The off-budget R&amp;D fund may become the  financial  basis of these efforts; it is expedient to form this fund  through withholdings from the cost of metallurgical production.    An industry-wide specialized commercial bank which would  provide specific and beneficial credits for measures aimed at  modernizing enterprises and developing capacities for  manufacturing competitive products should be set up. Obviously,  it is expedient to obtain long-term interest-free credits, e.g.,  from Russia's Central Bank or the government for shortening the  initial period necessary to develop the financial basis for  metallurgical modernization.    In discharging its function of legal protection for its  members, the International Metallurgist Union will also continue  to give them legal support in resolving internal points of  contention. To this end, an International Metallurgist Union  arbitration tribunal has been set up which, on beneficial terms  and in a short time span, will consider all cases submitted to  it. It is important that while possessing professional skills in  the field of metallurgy, the arbitration tribunal is called upon  to find ways to reconcile the parties and reduce the claimant  outlays related to the consideration of their cases.    Needless to say, several months of the International  Metallurgist Union activity is a relatively short time for  preparing and especially implementing serious measures. The  union is in its formative stages, and new members are still  joining it. We are not indifferent to the future membership  makeup of the organization. We are trying to ensure that it is  replenished with authoritative and skilled experts and  production leaders characterized by the pride in their work and  responsible attitude to the future of the industry. During the  past months, many leaders and prominent experts from metallurgy  enterprises in CIS countries, scientific research institute  staff, employees of concerns, Roschermet Corporation, the stock  market, trading houses, and certain state departments and trade  unions have become union members. We are hoping that the union  will continue to expand further by admitting engineering,  technical, and scientific personnel in the metallurgical and  mining industries who are committed to their profession and will  form the intellectual potential of the organization; realization  of this potential will help solve complicated issues of bringing  metallurgy out of the critical state and ensuring its future  balanced developed.    Approximately 50 enterprises in organizations from six CIS  countries which include large integrated iron and steel works,  specialized plants, scientific production associations,  institutes, and associations have already joined the  International Metallurgist Union as collective members. Requests  have been received about membership terms from several companies  from noncontiguous foreign countries. It is important to ensure  that this process continues. Speaking about expanding our  membership, we must clearly proceed from the principle that the  union needs enterprises and organizations as the basis for its  functioning while collective members need the union as the  organization capable of affecting the resolution of  contradictions arising due to the new realities of life.    It is necessary to emphasize that the newly developed  metallurgist union does not claim to supplant the functions of  existing management structures, including metallurgy committees.  Our primary intention is to assist all union members in various  states in establishing close contacts on the basis of common and  mutual interests. Whenever possible, we will undertake to solve  the problems which are unusual to the new structures but have  preserved or acquired urgency. The guiding principle of  interaction with the authorities is mutual respect and  assistance and the ability to complement each other. Not the  ambitions but cooperation in the name of normal viability and  development of industries, enterprises and organizations must  become the cornerstone of this activity.</p>

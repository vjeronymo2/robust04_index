			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: German banks prepare to launch money-market funds German banks are preparing to launch money-market funds in Germany this summer following the Bundesbank's surprise decision last month to drop its opposition to the funds. The German government plans to implement legislation allowing the funds as part of the second Financial Markets Promotion Act due to become law at the beginning of August this year. 'There are plenty of details to be worked out but we plan to introduce new funds as soon as is practicable,' said Mr Christian Strenger, chief executive of DWS, the Deutsche Bank affiliate which is Germany's largest fund manager. Money-market funds are short-term investment vehicles which are very popular as a highly liquid alternative to fixed-term deposits in countries such as the US and France. Units in the funds can be bought and sold on a daily basis and investors can enjoy a better return than for straightforward deposits. The Bundesbank has long argued that the funds, which invest in short-term government bonds, certificates and bank debt of less than one year, would diminish the effectiveness of its monetary policy. This was chiefly because they would have circumvented its minimum reserve policy, which requires banks to lodge a proportion of their deposits with the central bank on an interest-free basis. The central bank's opposition to the funds has waned in the past 18 months, during which time it has cut its main minimum reserve requirements from 4.95 per cent to 2 per cent. Over the long-term, the introduction of funds is likely to put pressure on banks' funding structure as customers shift their savings from deposits - a source of cheap financing for banks - to the new funds. But bankers said that current low short-term interest rates would ensure only a limited interest in the products when they are introduced. A study from DB Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm, said last week there is considerable investment potential for the funds. They will be able to invest in DM300bn (Dollars 174bn) worth of short-dated bonds with a residual life of one year or less, as well as other short-dated instruments such as floating-rate notes and commercial paper. In other countries, short-dated government securities are the chief investment vehicles for money-market funds. The Bundesbank objects to the government borrowing on a short-term basis but DB Research argues that the funds will remove resistance to such short-term borrowing.</p>

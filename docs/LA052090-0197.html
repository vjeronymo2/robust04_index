			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT PAYS SENIORS TO FARE-SHOP WHEN SEEKING AN AIRLINE  </P> <P> If senior citizens seem to be getting younger, one reason may be that golden  age discounts are kicking in at lower levels.  </P> <P> Once the magic number was a firm 65, and then it started dropping -- to 62, 60,  55, 50.  </P> <P> Now a newsletter called The Mature Traveler reports on "travel bonanzas for  49ers-plus."  </P> <P> Hotel discounts usually are pretty straightforward: Just state your age and ask  the reservations clerk how you'll be rewarded for having lived so long.  Frequently, it's 10% to 50% off regular rates.  </P> <P> Airline senior discount programs, however, can be as bewildering as Medicare  regulations. Travel is usually restricted on specific days or during certain  holiday periods, but not always.  </P> <P> A few airlines insist that you join a dues-paying club to become eligible for  perks; others require membership in a no-fee group similar to a frequent-flier  plan; sometimes you merely have to show proof of age at the check-in counter.  </P> <P> Typically, fares are slashed a flat 10% for passengers over 62 or 65, and for  traveling companions of any age.  </P> <P> Here's a sampling of what is around and some hints on what to look for when  you're fare-shopping:  </P> <P> Special senior rates pop up sporadically, usually during slow periods.  </P> <P> Few foreign airlines offer transoceanic senior plans, but there are a few  pace-setters.  </P> <P> El Al offers a 15% discount on all flights to anyone over 60. British Airways'  "Privileged Traveller Card," also available at 60, offers 10% off certain  hotels and packages as well as fares; the airline also waives pre-trip  cancellation penalties for seniors.  </P> <P> Finnair offers travelers 65 and over a fare of $496 round trip good any day all  year, from New York City. While it can't be booked more than three days in  advance -- which means seats won't come easy in high season -- it represents a  $323 saving from the best midsummer fare of $819.  </P> <P> U.S. airlines that also fly overseas should always be grilled for details about  how their senior plans apply to international trips.  </P> <P> Continental's "Freedom Passport," for example, allows a year of domestic travel  for $1,599, but global add-ons for optional international trips to Europe, the  Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii and other Pacific destinations start as low as $150  per round trip.  </P> <P> In a similar plan, Eastern offers first-class travel for $1,599; coach is  $1,199. Destinations include San Juan, St. Thomas, St. Croix and Canada.  </P> <P> Another common way to compensate seniors is with coupon books. They usually are  good for a year but sometimes restrict such things as total mileage per trip or  number of trips. However, most allow the purchase of unlimited coupons.  American, USAir and Delta Air Lines sell books of four coupons for $420, eight  for $704. Coupons can be used for most flights. Northwest's and United's  cheapest books are $384 but restrict travel days; Eastern's, also restricted,  are $368.  </P> <P> TWA's restricted four-coupon book, $379, includes a certificate redeemable for  a round-trip ticket from New York City to Europe at a peak-season rate of $649.  </P> <P> All require advance booking except Northwest, which also throws in added  discounts for travelers who register for the "WorldPerks Senior" plan.  </P> <P> Remember, you may be getting older, but the deals are getting better.  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Clinton warned on economic stimulus US business economists have warned President-elect Bill Clinton that his planned economic stimulus may achieve little, George Graham writes from Washington. A survey by the National Association of Business Economists, published yesterday, showed a median expectation that the economic programme outlined by Mr Clinton during his election campaign would result in just 0.2 percentage points of growth more than expected from a second Bush term. The economists said the investment tax credit and infrastructure spending outlined by Mr Clinton would have only a small effect on the US economy, but that did not mean he should aim for a bigger fiscal stimulus. 'Our advice right now is to be cautious. Clinton needs to maintain the confidence of business and the markets,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, the association's president. The NABE survey shows a median forecast of 2.6 per cent growth in gross domestic product next year, with unemployment projected to fall to 7.2 per cent. Inflation is expected to remain low at around 3.4 per cent next year. Strong economic data in recent weeks have led more economists to urge Mr Clinton to think again about the need for an immediate fiscal boost as soon as he takes office next month.</p>

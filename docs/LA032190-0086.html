			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRING BREAKS;  </P> <P> SIGNS ABOUND AS SEASON OF REBIRTH OFFICIALLY ARRIVES  </P> <P> OK, so the sun is shining, the palm fronds are swaying ever so gently and the  surfers are catching waves down at the beach. In Los Angeles, says Kristin  Zabawa, that's not enough to tell it's spring.  </P> <P> For Zabawa, an animal keeper in the bird nursery of the Los Angeles Zoo, spring  means baby birds.  </P> <P> "We're just starting to get eggs," she said Tuesday afternoon, shortly after  feeding a 3-week-old black-footed South African penguin named Art. "Right now  we have a king vulture egg -- they're from South America -- and a tawny  frogmouth."  </P> <P> Spring officially arrived in Southern California on Tuesday at 1:19 p.m.,  marking the vernal equinox, when the sun crosses the celestial Equator. Yet in  a region where the weather may be the same on New Year's Day as it is on the  Fourth of July, the season of rebirth and renewal is, as Zabawa says, heralded  by changes that transcend the climate.  </P> <P> The fragrance of night-blooming Jessamine (a cousin of jasmine, which won't be  blooming for another few weeks) sweetens the warm evening air. Rookie school  begins for would-be Los Angeles County lifeguards, and the Baywatch boats get a  fresh paint job. The fashion-conscious pull their crisp linen whites out of the  closet. On the city's Westside and in the Fairfax district, Passover matzo  begins appearing on the supermarket shelves.  </P> <P> At Dodger Stadium, Bob Smith, director of stadium operations since 1962, is  hurriedly preparing for the first cry of "Play Ball!"  </P> <P> "We've got gardeners and landscaping people, they're working on the field,  getting everything ready, planting flowers on the slopes, mowing and edging,"  he says. "We're hiring all our employees, the ushers, security people, ticket  takers. . . . Everybody's busy. The switchboard is lit up like a Christmas  tree."  </P> <P> At the Immaculate Conception School near downtown Los Angeles, paper Easter  eggs are popping up on classroom walls and bulletin boards. "The kindergartners  and first-graders have been growing plants for spring," says Principal Mary Ann  Murphy. "It's been real exciting for them to watch new life happen."  </P> <P> At Cal Poly Pomona, nursery technician Don DeLano sees spring in the colors of  his flowers: bright red roses, dazzling yellow daffodils, paper white  narcissus. "During the winter," he says, "you get your muted colors. I call  them somber shades -- burgundies, bronzes, tans. You get mixes of brown into  everything."  </P> <P> And lest you entertain the false notion that there are no weather changes  associated with springtime in Los Angeles, Scott Entrekin -- a meteorologist  for the National Weather Service -- will happily set you straight.  </P> <P> According to Entrekin, long-term climatological studies show that in Southern  California, the average chance of precipitation peaks during mid-February and  then again in March -- specifically on the 20th, the day winter turns into  spring. Beginning today, he said, those chances embark on a downward slide  toward summer.  </P> <P> "Generally," he said, "when spring starts to roll around we become a lot drier.  The chances of precipitation start to dwindle. The fog and low clouds  increase."  </P> <P> But that is of no interest to Pete Trilling, who along with his wife and young  daughter, was wandering about the zoo Tuesday -- a day when the temperature,  which hit a high of 90 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, was more reminiscent of  summer than spring.  </P> <P> Trilling, a Los Angeles police officer, said he moved here last year from South  Dakota for one simple reason: "So we could have spring all the time."  </P></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / BPB up 60% in wake of price war The share price of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, rose sharply yesterday after the company announced a 60 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 44m for the six months to the end of September. The rise follows the end of a debilitating European price war between BPB, Lafarge-Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany. BPB's share price rose 4 per cent yesterday to 278p following the announcement of higher profits and a new round of price increases in the UK, France and Germany from the beginning of next year. Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman and acting chief executive, said prices in its three main markets had risen on average by 25 per cent since the first quarter of last year. Plasterboard prices were planned to increase by a further 5 to 10 per cent from next year. This would leave them below levels of the late 1980s. The price war had cost the industry up to Pounds 200m a year in lost revenue. Mr Turner resumed control of the company after the previous chief executive, Mr John Maxwell, was ousted in September. Mr Pierre Cuny, who runs the group's gypsum interests from Paris, is expected to become the new chief executive. Mr Cuny was on Wednesday appointed group deputy chief executive. The rise in first-half pre-tax profits was achieved after a Pounds 8.3m redundancy charge. The interim dividend has been increased from 2.7p to 2.8p  -leaving it more than twice covered by earnings which rose from 3.7p to 6p. Turnover rose 5.4 per cent to Pounds 574.3m. Three-quarters of this increase was because of higher selling prices, said Mr Turner. Volume sales of plasterboard had also risen by 3 per cent. This was due mainly to a strong performance in Germany offsetting lower activity in Britain and France. Return on sales before redundancy charges increased three percentage points to 10 per cent. A net cash inflow of Pounds 38.5m enabled the group to reduce net borrowings to Pounds 198.3m - gearing of 28.8 per cent, against 38.4 per cent. BPB has signed a technical exchange agreement with Yoshino, Japan's biggest plasterboard manufacturer. Lex, Page 18</p>

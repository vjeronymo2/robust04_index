			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Britain announced an action  program Tuesday [31 May] to provide British companies with  better export opportunities in Japan.    The "action Japan" program is aimed at creating a  partnership  between Japan and Britain both at the governmental and private-  sector levels to make British products more competitive not only  in Japan but in global markets, British Trade and Industry  Minister Richard Needham said at a news conference in Tokyo.    The British Government has selected 10 industrial sectors  with the most growth potential as focusing areas under the  export campaign, Needham said.    He said the program will center on trade missions, trade  fairs, seminars and marketing research, all to be conducted  jointly with the Japan External Trade Organization.    The 10 designated sectors are health care, auto parts,  marine  equipment, power generation equipment, construction, giant  global projects, electronic components, environmental equipment  and services, food and beverages, and lifestyle-related areas  such as clothing, textiles and retailing.    Britain wants to expand Japanese-bound exports to 3.5  billion  pounds a year from the current 2.6 billion pounds within two or  three years, Needham said.    As a way to create larger business opportunities for British  firms, needham stressed the need for the Japanese Government to  ease its control on rules and regulations.    Needham said he recently presented to the Japanese  Government  a list of industrial sectors where Britain wants to see  deregulation.    The sectors are financial services, legal services,  telecommunications, oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, liquors,  food and beverages, autos and marine equipment, the trade  minister said.    It is necessary for British firms to compete with Japanese  counterparts "on a level playing field," Needham said.    Needham is visiting Japan as part of an export-promoting  tour  of five Pacific rim countries.    "Action Japan" is the third program of its kind that Britain  has formulated, following "opportunity Japan" in 1988 and  "priority Japan" in 1991.</p>

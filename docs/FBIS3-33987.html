The spokesman for the Majles commission on plans and budget  explained the changes in the budget bill and said: in comparison  to the bill presented by the government, the national budget has  been decreased by some 10 trillion rials, while the general  budget has been decreased by 3.7 trillion rials, and the gross  change that must be kept in mind during the second reading is  about 2.22 billion rials.    At the beginning of the open Majles session this afternoon,  deputy speaker Hasan Rowhani, who was in the seat of the  speaker, congratulated the deputies on the anniversary of the  return of the Imam Khomeyni to the Islamic motherland on 1  February 1979 and spoke of this day as an unforgettable holy day.    Mr. Hasan Rowhani referred to the various plots by the world  arrogant powers in creating confusion among the ever-vigilant  people of the country and pointed to the shooting incident this  morning at the start of the sacred 10 Days of Dawn ceremonies in  the pure shrine of his excellency, the imam.    He said: in a naive illusion and a childish move and by  firing several aimless shots into the air, the enemy imagined he  could disperse the people and disrupt the festivities marking  the 16th spring of freedom.    He emphasized: Such actions will definitely be to the loss  of  the enemy, and our people will not change their ways because of  such childish acts. They will continue to participate, actively  and with better spirit, in the festivities and other fields of  revolution.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 STROKES BEHIND LEADER, AUSSIE WAYNE GRADY;  </P> <P> TOM WATSON FIRES 68 IN ROYAL TROON 2ND ROUND  </P> <P> Tom Watson, searching for some golfing history in the misty Scottish haze he  loves so well, regained instead a touch of the magic that once was his alone.  </P> <P> "I'm not the golfer I was in 1980," the 39-year-old Watson said today, 'but  there's still a lot of that in me."  </P> <P> There was enough left to produce a 68 -- a scrambly, spectacular effort similar  to those of his glory years -- that lifted him to within two strokes of the  second round lead in the 118th British Open. And it afforded him a glimpse of  the goal he's seeking, a sixth British Open Championship to match the record  set by Harry Vardon in 1914.  </P> <P> "It was a mixed grill," Watson said of the four-under-par effort over the tame  and docile links of Royal Troon. "There was some luck. There was some magic. I  hit some bad shots. I hit some great shots," he said, then shrugged. "It was a  typical Tom Watson round."  </P> <P> It included the luck and magic of a 60-foot sand shot that nestled into the cup  for an eagle, along with a pair of 15-foot par-saving putts.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I'm in a good position to win. It's a matter of doing it. The  desire is there; no question about it," Watson said.  </P> <P> His foremost obstacle at the moment is Wayne Grady, an Australian journeyman  who has a history of second-place finishes, 26 of them in a globe-trotting  career.  </P> <P> Grady, who said he was "playing conservative, trying not to take on too much of  the golf course," saved a 67 and reached the tournament halfway point at 135,  nine shots under par.  </P> <P> Watson, who once dominated the world game but has won only once in the last  five years, was tied for second with Payne Stewart at 137.  </P> <P> Stewart, runner-up in the 1985 British Open, closed up with a course-record 65,  breaking the mark set by Sandy Lyle, Tom Purtzer and Bobby Clampett in 1982.  </P> <P> Eduardo Romero of Argentina, David Feherty of Northern Ireland and first round  leader Wayne Stephens of England were another stroke back at 138.  </P> <P> "We played a very easy Troon today," Watson said of the gentle breezes and  cool, misty drizzle. "The golf course had no teeth in it."  </P> <P> Former U.S. Open champ Scott Simpson, among others, took full advantage. He  birdied half the holes he played in a round of 66.  </P> <P> Simpson was tied at 139, four back, with Mark McCumber, Fred Couples, Steve  Pate, Mark Calcavecchia, Australian Greg Norman and a pair of Englishmen,  Derrick Cooper and Mark James.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino could do no better than a 73 and was at 141. Masters champ Nick  Faldo of England had another 71 and was at 142. U.S. Open champ Curtis Strange  was at 144 after a 74. Three-time British Open winner Jack Nicklaus shot 71 for  145.  </P> <P> While Watson and Stewart were advancing among the leaders, some of the European  stars who have dominated this tournament in recent years quietly slipped back  into the pack.  </P> <P> Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the defending champion and a three-time British Open  title-holder, took a 73 after missing six-foot putts on the last three holes  and was at 145.  </P></p>

Answering journalists' question about a possible government  reshuffle, Nicolae Vacaroiu said "the results of the activity of  some ministers and secretaries of state in this process of  transition" would be scrutinized. He opined that the scrutiny  "will disclose the way how they fulfill their duties". "The  government reshuffle will be to my mind a permanent target of  the executive's activity", the Romanian premier added.    Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu told on Monday the  press accredited to the Victoria Palace the his executive team  planned to implement in the first part of the year a set of  measures in the financial, monetary, currency and economic  fields aiming to recover macro-economic equilibrium. Among  them, the Romanian premier mentioned the bankruptcy bill, the  public finance bill and the stock exchange bill. The government  has considered also drafting decisions aiming to strengthen the  discipline of the economic agents.    The prime minister said the set of bills was much larger as  it targeted not only the economic field but also other fields  just as important: science, education, culture, justice,  defense.    In the context, the premier said that inflation would make  "a  slight jump" in the first part of the current year. The rate of  inflation would be 7-9 percent in the first 3-4 month and then,  because of the measures which would have been implemented, the  macro-economic stabilization would probably start and the  inflation would slow down to 3-5 percent in the second part of  the year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The second element described above concerns reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We request comments on what is reasonable compensation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a former requirements customer must pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues minus variable costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the future time period over which a customer's liability for stranded costs would be determined? That is, the present value of the customer's liability could be the discounted value of an annual amount for a limited time period. This total amount could be paid in a lump sum or over any mutually agreeable period. The limited time period over which the customer's liability is determined could be called the reasonable compensation period. If so:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Would the Commission apply the reasonable compensation period to assess the reasonableness of an exit fee in a revised requirements contract as well as a transmission surcharge?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) How long should such a time period be, e.g., five years or ten years or some other period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) When should such a period begin, e.g., if five years is a reasonable time over which a customer is liable for stranded costs, does the five-year period begin when the Commission adopts a final rule or when the utility files for stranded cost recovery in the future?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Should the length of a reasonable compensation period be based on what would constitute a reasonable notice period in requirements contracts or would some other concept be appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Establishing a reasonable compensation period effectively would also establish a future date beyond which requirements customers would no longer have any liability for stranded costs, either as an exit fee in revised requirements contracts or as a surcharge on transmission rates. Would this be appropriate? In responding, commenters should keep in mind that the concept of a reasonable time period for computing stranded cost liability is independent of the proposed three-year recontracting period for which the Commission is also requesting separate comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third element described above concerns mitigation measures. Adequate mitigation measures might include: (1) Evidence that the utility has tried to market the asset or assets, market the generating capacity, reconfigure or delay investment in or purchase of new generating capacity, or reform fuel supply contracts that form the basis for the stranded costs charge, and that such measures to mitigate stranded costs will continue for the entire period for which the stranded costs charge will be paid; or (2) the utility has given the customer the option to market the generating capacity or supply of fuel or purchased power that forms the basis for the stranded costs charge in order to afford the customer an opportunity to lower its stranded costs charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission expects the utility to use its best efforts to market its existing generating capacity as one way of mitigating costs. The Commission would expect to require revenues generated from sales of the capacity to be credited against the stranded costs to be recovered through transmission rates to the departing customer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission invites comment on the requirement that a utility must demonstrate reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs and what such measures may include.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also invites comment on how to determine the amount of stranded costs that the departing customer may be liable to pay. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entergy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission said that stranded costs could be no more than the revenues the departing customer would pay to the seller over the life of the contract. However, given that parties to requirements contracts are encouraged to include exit conditions (including notice provisions) in new contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts, it can be argued that stranded cost recovery should be capped at the revenues that the departing customer would pay after having given notice to the seller that it wishes to end all or some portion of its purchase. The problem then becomes what is a reasonable notice period, given the needs of sellers to adequately plan supply and the ability of sellers to find alternative buyers for power not taken by existing buyers. This issue pertains not only to determining stranded cost recovery in transmission rates but also to determining appropriate stranded cost provisions in new requirements contracts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission invites comments on reasonable notice periods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Recovery of Retail Stranded Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

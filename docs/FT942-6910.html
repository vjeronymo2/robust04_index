			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint tumbles Pounds 1.42m into deficit HunterPrint, the specialist printing group, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.42m for the half year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 330,000. The preference share dividend is again being omitted because of the negative revenue reserve. The company said there had been unexpected cost overruns in the first quarter associated with the launch of five new titles and the bedding down of three new presses. A cost reduction programme had been introduced in the second quarter. Turnover slipped from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 26.1m and net interest charges rose to Pounds 767,000 (Pounds 579,000). Retained losses amounted to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 295,000 profits) and losses per share were 2.6p (0.76p earnings). The company said its current trading profile would in future reduce the group's reliance on the first quarter.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA PAULA CLAIMS FRONTIER TITLE, 17-14  </P> <P> It was not a straight line and it was not the shortest distance between two  points, but Santa Paula followed the zigzag running of Dustin Magdaleno to the  Frontier League football title Friday night.  </P> <P> Magdaleno, Ventura County's all-time career reception leader, failed to catch a  pass but instead grinded his way to a career-high 187 yards in 22 carries as  Santa Paula held off a furious Fillmore rally for a 17-14 victory at Fillmore  in the 80th meeting between the schools.  </P> <P> Fillmore quarterback Art Sosa's desperation pass from midfield on the game's  final play was batted away by a Santa Paula defender at the five-yard line,  preserving the victory.  </P> <P> Santa Paula, which improved to 8-2 and 4-0 in league play, leads the series,  46-33-1. Fillmore, which suffered its second consecutive loss, is 8-2 and 2-2.  </P> <P> "The line just blew open holes like a torpedo," said Magdaleno, who entered the  contest with 33 catches but only 419 yards rushing. "It was a team effort."  </P> <P> While the Santa Paula offensive line was opening the way for Magdaleno, the  defensive line was holding back Fillmore's Tory Cabral.  </P> <P> Cabral, hampered by an ankle injury, was limited to 53 yards in 19 carries and  three receptions for 53 yards. But 40 of those receiving yards came on a  three-play, 72-yard drive that cut Santa Paula's advantage to 17-14 with 2  minutes 27 seconds left.  </P> <P> Fillmore's Gabino Martinez then recovered Eddie Rabingo's fumble at the  Flashes' 34 with 55 seconds left to set up Sosa's desperation pass.  </P> <P> Ben Fausset connected with Chris Gomez on a 14-yard scoring pass with 3:14 left  in the second quarter and Steve Dysart added the extra point for the only score  of the first half.  </P> <P> Santa Paula scored again on its opening possession of the second half when  Dysart's 38-yard field goal put Santa Paula ahead, 10-0, with 9:07 left in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> Fillmore cut the lead to 10-7 on a two-yard plunge by Cabral on the Flashes'  ensuing series.  </P> <P> Art Marcelo, who had two interceptions in the first half, reeled in an 18-yard  touchdown pass from Fausset to give Santa Paula a 17-7 advantage five minutes  into the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

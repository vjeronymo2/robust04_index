			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The dime novels always talk about cops putting people on the hot seat, but  c'mon.  </P> <P> A self-contained trailer fitted out with six solar-powered bathrooms will be  delivered next week to the Los Angeles Police Department from a Riverside firm  whose proud motto is, "We offer luxury seating."  </P> <P> The man who coordinated this for the LAPD's tactical planning unit is Sgt. Stan  Roberts, and the guys have given him quite enough ribbing about "Stan's cans."  </P> <P> The city had been looking for some time for a portable system it could use in  outdoor operations like an earthquake, for example. This one they can trundle  out to "situations like Operation Rescue (daylong mass arrests)," Roberts said,  "and field emergency operations where there's no hand-washing facilities  available, and no power sources. These things run on their own solar-charged  cells."  </P> <P> Sam R. Torres created Solar Sanitation Systems three years ago, and now his  potties are invited to all the best places, like the opening of the Nixon  Library in Orange County and PGA tournaments. His are rather like airline  bathrooms, and more sanitary than hole-in-one portable toilets, he says. The  solar power provides lights as well as running water for flushing and for the  stainless steel sink. He added a bit of carpeting, after golfers' cleats  scarred the linoleum.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy has ordered some, and so, says Torres, has the Soviet Union,  where people are used to standing in line for everything.  </P> <P> But, is it Art? No, it's Jonell -- Jonell Gomez, a painter photographed on his  way to a job in a Hollywood building. Pictures can deceive: Gomez was not the  art critic responsible for the comment painted above the graffiti on the  building's exterior. His job is to paint the interior.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, our answer to the graffiti question is, No, we can't read it. Can  you? We hear so much about slum dwellings that we now pause for some anecdotes  about the high-priced spreads.  </P> <P> The current Southern California Real Estate Journal invited property managers  to unburden themselves in its pages, and they bewail luxury condo and  office-building tenants who have:  </P> <P>  -- used the sauna to thaw frozen turkeys;  </P> <P>  -- hung meat in the elevators to harass other tenants;  </P> <P>  -- shut down one elevator at the same time every day to have sex between  floors.  </P> <P> One tenant with a fancy aquarium demanded to be reimbursed 20 fins per fish  (that's $100 in old street slang) after some of them died when the  air-conditioning failed. The property manager noted that the lease offered no  provision for that, and the tenant relented, but sniffled, "It would have been  nice if you had sent a condolence card, or went to the funeral."  </P> <P> That special phone number Todd Witteles asked for last year because it was  "easy to remember," the one with 7777 as the last four digits -- it's been  rather too easy.  </P> <P> First, giggly schoolgirls happened onto it, and now call up daily to hear  Witteles' ever-changing messages on his answering machine in Rancho Palos  Verdes. Then, "every little baby in the area seems to pick up the phone and  randomly dial my number," the result being endless recordings of "a lot of  babbling, then some father yelling 'Hang up that phone!' "  </P> <P> The worst, though, came not long ago, when some investment house ran a  newspaper ad with the same phone number, preceded by "this very small 800." So  small that several hundred readers didn't even see it, and all called Witteles  for investment information.  </P> <P> Never seek financial advice from a ticked-off 18-year-old. Witteles said he  left a "nasty message" on his machine, and within days, a new ad appeared, with  a new number to call, and the 800 part printed "real big."  </P> <P> Seen dockside: Adel Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash, awaiting a new trial  after a mistrial in the quadruple 1981 Laurel Canyon murders, had his day in  someone else's court on Wednesday. Nash, held without bail and wearing jail  blues, testified during the penalty phase for Linell Dumas, convicted of  murdering the mother of a sheriff's deputy. Nash appeared as a character  witness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The Electric Theater, this movie town's first movie house, opened on South Main  Street on April 2, 1902.MARILYN WEISS / For The Times  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / IG Metall extends strike IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, yesterday extended its indefinite strike action to 13 more enterprises, with the ailing steel industry particularly targeted. More than 35,000 eastern German steel, metal and engineering workers from 70 enterprises are now on strike in support of higher wage claims. They are demanding the reinstatement of a March 1991 contract, which Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers association, cancelled last month. The contract was aimed at equalising eastern and western wages by next year. Wages in eastern Germany are about 60 per cent of western German levels. IG Metall said the strikes would continue, and spread. However, it said the union would try to renew negotiations in the Saxon capital of Dresden which had broken down earlier in the week. Negotiations between the union and employers were due to start last night in Rostock, in the northern state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the heart of the dwindling shipbuilding industry. Industrial orders in the west German economy dropped another 3 per cent in March, and seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in April, confirming that the economic recession is still deepening, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The only hopeful indicator was that the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed slightly in the past month, but the headline figure for the country as a whole remains above 3.3m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tiit Tambi: "Russian Troops Leaving, But Not </F> Fast Enough"]    [Text]  <H5>  December Last </H5>   According to the foreign ministry, the following additional  objects have been turned over by the Russian army, since  December 1, 1993.    The 144th motorized rifle division turned over the remainder  of the Aegviidu polygon, roughly 300 hectares. Since the rest  had been received before, Aegviidu is now fully turned over.    The Piirsalu storage facilities were taken over from the  navy, making Laanemaa the 13th district that is  `clean.'    One third of the fuel terminal at Tallinn's North Harbor has  been taken over. Documents to be signed are with the commander  of the Northwest sector, as are those for the Hydrographic  Service of the Baltic fleet.    During the last week of the year just ended, roughly 40  armored vehicles were taken out by rail from the Klooga and  Tallinn units of the 144th motorized rifle division.  <H5>  The Mines of Naissaare </H5>   Out of the previously determined number of 330 newer type  sea  mines at Naissaare, 282 had been removed by December 25. Only 48  mines are left that can be put on one ship of the `Girocompass'  type. There were also 1,454 mines of the older type. Out of  those 828 have been destroyed by burning, leaving a balance of  626. However, the pace of work has slacked off a bit lately,  because out of the 37 navy personnel, only 18 are left.  According to authorities at the Tallinn naval base, mine  clearing at Naissaare should be completed by April 1, even  though experts think the job could be completed within a month.  <H5>  Packing Noted at the Radio Reconnaissance Station </H5>   Packing is also going on at the radio reconnaissance center  at Vana-Aaviku, near Juri, in the Harjumaa district. At  one  time, this object belonged to KGB, but was later turned over to  the navy. Its operating reach covered the coastal areas of the  United States and Canada, and the Mediterranean region, not to  mention the continent of Europe. The center itself did not pose  any particular danger to Estonia but, since it was aimed from  our territory against other states, it was that much more  troublesome politically.    Now, the dismantling of receivers has begun. The senders are  still in place, but the station as a whole is no longer  operational. Local commanders think that dismantling will be  completed in February. After that, the buildings and antennas  will be turned over to Estonia. (The equipment is obsolete and  Estonia does not need it). In contrast to many others, this  object is in good order, nothing has been broken.    In summary, one could say that foreign troops are leaving,  indeed, but at a very slow pace. In tomorrow's paper, we shall  try to analyze why this is so.</p>

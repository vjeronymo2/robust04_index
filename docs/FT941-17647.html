			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: A simpler, more elegant design on life. . .  -Josephine Fairley asks the style professionals how to make the very most of the New Year sales and how to avoid costly mistakes This is the season when the bargain-hunting sorts those shoppers worthy of Olympic medals from the amateurs. Spot the former, riffling calmly through the rails of discounted garments, wish-list clasped in one hand, while the other keeps a sensible grip on the credit card. The rest of us look frenzied and get excited over fashion follies which lived to haunt their designers - and will soon do the same for us. One New York shopper I know freezes her credit card in ice during the sales. Should she fall in love with an item, she returns home and waits for her Amex to defrost. If it still seems a good idea, she hot-foots back to the shop and bags her quarry. I asked style professionals about their strategies for bargain hunting and their best and worst buys. Gabriella Di Nora, personal shopping manager, Harvey Nichols My best buy was a Donna Karan ivory V-neck silk crepe blouse, down from Pounds 225 to around Pounds 65, which looked nothing on the hanger but fabulous when I tried it on. My worst buy was a beautiful pair of Betty Jackson black crepe trousers for half-price - around Pounds 55. I thought I was being terribly clever because they matched a skirt suit I'd got from her, but they were so baggy in the crotch I looked like I was wearing a nappy. Trying things on is essential, even in a sale. So is wearing the right outfit to shop in: a body, trousers and a soft top, slip-on shoes the height you'd wear with trousers - and definitely tights, not stockings] Don't ever take your partner. You may gain a bargain, but lose a relationship. John Morgan, associate editor, GQ My best buy was a huge alpaca teddy bear coat by Richard James, which comes to my ankles and could accommodate several of me. It's a splendid seasonal security blanket and is wonderfully warm. My worst mistake was in Paris, when I got confused by continental sizing and managed to buy a pair of shoes a whole size too small. I did try them on, but didn't frogmarch up and down like you should - it was a real case of sales fever. Fortunately I was able to find a Cinderella whose foot they fitted, and passed them on. Ask yourself whether you would want to buy the item if it was full price - because something is only a bargain if you get a lot of wear out of it. I approach sales with caution and find them good hunting grounds for basics such as shoes and knitwear. Nicola Jeal, editor, Elle My best buy is a pair of Manolo Blahnik purple suede riding boots, Pounds 100 down from Pounds 300. They are incredibly comfortable. My worst buy is a pair of Manolo Blahnik turquoise suede riding boots, from the same sale, but a size smaller. I made the mistake of thinking I could stretch them. They're cripplingly tight. I always take a small mirror with me, so that I can check the back-view of everything I try on. Geraldine James, contemporary collections buyer, Harrods My best buy was a grey wool Workers For Freedom short pleated skirt, half price at Pounds 90, which I got two winters ago and I've worn at least once a week since - partly because it has an elasticated waist, so it's incredibly comfortable] My worst buy was a Donna Karan jacket, in pink - a colour I never normally wear, and which became instantly dated. It cost around Pounds 175, down from Pounds 300. It's still sitting unworn in my wardrobe. Do not buy things that are incredibly fashionable because they date so quickly. Go for neutral colours and classics, or look at the upcoming season's fashions (in magazines) to help identify something on the rails that you'll want to wear sooner, rather than later. Iain R Webb, fashion editor, The Times: My best buy was a trio of linen jackets, bought for Dollars 50 each in a Gap shop in New York, in banana, sky blue and a Madras plaid. My worst buy was a Byblos silk shirt, reduced to Pounds 200 in the Harvey Nichols sale. It was cream and black deckchair stripes, splashed with huge red hibiscus flowers and looked wonderful until I put it on. (The friend I gave it to was very pleased, though). Always try things on, rather than go by the tag - even if the label says it's a medium, that may be a mistake. Sophie Laybourne, Daily Telegraph fashion writer: My best buy was an Aquascutum 40s-style fake beaver fur coat, which I picked up in Harrods' sale for around Pounds 100 - down from about Pounds 250 - long before fake fur became trendy. It was unbelievably warm, and looked so like the real thing that, heart-breakingly, it was eventually stolen off the back seat of my car one dark night. I wore it so often I became known as The Beaver. My worst buy was a Rifat Ozbek jacket, when he first became fashionable and everyone - from the Princess of Wales down - was wearing his stuff. I bought it in Browns in South Molton Street and it cost around Pounds 400 even in the sale. It was so ultra-fashionable and had been so widely photographed that by the time the weather was right to wear it again it was very identifiably Last Year's Jacket. I was going to a wedding and I was young and in love and wanted to appear desperately chic, but instead looked like something out of Dynasty. Do not to shop in sales when - for love or any other reason - you're feeling terribly pleased with yourself, because you tend to think you look fabulous in anything.' Caroline Baker, fashion editor, Good Housekeeping My best buy was a Pounds 50 Ralph Lauren bias-cut yellow paisley silk skirt, a perennial classic I wore constantly. My worst was a Yohji Yamomoto brown pin-striped jacket, cut out of one piece of fabric, terribly unstructured at a time when everyone was into the 1980s executive look; I rather regret getting rid of it, now that everything's unstructured again. At least I didn't waste much money - it was about Pounds 10 on the last day of the sale. Lisa Nelson, chairman, P R Unlimited My best buy was a blue suede Gucci jacket, which was outrageously priced before the sale but became affordable at around Pounds 300. My worst was a pair of purple Azzedine Alaia stretch trousers, which I got in Browns for Pounds 100 and never wore. I'd always wanted something by Alaia but I made the classic sales mistake of being seduced by the designer label, without asking myself whether I'd ever wear it. Lowri Turner, fashion editor, Evening Standard My best buy was a Jasper Con-ran black viscose knit wrap-over ankle-length skirt, reduced by about 50 per cent to Pounds 75, which I bought without even trying on. I thought it would be a good basic, but when I tried it at home I discovered it moved beautifully and was also really sexy. 'My worst buy was a Richmond / Cornejo lime green viscose circle skirt which stopped just below the knee - the most unflattering length. This was 10 years ago, and I was just so thrilled to have something by Richmond / Cornejo - but it was such a disaster and I was so embarrassed I put it in the cupboard without even taking the ticket off. My strategy would be: buy duplicates of things you've already got in your wardrobe, because you know they work for you. Don't take any risks. Anna Harvey, deputy editor, Vogue: My best buy was a blonde cashmere Jaeger trench coat, reduced to Pounds 40 from about Pounds 250. Even 15 years ago, this was so cheap that I thought they must have made a mistake and held my breath all the way to the till. My worst buy was more recent, in Rayne: they had comfortable little flat shoes for Pounds 40, reduced from Pounds 99, and although I only needed black I got a bad case of the Imelda Marcoses, and bought four other pairs in different colours - which I've never worn. My sales advice: the best shops have the best sales. Nick Sullivan, fashion director, Esquire: I paid around Pounds 85 for my best buy, a Paul Smith Shetland sweater of the kind you had when you were about three; it's donkey-coloured, nicely scratchy and incredibly warm. My worst buy was a suit from Rees, which I paid about Pounds 120 for some years ago; the shape was great but I made the fatal mistake of not taking it to the daylight to check the colour. When I got it home, it was a ghastly khaki and it made me look like a chauffeur. Pause and think before you buy: will it fill a gap in my wardrobe, do I need it? June Marsh, fashion editor, Country Life: My best buy was a Margaret Howell blue velvet skirt, reduced to Pounds 90 from Pounds 200 last winter, and it's barely been off my back since. My worst was a pair of Pucci leggings which weren't me at all - I just loved the colours. Go for classics, rather than high fashion items - and avoid bright colours however gloriously cheerful, unless you're planning to move to Sydney. Caroline Neville, Caroline Neville public relations: My best buy was at The Woollen Mill, a permanent sale shop in St Andrew's. I picked up a huge cashmere throw for about Pounds 150 that would easily have cost Pounds 500 in London. My worst buy was a pair of Dollars 150 glittery earrings bought in a store on Madison Avenue. They looked bold and daring in dynamic New York but in more restrained London, they were simply over-the-top. It's vital to go on a reconnaissance mission: you don't then fall in love with the first crazy thing you see and regret it further down the street. Jackie Modlinger, fashion director, Daily Express: My best buy was a Ralph Lauren pin-striped short skirt, which I bought last summer in their sale for Pounds 50 when I realised that short skirts were going to make a comeback. It matched a Ralph Lauren suit I'd bought earlier in the season (which had a long skirt and trousers) making the suit even more versatile. Go for a designer label that you've always coveted and could never afford rather than cheap labels that have been marked dow even further.</p>

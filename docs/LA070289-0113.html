			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BALANCE COVERAGE  </P> <P> I am intrigued by the fact that your reporter felt it necessary to stress the  point that only one of the candidates running for the 76th Assembly seat,  Stephen Thorne of Escondido, is an atheist ("11 Candidates Seek Seat Held by  Bradley," June 27).  </P> <P> Why weren't the religious affiliations, or lack of religious affiliations, of  the 10 other candidates mentioned?  </P> <P> Is this the kind of one-sided reporting that we are to expect in the upcoming  election? Let's see some balanced campaign reporting for a change.  </P> <P> JON GARTH MURRAY  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

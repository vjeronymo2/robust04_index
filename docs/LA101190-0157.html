			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE UNDERDOG DEMOCRATS TAKE THEIR CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCES INTO CLASSROOMS  </P> <P> When political science professors Guy Kimbrough, Peter Mathews and Fred Smoller  lecture to their students about the power of interest groups and the role of  money in elections, they offer more than just dry observations gleaned from  scholarly journals.  </P> <P> For while all three are capable of elevating their political discussion to a  theoretical plane, they are also all in the midst of their own very real  campaigns for public office: Kimbrough is a congressional candidate, hoping to  unseat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), Smoller has his sights set on  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), and Mathews is challenging Assemblywoman  Doris Allen (R-Cypress).  </P> <P> All three also are Orange County Democrats, and chances are good they'll still  be teaching after the November election rather than lecturing new legislative  colleagues on Gramscian hegemony or the decline of the American party system.  </P> <P> But that hasn't stopped any of them from waging aggressive campaigns. And, if  they are unsuccessful in pulling off the upset, their candidacies are an  opportunity for themselves and students to learn firsthand about politics, they  say.  </P> <P> "You participate in the process and you gain new insights," said Smoller, a  tenured professor at Chapman College, who recently had a book published on  media coverage of the White House. "As a teacher . . . I thought this would be  an interesting way to create some opportunities for my students."  </P> <P> Chapman students helped produce a 30-second cable TV ad for Smoller's campaign  that attacks Lewis for alleged ethical transgressions. Smoller's campaign  manager, Rob Crane, is a 21-year-old Chapman senior and political science major  who hopes to be a full-time political consultant someday.  </P> <P> "I probably have the only campaign manager in the county who works part-time in  a comic book store," Smoller said.  </P> <P> Kimbrough, who heads the political science program at Mt. San Jacinto College  in Riverside County, has a number of his former students who are now at  four-year colleges in high-level positions in his campaign.  </P> <P> Mathews, who teaches courses in government, politics and international  relations and is co-director of the political science club at Cypress College,  has built up an extensive network of student volunteers who work out of an  office set up next to a pizza parlor across from the campus.  </P> <P> "This is strictly a grass-roots effort," said Mathews, who hopes to raise about  $16,000 altogether.  </P> <P> All three professor-candidates use students in their campaign, but they have  different rules regarding their use. Smoller said he would allow students in  his classes to work on his campaign, leaving open the possibility that other  students in the class might feel pressured to do the same. Both Mathews and  Kimbrough said they do not allow students currently taking their classes to  volunteer for them.  </P> <P> "I just don't think it's appropriate," said Kimbrough.  </P> <P> "We can both be totally honest, but there is still the appearance of a  conflict-of-interest," said Mathews. "I've had to turn several students down  who wanted to volunteer."  </P> <P> Smoller, however, said he sees no problem using current students, adding that  he does not currently have any of his students working on the campaign.  </P> <P> "I have students baby-sit for me too, is that a conflict?" Smoller said. "Given  the probable outcome of this race, I really see this as an experience to take  part in a campaign, and I don't want to deprive them of a really meaningful  project."  </P> <P> Another problem the three candidates must consider is how to keep their  lectures from becoming campaign forums; all of them use their own campaign  experiences to illustrate topics in their lectures, but say they try to keep  their own politics from becoming the focus of discussion.  </P> <P> The problem arose for Kimbrough when he showed one of his classes a tape of a  candidates forum that included Kimbrough and Rohrabacher and asked the students  to critique their performances. "If anything, what I will usually do is I will  try to point out some of Rohrabacher's assets," said Kimbrough, who is shielded  somewhat from the problem because few, if any of his students, are registered  to vote in his congressional district. "It's a fine line you have to walk,  though."  </P> <P> Mathews says he makes an effort to keep his campaign out of the classroom, but  if a student asks him his view on an issue, he will offer it.  </P> <P> "Professors, I think, should give their own views as well as other views,"  Mathews said.  </P> <P> Smoller, who sees his candidacy as more of a valuable academic exercise than do  the other two professors, also draws more freely on his campaign experience in  class.  </P> <P> In one recent lecture he delivered to a sociology class, Smoller talked  extensively about his motivations for running and what he has learned as a  candidate outside the Ivory Tower.  </P> <P> "It's a completely different set of activities from grading papers, standing up  and waving to crowds, shaking hands," Smoller said. "People don't defer to Dr.  Smoller. They're not impressed by my academic resume."  </P> <P> Smoller also talked about something he calls "the fear of politics" in Orange  County, a phenomenon that he says he has encountered again and again in his  campaign -- voters at a street fair asking him why he is being "so political"  on a holiday weekend, mall managers asking him not to bother shoppers outside  their stores.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Atilio R. Fernandez, former presidential election  campaign director, on 3 June presented his government program  within the framework of his campaign to head the ANR [National  Republican Association--Colorado Party]. His speech started with  a call "to civilian Colorados and military Colorados." The rally  was attended by about 4,000 people, most of them top state  officials and departmental and municipal authorities.    Many well-known leaders of the so-called "Stroessnerist  militant faction" [former dictator Alfredo Stroessner's  supporters], including Ramon Enrique Reverchon and Juan Jose  Benitez Rickman, attended the rally.    The night's most noticeable item, without a doubt, was the  large number of posters saying "Oviedo '98" [General Lino Oviedo  for president in 1998], which was the exclusive responsibility  of Guaira Governor Rodolfo Max Friedmann, according to the  organizers. Eight of the total of 12 Colorado governors attended  the meeting.    The event was opened by campaign spokesman and former  Education Minister Horacio Galeano Perrone. After talking about  the Colorado Party's internal divisions and its history, Galeano  Perrone urged Colorado followers to work for unity without  exclusions. At the end of his speech, Galeano Perrone emphasized  that the faction headed by Fernandez did not accept the division  between "military and civilians" and made an ardent call for  unity within the party, "accepting the past with its lights and  shadows."    Several sections of his speech were dedicated to lashing out  at other internal movements despite his call for unity.    Among those attending were Paul Sarubbi and Gustavo Pedrozo  and Deputies Bernardino Cano Radil and Conrado Pappalardo. The  presence of Ramon Duarte Vera, the controversial former police  chief during the Stroessner administration, also was noteworthy.</p>

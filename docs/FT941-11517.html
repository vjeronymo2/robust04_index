			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Mirror-backed group in Pounds 50m bid to control Independent The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers is planning a pre-emptive strike to try to win early control of the loss-making company that publishes The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. A formal offer is expected from the consortium today valuing the company at more than Pounds 50m - an offer that is being pitched directly at the institutional shareholders which hold 52 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns the two newspapers. The offer, for more than Pounds 2.50 a share, will be in the form of a mixture of MGN shares and cash. There will also be a full cash alternative. By moving now, the consortium, which holds nearly 48 per cent of the company, is by-passing Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and his team of non-executive directors who are assessing the consortium bid and a rival bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland. The implication of the decision to go ahead without either recommendation or endorsement from the board suggests that the MGN consortium may have become exasperated by delays and the continuing talks with the O'Reilly team. Some of the consortium fear that the non-executive directors of Newspaper Publishing favour the O'Reilly bid for up to 24.99 per cent of the company plus a willingness to buy out up to 20 per cent of the existing shares held by institutions. The consortium brings together founders of The Independent, including Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the two main existing shareholders, the Spanish and Italian newspaper groups, El Pais and La Repubblica, and Mirror Group Newspapers, which plans to take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing. As part of the deal, MGN would take over the management of the broadsheet newspaper publisher, apart from editorial, with an inevitable loss of jobs. The deal, it is believed, will be underwritten by MGN, publishers of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People. It is clear that Mr Hay Davison has been trying to get an auction going and has been asking both sides to improve their offer. The O'Reilly camp, for instance, has been asked to extend its offer to include more than 20 per cent of the institutional shares, perhaps also bringing in a partner. The O'Reilly bid stands little chance of success unless it can gain the support of at least some members of the consortium. Mr Giles Elliott of Schroders, the merchant bank, acting for El Pais and La Repubblica, has made it clear that his clients and the founders of The Independent will vote against an O'Reilly deal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Husni Mubarak this morning received Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid [former Yemeni  vice president]. The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa.    Al-'Attas stated after the meeting that they discussed the  situation in Yemen. He said: We thank Egypt and President  Mubarak for all the efforts that have been made and are being  made to end the war in Yemen and to deal with the situation in a  way that would ensure stability in the country. He said that he  will continue his consultations with the officials in Egypt, the  other Arab states, and the friendly states.    Asked whether the purpose of his tour is to seek recognition  for Democratic Yemen, he said: What we are interested in right  now is to stop the war. He noted that the continuation of the  war is a loss not only for Yemen but also for all the Arab  countries. Al-'Attas said: We are demanding an end to this war  and the withdrawal of the forces to the positions they held  before 22 May 1990, that is before the unity. Then it would be  possible to conduct a dialogue on all the issues and on the ways  to resolve them. This includes the effects of the war and the  future of Yemen.    Asked about the statement of Yemeni Planning Minister  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani that contacts are taking place between  Sanaa and members of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], al-'Attas  said: There are no members in the YSP conducting mediation  independently from the party leadership. But there are other  national figures, led by Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-al-Shawarib, a principal member of the Dialogue Committee of  the national and political forces who earlier held consultations  with a number of figures outside the country. When some ideas  began to take shape, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih contacted these  figures and dissuaded them from continuing these efforts.  Whereas, we welcome any Yemeni or other efforts. He said that  these ideas have now been resurrected. He noted that they are  ready to consider any form of dialogue through the leadership in  southern Yemen.    Answering a question about the aid that Saudi Arabia is  providing to South Yemen, al-'Attas said: There are many claims  in this regard that aim at extortion. But we have confidence in  the capabilities of our people, all our brothers, and all our  friends who help us.    Asked how the military operations are proceeding now,  al-'Attas said that there are many victims because the  leadership in the north is involving thousands of our Yemeni  people in the war with no consideration for the number of  victims. We are sorry for this loss. He added: War is bound  to break any ties of love among the Yemeni people. It will also  create hatred, problems, and acts of revenge among the people.  This war was the first blow to Yemeni unity.    Asked South Yemen's response if the issue were raised in the  UN Security Council, al-'Attas said: We indeed prefer raising  the issue at the Security Council, which can help stop the war.  He explained that when South Yemen made the decision to restore  the situation to what it was before 22 May 1990, it sought to  protect the disintegration of Yemen into several states. When  the situation returns to what it was before 22 May, there will  be a time to think and proceed toward the future with complete  clarity. He said that in the light of the current situation,  the existence of two states in Yemen would be better for all  concerned.    Answering a question about al-Iryani's statement yesterday  that the northern forces have decided not to enter Aden,  al-'Attas said: They are unable to enter Aden. Had they been  able to enter Aden by force, they would have done so. They have  often declared that they will end the war within 48 hours, and  here we are in the fourth week of fighting.    Answering a question about what was discussed during his  meeting with President Mubarak, al-'Attas said: I briefed  President Mubarak on the situation in Yemen and the president's  reaction was positive regarding the need to end the problems in  Yemen. He noted that he is currently making a tour of the area,  and that he will leave for Syria after his visit to Egypt.    Al-'Attas denied Aden's responsibility for the outbreak of  fighting, emphasizing that Sanaa started the war. Al-'Attas  then reviewed the developments that took place following the  signing of the Pledge and Agreement Document in Jordan and the  cabinet meetings held in Aden and Ta'izz to implement the  document.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (5): Intense backroom battle - Deregulation Newcomers to Japan sometimes find it hard to understand why the country has such efficient manufacturing industries and yet such a primitive service sector. This is precisely the problem that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, is seeking to tackle with his potentially wide-ranging programme to scrap or review more than 10,000 regulations that control an estimated 40 per cent of Japanese industry. If Mr Hosokawa has his way, he will remove many of the unnecessary costs of complying with bureaucratic rules that provide such a drag on Japanese competitiveness, as exposed by the yen's steep rise. The upshot could be to improve Japanese industry's growth potential at a time when important international car and consumer electronics markets are becoming mature. Foreign companies also have a stake in this. If successful, Mr Hosokawa's deregulation drive could ease the way for imports, by streamlining complex certification procedures and removing a layer or two of the Byzantine distribution system that drives up costs to the benefits of hordes of middle men. Estimates of the general economic impact vary widely. At the conservative end, the Japan Research Institute, a private body, believes the programme could unleash a Y44,800bn rise in gross consumption, of which Y32,900bn would be increased imports and the remaining Y11,900bn would be supplied by domestic industry. At the optimistic end, one US economics expert believes that demand could rise by Y80,000bn, as a result. But first, the new government has to overcome fierce entrenched opposition, which has ensured that previous attempts at cutting red tape by earlier governments have got nowhere. Traditionally protected industries such as distribution, rice and construction fear losing their privileges. Japan's powerful civil service, unsurprisingly, resents this attempt to reduce its bureaucratic influence. That is why the deregulation drive has run into an intense backroom battle, as a result of which the first achievements are likely to be slight. Perhaps it is just as well that initial progress will be slow, for US and European Union experience during the 1980s shows that deregulation tends to produce a short-term rise in unemployment, as inefficient businesses go bankrupt, before the reduction in costs works through to the economy at large. The last thing that Japan's economy needs in the middle of a recession is a dose of deflation, points out Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. Yet it is surprising that any progress has been possible, given the difficulty of obtaining agreement on anything in a seven-party coalition. Just after taking office in early August, Mr Hosokawa asked government ministries to come up with a list of rules for the scrap heap. At the same time, he established a panel of 15 business leaders, economists and former officials, under Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation, to consider broader economic reforms centred on how to stimulate domestic demand. A month later, the ministries produced 60 proposals, most of which had already been gathering dust for years or were likely to have little impact. They included an easing of restrictions on the freight weight of trucks, an end to minimum production limits for brewers - which keep potential small producers out of the market - and fewer car roadworthiness inspections. The package also proposed a relaxation in regulations on new retail stores, although the details are vague. Undeterred, Mr Hosokawa sent the ministries back to the drawing board, after which they produced 34 more proposals, announced in mid-September at the same time as a Y6,150bn economic pump-priming package. The most radical new measure in the second round was to publish monthly lists of import cost prices for basic consumer goods, to exert moral pressure on high-priced retailers to trim profit margins and pass down some of the benefits of the yen's strength to customers. The next stage, generally greeted as a disappointment, was last month's publication of the interim report of Mr Hiraiwa's panel. The report, already once rewritten after Mr Hosokawa rejected a first draft as too vague, says there should be 'no sanctuaries' from deregulation. It singles out as urgent examples for review 500 rules, including the rice import ban and the resale price system, which requires some products to be sold at producers' recommended prices. It also calls for the establishment next April of a central body, under the prime minister's direct control, to carry out a five-year deregulation plan. Mr Hiraiwa promises more concrete proposals in his final report, due on December 15. That will provide the most revealing indicator to date of whether or not the new government will do any better than previous ones at overcoming bureaucratic attempts to block deregulation. The signs are, however, that this will get further than previous attempts at cutting red tape, such as the 1986 Maekawa report, named after its author, a former governor of the Bank of Japan. That proposed a shift away from export-led growth, the traditional engine of Japan's post-war economy, to domestic growth, fuelled by consumer demand. None of its proposals were acted on and it is the Hiraiwa panel's job to turn the Maekawa principles into concrete proposals for action. Mr Hosokawa has in his favour support from the top business lobbies, which see deregulation as an important way to reduce costs - on distribution, for example - and to help reduce the yen's value and assuage trade tension. Indeed, the Keidanren has criticised Mr Hosokawa for not going far enough and has persuaded the government to adopt some of its own deregulation ideas. Added to this, Japan's political upheavals coincide with the arrival of a younger generation of men in national politics, keen to raise living standards and satisfy consumers' interests rather than pander to traditional vested interests. A third force for deregulation comes from Japan's foreign trade partners. The US and the European Union are both increasing pressure on Japan to stimulate domestic demand as a way of cutting the trade surplus. That is why all involved agree that Mr Hosokawa has started a process that, over years, will shake up Japan's industrial system. 'In the longer term, the direction set by these preliminary measures will impact the future shape of Japanese business, politics and ostensibly the social structure of the country,' argues a paper by Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sprint to Proceed With Toll-Free IRS Number: US Sprint Communications Co. said  it will go ahead with a disputed proposal to offer special 800-number calling  for taxpayers seeking information from the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> One of Sprint's major rivals, MCI Communications Corp., had challenged the  "enhanced" toll-free offering in court, saying the service fell outside the  scope of the contract for the new federal long-distance system known as FTS  2000. Sprint is providing 40% of FTS 2000; AT&amp;T has 60%. The taxpayer  assistance service handles more than 60 million calls per year, according to  Sprint, which valued the contract at $450 million over 10 years. MCI said it  may file an appeal in the case.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian uranium mining curbs to stay There will be no immediate relaxation of Australia's constraints on uranium mining, and the issue has been referred to the ruling Australian Labour Party's national executive for consideration in three years' time. The sidestep, which was agreed yesterday at the ALP's national conference in Hobart, follows a week of uncertainly as advocates of a more liberal uranium policy sought to secure support for the opening of new mines. The ALP has a long-standing policy of restricting uranium mining to three sites. However, one of these mines is now worked out, and a second is approaching exhaustion. This situation, coupled with the desire of some Aborigine representatives to see uranium mining expanded in the Northern Territory, led to serious speculation that a change in policy could be agreed. Throughout the week, it had been touch-and-go whether pro-mining supporters could raise enough votes from delegates to the conference. On Wednesday night, many political commentators thought they had achieved the objective, although any new mine would have been bound to employ union labour - a condition designed to penalise CRA, the Australian mining group, which has been seeking to employ workers on individual staff contracts. Yesterday morning, however, a number of Victorian and Queensland delegates shifted in favour of the status quo. Last night, Mr Brian Ede, the Northern Territory opposition leader who had pushing hard for a change, estimated that - had the matter gone to a vote - 48 delegates would have been in favour of a change, compared with 54 against. Australia is reckoned to have about 30 per cent of the western world's low-cost uranium reserves but produces only about 10 per cent of the western world's supply. The two projects that are operating under the three-mines policy are Olympic Dam, owned by Western Mining Corporation, and Ranger, belonging to Energy Resources of Australia. Had policy been relaxed, projects most likely to go ahead would have included Koongarra and North Ranger/Jabiluka, both in Northern Territory. However, given the current low level of uranium prices, analysts believed that most mining companies would have been in no rush to open up new mines, although they added that there was a fair chance that additional projects would have come on stream over the next decade. Last night, ERA said it was extremely disappointed at the ALP's decision to retain the status quo. It said that, in conjunction with Aborigine owners, it would approach the government between conferences and continue to push for the development of new ore bodies. 'In the interim, ERA will continue to develop its existing deposits on the Ranger lease as the market recovers. However, this may mean that we will have to supplement our production with overseas purchases if we experience production limits in a buoyant market,' it commented.</p>

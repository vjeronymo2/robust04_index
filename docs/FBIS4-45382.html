Policing in this historic  district, 190 km south of Jaipur, has taken a different turn now  with the decline of terrorism in Punjab. Although the police  heaved a sigh of relief after peace descended in neighbouring  Punjab focus has now shifted to prevention of smuggling of  narcotics and opium from the nearby districts of Mandsaur,  Ratlam and Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh and Jhalawar, Kota and  Baran in Rajasthan. Other incidents of social crime have also  increased, the genesis of which can be traced to the  multi-purpose river project on the Chambal river.    According to the SP, Bundi, Mr. Srinivas Rao Janga, "Since  the late 1960s, when construction of the Chambal project  commenced, migrants from Punjab started settling in the southern  belt of Bundi in large numbers mostly in Alphanagar. With  terrorism at its zenith in Punjab a strict vigil was kept on the  activities of Punjabis settled in Sriganganagar and Bundi." In  1991, acting on a tip off, the district police raided the  residence of one Harbail Singh and arrested six noted ultras.    This district, unlike Sriganganagar, was not a hot-bed of  terrorism, but according to Mr. Janga, due to its strategic  location and remoteness was an "ideal hiding place" for  terrorists. "The situation has changed today and Bundi is  emerging as a conduit for opium trade in the Hadauti (southern  Rajasthan) zone," he pointed out.    The Aravallis range runs through Bundi dividing the district  into two near-halves. This demographic factor has had its impact  on crime. The district is used as a major transit point for  transportation of drugs to Delhi and from there to Nepal. It is  suspected that due to stringent action by the Kota district  police and other enforcement agencies, the opium smugglers have  changed their route. "While originally the contraband was taken  along Mandsaur, Jhalawar, Kota, Tonk and Jaipur, reports now  reveal that from Kota it is diverted to Patan, Lakheri,  Indergarh (all in Bundi) and to Sawai Madhopur from where on the  broad gauge railway network the consignment is either despatched  to Delhi or Bombay," Mr. Janga said.    Interestingly, while 14 and 23 cases were registered by the  police here in 1992 respectively under the Narcotic Drugs and  Psychotrophic Substances Act (NDPS), a special vigil is being  maintained on the basis of a report from the State intelligence  Department at Jaipur, which expressed fears about the growing  illegal trade.

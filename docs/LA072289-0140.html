			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DRAMA-THERAPY TROUPE SPOTLIGHTS SEXUAL ABUSE  </P> <P> "Shadow and Song," the Stop-Gap musical that premiered at South Coast  Repertory's Second Stage on Thursday, represents the next step in the Santa  Ana-based "drama-therapy" troupe's response to sexual abuse.  </P> <P> Originally entitled "When the Bough Breaks" when first produced by Stop-Gap in  1982, it focused entirely on the pain suffered by a handful of children who had  been mistreated. Now, with a new name and a revamped book by Orange County  playwright John Weston, "Shadow and Song" centers on how the ache continues in  adulthood, leading to ruined self-esteem, busted marriages, breakdowns and, in  the worst scenario, turning the abused into the abuser.  </P> <P> Pretty serious stuff for a musical. But "Shadow and Song" isn't so much about  entertainment as it is about education. This isn't to say that Weston doesn't  try to hold us with his story of grown-up Elizabeth cleansing herself of the  past, but the show's primary goals are to provide insight for the public and a  measure of catharsis for victims and their families.  </P> <P> It all fits in well with Stop-Gap's manifesto. This nonprofit group has, over  the years, staged works probing a spectrum of issues and ills from alcoholism  to date rape to AIDS. Even the less-accomplished productions could never be  accused of apathy or heartlessness.  </P> <P> With that in mind, it's easy to recommend "Shadow and Song." While Ron  Creager's songs aren't really memorable, and the pivotal dramatic moments --  especially the confrontational resolution -- often jar with abrupt, pregnant  importance, we still stay tuned. It has a message that everybody wants to hear:  There is hope for victims.  </P> <P> The show is really more of a drama sprinkled with several songs (many retained  from "When the Bough Breaks," though they are not listed in the program) than  what we generally think of as a musical. Exposition and dialogue aren't the  threads that hold the tunes together, but the other way around. Here, what's  significant are the facts we learn about Elizabeth (played as an adult by  Sharon Murray and as a teen-ager by Karen Angela).  </P> <P> Most of those are revealed through her interaction with the other characters,  especially her dad (Douglas Rowe), a weak man who was physically abused by his  own father. He dotes on Elizabeth and seems to be devoted. He also visits her  bedroom for sex -- more than 40 times, we later learn (she's made a mark on the  bedpost for each encounter).  </P> <P> When she gets a little older, Elizabeth runs away and meets up with a street  sleaze who preys on girls at the bus station. He crawls over and tries to get  her involved in pornography. These brief scenes are the play's least  convincing, bearing that inauthentic or cliched feel that so often taints  made-for-TV movies on the same subject. But perhaps this is just how things  develop for many victims; Stop-Gap should know.  </P> <P> Elizabeth eventually becomes a successful songwriter and singer, but her last  performance ends in an on-stage collapse. The feelings associated with the  abuse overwhelm her. As she prepares to make a comeback with the help of a  supportive manager (a spirited and natural performance by Catherine Rowe),  Elizabeth has to deal with all that's been paralyzing her.  </P> <P> Director Don R. Laffoon gets able performances from his cast. Karen Angela  imbues the adolescent Elizabeth with buried turmoil, equal parts confusion and  anger. Those feelings evolve in Sharon Murray's adult Elizabeth into a  desperately impenetrable veneer erected to hide her vulnerability.  </P> <P> Angela and Murray sing all the songs, with Angela, a young actress, performing  competently enough, and Murray, a singer with a rich voice, shining through the  score.  </P> <P> Rowe is unsettling as the father. It's creepy when he gives advice -- a little  too earnestly -- on how "daddy's little girl" should dress more attractively,  all the while caressing her shoulders, a little too affectionately. But you  also feel a degree of sympathy for him when, at the conclusion, he reminds us  that he too was a victim.  </P> <P> In the end, Elizabeth, having faced her father and condemned him for what he  did, emerges triumphant. Now more confident, she belts out the last number.  It's a contrived, even hokey, finale, but it does put Stop-Gap's banner of  optimism under a bright light.  </P> <P> 'SHADOW AND SONG'  </P> <P> A Stop-Gap production of the musical with book by John Weston and music and  lyrics by Ron Creager.

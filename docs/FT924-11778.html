			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Queen visits Leizig Scores of Germans booed and whistled at the Queen yesterday when she arrived at the Kreuzkirche cathedral in the eastern city of Dresden for a service of reconciliation between Britain and Germany. Some protesters (above) carried placards referring to second world war bombing raids by British and US air forces which devastated the city. Later, in Leipzig, the Queen was applauded and handed flowers when about 8,000 people turned out to greet her.</p>

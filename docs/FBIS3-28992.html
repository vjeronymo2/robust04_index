They said Hata used the meeting to emphasize to the United  States that Japan has no intention to arm itself with nuclear  weapons.    In response to calls by some U.S. lawmakers for Japan to  halt  cash remittances by North Korean residents in Japan, Hata said  without elaboration that he understands some money is sent from  Japan to North Korea via a third country, the officials said.</p>

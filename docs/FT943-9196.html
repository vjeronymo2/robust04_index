			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: British Bus makes further purchase British Bus, the acquisitive Salisbury-based transport group, is buying Derby City Transport, owned by its managers and employees, for Pounds 7m. This is the third acquisition by British Bus since June, when it received an equity injection of Pounds 30m and arranged new debt facilities of Pounds 35m. The deal is part of a broader plan to consolidate the competitive position of British Bus relative to its two main rivals, Badgerline and Stagecoach. Derby City Transport is unusual among bus companies because of its ownership of taxis and rental car franchises. Its managers and employees paid Pounds 4m for the company in 1989 and had a refinancing with Pounds 1.5m of equity capital from NatWest Ventures in 1993. Mr Martin Bodenham, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in Nottingham, which handled the sale for the shareholders, said that during the last three months there had been a flurry of approaches by the large bus groups. British Bus owned 22 per cent of the company through Luton and District, one of its recent acquisitions, which had been a trade investor in the original buy-out.</p>

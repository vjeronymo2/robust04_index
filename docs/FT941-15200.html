			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / IBM wins contract for four Olympic Games International Business Machines, the world's largest information technology group, has been given sole rights to provide computer systems for the next four Olympic Games. An exclusive agreement with the International Olympic Committee was signed last month, and the two organisations have the option to extend the agreement for a further two games. This is the first time the IOC has selected a single company to provide information technology systems for either the summer or winter Games, which are held every four years. The winter games next month, at Lillehammer in Norway, will be the first in which the winter and summer cycles are separated by two years. IBM is providing systems for the winter games this year and for those at Nagano in Japan, in 1998. It will also support the summer games at Atlanta in the US, in 1996 and those at Sydney in Australia, in 2000. No other computer company was invited to bid. It is understood that, although other manufacturers could have provided the computers, the IOC was persuaded by IBM's world-wide presence, which means it has an organisation in any country that might host the games. The committee was also attracted by the idea that systems developed for one games could be moved easily to the next. The deal commits IBM to provide for each games, without charge, enough computer power to run a large company. IBM is also acting as project manager for the software houses developing special software for the Games. IBM estimates its involvement will cost it over NKr100m (Pounds 9.1m). The US company has lost money heavily for the past two years and is expected to announce further losses this month. Mr Louis Gerstner, the company's new chairman, had to approve the Olympic deal. IBM will have a range of marketing benefits, including world rights to the Olympic rings and logostyles for use with company promotions. IBM estimates the value of these from Lillehammer at NKr80m. Because the new deal was signed after IBM had developed the systems for Lillehammer, the Norwegians have agreed to pay IBM the difference, or NKr20m.</p>

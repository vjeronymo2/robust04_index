			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar resists positive data THE DOLLAR lost ground against a wide range of currencies yesterday despite recent positive economic news from the US. Meanwhile sterling performed very strongly against the dollar and continued its assault on the DM2.50 level which it tested last week, writes Peter John. The US currency opened at DM1.5787, down from Friday's close. Foreign exchange dealers said that concentration on European currencies ahead of the EC summit in Edinburgh ensured that the dollar remained on the sidelines. Also, comments from the Bundesbank reaffirming commitment to current interest rates prompted some weakness. Mr Mark Austin, an economist with the HongKong Shanghai Bank said; 'People have been holding long positions on the D-Mark which they have been closing up. There was also a story that a slightly stronger performance of the US economy would make Clinton less liable to make fiscal changes.' The dollar was further affected by heavy switching as investors moved into Swiss francs after Switzerland's rejection on Sunday of closer European ties in the European Economic Area. The dollar closed nearly three pfennigs lower against the D-Mark at DM1.5685 and hit SFr1.4000, down from SFr1.4335 previously. It was slightly weaker against the Yen. The Swiss franc had suffered initially as the Swiss decision was considered poor for the Swiss economy and for Switzerland as an investment centre. However, the buyers who finally prevailed believed capital flows were in no danger, and a 'no' took Switzerland further away from any association with trouble in the ERM. That 'safe-haven' benefit came into play again as rumours resurfaced that the French franc could be devalued. A press article saying that France was prepared to devalue its currency struck a chord with a number of dealers. Despite a strong denial from the French finance ministry, the franc slipped to FFr3.408 against the D-Mark. Sterling continued to push against DM2.50. By the close of dealing in London the pound was at DM2.490 against DM2.4875. It also rose to Dollars 1.5875 after hitting a peak of Dollars 1.6020, some three cents above its opening. Economists said the pound was still in favour for its isolation from the tension in the ERM rather than a fundamental recovery in the UK economy. However, it also received a boost from a higher than anticipated rise in consumer credit spending. Slovenia's tolar continued to strengthen against other currencies in former Yugoslavia in October, the anniversary of its introduction, figures from the newly-independent country's central bank show. The tolar, introduced at parity to the Yugoslav dinar on October 8 1991, averaged 17.85 per 100 dinars in October this year, the Bank of Slovenia said in its November bulletin.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: VALVANO'S PROGRAM COMES UNDER ATTACK  </P> <P> Jim Valvano should choose between his role as athletic director-basketball  coach at North Carolina State and his outside interests, said Hugh Fuller,  director of the school's academic tutoring program.  </P> <P> In an interview published Monday by the News and Observer of Raleigh, Fuller  also said that:  </P> <P>  -- Academic tutors hired by the athletic department did course work for  basketball players, who then submitted it as their own.  </P> <P>  -- Athletic department officials abused policies that allow students to  withdraw for medical or psychological reasons in order to keep players  academically eligible.  </P> <P>  -- School officials persuaded instructors to give players who were in academic  trouble incompletes, rather than failing grades, allowing the players to remain  eligible.  </P> <P>  -- Top university officials ordered one star basketball player reinstated to a  study hall after the player had been kicked out for disrupting other students.  </P> <P>  -- Players were steered toward courses taught by sympathetic instructors.  </P></p>

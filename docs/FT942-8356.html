			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: NEC to open Europe R&amp;D centre NEC Corporation, the large Japanese electronics group, is to open its first European research centre in Bonn, Germany, in September. The company has nine laboratories and three research and development centres in Japan, but its only overseas research centres are in New Jersey in the US. NEC said yesterday the new centre would enable the company to build closer ties with research centres in Europe as well as helping to underpin research, manufacturing and product sales. The initial investments will be modest: about Y100m (Dollars 920,000) a year to support six staff. However, there are plans to grow to a staff of 20. A director for the centre has yet to be named. The centre, to be sited in the German National Information Processing Centre Technopark (GMD) in the Bonn suburbs will investigate problems associated with advanced computing and multimedia communications systems. It will include joint research with GMD using NEC's parallel processing supercomputer, Cenju-3. NEC said it believed the GMD was the leading institute in Europe for parallel computing, distributed processing and multimedia. The Bonn location made for easy interchange with other Europe institutes. NEC is the second Japanese company this week to announce a European R&amp;D initiative. On Monday, Hitachi said it was establishing a wholly-owned semiconductor design operation in the UK to service European customers.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Fund managers still investing in recovery stocks Britain's largest institutional fund managers still believe share prices do not reflect the full benefits of recovery, an analysis of their portfolios suggests. Of the UK's 12 largest fund managers, which own 23 per cent of the domestic stock market, eight own shares which they expect to benefit from a pick-up in consumer spending and increased economic activity, according to Citywatch, the research firm. Citywatch compiled the data by analysing shareholding records of all the companies in the FT-Actuaries Index and identifying the end-investor behind nominee companies. While fund managers say the data are distorted - for instance when clients dictate the investment strategy - they concede the Citywatch figures are broadly accurate. The data show that most fund managers are weighting their portfolios towards building and construction stocks, property, retailing, banking, leisure and hotels and media. Gartmore has high concentrations in the building sector and double the market average holding in engineering. 'Britain has lower unit labour costs than the rest of Europe and the manufacturing base is likely to recover relative to consumer stocks,' said Mr Vivian Bazalgette, managing director of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. Mercury Asset Management is positive about prospects for recovery. It has a much heavier than average holding in the building materials and hotels and leisure sectors, is modestly overweight in banks and is underweight in food retailing. However, some fund managers, PDFM in particular, believe share prices for recovery stocks are too high and reflect over-optimism about economic growth. 'We think the market is overvalued and cyclical stocks tend to be more overvalued than most,' said Mr Richard West, a director at PDFM, part of investment bank UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'We have been selling cyclical stocks and investing in less favoured consumer sectors.' Citywatch's data show that PDFM is overweight in breweries, tobacco, chemicals and engineering. 'A year ago we were heavy in building, property and leisure stocks,' said Mr West. Scottish Widows, the Edinburgh-based life insurer, reflects some of PDFM's bias, holding relatively low positions in the building sectors but high weightings in breweries and tobacco. Mr Mark O'Hare, managing director at Citywatch, said that some fund managers' holdings in key sectors were distorted by a single large holding. For instance, he said, his research showed that MAM, 75 per cent owned by merchant bank SG Warburg, is most overweight in merchant banking stocks. This was because MAM holds 20 per cent of Warburg's shares, Mr O'Hare said.</p>

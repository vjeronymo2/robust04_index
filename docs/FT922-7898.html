			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Banknote theft probed by police EIGHT people have been arrested by police investigating the alleged theft of money from the Bank of England's depot at Debden, Essex, where old banknotes are destroyed. Scotland Yard said a large quantity of cash had been recovered but did not reveal the amount. The arrests by officers of the Company Fraud Squad and No 9 Regional Crime Squad were made yesterday at three addresses in Loughton and one at Chelmsford, Essex. The four men and four women arrested were released on police bail pending further inquiries. Neither the police nor the Bank would confirm a report in today's Daily Mail that up to Pounds 50m may have been stolen from the depot.</p>

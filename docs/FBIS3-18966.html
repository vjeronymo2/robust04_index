			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "One Per Day" column by Panayiotis Paskhalis: </F> "Confidence-Building Measures: One-Way Road"]    [Excerpts] Developments that have brought the long-running  Cyprus issue to its current, most critical, phase did not appear  out of the blue but rather came from the calculations of those  in power.    We have repeatedly stressed that Cyprus is under the  pressure  of the powerful in the world, who, in our case, are none other  than the Americans and the British. According to their will and  political-military interests, they use the United Nations  organizations through the Security Council, which they control  with a majority. [passage omitted]    First, it was President Glavkos Kliridhis' unconditional  acceptance of the famous confidence-building measures [CBM's]  without the knowledge of the country's political leadership.  After accepting the CBM's in principle, he proceeded to discuss  their implementation without accepting, before the eyes of every  common man, the reports of the experts. These UN experts  visited and explained the CBM's to the president, who accepted  them without discussion but succeeded in uniting all political  parties against them.    No one accepted these measures, but the discussion on their  implementation has gone on since 17 February. Every time you  come to them, you realize how far we are from the principles and  decisions, not only of the Security Council resolutions, but  also of the international accords for which humanity has made  huge sacrifices.    With a presidential will that is translated into  stubbornness, we started the dance of the CBM's. Like every  dance, it must end some time. Officials have often told us that  the experts' reports are not official UN documents. But they  are on the negotiating table and each side can use them as it  desires to support its positions.    The UN secretary general's latest report also refers to the  experts' reports and they can now be passed as official  documents, with our side still maintaining the illusion in  simple statements that these reports are not official UN  documents. Again, the evaluations of the Republic's Presidency,  which is isolated from the rest of the leadership, are proven  wrong at the expense of our national intrest. [passage omitted]    As all the developments indicate, the confidence-building  measures have put us on a one-way road with no chance of return.  Whether we like it or not, this road should come to an end in a  "few weeks," as ordered by those who today control and lead the  United Nations and its bodies.    It is our duty, as Cypriots, to find those roads, which,  through firm steps, will lead to the establishment of a real  climate of confidence without fear, in which all our countrymen,  irrespective of race or religion, will enjoy their right to a  united homeland.</p>

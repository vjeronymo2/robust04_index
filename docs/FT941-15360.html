			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Welsh windfarm venture rejected Evidence of growing opposi-tion to windfarms in Wales has come with the rejection of an application to erect 20 turbines on a hill overlooking the historic town of Kidwelly on the south-west coast. Councillors at Llanelli, the planning authority, voted unanimously to refuse the application by Westwind Generators of Penarth, South Glamorgan. More than 400 people signed a petition against the farm, which was also opposed by Dyfed County Council. The 500kW turbines would have been 40m high to the hub, with 40m diameter blades. Llanelli council said they would be 'seriously detrimental' to the landscape and create a noise nuisance. Cadw, the organisation responsible for Welsh historic monuments, said the farm would be an 'alien backdrop' to 11th-century Kidwelly Castle. Dyfed County Council is also opposing an application by the company to erect 20 turbines at nearby Ferryside. Carmarthen District Council is due to rule on that application on Tuesday with a recommendation by its officers to refuse it.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Bristol prison facilities criticised THE CARE of seriously disturbed inmates at Bristol prison remained 'dangerous and unacceptable' in spite of redevelopment work after riots three years ago, Judge Stephen Tumim, chief inspector of prisons, said yesterday. More than Pounds 1m of damage was caused at Bristol during the riots that swept British jails in the spring of 1990. The prison has since been renovated at a cost of Pounds 3.5m. In his latest report Judge Tumim says little appears to have changed apart from the redevelopment work. He refers to 'considerable achievements' in repairing the riot damage and building relationships between prisoners and staff but says Bristol remains a 'busy, overcrowded prison offering few facilities for inmates'. The government says measures have already been taken to meet many of the recommendations in Judge Tumim's report.</p>

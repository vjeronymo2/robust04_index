			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: French launch of Glaxo drug Glaxo has finally launched its migraine drug Imigran in France, despite failing to secure government agreement for its availability on the French national health service. Patients will have to pay for the drug, at FFr142.5 (Pounds 17.10p) per injection plus the pharmacist's mark-up. This is about the amount paid by the UK National Health Service. Sales of Imigran, which promises to become one of Glaxo's biggest sellers, were Pounds 243m last year. France has among the lowest drug prices in Europe but the largest per head consumption.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rhino runs deeper into red at midway Shares in Rhino Group, the USM-quoted specialist video and computer games retailer, fell 5p to 27p yesterday, after the group reported a sharp increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 263,000 to Pounds 1.37m for the first half of 1994. Mr Bev Ripley, chairman, blamed the setback on the strong seasonality of Rhino's subsidiaries, Future Zone Stores and Downpace. However, he expected the second half to again benefit significantly from Christmas trading - 1993 profits totalled Pounds 2m. First-half turnover jumped to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 3.6m) reflecting Rhino's growing number of stores. Future Zone now operates from 90 retail outlets, against 28 a year ago, and the group expects to have at least 110 stores trading during Christmas. Because of the seasonality of the business, no interim dividend has been declared. Losses per share were 1.21p (0.45p). Mr Ripley estimated that so far this year the UK computer and video games market had declined by about 14 per cent, although this trend had not been consistent across the various product ranges. He added that Rhino's share of the UK software market had now risen to about 12 per cent. The company intends to apply for a full listing, following publication of its 1994 annual report.</p>

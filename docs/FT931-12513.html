			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Plight of poor confirmed CONFIRMATION that the share of income going to Britain's poorest people fell throughout the 1980s is provided by Social Trends. The poorest fifth of the population's share of household income fell from 9.9 per cent in 1979 to 7.9 per cent in 1988-89. When housing costs are taken into account the share of the bottom fifth fell from 9.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Only the top fifth of the population finished the 1980s with a bigger share of total income than they had in 1979. This rose from 34.8 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent in 1988-89, or from 35.3 per cent to 41.1 per cent after housing costs. The share of marketable wealth held by the richest 1 per cent of the population fell from 21 to 18 per cent in the late 1970s, and has remained at 18 per cent since. The most wealthy 5 per cent increased their share of total wealth from 36 to 37 per cent between 1986 and 1990. More than half of total wealth is held by the richest 10 per cent of the population, and 93 per cent by the most wealthy 50 per cent. Increases in home ownership meant that by 1990 more than one third of personal wealth was in property. The top 10 per cent of taxpayers, who contributed 35 per cent of total tax in 1976-77, pay more now. In 1992-93 their share will be an estimated 43 per cent.</p>

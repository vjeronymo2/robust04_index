			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Construction and Housing Minister </F> Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer by Itay Engel; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Engel] What is your reaction to this morning's  grave incident in Hebron?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] It was a very grave incident. I sharply  denounce the attack. It came not only at the wrong time, but it  could lead to the situation getting out of control unless the  following conditions are observed: All the security forces,  especially the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], must show maximum  determination and control on the ground. There is no room for  mercy to anybody. In this situation, there are two  possibilities: Either we immediately clamp down on everybody or  there is havoc. At the same time, the IDF, the security forces,  and the political echelon, must and can bring about steps to  calm down tempers. I reiterate my long-term conclusion that  when extremists on both sides -- and this time religious  extremists -- live together, such a situation is inevitable.    [Engel] This incident is not linked to the IDF's action in  the field. We understood from Qiryat Arba' local council head  Beni Qatzover that the assailant was mentally unstable, at least  lately, yet he had weapons and plenty of ammunition which he  could use whenever he felt like it. How can the security forces  or the political establishment cope with such a situation?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I heard Qatzover saying that the man was  mentally unstable. It is a shame that we found out about that  after he murdered others and committed suicide. I think that  political and municipal officials have to cooperate with the  authorities, despite all the difficulties involved, to prevent  crazies from carrying weapons. There are extremists in the  territories belonging to very extreme movements who are no less  dangerous than that crazy man.    [Engel] How will this grave incident influence the  negotiations with the Palestinians?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] It will definitely not contribute to the  talks.    [Engel] Was Israel in touch with the Palestinians this  morning?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I have not had any contacts. It is possible  that others have. I think contacts are vital and coordination  between the two leaderships is critical. I would welcome such  moves. We must remember that we are in the midst of the Ramadan  fast, which will bring the entire Islamic world up in arms. How  can we go and tell them that a crazy man was responsible? We  must not ease up our control on the territories and our efforts  to return calm through talks and actions.    [Engel] We understand that the prime minister plans to  convene the Inner Cabinet.    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I think that is the right thing to do.    [Engel] Can you tell us what you think it will decide?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] No, I cannot. I am no prophet. I can only  say one thing: We do not have any interest in bringing about an  escalation of the situation. Our only interest is to restore  calm. We are not going to war against either side. In my view,  it is a grave escalation of the situation because if whoever did  it is crazy. It is something you have no control over unless as  I said, people cooperate. I believe that any decision made will  be aimed at controlling the situation and restoring calm.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT IS ORDERED  </P> <P> An Ojai couple who want to build seven houses in a citrus grove will have to  redo an environmental impact report on the project to take into account a  one-year moratorium on new water hookups, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Joseph and Josephine Macaluso have already spent more than $25,000 on an  environmental report on their proposal to build seven houses in a 10-acre  orange orchard near Nordhoff Cemetery on Cuyama and Del Norte roads.  </P> <P> But Ojai Planning Director William Prince said that because of a one-year  moratorium on new water hookups instituted by the Casitas Municipal Water  District on April 11, the report needs to be revised to indicate that providing  water to the seven houses would have an "unavoidable but significant impact."  </P> <P> Prince said that a hearing set for tonight on the project will be held as  planned and that a second session will be held July 18 after the new report is  completed. A prior hearing on the project drew a large crowd opposed to the  project because of traffic and air quality concerns.  </P> <P> Joseph Macaluso said he should not have to redo the report because the orange  trees he plans to remove from the land use more water than the houses would.

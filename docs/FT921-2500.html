			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Price war hits Bernard Matthews Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat producer, yesterday reported a 15 per cent fall in profits as a war between chicken manufacturers last year undercut the market for its oven ready turkeys. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.2m on sales marginally down at Pounds 148.4m (Pounds 150.1m). Earnings per share fell from 7.99p to 6.95p and the final dividend is held at 2.5p, giving a total of 4.5p for the year. Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said the whole bird and oven ready turkey market had been hit by chicken prices that fell last year to as low as 39p per pound. The recession had also hit food sales and there was evidence that there had been an overall drop in food consumption.</p>

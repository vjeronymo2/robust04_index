			<p>BFN     [Text] Paraguayan Finance Minister Crispiniano Sandoval  urged industrial nations to reduce their protectionist measures  and give products exported by the Latin American Southern Cone  countries, especially Paraguay, broader access to their markets.  The Paraguayan minister launched his call in Washington at the  midyear World Bank Development Council meeting, which he  addressed on behalf of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay,  Peru, and Uruguay.    "It is encouraging to find out that the recovery of  Anglo-Saxon economies and the signs that mark the beginning of  the end to the recession in western Europe will have favorable  effects on international markets as far as exports from  developing countries are concerned. We are also very pleased and  optimistic over the success of the Uruguay Round of the GATT  talks, following many years of hard bargaining," Sandoval said.    "We are especially pleased over the agreements reached in  the  agricultural field, although we would like to stress the need to  gradually implement measures aimed at opening up markets while  at the same time eliminating distortions caused by subsidies  that industrial countries usually grant," Sandoval added.    Sandoval also asked the World Trade Organization [WTO] "to  actively guarantee the commitments that have been undertaken to  curb the use of unilateral commercial measures, to help resolve  disagreements, and to ensure proper cooperation between the WTO  and the institutions created at the Bretton Woods Conference.  This will allow better use to be made of the new markets, and  will pave the way for more precise coordination between  commercial and economic policies."    The minister then discussed "the persistent decline in the  international prices of our basic products." Because of this  situation "our rural population, which is responsible for most  of our production, has had to make greater sacrifices and its  economic situation has worsened."    Sandoval also spoke about the landlocked situation of both  Paraguay and Bolivia, an obstacle which further increases the  cost of exports from these countries, and urged "multilateral  organizations to give priority treatment to technical and  financial support for infrastructure projects aimed at improving  regional transport."</p>

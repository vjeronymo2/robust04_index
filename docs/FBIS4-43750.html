			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Running Out of Time"] </F>   [Text] The UN organization, which has failed to resolve the  Cyprus problem during the past 30 years, has moved to blame the  Turkish Cypriot side for the lack of a solution on the island  through UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's designs.  Butrus-Ghali's biased, aggressive, and blackmailing report to  the UN Security Council is fresh confirmation of that painful  reality.    Meanwhile, the European Union [EU], which wants to have a  say  on the Cyprus problem, has moved to find a way to benefit from  the UN officials' failure to resolve the Cyprus problem. EU  officials believe that "since the United Nations has been unable  to resolve the problem during the past 30 years, then the EU  should move into action." Obviously, the EU approach on the  Cyprus problem will be similar to the approach the UN  organization has maintained thus far. Consequently, it will be  unsuccessful, at least as much as that organization has been.    However, finding a realistic solution to the problem is not  their objective. Therefore, what difference would it make if the  UN organization or the EU wastes time on it? After all, their  objective is similar: To completely Hellenize the island by  forcing the Turkish Cypriots to agree to having minority rights.  The way that objective is to be achieved has come into light.  The security and the communal and sovereignty rights of the  Turkish Cypriots will be ignored and Cyprus will be admitted to  the EU as a member. In other words, the integration between  Greece and Cyprus will be realized within the EU framework.    Considering all that, we can regard Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  latest report as an indication of the UN organization's  inclination to withdraw and leave the EU in the arena.    If we have realized the design behind admitting Cyprus into  the EU in Turkey's absence, then we should not ignore the fact  that we have to make a historic assessment.    That the process of admitting Cyprus into the EU as a member  will begin on 1 January 1995 is a strong possibility.  Apparently, plans are being drawn up with that date in mind.  Therefore, we have to work with Turkey to decide on new  alternatives. In fact, we are running out of time for that.</p>

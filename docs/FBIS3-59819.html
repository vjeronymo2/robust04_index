			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Shakir Mahmud al-Mashhadani, vice-chairman </F> of the General Federation of Cooperatives, by Jabbar Tarrad,  place and date given: "The Cooperative Movement Between  Proponents and Opponents of Its Role in Our Daily Lives"]    [Text] It is the hard times, rather than those of  prosperity, that truly test people's mettle. Hardships harden  people and hone their abilities to confront challenges.    Our country has gone through a difficult experience that  gave  rise to other experiences. Some of those experiences have been  beneficial and others may be written off as negatives.  Cooperatives have been one such experience.    The cooperative movement was launched in Iraq with the  promulgation of Cooperatives Law No. 22 of 2/7/1922. The first  consumer cooperative was founded in 1937 in Baghdad's  al-Za'franiyah district.    Cooperatives Law No. 202 of 1970 was promulgated by the  glorious 17-30 July revolution to define the parameters of  cooperative action. Cooperatives have continued to proliferate  and their number grew to 203 by 10/6/1991. Did those  cooperatives live up to their raison d'etre by helping citizens  endure the infamous economic boycott imposed upon our steadfast  country? Or were they a merely a means for lining the pockets of  certain individuals who infiltrated that vital sector with  commercial agendas designed to serve their personal interests?    The proponents and opponents of the cooperative sector have  been debated that question back and forth. There are even those  who accuse that sector of failing to achieve the well-publicized  economic objectives that prompted its creation.    To ascertain the workings of that sector and the problems  and  difficulties that beset it, causing many citizens to express  dissatisfaction with cooperative organizations and their  activities, AL-'IRAQ interviewed those charged with  responsibility for that sector whose motto is: "Serving Citizens  Is Our Objective, The Prosperity of Society Is Our Goal, and  Breaking the Unjust Siege Is Our Quest."    We interviewed Mr. Shakir Mahmud al-Mashhadani for this  comprehensive discourse, which is not devoid of frankness.    [Tarrad] The federation has existed for sometime now and has  enjoyed the support and patronage of the [country's] leadership.  Has it realized the aspirations of the revolution and the  patriotic objectives with which it is charged?    [al-Mashhadani] Yes, were the country living under  conditions  of normalcy. We will not, however, use the siege as an excuse  for not achieving programs and objectives in their ambitious  forms. We point out, however, that this sector deals directly  with the public, be it in the fields of consumption, service,  production, or housing. As such, we face many obstacles. It is  common knowledge that cooperative sector purchases for  consumption can only be of products available in domestic  markets, of whatever else we can buy on commercial markets, and  of other essentials supplied by the Ministry of Trade such as  sugar, rice, and small quantities of tallow. Our sector has no  recourse but to sell at government-set prices and can not  deviate from them whereas goods available on commercial markets  are governed by factors that run contrary to government-fixed  pricing. Our outlets therefore have little to offer and we can't  meet the needs even of one-half of cooperative members.    [Tarrad] How do you plan to deal with that situation? The  siege is a fact of life. Are you going to deal with it sitting  on your hands when the citizenry expects you to supply its needs?    [al-Mashhadani] Indeed we have strategies and have begun the  search for alternative sources of basic goods in order to supply  members enrolled in the cooperative sector. Merchants are the  only problem we now face since they control the market. If only  they would cooperate with us we would be able to maintain  stability. They should be content with a reasonable profit on  their transactions with us. We believe that this is a difficult  equation that be achieved only through the efforts of the good  and honorable sons of our beloved fatherland.    [Tarrad] A vast network of cooperatives has sprung up  throughout the country but the federation's efficacy and its  oversight function are nowhere to be seen?    [al-Mashhadani] This is a valid indictment. We have  established representative offices of the cooperative movement  in all the governorates and have bolstered the efficacy of  internal oversight to keep pace with the proliferation of  cooperatives. We also conduct unannounced inspections,  especially of new cooperatives, and we allow people's groups  supervisory roles when distributing building supplies and other  subsidized essential goods.    [Tarrad] Cooperatives are charged with negligence in  assuring the needs of their members, that their boards  appropriate their offerings, and that their employees undermine  the [cooperative] movement by their belligerency towards  member-shoppers.    [al-Mashhadani] There may be some truth to that. We, as a  federation, issue direct guidelines as well as circulars to  convey the instructions given by the leader President Saddam  Husayn, may God keep him and nurture him, when he honored the  cooperative movement with an audience. He impressed upon us the  importance of treating citizens with dignity and justice. We  consider that an order to be obeyed and have circulated [that  directive] to all our cooperatives and conveyed it to them in  face-to-face meetings. We take immediate and direct action  against those cooperatives that do not rise to that directive.  [In that,] we depend not only on written reports but also on  those that are phoned in and that we immediately investigate. We  are delighted that all the reports and complaints we received  had merit and that prompt and immediate remedial action was  taken.    [Tarrad] Would you cite an example?    [al-Mashhadani] A lady contacted me personally to inform me  that the chairman of one cooperative and its secretary-general  obtained a refrigerator and a freezer without benefit of  lottery. We investigated the matter and took appropriate action  against those individuals. I would like to mention something  positive for the record. Our citizens have reached such a state  of understanding that they report all the aberrations that they  witness.    [Tarrad] Many members are discouraged from shopping at their  cooperatives because of their distant locations and because  there are no established shopping hours. Consequently, those who  live in their vicinity get the lion's share and those who are  not get nothing.    [al-Mashhadani] Our objective in the cooperative movement is  to achieve justice. As far as cooperative are concerned, we  have two types of cooperatives: professional and geographic. For  example, al-Zawra' consumer cooperative whose membership is  composed of journalists, has to dedicate one shopping day for  employees of AL-'IRAQ and another for employees of AL-THAWRAH.  The same holds true for the cooperatives of physicians,  engineers, etc. Geographic cooperatives are meant for retirees  who are not issued central market cards and who do not belong to  professional cooperatives. I would like to point out here that  those with central market cards are not allowed membership in  federation cooperatives. We are serious about this rule and  violators will face the consequences. We hope to raise the  awareness of those individuals because this is the only way to  ward off violations. Frankly, violating that rule effectively  means stealing somebody else's rights. We will be deferring to  the findings of a member's precinct and of the People's Council.  The federation shall continue to be on top of that.    [Tarrad] What action do you take against those [violators]?    [al-Mashhadani] We have instructed the Oversight and  Inspection Organization to make unscheduled inspections of  cooperative society books. Those found in violation would be  dropped from membership and their precincts notified. I would  like to point out that cooperative chairmen and  secretaries-general are directly accountable to us for such  incidents. We have indeed found a number of cooperatives to be  in violation and have, as a result, dismissed their boards and  merged them with other cooperatives or turned them into  cooperative markets for other cooperatives whose boards function  properly in a manner consistent with our primary objective of  service to citizens.    [Tarrad] Do you have a specific strategy to develop  cooperative action and to keep out opportunists?    [al-Mashhadani] This is both very difficult and easy at the  same time. The secret lies in how aware cooperative general  assembly members are. General assemblies have to elect honest  and competent members and this is our only guarantee against  opportunists who manage to infiltrate cooperatives as they  proliferate. We are serious about holding conferences to renew  confidence in members of administrative assemblies.    [Tarrad] What happened to the year-end statements of  cooperatives and why haven't the members received their share of  the profits?    [al-Mashhadani] I am the one to answer to this. Professional  federations and all service cooperatives have forwarded their  statements with the exception of three societies in the  production sector and the books of the latter are already in the  hands of [the accountants]. It was impressed upon those  cooperatives that unless their statements are completed within  two months their boards would be dismissed and their managers  held to task.    [Tarrad] What are the activities of the professional housing  cooperative federation. Does it have strategies for dealing with  the economic problems that burden the citizenry?    [al-Mashhadani] We follow the leader's directives on the  housing sector in that its function should not be limited to the  distribution of building lots. This can be handled by the state.  The housing sector has therefore begun to prepare studies on  low-cost housing in coordination with architects and  specialists. We received studies and models from several sources  and have begun looking into these models. Cost accounting,  however, showed that they are very costly and we are therefore  proceeding slowly for the time being in view of the onerous  siege. We have distributed several building lots in the  governorates and are obliging citizens to build on them in  conformity with the award-winning prototypes models made  available by the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction.    [Tarrad] And the service cooperative federation--what is its  purpose and has it won the satisfaction of those whom it serves?    [al-Mashhadani] The function of that federation is to  provide  services to the inhabitants of housing complexes and to offer  household services through equipment repair and mass  transportation cooperatives. This year, it is transporting the  employees of 13 ministries on 1034 busses of which 758 are  currently in operation, 145 in need of major repairs, and 131 in  need of minor repairs. We have been able to resurrect some  busses that were completely broken down. We are grateful to the  Ministry of Industry for supplying 300 batteries and we  anticipate the delivery of tires for those busses. As to  services for housing complexes, the competent federation  responsible for 12 such complexes in Baghdad and in the  governorates, has its problems. Those are not easy and they  relate primarily to subsidized transit fares which fall short of  providing permanency and sustainability. We are optimistic about  the future, though.    [Tarrad] What pragmatic working plans does the federation  have for supplying future citizen needs?    [al-Mashhadani] We have ambitious plans and programs and it  is our hope that the cooperative sector would attract aware and  educated elements that would help bolster its relations with  other populist organizations in the effort to achieve our  primary objective of securing for citizens a better quality of  life.</p>

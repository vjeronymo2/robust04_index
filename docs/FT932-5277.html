			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Smith faces attack from union chief MR JOHN SMITH will come under veiled attack this weekend from the general secretary of Britain's third-largest union for lacking boldness and imagination as Labour party leader. In a keynote speech to his annual conference on Sunday, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the 860,000-strong GMB general union, will denounce Labour's failure to seize the political opportunities provided in the past 12 months by the troubles of Mr John Major's government. Although Mr Smith will not be criticised directly - because Mr Edmonds wants to avoid personalising the issues - the speech is likely to be interpreted as the first damaging public attack on the Labour leader from one of the union leaders whose block votes ensured his victory in last autumn's leadership election. Mr Smith is a member of the GMB and has attended the conference for the past three years, but Mr Edmonds has not invited him to speak to the delegates this year. The GMB, traditionally a centre-right union loyal to the Labour leadership, appears under Mr Edmonds to have become a critic of the present state of the Labour movement. Mr Edmonds claims to have discovered widespread disillusionment and discontent among union activists across the country in recent months, and he intends to articulate their views. He will argue that both the Labour party and the trade unions have lacked focus for their attacks on the Conservatives. His speech will question whether Labour's caution and patience have been a sensible way of responding to what he regards as the government's wickedness. The GMB general secretary is unlikely to compromise over the controversial issue of one member, one vote for the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates and election of the party leader and deputy leader. Mr Smith has turned the issue into a test of his political credibility. Mr Edmonds insists that union political levy-payers must have a voice in such elections inside the Labour party through their affiliated unions, arguing that Labour has a federal structure and is more than just a party of individual members. The union is also likely to give no comfort to those in the Labour party who want to carry through parliamentary electoral reform like proportional representation in parliamentary elections. The GMB is expected to defend the existing first-past-the-post system of electing MPs.</p>

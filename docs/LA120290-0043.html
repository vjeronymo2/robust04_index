			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> CLIMBING L.A.  </P> <P> FORGET TRAFFIC jams and parking hassles. In the charming guide, "Stairway Walks  in Los Angeles," authors Adah Bakalinsky and Larry Gordon share their  enthusiasm for walking by exploring the heart of Los Angeles: its  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The book ($8.95) reports on 18 L.A. walks, each about two to 2 1/2 hours --  covering landscape from the ocean to downtown and beyond -- and includes  illustrations, maps and a bit of the history of the community of the trek. The  rating system is based on pieces of fruit needed to replace energy: a  two-orange walk is a moderate walk; longer, tougher trips, up to four oranges  and, sometimes, cantaloupes, tangelos, raisins and walnuts.  </P> <P> The downtown walk descends the new Bunker Hill steps, with a miniature river of  bubbling water gushing down its center and shops and cafes on the terrace. The  tour continues through the lobby and ground floor of the Biltmore, perhaps a  stop for a spot of tea? In Franklin Heights, there's the nine-acre estate,  Villa Giuseppi, to explore. And for those whose idea of exercise is a climb  into a favorite armchair, the book makes for delightful reading for the voyeur  hiker.  </P> <P>  "Stairway Walks in Los Angeles," is available through Wilderness Press, (800)  443-7227; and at major book and sporting-goods stores throughout the area.PAT  DELEE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martens Ready To Assume </F> Responsibilities"]    [Text] If the EPP [European People's Party], the Belgian  Government, and the other European Governments find Wilfried  Martens the best man to head the European Commission (EC), he  will be prepared to assume his responsibilities, Wilfried  Martens told GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN.    Wilfried Martens: "The matter must be seen in a wider  context. There are no official candidates for the EC presidency.  With Jacques Delors, the European Socialists have headed the  Commission for 10 years. It is only normal for a Christian  Democrat to have a turn. It is also clear that someone from a  small country, such as one of the Benelux countries, has the  best chance."    An additional point in Wilfried Martens favor is the desire  repeatedly expressed by the European Council of government  leaders for the new president of the EC Commission to be a past  or present head of government.    It is thus only logical for names such as Ruud Lubbers and  Wilfried Martens to come up. "But Jean-Luc Dehaene," Martens  says, "would be a good president. Agreement must also be  reached concerning other important posts, including the  presidency of the European Parliament."    Immediately following the European elections in May, the  presidents of the European Christian Democrat parties and  Christian Democrat government leaders will meet to discuss the  situation. "But a lot will obviously depend," Martens says "on  the attitude of the other governments."    As EPP president, Martens says he is "relaxed" about the  situation. As president, he must also adopt a neutral stance.  "I am therefore restrained in my comments. But everyone knows  my convictions and knows what I stand for." The question as to  whether or not he is a candidate for the presidency of the EC  Commission is therefore only indirectly answered.    "If the EPP, the Belgian Government, and the other  government  leaders consider that I am the most suitable man, then I will  not evade my responsibilities."</p>

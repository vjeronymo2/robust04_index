			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "ONERA Studying Behavior of </F> Composites"]    [Text] Drawing on its many years of experience in the  study of the process of deterioration of metallic materials, the  National Office of Aeronautical Research [ONERA] is now studying  more complex materials.    Composites? Everyone talks about them, everyone uses them.  But what is actually known about their behavior, about their  process of deterioration? Not much! Yet, in order to determine  the useful life of a part and define intervals between  maintenance, this knowledge is indispensable.    By comparison, metallic materials no longer conceal any  secrets. For many years ONERA has worked on a realistic  description of the (nonlinear) behavior of these materials. A  little more recently, it was able to extend its field of  activity to include the gamut of organic-matrix composite  materials.    Building on its experience in that area, which included the  developing of methods that have now the test of wide usage,  ONERA is turning its attention today to thermostructural  ceramic-matrix composites (SiC-SiC), and tomorrow to C-C and  Ti-SiC composites...    Why is it so difficult to define realistically the behavior  of composite materials? Complexity is the key word. A composite  material presents itself as a stack of layers, each of which is  made up of unidirectional fibers embedded in a resin. Its  complexity, or rather diversity, gives rise to a process of  deterioration having multiple origins: fissures of different  types and delamination. Unlike metallic materials, whose  descriptive laws of the destruction of the piece are posited on  a macroscopic scale, the microscopic aspect of those concerning  composite materials cannot be circumvented.    The studies being conducted by ONERA are of particular  interest to the engine manufacturers (hence, close collaboration  with Turbomeca, SNECMA, SEP, Rolls-Royce, Fiat, etc...), but  also to the aircraft manufacturers, in whose case the fields of  application can be grouped under two main headings. The first is  aeronautical and space engines, particularly insofar as concerns  characterization of the phenomena that occur in pieces where the  temperature gradient is high and where the stresses are of  thermal origin; and the second is aircraft frames, stabilizers,  and wings, from the standpoing of their problem of a vibratory  nature, stemming more naturally from fatigue brought on by an  extensive number of cycles.    In the case of engines, stresses are linked to the run/stop  cycles and to the takeoff/cruising/landing cycles (at  frequencies ranging from several minutes to several hours), but  also to the high-frequency aerodynamic abrasion on the turbine  vanes (1,000 to 10,000 Hz).    In that of air frames, stabilizers, and wings, the  cyclicities are more complex and include a minimum of three  levels of frequencies corresponding respectively to flight,  maneuvers, and turbulences.    Analysis in Four Stages.    The study of a particular material in a particular piece is  made in four stages of successively concatenated computations.  First, the material's behavioral laws are modeled with the aid  of cyclic, uniaxial, and multiaxial stress test analyses. The  piece itself is then calculated by a finite-element method, so  as to determine its constraints and its local deformations  (mechanical, thermal, etc...). This is a digital stage that  utilizes the priorly determined laws, and codes that take into  account the cyclic phenomena. Currently, pieces are calculated  on the basis of a service life of 500 successive cycles. ONERA's  long-term objective is to be able to base computations on all  the cycles of the piece, until its rupture. The third stage  determines the critical fault (onset of fissure) and computes  the number of cycles prior to the advent of this fault. And in  the final stage, the propagation of the fissure (fissuration) is  studied.    Depending on whether the piece is a component of the engine  or of the structure, the approach is inelastic or elastic,  respectively.    The work done thus far on metallic materials has enabled,  among other things, the development of vanes cast under an  anisotropic oriented monocrystalline phase. This technique  eliminates the packing of grains, hence pits that can oxidize  and give rise to fissures.</p>

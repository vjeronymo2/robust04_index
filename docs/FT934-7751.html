			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (4): ANC way ahead - The political parties SOUTH AFRICA'S first elections are likely to be dominated by the issue of liberation from apartheid, and as the primary party of liberation, the African National Congress (ANC) can count on a large 'vote of thanks' from black South Africans. With the widely respected Mr Nelson Mandela as leader, the ANC is expected to win the largest share of the vote - recent opinion polls have shown its support at between 46 and 58 per cent, though pollsters believe a two-thirds vote for the ANC is possible if many of the 25 per cent undecided voters choose not to vote at all (an outcome which would favour the ANC, whose voters are more motivated). ANC policies are not likely to exert a significant influence on voting patterns in the first elections; opposition will come from those who accuse the ANC of involvement in violence, or from those who view the organisation as Xhosa-dominated (many top ANC officials belong to the Xhosa tribe). The ANC's stated goal is to create a non-racial multi-party democracy with a mixed economy. National Party The new multi-racial National Party appeals primarily to ethnic minorities such as whites, Coloureds and Indians, though it may also win a substantial number of votes from blacks who fear domination by the ANC, or who yearn for law and order. The National Party's share of recent opinion polls has fallen as low as 11 per cent though it seems likely that this represents a protest vote which could disappear. Most Afrikaners, along with most other whites, are likely to vote for the National Party, along with a large share, perhaps a majority, of Coloureds and Indians. The party's policy is similar to that of the ANC: multi-party democracy with a free enterprise economy (probably freer than that envisaged by the ANC); but the National Party also pledges to fight for minority rights. Inkatha Freedom Party Primarily a Zulu party based in Natal, the IFP can probably also claim substantial white support in its regional base. The IFP scores poorly in opinion polls (9 per cent) which focus on towns. However, IFP support is concentrated in rural Zululand and in townships where violence makes polling difficult. The IFP, like the other two parties, supports multi-party democracy and free enterprise, but believes in strong regional government. It is likely to fight the election on a law and order ticket. Conservative Party The white-supremacist Conservative Party gained 800,000 white votes in the 1992 referendum though its support has certainly waned since then. Still, it represents the only home for whites who reject the new South Africa, and wish to cast a protest vote. It seems unlikely to win a major share of the vote nationally, and may not even win a majority of Afrikaners. Democratic Party South Africa's liberal party, the Democratic Party will be lucky to get the 5 per cent of the national vote required for a seat in the cabinet. Though it, too, fought apartheid through the decades, the DP is likely to reap no liberation bonus. Viewed as a weak party, it has no obvious constituency except affluent whites in Johannesburg and some Coloureds and blacks. Pan Africanist Congress This ultra-radical black party scores in low single figures in opinion polls. It is likely to fare badly in the first election, although its policy of rejecting accommodation with whites could well become more popular, particularly among young unemployed black South Africans, if the first post-apartheid government fails to deliver immediate fruits of victory. The PAC is a socialist party and its policies are basically pro-black and racist.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FINAL PROGRAM IN KALEIDOSCOPE SERIES  </P> <P> Instead of once again succumbing to excess, Dance Kaleidoscope unexpectedly  satirized it during much of the showcase series' final 1989 program Saturday in  the Cal State Los Angeles Playhouse.  </P> <P> Consider Gregg Bielemeier's wry new solo, "A Place for Everything and  Everything in its Place . . ," with its mock-serious anthology of the most  flagrant mannerisms and cliches found in ballet, pop dance and the avant-garde.  Emerging from the parody of choreographic styles came a bitter question very  specifically expressed in sound and motion: Is the contemporary dancer merely a  dog executing tricks?  </P> <P> Jacqueline Planeix and Thomas Crocker (a.k.a. Blue Palm) seemed to answer  affirmatively through their suite from "Dance Talks," in which the demeaning,  lifelong duplicities inflicted on dancers were boldly articulated in speech and  illustrated with movement.  </P> <P> Finally, the Shrimps' inspired outdoor intermission epic "Bluff" reduced the  preoccupation with sex-war in contemporary modern dance to a series of assaults  by teams of morons in their underwear. Sometimes they even wielded giant,  shockingly phallic legumes -- but don't tell Sen. Jesse Helms.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Shrimps, Blue Palm and Bielemeier didn't get around to  satirizing some of Kaleidoscope's own programming sins. Where were they during  Ka-Ron Brown Lehman's solo "A Piece of Sky," for instance?  </P> <P> This slick, sure-fire collage of Alvin Ailey hallmarks featured the customary  lady in a long white dress (here the valiant Jessica Vallot) doing the usual,  frenzied circle-kicks -- accompanied, as always, by a blaring pop ballad.  Perhaps Lehman should formally acknowledge her source by re-titling the work "A  Piece of 'Cry.' "  </P> <P> More original, though ultimately no more satisfying, Patricia Sandback's solo  "Toward Stillness" (well danced by Debi Toth) used walking passages to  punctuate sequences of rhythmic keening and other vividly projected gestural  imagery. However, the components remained isolated statements and the solo  itself a curiously incomplete experience.  </P> <P> Equally fragmentary was Tina Gerstler's "Eclipse," a brief, fluid structuralist  quartet, neatly performed, with some tentative expressive content occasionally  evident. Gerstler aimed for a cosmic perspective on human relationships, but by  using intense embraces merely as formal motifs -- and never suggesting anything  about the participants -- her work looked at once overblown and trivial.  </P> <P> If Dance Kaleidoscope gave a prize for reckless ambition, it ought to go to  Antony Balcena for "Dudes." This movement-theater extravaganza not only dared  to repudiate every vestige of gay pride in its uncompromisingly downbeat  portrayal of homosexual relationships, it also emphasized the most horrific  elements of the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> Balcena proved highly imaginative in physicalizing thorny socio-sexual issues,  but his grotesque finale needs to be revised -- if only because it closely  duplicates the ending of Gerald Arpino's apocalyptic ballet, "The Clowns."  </P> <P> Completing the program: "Departure of the Youngsters," John Malashock's deeply  personal exploration of power and manipulation, recently reviewed in these  pages.  </P> <P> A former Tharp dancer, Malashock is one of the major talents to arise in  Southern California since Dance Kaleidoscope folded two years ago. His presence  on the final program offered potent evidence that this newly revived series  must continue as a means of introducing (and developing) new artists for a  wider audience.  </P></p>

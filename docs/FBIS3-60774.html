Also invited were government  officials and security forces.    Earlier, an unidentified man bombed two mosques, apparently  in retaliation for the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in  Davao City, southern Philippines. In the Davao blast, six  persons were killed while some 130 others were wounded. The  other explosion was in Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental on  Christmas Eve, killing five persons and injuring about 40 others.    AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff  Lisandro  Abadia says the spate of bombings in Mindanao could be the  handiwork of some extremists group out to derail the peace  process.    Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front,  MNLF, strongly deplored the bombing incident in Davao City last  Sunday. Misuari issued this strongly worded statement during  yesterday's meeting of the joint ad hoc technical working  committee of both the government panel and the MNLF in  Timbangan, Indanan, Jolo. In condemning the attacks, Misuari  said the bombings of different places are deplorable and  cowardly acts. He said, it is also a blasphemy which the MNLF  will never allow or condone.

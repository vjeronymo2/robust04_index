			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Sheffield makes a sacrifice: Why city council workers voted to take a pay cut There is an air of pride in Sheffield this week, where nearly 20,000 council workers have voted to take a 3.5 per cent pay cut in exchange for an hour off the working week or seven days' extra holiday, so as to avert 1,400 sackings. 'It's very, very positive,' said Don Lyon, chief executive of H Turner &amp; Son, one of Britain's few remaining locally owned wholesale newspaper distributors and former president of Sheffield Chamber of Commerce. 'They have behaved in an inspiring way,' said Hugh Sykes, chairman of the government-funded Sheffield Development Corporation and a former Master Cutler - the title given to the yearly presidency of the Cutlers' Company, the ancient association of Sheffield manufacturers. With a government-imposed spending limit of Pounds 366m, Sheffield has been struggling to set a legal budget for 1993-94. The city council warned at Christmas that about 1,400 sackings might be needed to save on the wages bill. Nationally, about 90,000 local government jobs will probably be axed over the next year. The dilemma for the council was no different from that facing many others in England and Wales. The government is determined to keep council spending down so that the new council tax - the replacement for the poll tax - can be held as low as possible. Rather than cut staff to keep within government spending limits, Sheffield decided to take another route. The council and the unions negotiated the pay-cut solution so that more workers would not be added to the city's unemployment rate of about 14 per cent. Much of the credit is being given to Mike Bower, who became leader of the Labour-controlled council last April. Since 1980, he has organised the Co-operative Development Agency in Sheffield, which promotes the formation of workers' co-operatives. Before that he worked as a full-time official of the National Union of Journalists after a career on the Sheffield Star, the city's evening paper. According to his colleagues, he is a skilled negotiator who rejects confrontation. He has helped set up 42 workers' co-operatives with about 300 employees in the past 12 years. Despite Mr Bower's skills, the talks were not wholly successful. Shop stewards for nearly 2,000 manual workers in the works department launched a successful campaign for a No vote on the deal. Mr Bower has since been in daily negotiation with the shop stewards and is confident of forging a separate deal. Another group of town hall workers who voted against the wage cuts later reversed the decision. They comprised 529 members of Cohse, the health services union. 'The person who explained it initially hadn't been at the negotiations,' one council employee said. 'Once the background was understood, there was overwhelming support.' The reversal improved overall support for the controversial pay cut to about 61 per cent of the workforce. With the exception of the works department, it will now be universally imposed. Voting figures, however, showed more enthusiasm for the deal among white-collar workers than blue-collar ones. Nalgo, the main office workers union, voted 65 per cent in favour, compared with 53 per cent among the GMB general union. Nupe, which represents lower-paid manual workers, showed 57 per cent support, while members of the Transport and General Workers Union were only just in favour, at 51 per cent. Some council staff remain unhappy, feeling that the city should have found a way of persuading the government to raise the ceiling on its spending. But most did not see this as a serious option because of the government's determination to hold down local government spending. Others - mainly lower-paid workers - said they voted against the proposal because they personally could not afford the cut. But despite opposition, the deal has brought plaudits for its principal architect. At a breakfast meeting this week, Mr Bower was congratulated on doing a good job for Sheffield's image by leaders of the Cutlers' Company, the Chamber of Commerce, the development corporation, and the city's two universities. Much government funding for Sheffield comes through the development corporation, which receives Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m a year for economic revival. It is now developing office blocks, which Sheffield needs to attract white-collar jobs. Mr Lyon, chairman of the Sheffield Partnership, a forum of public and private sector activists, says that over the longer term the council will have to shed white-collar jobs. Unless the city can attract companies through the provision of quality offices, the likelihood of their finding jobs is remote. 'No one would willingly add to unemployment at the moment,' he says, 'but longer-term the council will have to reduce numbers to fit its size as an enterprise.' Ironically, Mr Bower agrees. He says the council has too many layers of supervision and management and this is where he expects long-term reform to make the most impact on jobs. 'We need to cut the cost of services without cutting the services,' he said. 'We can devolve much more responsibility down the line. My experience in the co-operative movement has taught me people will behave responsibly if they are given responsibility.' Many will feel this week's ballot underlines his point.</p>

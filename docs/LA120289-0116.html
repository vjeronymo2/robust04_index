			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> U.S. MOVE TO BACK AQUINO COULD PROVE COSTLY LATER  </P> <P> Over the long run, the Bush Administration's military intervention on behalf of  President Corazon Aquino could, ironically, mark the beginning of the end of  America's 91-year involvement in the Philippines.  </P> <P> For now, the U.S. military move in Manila could help preserve the Aquino  government and, with it, two strategic American military facilities, Clark Air  Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. But the American military action also could  accelerate forces, both in the Philippines and in Washington, leading to a  reduction or pullout of U.S. forces over the coming decade.  </P> <P> Aquino's need for U.S. Air Force warplanes to suppress a military revolt serves  as the most graphic reminder yet of the dependent relationship between the  Philippine government and the United States. Like the regime of Ferdinand E.  Marcos in its final years, the Aquino government has demonstrated that it  cannot survive without American backing.  </P> <P> It has been that way ever since May 1, 1898, when Commodore George Dewey and  his fleet sailed into Manila Bay, sank a Spanish armada and seized America's  first overseas territory. As author Stanley Karnow recounted in his book, "In  Our Image," President William McKinley later explained that God had told him to  annex the Philippines and "do the best we could for them."  </P> <P> In recent years, a number of nationalist leaders in the Philippines have spoken  of the importance of breaking the pattern of dependency on the United States.  "We must slay the father image," declared Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus. The  American military intervention is likely to intensify these nationalist  sentiments among Filipino politicians.  </P> <P> In Washington, meanwhile, foreign-policy strategists have been warning that in  the future, the United States should reduce its reliance on overseas bases such  as those at Clark and Subic Bay, America's two largest overseas military  facilities.  </P> <P> "We should not ordinarily be dependent on bases in defending our interests in  the Third World," concluded the Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy, a  private blue-ribbon panel that included former national security advisers Henry  A. Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and William P. Clark, in a report two years  ago. "We have found it increasingly difficult, and politically costly, to  maintain bases there."  </P> <P> This week's coup attempt in Manila indicates that even now, despite all the  U.S. efforts and money, the situation in the Philippines is, if anything, more  politically fragile and unstable than ever.  </P> <P> Only three weeks ago, on the eve of a visit by Aquino to the White House, a  Bush Administration official was asked whether her government had managed to  improve the situation in the Philippine armed forces since an unsuccessful coup  attempt in August, 1987.  </P> <P> "Since then, the state of civil-military relations (in the Philippines) has  improved markedly," declared the senior official. "I think morale within the  armed forces, discipline, the sorts of things that are important for an  effective force, are much greater now than they were, say, two or three years  ago."  </P> <P> The events of recent days show that the Bush Administration has been far too  optimistic. And quiet U.S. efforts over the past few years to find alternatives  to the bases in the Philippines are likely to take on special urgency now.  </P> <P> The U.S. lease for its bases in the Philippines -- including not only Clark and  Subic Bay but four smaller military facilities -- expires in September, 1991.  Discussions between the two governments about the future of the bases are  scheduled to resume in Manila later this month.  </P> <P> The next presidential elections in the Philippines will be in 1992, and Aquino  recently told The Times in an interview that she will not run for reelection.  "I feel I have already done my duty insofar as being a citizen of this republic  is concerned," she said.  </P> <P> Philippine voters already have elected a Senate dominated by members opposed to  continuation of the U.S. bases. And the future of the relationship between the  Philippines and the United States will inevitably be one of the principal  issues in the next presidential election there.  </P> <P> Over the past year, even middle-of-the-road Philippine politicians and military  leaders have begun to call for a gradual elimination of the U.S. military  presence during the 1990s.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, one of the staunchest supporters of the  United States among Philippine leaders, said early this year there should be a  "phase-out" of the U.S. bases by 1998, the 100th anniversary of Dewey's sail  into Manila.  </P> <P> Similarly, last July, Vice President Salvador Laurel called for "at most, a  10-year phase-out of the bases." In other words, the question among Philippine  politicians seems to be shifting from whether the Americans should leave the  bases to how soon.  </P> <P> At the same time, Washington officials have begun to take seriously the  possibility that the United States could be forced to give up its bases in the  Philippines, which are considered perhaps the most important American military  facilities outside the United States.  </P> <P> One of the biggest problems is money. Last year, the United States concluded an  agreement with the Philippines under which it is paying $481 million a year in  aid for the bases until the current lease expires.  </P> <P> In addition, the United States has promised to contribute $200 million a year  in economic aid to the Philippines as part of a multinational aid initiative  aimed at buttressing the Philippine economy. But Congress has balked at  contributing the money, and it is doubtful the United States will be able in  the long run to keep increasing its payments to the Philippines.  </P> <P> "In the current budget environment, it's not clear that the United States is  going to fight as hard as it might have done to preserve bases if the Filipinos  don't want them," Dov Zakheim, a former Ronald Reagan Administration defense  official, said Friday.  </P> <P> Over the past few years, Pentagon planners have studied the possibility of  relocating the American facilities to U.S. possessions in the Pacific.  </P> <P> "If you move back to Guam, Tinian or Saipan, you could carry out a lot of the  functions of Clark (Air Base) with relative ease," observed one senior Defense  Department official. "The problem is replacing the ship-repair facilities at  Subic Bay."  </P> <P> Some U.S. defense strategists hope that eventually new, high-technology  solutions will make bases like Clark and Subic Bay less important than they are  now.  </P> <P> Last year, the Hudson Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank, said the  development of hypersonic aerospace planes, which could travel halfway around  the world in a few hours without refueling, would reduce the need for overseas  bases.  </P> <P> The Hudson Institute report concluded that "the fruits of these technologies  will probably not be available for at least a decade." That prediction matches  the timetable of the Philippine leaders who are calling for a gradual phase-out  of the American military presence during the 1990s.  </P></p>

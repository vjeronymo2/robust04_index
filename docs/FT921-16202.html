			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Tajikistan forms ties with China China and Tajikistan yesterday established formal diplomatic links as Beijing continued to form ties with the successor-states to the Soviet Union, especially those on its sensitive border, Reuter reports from Beijing. The New China News Agency reported that a joint communique was signed in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital, to establish relations at ambassadorial level. Tajikistan is one of three republics bordering China's Moslem-minority region of Xinjiang in the north-west. Beijing still has to establish ties with Kirgizia in order to have relations with all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on its immediate border. China and Russia set up ties at ambassadorial level on December 27. Beijing subsequently set up full ties with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine. China has recognised all republics of the CIS and Georgia, which has not yet joined the commonwealth, but has said it will negotiate full ties with each individually. A senior official in China's remote north-west on the border with the three republics has urged the region's ethnic minorities to improve inter-ethnic unity and national defence. Mr Keyum Bawudun, deputy chairman of the predominantly-Moslem Xinjiang province, made the plea because Beijing views with alarm the possibility of Moslems on both sides of the border making common cause. 'Xinjiang, as the north-west gateway of the motherland, is very important in terms of its strategic position,' Keyum was quoted as saying on Xinjiang television on Saturday. 'Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education in national defence among all ethnic groups in the region, to enhance solidarity between the army and the people, and to increase inter-ethnic unity,' he was quoted as saying.</p>

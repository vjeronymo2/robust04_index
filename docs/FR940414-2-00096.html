Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 20, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to allow the Exchange to list capped-style stock index options (``capped options''). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Initially, the Exchange proposes to list capped options on the Wilshire Small Cap Index and the PSE Technology Index (together, the ``Indexes''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On October 20, 1993, the PSE amended its proposal to replace references to ``CAPS'' with references to ``capped-style'' options and to state that the Exchange plans initially to adopt a cap interval of 20 points. See Letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated October 15, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). On November 3, 1993, the PSE amended its proposal to indicate that the proposal will apply only to broad-based domestic index options and to clarify that Bridge Data Company calculates the opening and closing index values for the Wilshire Small Cap Index and the PSE Technology Index. See Letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division, Commission, dated October 29, 1993 (``Amendment No. 2''). On February 7, 1994, the PSE amended its proposal to include new Rule 7.8(c), which will (1) indicate those indexes that have been approved by the PSE for capped option trading; (2) provide, in rule form, that, unless modified by the PSE, the cap interval will be $20.00; and (3) set forth the standards for listing and adding series of capped options. See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Michael A. Walinskas, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated February 7, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3''). On April 5, 1994, the PSE amended the proposal to indicate that the PSE has developed procedures to identify and correct any exercise settlement values prior to clearance and settlement of such contracts at the Options Clearing Corporation. See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, PSE, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated April 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed PSE Rule 7.1(r) defines a ``capped-style index option'' as an index option that is exercised automatically prior to expiration when the cap price is less than or equal to the closing index value for calls or when the cap price is greater than or equal to the closing index value for puts. The cap price, which is assigned by the Exchange when the capped option is listed, is the exercise price plus the cap interval for a call or the exercise price minus the cap interval for a put. Accordingly, the cap price is above the exercise price ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  strike price) for calls and below the exercise price ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  strike price) for puts. The difference between the strike price and the cap price is equal to the ``cap interval.'' Specifically, the PSE defines the cap interval as a ``value specified by the Exchange which, when added to the exercise price for the series (in the case of a series of calls) or subtracted from the exercise price for such series (in the case of a series of puts), results in the cap price for the series.'' The PSE has set as an initial standard, subject to Exchange modification that the cap interval for capped options must be $20.00. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While capped options will be subject to automatic exercise due to movements in the underlying index, they also will be European-style, so that if the cap price is not reached prior to expiration the option can be exercised by the holder only at expiration pursuant to the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). Thus, if the underlying index fails to reach the cap price during the life of the capped option, the option becomes European-style on the last business day before expiration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

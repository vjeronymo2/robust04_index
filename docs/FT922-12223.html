			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Aid for Russia: lessons from the Marshall Plan 'ECONOMIC assistance might turn the scale between stability and further disintegration next winter. . . by tempting food and goods to market, restoring the purchasing power of wages and increasing the incentive to produce more.' This quote could have been lifted from any of the many articles advocating generous western financial assistance to aid the economic reconstruction of former Soviet republics. In fact it appeared in July 1947 in the Economist magazine, a few weeks after US secretary of state George Marshall first proposed his aid package. Europe's post-war economic recovery turned out, in fact, to be dramatically successful. By 1951, average national income per head had risen to more than 10 per cent above their pre-war levels, an achievement not matched between 1914 and the great depression. Yet it is surprisingly hard to pin down the role of Marshall aid in fuelling this recovery. While most countries had rapid growth rates, there is little correlation between the amount of aid a country received and its rate of economic growth. West German industrial output rose by a remarkable 312 per cent between 1947 and 1951; but Germany received a below-average Marshall aid allocation. It was the nature and not the quantity of aid that was more important for the pace of Europe's recovery, according to research by Mr Barry Eichengreen and Mr Marc Uzan to be published in the next issue of Economic Policy. Countries across Europe had suffered extensive damage to their infrastructure, needed new investment to shift production to domestic uses and were short of foreign exchange reserves to buy imports. But the total resource flow - Dollars 13bn between 1948 and 1951, more than Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.5bn) in today's prices and averaging only 2.5 per cent of gross national product - was too small to provide a significant boost to either investment or government spending. Countries with the largest current deficits tended to receive more aid. But there was no strong link between national growth rates and either the size of these deficits or rates of investment growth. The importance of Marshall aid was in restoring financial and political stability and speeding the liberalisation of production and prices. Post-war prices were at unsustainably low levels, consumer goods were scarce while large budget deficits threatened inflation. Producers were better off hoarding their goods than selling them. Economically the solution was clear: price controls had to go, wage demands moderated and budgets balanced. But the political difficulties of higher prices, lower real wages for workers and higher taxes were great. Marshall aid, while modest, eased the fiscal constraint facing national governments and made it easier to mollify fractious interest groups. Equally important were the conditions attached to aid. Countries were required to maintain workable stabilisation policies, but specific targets for monetary and fiscal policy were less important than pressure to decontrol prices, reduce trade barriers and co-operate to revive intra-European trade. Russia's reformers are today facing similar problems. The recent decision by the Group of Seven industrialised countries to grant a Dollars 24bn package of aid and trade credits to the Russian government has revived hopes of a Marshall-style solution. But the Marshall Plan analogy may be misleading. Post-war Europe had experience of a private economy: the domestic debate was over types of market economy - more or less state intervention or redistribution - rather than whether to build a private market economy or return to state control. The G7 countries may be able to apply pressure for faster liberalisation and a revival of inter-republic trade. But if the constituency favouring a painful shift to a market economy is weak, Dollars 24bn is unlikely to tip the balance.

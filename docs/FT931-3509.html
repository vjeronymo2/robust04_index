			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook buys 8.4% of Owners THOMAS Cook, the German- controlled travel agency, yesterday bought an 8.4 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, the holiday company defending a hostile bid from rival Airtours. The purchase may prove to be decisive in ensuring that Owners Abroad retains its independence, allowing it to progress with its proposed commercial tie-up with Thomas Cook, and its sister company, LTU, the German tour operator. Last night Owners Abroad and Airtours were awaiting the decision of Gartmore, a 7.6 per cent shareholder in Owners Abroad. The offer closes at 1pm today. Advisers to Owners Abroad said Thomas Cook had bought the shares from a variety of institutions at a cost of about Pounds 21m. Thomas Cook's offer of 152.5p was aimed at investors who were believed likely to accept the offer, they said. Gartmore was understood to have sold some of its stake to Thomas Cook. A spokesman for Gartmore would not comment on whether it planned to to accept the Airtours offer. Airtours also yesterday produced new information on the cost savings it expects to make from a merged Owners and Airtours. It said it hoped to make Pounds 20m savings in the full 1993-94 financial year and the same the following year. These figures compared with Owners Abroad's assessment of benefits from its tie-up with Thomas Cook of Pounds 9m and Pounds 11m in the two years. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said Pounds 8m of savings would come from an average 2 per cent saving on the purchasing of bed nights. A further Pounds 4m saving would come from a car rental deal in the US. Other savings would come from passenger handling, and economies in running the two airlines. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, described Airtours statement as a 'a last minute response to a glaring omission in its arguments to date'. He said Owners' brands had limited overlap with Airtours. Airtours appeared to have ignored the effect of loss of market share which would occur if its bid were successful, the company said.

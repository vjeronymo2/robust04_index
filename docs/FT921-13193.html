			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WEAKNESS in the underlying stock market, a lower Wall Street and technical trading conspired to depress recent high premiums on FT-SE futures yesterday. On the Liffe, the March contract opened at a strong premium of 46 points above the underlying market against its estimated fair value - the premium which allows for dividend flow and financing costs on the underlying Footsie stocks - of 22. March ticked up a little first thing and then, a heavy programme trade weighted to the sell side in the cash market, brought it back from a high of 2,604. It reached a low shortly afterwards as a result of a sell order in a thin market. But, in the afternoon, the decline on Wall Street affected sentiment and just before the close traders, who earlier bought the contract on its relative cheapness, rushed to sell out and straighten their books. At the official close, March was 2,577, a premium of 44, with some 5,600 contracts traded. It continued lower in after-hours' trading to reach 2,563. In LTOM, turnover of 21,569 lots was significantly down on the previous day. Asda was the busiest stock option with 1,392 contracts traded. FT-SE Index options were active.</p>

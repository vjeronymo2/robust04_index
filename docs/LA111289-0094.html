			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DNA TESTING CITED AS MAJOR TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: OFFICIALS ARE APPLAUDING DECISIONS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND  ELSEWHERE TO BUILD LABORATORIES TO TRACK DOWN VIOLENT CRIMINALS THROUGH GENETIC  'FINGERPRINTS.'  </P> <P> In a bustling corner of the FBI headquarters, Special Agent Jack Quill is  poring over an X-ray that bears an odd-looking pattern not unlike the bar code  on a box of cereal.  </P> <P> But these horizontal lines have nothing to do with supermarkets. What Quill is  holding on the oblong transparency is a piece of evidence that most likely will  put a rape suspect behind bars.  </P> <P> The case is one of the 400 in which the FBI's DNA Analysis Unit has completed  its work since its opening last December. Work on 600 others, referred from law  enforcement agencies throughout the country, is in progress.  </P> <P> "It takes us probably two to three weeks before we can even start a case now,  because of our backlog," said John W. Hicks, the FBI assistant director who  runs the bureau's sprawling laboratory division. "And it will probably get  worse."  </P> <P> That is one of the reasons that Hicks and other DNA experts, both in government  and out, are applauding decisions by officials in Orange County and other  jurisdictions to build their own laboratories to track down violent criminals  through DNA "fingerprints."  </P> <P> "We think it's a very powerful technology that's going to have a tremendous  impact on law enforcement," especially in identifying rapists and, to a lesser  extent, murderers, Hicks said.  </P> <P> DNA testing technology represents a major breakthrough for law enforcement  because it is a highly reliable method of positively matching blood, semen,  hair or tissue samples taken from a crime scene with a blood sample taken from  a suspect.  </P> <P> The older technology of blood serology is effective in excluding suspects, but  it hardly ever produces a positive identification.  </P> <P> DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is an organic material found in the  chromosomes of every human being. It carries the basic genetic code that  determines individual characteristics.  </P> <P> By matching the repeating chemical patterns in those sections of DNA that bind  genes together, scientists can routinely make identifications with certainties  of one in several billion.  </P> <P> Eventually, law enforcement officials hope to build a computerized central DNA  "fingerprint" identification system that will allow authorities to determine  whether a series of rapes or murders across the country was the work of a  single person, or whether a suspect arrested in one state was connected to  violent crimes in another.  </P> <P> Despite questions raised by defense attorneys and civil libertarians, the  technology has been accepted in trial courts in 34 states, according to an  official of one of the two major private DNA testing laboratories in the  nation.  </P> <P> Appellate courts in three of those states -- Maryland, Virginia and Florida --  have upheld the use of DNA testing, said John W. Huss, vice president of  Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., about 25 miles northwest of  Washington. No appellate court has yet rejected the technology.  </P> <P> However, only two states and one local jurisdiction -- Virginia, North Carolina  and Nassau County, N.Y. -- have opened DNA testing units in their own crime  laboratories, according to the FBI. Six other state and local agencies,  including the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department, are on their way.  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Oct. 17 to spend $200,000 to  create a DNA unit in the county crime laboratory, $80,000 of which will be from  private sources that have contributed to the Sheriff's Advisory Council.  </P> <P> The decision was prompted in part by the disclosure that a suspect in the  recent rape of a 12-year-old girl in Huntington Beach had been acquitted of a  rape charge five months earlier because prosecutors were late in obtaining DNA  evidence from a private laboratory. Had the evidence been received sooner,  authorities have said, the man would probably have been convicted.  </P> <P> "The sooner we get it on-line, we feel, the better off we're going to be," said  Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  "We feel that evidence of this type is so overwhelming that in a lot of cases,  rather than go to trial, we'll get more guilty pleas." And that, Olson said,  would save both time and money.  </P> <P> Further, in the cases that go to trial, police officials said, an in-house DNA  lab would eliminate the need to hire expert witnesses from private  laboratories, which charge fees of as much as $1,000 for a single court  appearance.  </P> <P> Exonerations can result in savings too, police said. If a DNA test determines  early on that a prime suspect could not possibly have been the assailant,  police are not wasting time or money going after the wrong person.  </P> <P> However, it is difficult to determine the cost-effectiveness of establishing a  DNA unit in a public crime lab, Huss said. The FBI performs its analyses for  local police agencies at no cost, but the growing demand may mean longer waits  for evidence.  </P> <P> "I would say a laboratory that is going to do 10 cases a year, it would be  absurd," Huss aid. "But maybe it makes sense if you're going to do 30 to 50  cases a year. . . . It's very hard to calculate break-even, in a non-revenue  environment and a non-competitive environment. But I think there are practical  reasons to do it, chiefly chain of custody."  </P> <P> The technology was developed in the early 1980s, and it has been refined in  recent years. Its first widespread commercial application was in paternity  testing. Huss estimated that 85% of his company's business involves paternity  cases, but its criminal work is significant.  </P> <P> Cellmark, for example, performed the lab work that led to the conviction last  month of a 35-year-old woman for the robbery and murder of a worker at a  Ventura hamburger stand. It was the first California case in which genetic  testing evidence was introduced.  </P> <P> "We don't view the entry of the public sector laboratories as a surprise or a  problem," Huss said. "When the FBI entered this business, our business shot up  substantially because it gave the broadest possible endorsement to the  technology."  </P> <P> In addition to operating its own DNA lab, the FBI also trains law enforcement  agents from all over the country in the use of the technology. The bureau  expects that 120 people will take its DNA courses at Quantico, Va., next year.  </P> <P> Still, despite its promise, DNA identification does have limitations.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Political Notebook: A quiet weekend for Mr Patten MR Chris Patten will not be travelling to Chequers this weekend clutching his computer printouts of the local election results. Instead, we are assured, he will enjoy a birthday dinner with his wife and daughters before spending a couple of days with friends in Yorkshire. (The celebration is a week early but party chairmen are too busy to be over-precise about these things). Mr Patten has good reason to avoid the television crews who tend to camp outside the prime minister's official country residence. When Mr Cecil Parkinson took the results of that year's local elections to Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1983, the decision to call an early general election had all but been been taken. It was the same when Mr Norman Tebbit made his much-publicised pilgrimage in 1987. There is no such certainty now. If Mr Patten were to follow their example he would probably find himself sneaking out of the back door on Sunday afternoon with a less than triumphant message for waiting reporters. Unless today's results defy all expectations he would have to say something like this: 'Um. .we are optimistic, the results were much better than last year. But they are not quite good enough yet. Let's watch the opinion polls and see what happens in the Monmouth by-election'. The headlines in Monday's newspapers would read: 'Major AND Patten dither over election timing'. So what we can expect instead is a quiet telephone chat with Mr Major on Sunday morning followed by Downing Street guidance that the prime minister is far too busy to waste time speculating about the election date. To delay is much better than to dither. ****** The prospect then is that for the next few weeks and, much more likely, months we will all be in the thrall of the opinion polls - the result on May 16 in Monmouth is unlikely to be any more decisive than the local elections. A newly-published history of British opinion polling* provides both Mr Major  -and the commentators attempting to second-guess him - with a salutary reminder of the risks of relying too heavily on these snapshots of the public mood. Mr Robert Worcester of Mori explains how the science has moved on since Gallup broke new ground in 1937 by asking the British public whether, if pushed, they would prefer Fascist or Communist rule (51 per cent opted for the hammer and sickle against 49 per cent for the swastika, but 46 per cent were pioneers of that difficult 'don't know' category). He recalls that what is the now-traditional Liberal by-election tactic of trying to swing voters by publishing favourable canvass returns was first seen in the 1951 general election. The Liberals leaked poll findings referring to the '38 per cent of the electorate who would vote Liberal if they thought they really could have a Liberal government'. But the book reminds us also of the first and second rules of interpreting opinion polls. They are a device for assessing opinion not for forecasting behaviour; just as importantly, the results reflect that opinion only at the time the poll is taken. For much of the 1980s, the health warnings were ignored. In 1983 and 1987, public support for the Tories was sufficiently high - and solid - for Mrs Thatcher to be confident that snapshots of opinion in the run-up to the elections provided a reasonable proxy for behaviour on polling day. But the best comparisons now are those with the late 1960s and early 1970s rather than those with the 1980s. The swings in opinion over the past two years mirror those between 1966 and 1970 when the then Mr Harold Wilson was alternately 20 points behind and then 20 points ahead. The most worrying parallel for Mr Major is with the spring of 1970 when Mr Wilson was encouraged by his lead in the polls into calling a June election. That apparent lead lasted for the whole of the campaign. But he lost to Mr Edward Heath. Mr Heath in turn was to be similarly misled by private opinion polls into seeking a new mandate in February 1974. ****** Mr Patten has his own reasons for being sceptical about the elaborate and expensive computer projections which will follow the local election results. The printouts that Mr Tebbit took to Chequers in 1987 predicted confidently that although the Conservatives were heading for a landslide nationally Mr Patten would lose his Bath seat by 5,000 votes. He won it by 1,400. *British Public Opinion by Robert M Worcester, published by Basil Blackwell for Institute of Contemporary British History.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (11): Downturn begins to bite - The Labour Market THE day starts early in Tokyo's day labourer district. By dawn most of the men, many of whom had slept outside in blankets and cardboard, hang around the day labourer market - a block where the recruiters wait around with their minivans. However, times are hard for the labourers of the Sanya district in east Tokyo. While the average Japanese office worker has yet to feel the direct effects of the recent downturn in the economy, the labourers, usually working on construction sites and small factories, are one of the first groups to face the slump in the real estate market and decline in capital investment by companies. 'It's a recession,' says one labourer waiting for the tehaishi, day job recruiter, to pick him up. 'I'm lucky because I have connections. You can't find jobs without connections these days,' he adds. He is one of 8,000 workers in the district, the second largest day labourer area following Osaka's Nishinari district. The men sleep in the doya, cheap hotels and apartments, or outside on the streets if they cannot afford Y1,000 for the night. At about 6.15 am those who have not been so lucky in finding work for the day, head off to the employment centre, run by the municipal government, a grey concrete building where day jobs are posted from 6.30 am. Waiting for the shutter of the centre to open, the workers, mostly men in their 50s, wait around with cigarettes in hand, and their belongings in paper bags by their sides. 'I couldn't pay the rent for three months, so I just ran away,' says one man to his friend. 'There are three good jobs in Tokyo, and one in Sendai,' shouts another. Once the shutter opens, the men crowd into the centre, which resembles an empty parking lot. The workers look intently at the job offers posted on the walls. However, the number is limited and only a handful of applicants are accepted. The daily average number of jobs at the three employment centres in Sanya fell 16 per cent in the last fiscal year to March, to 554. For those who have given up looking for work, the day begins with glasses of beer or sake at one of the many sake stands. Some stand around a meal van eating curry with rice for Y120, a fraction of the price for a businessman's meal in Tokyo. The heady days of the late 1980s and the acute labour shortage created high demand for the day labourers, increasing daily wages to as high as Y13,000 for clearing and digging land. The increase in pay gave rise to business hotels where workers upgraded their boarding facilities from a badly lit room with six bunks to fully air conditioned rooms with television sets, costing as much as Y4,100 a night. However, the lack of jobs has pulled down wages, and for an increasing number of workers, even the cheaper hotels are too expensive. 'Of the 200 hotels for day workers, only 50 per cent of the rooms are being utilised,' says Mr Kouichi Sato, manager at Jouhoku Welfare Centre, a government run counselling and aid centre in the Sanya district. By 8.00 am, the early morning buzz is over, and blue-suited office workers start their journey to offices surrounding Sanya. The lives of the middle class around the area, are rarely affected by the outcast day workers. During the day, the Sanya area becomes quiet, with a few of those who could not find work sleeping on the streets. Some of the labourers say they are turned off by the poor terms of the recruiters who are often connected with the yakuza, or gangsters. 'I'd rather be out on the streets than work for the yakuza,' says one worker who chose to spend the day at the welfare centre. He complains that the an increasing number of employers try to exploit the labourers by charging unrealistic prices for meals, cigarettes, and tissue paper consumed during the day. With such expenses deducted, 'by the end of the day, you end up being paid around Y4,000 although the promised amount is over Y10,000,' he adds. Mr Sato at Jouhoku says the number of labourers asking for aid or counselling has risen in the past year. 'The number rose over 3,000 last January for the first time in eight years,' says Mr Sato. Last fiscal year to March, the number of workers seeking help concerning food rose by 64 per cent, while those in need for board rose by 30 per cent. 'You're drinking, aren't you,' says a welfare worker sternly to a middle-aged straggly-haired man waiting for counselling. A high percentage of the Sanya dwellers are alcoholics, and many are in poor health due to malnutrition. 'Get your free health inspection,' urges a flier distributed by the welfare centre, listing the symptoms of tuberculosis. The demographic changes under way in Japan are apparent in Sanya. While most of the men look older than they actual are, due to the harsh manual labour, the average age of the labourers is rapidly rising. In Sanya, some 60 per cent of the residents are over 50 years old, while the same age group constitutes only 30 per cent of the whole of Tokyo. Another problem for the labourers is the increase in foreign illegal workers. Employers prefer to hire younger foreign labourers at cheaper prices. Mr Sato was concerned over the increasing number of Japanese labourers losing jobs to such foreigners. 'The rise in tensions could lead to riots,' he adds. By sunset, most of the workers are back from their jobs. After retrieving their bags containing their belongings from the coin lockers, some head for the public baths. By 9.00 pm, the streets are quiet again, as the labourers of Sanya prepare themselves for another early morning ahead.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Franco pledge on Brazilian reform BRAZIL'S acting president Itamar Franco said yesterday his government remained committed to the 'basic principles' of the modernisation programme started by President Fernando Collor, who was suspended last month on corruption charges. In a message to the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain, yesterday celebrating its 50th anniversary, Mr Franco underlined his support for 'the full normalisation of our relations with the international financial community, the uninterrupted implementation of the privatisation programme and the opening up of the Brazilian economy.' He said Brazil would always welcome foreign capital wishing to share the risks of the market economy and the challenges of development. In a speech to the chamber, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the UK Board of Trade, urged the Brazilian government to move quickly with the implementation of adequate intellectual property legislation and to continue to reduce tariffs, which currently average 20 per cent. He also stressed the importance of Brazil's fiscal reform efforts. He welcomed recent moves by the Brazilian government to improve the climate for foreign investment, and said he looked forward to the removal next year of constitutional limitations on foreign investment in mining and oil and gas exploration, production and refining. He said British companies, which already had about Pounds 1.5bn of investments in Brazil, were particularly interested in developing trade in several sectors: the construction of the gas pipeline between Bolivia and Sao Paulo; cellular telephones and fibre optics; ports and airports; oil and gas production; water treatment and consumer products.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): How to reduce paperwork - High-speed memos via electronic messaging TODAY'S growing tempo in industry and commerce means businesses must be more responsive to customer demands. However, even though the ubiquitous fax has made big inroads into the market historically enjoyed by telex, the real need of most users is for electronic messaging directly to the screen of a personal computer - either desktop or notebook - with paper copies only being printed when required. Similarly, new messages would also be prepared on the same PC, prior to being 'mailed' electronically. The concept is very beguiling as the last thing that any manager wants is a further proliferation of paper on his desk. It should be feasible to send and receive these memos and messages from wherever there is a telephone, because the telephone network spans the globe. In principle, electronic messaging is very simple: a user prepares a message on his own PC, which must be equipped with a communications device, known as a modem, and appropriate communications software. He then dials into a central message-centre computer and, having completed the logging-on process, which includes password and other security checks, 'down-loads' that message into an electronic pigeon hole, known as a mailbox, on that host computer. He, and other users, regularly dial into that same computer to check whether there are any messages waiting in their individual mailboxes. These they 'down-load' into their PC. So the process continues, with messages and reports being prepared, sent, received and read. While this all may seem very complex, there are a growing number of executives who regularly keep in touch via messaging systems. And the number of users worldwide today may already be as high a 3m. Typically, electronic message services today will allow messages to be transmitted at speeds as high as 2,000 words a minute. However, the latest data modems will support speeds of 30,000 words a minute and even higher. Thus, in due course, it will become common practice to transmit even lengthy reports from one end of the world to the other. Even though many lessons have been learned from that early civil engineering project - the Tower of Babel - it has taken a number of years for a technical standard for message handling systems to be agreed internationally. The operators have the task of converging their existing services in the UK and elsewhere in the world to this standard, known as X400. For example, BT has upgraded its long-established Telecom gold service to BT Mailbox. Not only is this X400 compatible, it is backwards-compatible with Telecom Gold and other Dialcom services worldwide. BT hopes that, in the fullness of time, all its Gold customers will migrate to Mailbox with its added features. However, Mercury Communications, which at the end of last year announced its MultiMessage service aimed at the large corporate client, is holding back from taking a similar initiative because, according to Gary Muchmore, Mercury's electronic messaging product manager, 'there is a need to get the underlying communications standardised' as the majority of users will not find X400 intuitive to use. Services of this nature are not unique to the UK, or for that matter, merely accessible in the country of origin. For example, the latest list from US carrier MCI shows that there is local access to its MCI Mail service in more than 25 countries - and the list is growing. Similarly, IBMX400 is a service offered by IBM International in many countries throughout the world. This is aimed at users of IBM mainframes and allows them to connect to other IBM sites in their own and other countries. The growing penetration of X400 will speed the growth of messaging. However, when one first uses electronic messaging, it is often as an alternative to, say, fax or some other, totally familiar, method. In addition to employing a new technique, users must become familiar with many new mailbox numbers and procedures. The remedy for this is coming from an unlikely source - fax. Because a very large proportion of documents that are sent by fax actually originate from a PC, manufacturers of communications modems are increasingly incorporating a fax facility. A new generation of data modems, such as the Quantum 144 from Cray Communications, support fax and extremely high data rates.</p>

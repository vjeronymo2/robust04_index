			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Ashdown alleges Tory split on EU Mr Paddy Ashdown last night gave a foretaste of the Liberal Democrats' European election campaign, combining remarks highlighting the benefits Britain derives from the European Union with a passage mocking the Conservative split on Europe. The Liberal Democrat leader called for a 'Europe-wide strategy of investment in training and infrastructure', especially transport and information technology. 'Information highways . . . will bring jobs and opportunities to regions scarred by the collapse of traditional industries and to the remotest parts of our islands,' he said. Mr Ashdown, speaking in London three days before the European People's party  -the Conservatives' federalist allies in the European parliament - publishes its manifesto for June's elections, said the Tories were split on Europe. This meant government policy was geared to 'holding together a fractured party' and not to promoting Britain's best interests. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was leading two parties, a moderate, pro-European party symbolised by Conservative MEPs in Brussels and a 'negative party of rightwing xenophobes' who made 'nasty speeches about foreign benefit-scroungers and corrupt foreign politicians'. The Liberal Democrats are confident of making headway in the elections at the expense of the Conservatives, particularly in south-west England. Mr Ashdown said the challenge for pro-Europeans was to transform the European ideal into something which mattered in people's 'practical everyday lives'. He said Britain received 40 per cent of all EU support for the redevelopment of declining industrial regions and 50 per cent of the Rechar budget to help economic regeneration in coalfield communities.</p>

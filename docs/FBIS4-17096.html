			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report in the "Power" column: "The </F> Bosnian Crisis as a Cause for Apparatus Intrigue. The Security  Council Has Resolved To Continue Negotiations With the Serbs"]    [Text] The subject of a Bosnian settlement has suddenly  taken on a scandalous turn. As SEGODNYA reported earlier, the  day before yesterday the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry  prepared the text of a presidential statement, but the final  text that emerged from the Kremlin office that day was a  strongly watered-down version. It is not ruled out that this is  a totally different text. At the same time, a Foreign Ministry  spokesman denied "reports by some mass media outlets" about  differences between Andrey Kozyrev and Vitaliy Churkin on the  Bosnian problem. This statement is more than suspicious: At  least we are not aware of any such reports. Yesterday morning a  new denial followed, this time by Air Force Commander Yevgeniy  Podkolzin. The general described as "speculation" reports that  the Russian battalion can be withdrawn from Sarajevo. During  the whole day there was a solid flow of denials and similar  statements via various communications channels. Toward evening  the presidential press service circulated a report about a  session of the Russian Federation Security Council. The text  says that the session, "in addition to the planned agenda,"  considered the "situation in Bosnia and the tragedy in Gorazde."  It resolved: There is no tragedy. This is our comment on the  phrase: "The possibility of a peace agreement on settling the  conflict remains real."    Judging by a number of signs, what is now happening Moscow  is  not just an attempt to prevent a large-scale use of force in  Bosnia, but an inner apparatus intrigue whose victim could  become the president's special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin.</p>

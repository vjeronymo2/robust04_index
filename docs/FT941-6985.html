			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Managed PEPs (7): Still popular - with the rich / Easing of limits on pooled funds has been a setback to a once-favoured vehicle Although managed Peps were once a core product, many people in the investment industry now feel that they have been overtaken by history and become yesterday's investment. When Peps were launched, in 1987, only Pounds 420 of the permitted Pounds 2,400 annual investment could be placed in a unit trust or investment trust. The favoured Pep vehicle, therefore, was a managed portfolio of a handful of shares, sometimes with the satellite addition of a small unit trust or investment trust holding. However, over the next five years the permitted exposure to pooled funds was gradually increased, until in 1992 all restrictions were removed and the full annual Pep contribution could be invested in a unit trust or investment trust. This new freedom prompted an immediate reaction from many investment houses. Roger Cornick, a director of Perpetual Unit Trust Management, says: 'We stopped doing managed Peps, which were expensive to run, when it became possible to invest everything in unit trusts. I think managed Peps are for people who own their own shares in their own companies, and want to shelter a single line of stock; or for sophisticated customers who believe they can outperform fund managers. Otherwise I cannot think of a category of investor they suit.' Peter Pearson Lund, managing director of Gartmore Fund Managers, is even more forthright: 'I don't think the managed Pep vehicle has a future, because it can't give enough spread.' Like Perpetual, Gartmore ceased marketing a managed Pep when the restriction on unit trust Pep investments was lifted. Save &amp; Prosper, however, had invested heavily in the necessary systems; it has continued to keep faith with its managed Pep and now has Pounds 468m under management. But while Ken Emery, S&amp;P's investment products technical manager, says the vehicle has been very successful in both performance and marketing terms, he admits: 'If we were starting now, with a blank piece of paper, we would not have a managed Pep.' He explains: 'The combination of Inland Revenue's regulations and the SROs' (self-regulatory organisations) regulations make it so complicated, and that makes it expensive. The rules and regulations also make it difficult to manage the portfolio effectively. I think the pooled vehicle will become the Pep for the average investor. Peps are perfect long-term savings vehicles, and it is difficult to offer a savings scheme on a managed portfolio.' Fred Carr, managing director of stockbroker WI Carr, still runs his managed Pep, but not with much enthusiasm: 'We don't think it is justifiable from the cost point of view to take clients out of perfectly good equities. But we haven't put any new money in for a long time. Nowadays, we would tend to use the fund route, although clients could argue that you have a double layer of management charges. Whether this makes up for the lower risk, time will tell.' Although managed Peps have fallen out of fashion, they continue to be popular with a number of wealthy or sophisticated investors. As Jain Castiau, assistant marketing director of Barclays Financial Services, points out: 'We thought that the managed Pep was a product past its sell-by date, but the latest Inland Revenue figures show surprisingly little drop in support.' The figures reveal that, while the overall percentage of managed peps has decreased, overall contributions rose Pounds 6.7bn to Pounds 11.1bn in the 1992-1993 tax year. Barclays has 13,500 managed Pep investors, and Pounds 120m invested in its managed plan, or just over 10 per cent of its total Pep funds under management. But the bank takes some care to cherry-pick the customers to whom it markets this vehicle. Castiau says: 'We see a managed Pep as a niche product for customers who have a particular affinity with shares. We have found that those customers who are used to buying shares actually like to see a handful of shares in their Pep.' Some suggest that the modern successor to the managed Pep will be the 'fund of funds' Pep, a vehicle which invests in a basket of unit trusts and which is growing in popularity. For example, M&amp;G now has more than Pounds 250m invested in its Managed Income Pep, while Fidelity has just launched a similar vehicle, linked to its Moneybuilder unit trust. Judy Delaforce, Fidelity's Product Development Manager, says: 'The Moneybuilder Pep holds about 12 different unit trusts. We think you get the ultimate diversification by this method, even for the investor who can only afford a contribution of Pounds 50 a month.' But, for most investors, a managed Pep means a portfolio of shares, managed on a discretionary basis, and either standing alone in the Pep, or with a satellite unit trust or investment trust. And there continues to be no lack of choice for those who are attracted to such a vehicle. There are more than 30 'share only' managed Peps listed in brokers Chase de Vere's latest guide, and probably three times as many plans that offer an exposure to shares, plus either a unit trust or an investment trust. The important question is: how do prospective investors make a choice? Certainly they should ask about charges - the performance will need to be very good if the management fees are much, if any, higher than those charged on a unit trust or investment trust Pep - and they should also ask about the number, as well as the quality, of the holdings. The criticism of managed Peps has always been that they do not provide a sufficient spread of risk - Pounds 6,000 hardly buys a balanced portfolio of shares - but new investors should inquire whether the number of shares (which will probably only be five or six at the outset) increases in line with any increase in the size of the Pep holding. However, the key factor is performance; and the central difficulty when selecting a managed Pep is to gauge how similar investments have performed. As the gurus at Chase de Vere concede in their new Pep Guide: 'It is not possible to produce meaningful comparative figures for managed share portfolios or for the older style of Peps, which are made up of a combination of managed shares and unit or investment trusts.' So prospective investors must interrogate individual investment managers. The best of them will monitor their performance internally, and should be happy to provide details of how existing clients have fared.</p>

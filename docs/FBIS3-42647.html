Now a subdivision of exceptional importance to public  health is taking action. PRAVDA UKRAINY interviewed Chairman  V.G. Belyavskiy of the Drug Control Committee of the Ukrainian  Ministry of Health, doctor of medical sciences. We will begin  with a few words about him. He is a well-known toxicologist and  he heads a laboratory in the Scientific Research Institute of  Pharmacology and Toxicology, where he has been working for 25  years.    [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, what is the moral and  legal  platform of the committee you head?    [Belyavskiy] The committee was established in accordance  with  the decision of the Ukrainian National Security Council "On the  Status of the Struggle Against the Drug Traffic in Ukraine." No  one is likely to disagree with the statement that an effective  struggle against the drug menace necessitates the united efforts  of all state and public organizations. The creation of the  National Coordinating Council To Combat Drug Abuse could be  viewed as the first step, and the next logical step was the  creation of a special agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health  to establish control over the production and distribution of  medicines containing narcotic substances. That is how our  committee came into being.    [Vilenskiy] How will it operate?    [Belyavskiy] First of all, we will be guided by the articles  of the UN Convention on Narcotic Substances (1961) and the UN  Convention on Psychotropic Drugs (1971) and by Ukrainian laws.    Now that our state is effectively on its own in the fight  against the expanding drug traffic, we need a new and more  responsible approach to the import and export of drugs and  semimanufactured products containing narcotic and psychotropic  substances. Their inclusion in legal records, the issuance of  permits to establishments and institutions for the use of these  substances for scientific and medical purposes, the drafting of  drug use standards in medicine and science, and the replacement  of those that might lead to pathological addiction are the  responsibility of the new committee.    This is far from a complete list of what we plan to do.  After  all, there are no secondary issues in today's world of medicines  and drugs. Incidentally, certificates of authorization to import  and export narcotic drugs have already been approved. Now these  regulating documents of the Drug Control Committee will be  obligatory.    The statute on the committee was approved by the Ukrainian  Ministry of Health and Ministry of Internal Affairs. The  committee members are medical experts and pharmacologists, as  well as representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, Security  Service, Customs Service, Ministry of Justice, and ministries of  foreign and internal affairs. Therefore, it is an  interdepartmental subdivision on the state level.    [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, you have a draft of the  law  of Ukraine on the procedure for handling narcotic drugs,  psychotropic substances, and precursors on your desk. Our  readers probably have not heard anything about it....    [Belyavskiy] I will begin by clarifying the terminology.  Narcotic drugs are the plants and compounds described as such in  international conventions and categorized as such by our  committee. Then there are the psychotropic drugs that can be  dangerous to human health because of their psychological  effects. Finally, precursors are the substances and salts used  as chemical raw material in the production of narcotic drugs and  psychotropic substances.    The draft law consists of 33 sections covering this whole  complex sphere. The passage of the law will be of inestimable  importance to the future of Ukraine.    [Vilenskiy] As far as I know, the law also restricts the  cultivation of opium poppies and several strains of hemp used as  narcotic raw materials.    [Belyavskiy] Yes, and this is of vital importance. Besides  this, it also proposes a new type of prescription for narcotic  and psychotropic drugs. Medicine needs these drugs, but strict  records will be kept of all prescription forms to guard against  forgery. Each prescription will be recorded in a register, and  receipts will confirm the legal acquisition of the drugs. In  other words, the law will stipulate specific procedures for the  physician and the pharmacist. It should guard us against drug  abuse and protect the health care system from encroachments by  the "black market."</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Protean rises 32% and expects further growth Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, lifted pre-tax profits by 32 per cent from Pounds 4.08m to Pounds 5.39m for the year ending March 31. Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said the company had had a good year in spite of recession and tough times, not only in the UK, but in other markets. The return on sales had increased from 12.3 per cent to 13.1 per cent, 'and I see no reason why we should not continue to grow'. Turnover rose from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 42.2m, including Pounds 3.18m from Techne and LIP, two complementary companies acquired in December. The acquisitions also contributed Pounds 552,000 to profits. Mr Ryan commented: 'So far every acquisition we have made has been successful.' The group now comprises 16 companies operating in four countries. Overseas sales accounted for 51.5 per cent of turnover, up from a previous 48.8 per cent. The water purification side accounted for 57 per cent of turnover and 41 per cent of total operating profits of Pounds 5.53m. The laboratory water products side did particularly well, gaining market share in spite of market weakness. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 324,000 to Pounds 1.77m, mainly reflecting the Pounds 1.75m new factory in Derbyshire for making furnaces and ovens opened last August. Earnings per share rose from 10.44p to 12.92p. A final dividend of 3.7p (2.65p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 4.75p (3.55p).</p>

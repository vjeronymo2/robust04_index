			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: E Europe urged to renew ex-Soviet ties - No firm dates offered for EC membership EC member states yesterday urged central and east European countries to rebuild commercial ties with the former Soviet republics to strengthen trade liberalisation in Europe. The call came at the end of a two-day international conference in Copenhagen, but several delegations cautioned that greater regional co-operation in the east should not be a substitute for improved market access to western Europe and eventual EC membership. Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign affairs minister who emerged as the champion of the former communist countries in eastern Europe, said: 'This is not a bad idea. But it only makes sense if integration goes ahead with western Europe.' A free trade zone in east Europe would complement existing efforts to cut barriers between Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary and Slovakia - the so-called Visegrad Four. But it remains politically sensitive as east European countries fear being pushed back towards markets in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The Copenhagen meeting was organised by the Danish government to discuss how best to foster economic development and political stability in central and eastern Europe. In addition to delegates from the 12 EC countries and the Visegrad Four were members of the European Free Trade Area, the Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia. Russia was not represented. The conference highlighted the contradiction between western European countries' political desire to help the former communist countries and the economic reality of recession, which has made them reluctant to offer generous concessions on market access. Despite misgivings among free trade-minded countries such as the UK, Denmark, Switzerland and the Nordic states, the final communique avoided concrete offers on market access. It noted only that the EC and Efta, among others, had an important role in opening markets progressively 'on a mutually advantageous basis'. However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, suggested the conference could increase political support for faster moves to open the EC's markets to central and east European imports. The issue is to be considered at the EC summit in June. At present the EC has struck association agreements with six east European countries, including the Visegrad Four, Romania and Bulgaria. These provide for progressive dismantling of trade barriers, but contain restrictions on sensitive items such as agriculture, textiles and steel - all of which remain key export earners in eastern Europe. The conference, which was non-binding, did not offer a firm date for EC membership for Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, spoke of a 'clear perspective' on membership but added: 'It makes no sense to set a time. It can't be done. It would not help.'</p>

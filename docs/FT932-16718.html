			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Azerbaijan declares emergency THE FORMER Soviet republic of Azerbaijan declared a state of emergency yesterday, after gains by Armenian forces in battles just inside Azerbaijani territory, agencies report. President Abulfaz Elchibey ordered a curfew and travel restrictions, and banned political activity that might destabilise the situation. The emergency would apply throughout Azeri territory for three months. Mr Elchibey had earlier sent a message to the Russian and US presidents, and called on democratic nations to denounce the Armenians as aggressors. An Azeri defence ministry spokesman said Armenian forces had captured 25 villages in western Azerbaijan and reached the regional centre of Kelbadzhar. He said the Armenians were fighting inside the town limits. More than 2,500 people have been killed in five years of Azeri-Armenian fighting, the deadliest and longest conflict in the former Soviet Union. Most of the unrest has been near the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, but fighting has often spilled into border regions of the two states.</p>

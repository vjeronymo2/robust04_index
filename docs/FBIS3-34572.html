			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Intelligence and Security Minister 'Ali </F> Fallahian to unidentified correspondent on 8 February; place not  given -- recorded]    [Text] We seek refuge to God from the evil of accursed  Satan. I offer my congratulations to the martyr-nurturing ummah  and to the esteemed leader on the auspicious occasion of the 10  Days of Dawn. As our martyr-rearing nation is aware, there was  an assassination attempt on the life of our country's beloved  president. Many people have expressed concern through personal  contact or by telephone. They kept requesting that we should  explain the issue more. Although the interrogations are not  completed yet, I will explain some of the issues to our dear  nation to respond to the request of the people.    You know that during the current year global arrogance  employed various means to put pressure to bear on the Islamic  Republic of Iran and on the Iranian nation. This is because our  nation has refused to submit to the pressure exerted by global  arrogance, thanks to our people's firm determination, their  perseverance and their support for the esteemed leader, the  beloved president and the state authorities. This was economic  pressure, the fall in oil prices, psychological warfare, efforts  to isolate the Islamic Republic regime, efforts to distort the  regime's face abroad, psychological war inside the country and  assistance given to their elements, who during the past several  years have tried to remain lackeys of aliens.    In this connection about 24 bombs were smuggled inside the  country. But thanks to the vigilance of the hidden imam's  unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were discovered, but  unfortunately four of the said bombs exploded. In this  connection 16 people were arrested. Meanwhile two brothers  working for the Intelligence Ministry were martyred.    Also during the current year, we have arrested about 40  spies, who have had links with Iraq's security service. There  have been other security problems this year. Thanks to the  efforts of the hidden imam's soldiers, the cooperation of the  Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, the law enforcement forces and  other intelligence organs, these conspiracies were unravelled  and neutralized and security was maintained in our society.    Naturally, because of his effectiveness, because he is an  outstanding and vital figure in our revolution, the honorable  president has constantly been the target of arrogant blows. It  is not the first time and it will not be the last time that such  a conspiracy has been perpetrated; they have committed such acts  many times. We even saw that they tried to assassinate the  popular president of the Iranian nation in the outset of the  Islamic revolution.    When we identified the main members of the group -- those  who  are now known to us as the principle perpetrators of that deed  -- they are people of bad record, of poor or no faith,  irresponsible and corrupt. Some of them also had connections  with minigroups.    The person who instilled most of the negative thoughts in  the  mind of Nik-Akhtar [man arrested for attempt to shoot  Rafsanjani] was a person named Mortaza Mehrpu, who worked in the  police department before the revolution. After the Islamic  revolution he was purged and joined the Feda'i-ye Khalq  minigroup. He spent some time in prison and was then released.  After the minigroup was smashed he became inactive and pursued  his own evil aims and had a very bad life. He was addicted to  alcoholic drinks and had unhealthy relationships.    Nik-Akhtar, himself, after he left secondary school, was an  unsuitable person in terms of faith and deeds and morals. Twice  he applied to join the [Revolution Guards] Corps, but was  rejected. However, with the help of his friends who were also  minigroup members he began his national service and was  dispatched to Zahedan. There he tried to pretend that he was a  suitable person. He made out that he had good points. He tried  to take part in religious publicity work, although he did not  have a proper faith and did not even perform his prayers.  Finally he arrived in Tehran and started working as a reporter  in NEGAHBAN magazine and some other magazines.    There was another person by the name of Mohammad Musavi-Nia.  He is a person who has failed in life and feels dejected. In  terms of piety and faith he is very weak. He is a person who is  affected by negative issues in the society. He mostly read  newspapers which published negative articles and tried to  explain those issues in gatherings.    There is another person in the group who, for security  reasons, I will not name now. He was connected to some foreign  embassies. Of course, there are other persons who helped them  from the fringes or provided facilities for them. They,  unfortunately, worked in some newspapers. If their roles become  clear to us we will take serious measures about them.    The way they worked was that they initially tried to carry  out this deed during Friday prayers. They went to the Friday  prayers venue a number of times and reconnoitred the place.  They studied Friday prayers programs and those who delivered  Friday prayers sermons. Based on information they gleaned from  the Friday prayers they discovered which day the honorable  president would deliver the sermons. They had planned their  action for that day, which coincided with the 10 Days of Dawn  period. They thought that if they carried out the deed at the  shrine of his holiness the imam [Khomeyni] and on 12 Bahman [1  February] it would be more fitting. They, therefore, tested the  weapon they had obtained. Nik-Akhtar and his friend Musavi-Nia  went to the shrine of his holiness the imam. Of course, to  encourage Nik-Akhtar, Musavi-Nia said let me do it. But  eventually Nik-Akhtar said no, I will do it myself.    They went there and using ploys they tried to evade the  shrine security guards. They entered the shrine. It was the  beginning of the speech. The people had not congregated  properly yet. When they entered the shrine they saw that they  could not go to the front. Based on the information they had  received they thought they could do the deed from a distance of  50 or 60 meters. They found a secluded spot and Nik-Akhtar  fired at the podium. Of course, the first shot was aimed at the  podium. But he got nervous and could not aim the subsequent  shots at the podium. He emptied his magazine and threw his  weapon down and tried to mingle in the crowd, but the people  arrested him.    Of course the people were angry and beat him up severely.  Other things happened in the place. Apparently some had held  him tight and the officers could not take him away from the  scene. This is worthy of consideration. We recommend that in  such instances the people should allow the officers to take away  the accused individual. Otherwise the assailant might be  killed. The same thing happened to [Kurush] Nik-Akhtar and the  probability of his being killed was very high.    Anyway after the arrest, he was handed over to the  intelligence forces and the task of identifying the others  began. So far in this connection I have come to the conclusion  that these are basically adventurous elements, they lack belief,  are influenced by negative insinuations, and are mostly  individuals who do not go along with the revolution and Islam.  They have taken such an action not because of current  difficulties, rather they have opposed our system from the  beginning and for a long time. Although the organized  mini-groups have mostly disappeared, their remnants may come  together in circles to exploit the wounds inflicted on society.    At this point I wish to thank the Hezbollahi ummah for its  cooperation with the Intelligence Ministry. I am also grateful  to the intelligence association, the military and law  enforcement forces for endeavoring to maintain security in the  society. May God grant success to all of us to improve the  society's security daily. Despite all the conspiracies, our  society, our country is the most safe country in the world. We  owe this to all the law enforcement forces, the Guards Corps and  intelligence forces in society. May God's peace and mercy be  upon you all.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Hong Kong awards Pounds 600m airport deal: International consortium wins contract AN international consortium of Japanese, US and European companies was yesterday provisionally awarded a HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 600m) contract to carry out reclamation and site preparation for Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport. The bid by Airport Platform Contractors was the lowest from four short-listed consortia, and was well below the HKDollars 10bn budgeted for the work by the Provisional Airport Authority, the government corporation charged with overseeing and managing the project. The contract is expected to take about 3 1/2 years to complete. Members of the consortium include Nishimatsu Construction of Japan, Costain of the UK, Morrison Knudsen of the US, China Harbour Engineering from China, Ballast Nedam, a Dutch subsidiary of British Aerospace, and Jan De Nul of Belgium. Work will involve levelling the 1,248 hectare site on Chek Lap Kok Island and reclaiming land from the sea. The formal award of the contract requires China's approval for the financing for the airport, which, allowing for estimated inflation, is forecast to cost HKDollars 68.5bn. The Hong Kong legislature then has to approve the arrangements. Beijing's approval is expected to take some time. The consortium has agreed to extend the closing date of its offer from mid-October until the end of November. Failure to meet this deadline may mean the contract being put out for re-tendering. It is the second big contract to be awarded for the airport project, which includes large-scale road and rail links to the mainland. In May an Anglo-Japanese consortium which included Costain and Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shipping and hotels group, was awarded a HKDollars 7.14bn contract to build one of the world's largest suspension bridges. Negotiations between Britain and China about the financing of the whole airport project broke up on Thursday without agreement. Yesterday Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, said he hoped for rapid progress in negotiations after August. China is concerned about the cost of the project, the financial guarantees made available by the government, and the prospect of heavy debts accruing to the post-1997 government of the colony. Britain is seeking China's agreement to the financial package devised for the Provisional Airport Authority. It is prepared to make concessions on the financing of the airport railway, the principal source of concern to China. These worries are unlikely to be allayed, or confirmed, until Mr Patten makes known his plans on the colony's future political structure in the autumn. But the provisional award of the contract has increased the pressure on Beijing to approve the financing for the airport.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Index surprise A surprise result in the latest changes to the FT-SE 100 Index came too late in the day to affect the relevant stocks, but dealers said several big investors were put off their stride by the inclusion in the index of investment group 3i rather than Eurotunnel. It had been widely anticipated that the Channel tunnel group would join merchant bank Schroders in the leading index, replacing textiles group Coats Viyella and freight company NFC. A number of tracking funds which link investments closely to the Footsie had apparently already bought Eurotunnel stock to adjust their holdings. However, a spokesman for the FT-SE steering committee said that as the Eurotunnel Units represented a combination of French and British stock the capitalisation was halved to give an appropriate weighting. Coats Viyella, which announced the appointment of Lord Owen to the board, eased a half-penny to 222 1/2 p, while NFC shed 2 to 170p following a fall in nine-month restated profits to Pounds 76.8m from Pounds 116.3m previously. Eurotunnel was a penny off at 284p and 3i slipped 2 1/2 to 319p, while Schroders edged up 2 to 1535p. The world's biggest mining company, RTZ, advanced 13 to 885p after producing first-half figures above market forecasts. The group announced a 30 per cent rise in adjusted earnings to Pounds 242m, against forecasts of between Pounds 195m and Pounds 215m. Analysts raised full-year predictions by some Pounds 70m. For example, SGST moved its figure to Pounds 530m from Pounds 460m. RTZ's paying of a foreign income dividend had distorted the figures by lowering the tax charge, but underlying profits were still up by 20 per cent against market expectations of about a 15 per cent increase. More details of share buy-backs and the appearance of the rumoured cost-reduction programme at Midlands Electricity kept the regional electricity stocks bubbling away. London Electricity just edged out Midlands as the sector's best performer, with London closing 21 higher at 721p and Midlands 20 ahead at 819p. Midlands said its cost reduction plans would be worth around Pounds 30m over the next two years. Manweb, which announced a similar move on Tuesday, jumped 11 more to 862p. There were more share buy-backs announced yesterday by South Wales Electricity, which said it had picked up a further 100,000 shares late on Monday at 815p. South Wales shares advanced 13 to 830p. There were also strong performances from Eastern, up 9 more at 797p, Norweb, 12 higher at 817p, and Southern, which rose 13 to 780p. The Scottish generators suffered yet more weakness ahead of the pricing review, which was said to be imminent. Hydro-Electric lost 10 at 388p and Power 9 at 390p. National Westminster was the outstanding stock in a bank sector still attracting plenty of attention from the big institutions. The shares rose 7 to 518p, helped by a positive recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing, whose banks team pinpointed the stock as a particular beneficiary of higher base rates. The market gave a grudging response to the interim profits improvement at Hillsdown Holdings, with dealers marking the shares up to 185p immediately the results were announced before chopping them back to their overnight level of 181p. Ms Arabella Cecil, food manufacturing analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, described the figures as 'satisfactory rather than exciting', but remained bullish of the stock. 'We continue to expect a 10 per cent-plus rerating over the next 12 months as consistent results are delivered and the dividend resumes growth.' Ms Cecil cautioned, however, that the stock would be low on short term thrills. Dalgety receded 4 to 485p amid talk of a James Capel sell recommendation. Cadbury Schweppes rose 5 to 472p, helped by a Strauss Turnbull buy recommendation in front of interim figures expected this morning. Nurdin &amp; Peacock put on 6 at 183p in the wake of the well received interims, which included a 5 per cent increase in the dividend. Engineering group BBA managed to overcome an initially unfavourable reaction to its interim profits, which more than halved because of a Pounds 15m exceptional litigation charge. The market was pleased with the progress the group has made and encouraged by management's reiteration of target margins of 10 per cent. The stock put on 9 at 198p on high volume of 3.8m. Nervousness surrounded GKN, which declined 9 to 614p. There was rumoured to be a block of 1m shares in the market and few takers. Simon Engineering suffered, in spite of reducing first-half losses, the shares dipping 4 to 110p. 'It is difficult to see any value short of breaking the group up,' said one analyst. Profit-taking took 4 1/4 off British Steel at 153 1/2 p. The stock has lost 7 since Monday, sparked by downbeat price comments made by ASW when announcing its results on Monday. Arjo Wiggins, the paper group, improved 7 1/2 to 279p ahead of interim figures due today. Bowater remained strong, closing 6 up at 498p. Encouraging figures from Portals, the banknote paper maker, saw the shares jump 20 to 675p. Interim profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 16.2m. Anagen, the medical diagnostic group, forged ahead 13 to 65p after announcing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its automated immunoassay system. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

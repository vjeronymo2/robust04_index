			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Chase Manhattan in share offer CHASE MANHATTAN, the big New York bank engaged in a wide-ranging restructuring programme, yesterday turned in higher first-quarter earnings and revealed plans to raise Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) of new equity capital while also writing off Dollars 1bn of commercial property loans in a significant change in strategy in the property sector. Net profits for the quarter were Dollars 153m, up from Dollars 141m a year ago. The net income was struck after a Dollars 500m extraordinary gain reflecting accounting changes related to income tax. The first-quarter 1993 profit also reflected special provisions of Dollars 884m taken after the bank decided to segregate about Dollars 2bn of 'lower quality domestic commercial real estate assets' and to sell these in the next few months. In addition to the charge the bank also used Dollars 135m of its loan loss reserves, thus marking down the total value of the Dollars 2bn property portfolio to Dollars 1bn. Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase, said selling the Dollars 2bn of property assets would reduce the bank's bad debt provisions by Dollars 750m for the rest of 1993. Chase also said it had informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) it planned to raise Dollars 750m of additional equity capital by way of a share offer that will be underwritten by a syndicate led by Goldman Sachs, First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and SG Warburg Securities. Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase, said the aim of the property loan disposal plan and share offer proposal was 'to take advantage of better liquidity in the real estate market in order to shrink the size of the property loan portfolio' while raising capital to continue financing the bank's strategy of focusing on worldwide corporate, information and clearing services and domestic New York area retail banking and consumer products. At the end of March Chase's US commercial property loan portfolio totalled Dollars 4.6bn, down from Dollars 8.2bn a year ago. Chase also made other bad debt provisions of Dollars 360m, compared with Dollars 300m a year ago. The bank wrote off Dollars 220m of loans in the quarter, compared with Dollars 294m a year ago. Its tier one ratio of risk-weighted assets to capital was 7.1 per cent at the end of the first quarter, from 5.7 per cent.</p>

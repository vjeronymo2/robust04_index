Upper </F> Silesia's Future Rests on Winning Special Economic Zone Status"]    [Text] For a while now, the Western press has carried  predictions of the expected emergence of a new "European Tiger."  Previously, that aggressive title was reserved exclusively for  the economies of such East Asian countries as Taiwan, South  Korea, Singapore, and others. This time it is Poland's turn, and  we find the news somewhat surprising, to say the least.    However, the Western observers' conclusion is drawn from the  study of the Central Office of Planning [CUP] official economic  forecast for the next four years, which includes a detailed  prognosis for the next year. Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, who  heads CUP, maintains that, over the next four years, we will be  able to consolidate the economic growth that has already been  noted, and even accelerate it. According to the forecast, the  gross national product should grow at the rate of 4.2 percent  per year, our exports by 5.5 percent, and public consumption by  14 percent. All of this should be accompanied by a 9-percent  annual increase in capital investment. These projected figures  are comparable with the indexes achieved by Asia's "economic  tigers," and that fact gave rise to the aforementioned  analogies, which are further reinforced by the proven accuracy  of recent CUP forecasts.    Will the latest CUP prognoses be just as accurate? This  depends first and foremost on our politicians and the policies  they pursue--in other words, on precisely those factors that  should not affect the economy. The latest CUP predictions were  prepared during Hanna Suchocka's rule, whereas the task of their  realization will be entrusted to the new government, commonly  dubbed the government of the left. It has to be admitted that  Prime Minister Pawlak and his ministers have pledged their  intention of maintaining the direction of the reforms, including  privatization and controlled inflation. However, voices have  been heard heralding interventionist policies, which should  encourage exports on the one hand and promote our own  agriculture and industry on the other. A small measure of state  intervention will not harm our interests, and privatization  should be carried out avoiding unjust treatment of work forces  in the process and at a slightly slower rate, according to the  opinion of the government team and its economic advisers.    Only such nuances could now alter the accuracy of the  forecasts. However, other economists see our aspirations to the  title of "Europe's tigers" in bleaker terms. One of them,  Andrzej Krzysztof Wroblewski, wrote in his paper, GAZETA  BANKOWA, that the sight of the steadily shortening lines of  people bringing their savings to banks and the correspondingly  lengthening lines of company directors applying in the same  banks to have their debts annulled filled him with pessimism.  His pessimism was, according to him, an answer to the optimism  of those who hope that the left-wing government will not expect  people to work hard but will, instead, allow employers to pay  them more. Such optimists see the supposed proof of the  correctness of their views in the government's decision to  abolish the "popiwek" tax [on above-normative wages] on 1 April  1994.    Regular polls carried out by the Public Opinion Survey  Center  [CBOS] confirm a steady rise of popular optimism after the  September election and the appointment of the new government. At  the same time, CBOS analyses show that Polish people assess  their material situation as rather modest. However, compared  with the situation prevailing 18 months ago, they appear to have  a stronger sense of material security. This opinion should be  modified by adding that the relevant polls were carried out  toward the end of November, so their respondents could not have  known the scenario of the December "packet" of price rises  announced for the coming year. An avalanche of these price  increases is due to be triggered on the last night of the year  and will hurtle onward right through until December 1994. The  draft budget approved on Christmas Eve assumed a 27-percent  increase in the prices of consumer goods and services! To make  matters worse, forecasts concerning the situation in the labor  market are hardly any better. It is expected that unemployment  will continue to grow throughout 1994 and that, in four years'  time, it could still be only 5 percent lower than in 1994.    No one is a prophet in his own country, and that is perhaps  why Western observers perceive our chances in a more optimistic  light--starting with Professor Jeffrey Sachs and ending with  Western businessmen, who recently seem to be somewhat more  inclined to invest in Poland than they appeared before. They all  agree that the obvious continuing modernization of our  infrastructure, from the banking system through the  communications system to the construction of freeways, speaks in  favor of treating us with such new confidence, as does the  continuing growth tendency noted in our economy.    Unfortunately, prospects for the Katowice Voivodship appear  rather black against that optimistic background picture. Such  neighboring voivodships as Bielsko-Biala and Czestochowa have  recorded a steady increase in their sold output, so they enjoy  rather hopeful expectations and forecasts. However, the region  of [Upper] Silesia will not be able to activate its economic  potential by itself, considering its lack of gross profit-making  capacity, the extent of its debt liabilities, and the absence of  credit-generating capacity on the part of the majority of the  giant state enterprises representing predominantly such branches  of heavy industry as mining and the metallurgical industry. This  absence of a growth potential in [Upper] Silesia will persist  even in the case of a hypothetical economic boom enjoyed by the  rest of the country. This is because--as we will  remember--according to an analysis prepared a while ago by the  EEC of the development prospects of Poland's individual regions,  Upper Silesia is treated as a moribund industrial zone. This is  bad news for the region's rating as regards its potential for  attracting foreign investors. That is why its future depends,  among other things, on whether the Katowice Voivodship manages  to win the status of a special economic zone. Unfortunately,  Warsaw and its power centers are not at all eager to accord it  such a status.    As we can see, the answer to the question "What will 1994 be  like for us?" will depend on a great many factors. Some of those  will be external factors that we cannot influence ourselves.  Nevertheless, our country should by no means be regarded as a  peripheral area of Europe, and such developments as stemming the  recession in the West, securing lasting peace in the world (and  especially in Europe), shaping correct relations with our  neighbors, and the unveiling of Russia's war doctrine will not  be irrelevant to our condition and our assessment of our  situation in the coming year.    Will a new "tiger" be born in Europe? And will it be a  "Polish tiger"? The question remains open, but even the fact  that it has been posed bodes well for us. Who would have dared  to come up with such a prospect as recently as two years ago?</p>

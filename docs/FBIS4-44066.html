			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  leaders meeting here Friday [24 June] agreed the outlines of a  common economic policy, an essential step if they are to bring  their economies towards greater union, diplomatic sources said.    The talks on price stability, sound public finances and  labour market flexibility were brief, the main points having  already been approved at a meeting of the EU member's ministers  of economy and finance two weeks ago.    They had to be approved by the heads of government at the EU  summit here before being formally adopted by the finance and  economics ministers at their next meeting.    Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen told European leaders  that the union had to offer a clearer explanation to the public  indicating that the policy was aimed at fighting unemployment,  the source said.    The convergence criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty on  European economic and political union set a limit for public  sector debt of 3 percent of gross domestic product.    The criteria have to be met for countries to join a single  European currency sector due to be agreed at the end of 1997 or  1999. Few EU member states currently meet the targets.</p>

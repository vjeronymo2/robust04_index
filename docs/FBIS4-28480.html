			<p>BFN     [Text] The traditional government stance that "the use of  nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of international  law" has been deleted from an official statement the government  plans to submit to the International Court of Justice [ICJ].  What happened in the process has once again served to show that  the ruling coalition government is "controlled by the  bureaucracy," something for which the coalition government has  been under fire ever since the inauguration of the  administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last  year. For Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, this could be considered  a political blunder which may possibly give the impression that  he lacks leadership in an area that has to do with Japan's basic  stance in foreign affairs.    At a news conference following a lower house budget  committee  meeting on 8 June, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters: "(After the Foreign Ministry drew up the official  statement), it was referred to ruling coalition parties so as to  lay the groundwork for its approval. However, word about this  spread and turned into a controversy." He thus hinted that top  government officials, including Prime Minister Hata and Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa, failed to review the statement  sufficiently.    Even amidst rising objection in the nation to the  government's stance on the issue, the Foreign Ministry continued  to doggedly maintain its stance, saying "there is no change in  the government's legal view of the issue" (as stated by Foreign  Ministry spokesman Terasuke Terada). In the past, the  government has made it known that this was its stance not only  at Diet sessions, but also whenever it had the chance to discuss  nuclear arms issues during informal talks with allied nations  and with members of international organizations.    However, to indicate the government's stance to the ICJ via  an official document would add considerable weight to the  significance of this "stance." Moreover, as the issue of the  DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear arms has  become a serious international concern, it could have been  predicted well in advance that making public such a government  stance in the form of bureaucrats' explanation to the ruling  coalition parties would create a controversy not among  politicians, but also among the people. There are many ruling  coalition party officials who shake their heads in amazement.    When Prime Minister Hata first glanced through the  statement,  he reportedly felt that "it was hard to understand." However,  the Foreign Ministry explained that "this stance has been  repeatedly disclosed in the past," and the prime minister  accepted the explanation without further question. This is what  has complicated the matters.    This situation of letting bureaucrats take care of  government  affairs became evident again at a meeting of the lower house  Committee on Foreign Affairs on 8 June. Foreign Minister  Kakizawa was unable to make a clear answer to a question by  Tadatoshi Akiba, a member of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan, who asked: "Does this mean that if North Korea uses  nuclear weapons, you cannot say that this is a violation of  international law?"    Even though some cabinet ministers voiced objection to the  government stance on the issue of the legality of the use of  nuclear arms, a decision was made to delete the clause regarding  this stance only after deliberations at the lower house Budget  Committee meeting came to a halt over this matter. All this has  led to doubts about Prime Minister Hata's and other ministers'  leadership. Moreover, such action cannot help but give the  impression that the Hata administration has merely tried to ride  out the situation for the time being, since the government  maintains that it will not change its legal view of the issue.</p>

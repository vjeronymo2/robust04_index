			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Chance to shop around by 2002 ALL household gas consumers will be able to shop around for their supplies by the year 2002 if ministers accept the MMC's recommendation to abolish British Gas's hold over the market. They are likely to be bombarded with offers to supply their homes from among more than 30 companies competing in the new deregulated market. Packages could be as varied as mortgages. These could include long-term, fixed-rate contracts. Exact arrangements for the new system have still to be worked out - the government has yet to approve the recommendations to open the household market fully to competition. But a free market in gas might work as follows. In March 2002, the Jones household in North London might get an offer from a newly formed company in, say, Manchester to supply them more cheaply than British Gas's supply business (which by then is likely to be a separate company anyway). The Joneses choose the package they want and sign up with the new company. This will not involve changes to the pipes or meters in their home which will probably continue to be administered by British Gas's distribution business. The new company will supply the Joneses with gas pumped through the pipeline network which will still be owned by British Gas. They will then charge the Joneses. In this new world, it would even be technically possible for the Joneses to sign up with two suppliers which offer better prices at different times of the day. New electronic meters are being developed to measure consumption at short intervals, and they will be fitted with radio signalling so that they can be read from a distance. However, daily or even weekly changes of supplier were considered extremely unlikely by gas companies yesterday. 'Some people will shop around,' said Mr Stephen Gutteridge, chairman of Southern Gas. 'But I would expect most contracts will be for about a year.' Mr Malcolm Faulkner, chairman of Northern Gas, said daily settlements of bills would be too costly to administer. Monthly contracts were possible. 'Some people may want to sign up for long agreements if they think it will give them a better deal,' he said. 'It would be similar to taking out a fixed rate mortgage.' Northern and Southern Gas are arms of the regional electricity companies and were set up to take advantage of the likely deregulation of the gas market.</p>

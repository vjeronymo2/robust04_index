			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP GENERALS REPORTED SLAIN IN ETHIOPIA  </P> <P> President Mengistu Haile Mariam appeared to regain control in Ethiopia on  Friday as a four-day revolt by mutinous soldiers faded under the guns of  loyalist troops.  </P> <P> Nearly the entire high command of this Marxist government has been killed, a  Western diplomat said, in an attempted coup led by generals humiliated in a  string of recent defeats against rebels in northern Ethiopia.  </P> <P> "If we move into a 'night of the long knives,' it (the high command) will be  gutted even more," the diplomat said, "There'll be a certain amount of  retribution."  </P> <P> Despite reports of continued scattered fighting, the government confidently  said it has thoroughly smashed the rebellion.  </P> <P> Briefing foreign ambassadors in the capital Friday, Foreign Minister Berhanu  Bayeh said the revolt "was crushed at the center here in Addis Ababa" within  hours Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> Lingering resistance was stamped out Thursday when loyal soldiers of the 2nd  Army killed their "commander and his collaborators" in Asmara, Ethiopia's  second-largest city and capital of the northernmost province of Eritrea.  </P> <P> "It was a very self-confident briefing by the minister," said a Western  diplomat. "I think Mengistu has got back in the saddle. He has shown a degree  of efficiency and ruthlessness that might have surprised some."  </P> <P> But the envoy noted that the "military situation in the north is going to be  substantially eroded."  </P> <P> Mengistu's troops have been fighting secessionist rebels in Eritrea and another  rebel group seeking autonomy for the neighboring province of Tigre. But they  have consistently lost ground to the rebels, despite massive military aid from  the Soviet Union, which counts Ethiopia as its staunchest African ally.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Escape from the Himalayas: a family's ordeal - Stefan Wagstyl advises travellers to India to be prepared for surprises after his adventures in the mountains The soldier poked around in the boot and asked: 'Have you got any bombs or guns?' 'No,' replied our driver. 'Well, be on your way,' said the guard, slinging an ancient Lee Enfield rifle on his shoulder and wrapping his cloak around him to keep out the icy early morning wind. The Drass Valley, in the Himalayas in the north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, is the second coldest inhabited place on earth after Siberia. The towering mountains keep out the sun so effectively that even in summer in the narrowest parts of the valley, the snow and ice never thaw. The valley is also full of soldiers, being less than three miles in places from the disputed border with Pakistan. I had never had the slightest intention of visiting this remote and hostile territory, particularly not with my wife and three small children. But travellers in India have to allow for even the most unlikely surprises. Our adventures began with a five-day holiday in the mountain kingdom of Ladakh, lying just inside India's border with China. Most of Ladakh lies north of the Himalayas; the mountains block the rains and snows so Ladakh gets as little water as the Sahara. But there is a wild beauty about its rocky landscapes and about the bright green oases which flourish around streams and rivers, including the Indus, which flows through the heart of the region. At 11,000ft and more, the thin air is so clear that everything seems closer than it really is, making the landscapes unbelievably vivid. The first Ladakhis were Tibetan nomads who brought with them Tibetan Buddhism and a language which is closer to Tibetan than to any Indian tongue. Their white-painted monasteries cling to the mountains and their stupas and prayer stones dot the valleys like the relics of some prehistoric civilisation. Even though Leh, the Ladakhi capital, has been turned into a military base by Indian troops guarding the disputed frontiers with Pakistan and China, Ladakhi people have managed to preserve their gentle and spiritual culture. But, despite its other-worldliness, Ladakh is remarkably accessible - being only a one-hour flight from Delhi. So, a trip to Ladakh is a good way to spend a long weekend - but only if the weather is kind. For us, it was not. The sun shone from a cloudless sky for the first four days, ideal conditions for aircraft at Leh airport. But on our last day the clouds came down and showed no sign of lifting. Even though the air force keeps the airport running all year round, there is nothing it can do about the cloud. After waiting for three hours, we heard the flight was cancelled. The airport manager said the aircraft could come the next day or the next week. 'You are lucky. In winter we are sometimes closed for a month,' he added helpfully. Our hearts sank. The idea of an indefinite wait did not appeal, particularly as this was the beginning of September and the temperatures were already dropping fast from their brief summer highs. The children had already seen as many yaks as they wanted and moaned at the thought of more days in the terrestrial equivalent of outer space. The only alternative to flying was the road. A two-day trip - either west to Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, or south to Kulu, a hill station on the southern side of the mountains. Srinagar, with its political troubles did not appeal in the slightest. But the airport at Kulu is also frequently closed by bad weather. So, anxiouslywe opted for Srinagar. We stocked up with apples and chocolate and with bread and cakes from Leh's German Bakery, which is capable of turning out wonderful apple cheesecake in the most unlikely surroundings. A car was found - one of India's venerable fleet of Ambassadors, the Morris Oxford lookalikes. Regzin, the driver, promised he did not drink and had never had an accident. With considerable trepidation, we set off. The road started by winding across the long valley of central Ladakh. The clouds grew thicker and the winds blew grit and sand in all directions. We saw bedraggled-looking sheep and goats, and, at one point, a couple of foreign trekkers, huddled together under a sign proclaiming the virtues of Himanuk, the corps of army engineers who built the road. The plateau ended abruptly and the road snaked down to the Indus, through the first of many sets of hairpins we would see. No crash barriers, here or anywhere else. We winced at the sight of a truck lying upside down on the rocks below. The road is open for only six months of the year. It is closed in winter and spring when the waters released by the thaw wash away chunks of asphalt. We saw gangs of workmen repairing the roads, digging holes and breaking rocks, their faces blackened with the tar they heat on open fires. They were not Ladakhis or Kashmiris, but migrant labourers from the plains of Bihar, India's poorest state. About 1,000 miles from home, they seemed more out-of-place than we did. The Ladakhi villages we passed looked surprisingly prosperous. With their yaks, sheep and goats, their fields of barley and orchards of apples and apricots, they seemed to have learned to live well in the harsh terrain. By the afternoon of the first day, we reached the Fortula Pass, at 13,500ft, the highest point between Leh and Srinagar. The mountains here fold into even stranger and wilder formations than around Leh. There are walls of brown and yellow like those of the Grand Canyon, Dolomite-like spires of grey and black, and purple craters which might belong better on another planet. 'The moonscape viewing point,' said a sign, pointing out the obvious. Below the pass, the landscape gradually became greener and the villages larger. Among them was Mulbekh, site of a 2,000-year-old statue of Buddha carved out of a single rocky outcrop standing by the road. We stopped to stare at its enormous bulk. The priest stared back at our children, perhaps the first white children he had seen. Exhausted, we reached Kargil, the only town between Leh and Srinagar and our halt for the night. The Caravan Serai Hotel was about to close for the season. But the owner, Mr Iqbal prepared two bedrooms and a supper of lentils, rice, boiled potatoes and cauliflower. He apologised for the service, explaining that things had been better 'before the militancy'. It was the first reference we had heard to the insurgency which has left at least 10,000 dead in Kashmir since it broke out in earnest in 1989. The following day, evidence of the fighting multiplied as we crawled closer to Srinagar. Leaving Kargil, the last outpost of Buddhism, we drove into the heartland of the troubled Moslem region of Kashmir. The landscape was as spectacular as the day before, but less barren, with grass and trees on the lower slopes of the Drass Valley and the Zojila Pass, the only gateway between the heart of Kashmir and Ladakh. Our impressions were dominated by the presence of the army, which controls the route. Soldiers with machine guns man outposts along the single track road. The traffic is one-way - in the morning and early afternoon traffic it moves from Kargil to Srinagar; then the other way around. An army convoy heads the queue in each direction, spewing diesel fumes and stopping frequently to make sure that even the oldest vehicles do not get left behind. Then come taxis, buses and lorries. We drove just behind the army, staring for much of the way at the machine guns of three soldiers sitting in the last jeep. The soldiers became nervous as they reached closer to the top at the pass, scene of one of the few pitched battles of the insurgency. But even here, nature demanded as much respect as the militants. The army trucks stopped one by one for the drivers to worship at a small Hindu shrine, a memorial to dead sappers. Since the road at this point clung to the face of a 3,000ft cliff, it was, I felt, an appropriate time for prayer. Even the children were quiet for a while, awed by enormous slabs of rock, guarding this, the entrance to the Himalayas. Below the Zojila the road was easy, winding down a gentle valley to Srinagar. But the army became more and more intrusive. In 50 miles, we were stopped six times at sand-bagged checkpoints. As foreigners we were treated reasonably well, unlike the Kashmiris, who hate the soldiers as much as the soldiers seem to hate them. We saw about 20 men standing in line along the road, while soldiers searched their bus, throwing the luggage out into a roadside ditch. In the late afternoon we finally reached the lovely green lakes of Srinagar and the comfortable houseboats of Mr Ghulam Butt. After the rigours of our journey, I immediately knew what a Mughal poet meant when he said of Srinagar: 'If there is paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.' The houseboats were moored by flower-filled gardens. Kingfishers perched on the decks. Ramzan, the bearer, brought tea and home-made scones. But even here, the effects of the fighting were visible - in the empty pages of Mr Butt's visitors' book and in the rotting timbers of the boats he could no longer afford to maintain. The boatman mournfully looked at our children and said: 'Yours are the first white children I have seen in five years.'</p>

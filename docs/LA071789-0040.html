			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> VALDEZ TAKES MORE DAMAGE  </P> <P> Rough seas have caused further damage to the tanker Exxon Valdez, which  continues to leak small amounts of an unidentified substance into the ocean off  San Diego, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Heavy seas bent back three more steel  plates from the tanker's bottom, bringing the total to nine, Coast Guard Lt. Ed  Bass said. The jagged steel plates hanging from the tanker's bottom make its  draft too deep for San Diego's port where the Valdez was being towed for  repairs. The Exxon tanker, which caused the worst oil spill ever in the United  States when it ran aground in Alaska in March, has been towed to calmer waters  about 20 miles off San Clemente Island, Bass said. Despite the new damage, the  vessel is still structurally sound, an Exxon spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

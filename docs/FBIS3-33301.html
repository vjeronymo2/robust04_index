The source said members of the Simon Bolivar National  Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) detonated an explosive  device at the American School parish in Cali, the third largest  city in the country, resulting in no casualties but extensive  property damage.    The attack, the second so far this week, destroyed windows  in  the school in the capital of Valle del Cauca Department, some  400 km southeast of Santa Fe de Bogota, an official report  stated.    Last Tuesday the rebels detonated an explosive device at a  Mormon temple in Cali, causing extensive property damage.    The action is part of a campaign of attacks initiated by the  rebels last January to protest the arrival of 150 U.S. Army  soldiers from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, who are carrying out  social projects in southwestern Colombia.    The CGSB issued a communique a few days ago saying all  entities sponsored by the United States or by U.S. capital are  considered military targets. Since that time, two seminarians  from that country have been kidnapped and three Mormon temples  and educational and financial centers in the largest cities have  been attacked.    In the next few weeks, the Colombian Congress will  investigate President Cesar Gaviria to determine if he did in  fact violate the Constitution by authorizing the foreign mission  to work in the country without permission from the Legislative  Branch.    The police spokesman said security measures will be  tightened  at institutions or centers that are possible targets for attacks.    Moreover, rebel commando units torched four buses in  Medellin, some 540 km northwest of this capital, which has  frightened bus owners, many of whom have refused to provide  service.</p>

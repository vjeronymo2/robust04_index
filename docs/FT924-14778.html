			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / People: Courtaulds The reshuffle at Courtaulds following the departure of Richard Lapthorne, finance director, to British Aerospace, appears to have run its course with the appointment of Neville Petersen as head of the coatings operations in Europe. Lapthorne was replaced as finance director by Michael Pragnell, who was previously chief executive of Courtaulds coatings. Pragnell, in turn, has been replaced by Eryl Morris who now has main board responsibility for coatings which last year had a turnover of Pounds 678m and made profits of Pounds 59m. Petersen, 52, was previously group chief executive of Plascon Paints South Africa, the market leader of coatings in South Africa.</p>

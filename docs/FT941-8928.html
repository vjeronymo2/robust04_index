			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television ITV begins two new series. The Big Race records an overland car race from London to New York, the first leg taking the contestants to Moscow. Highlights, we are promised, include a journey through the Channel Tunnel and New Year's Eve in Minsk (7.30). Commando is yet another of those series that make you glad you never became a soldier. Just as every country believes it makes the best chocolate and the best knives, so every specialised military unit in the world believes its training course is the toughest. This series follows two troops of men hoping to become British Commandos (9.30). BBC1's new half-hour sitcom Nelson's Column is set in the offices of a local newspaper. Gavin Nelson (hence the title; if you think national papers are too fond of puns just look at some of the provincials) pursues local scandals and the office junior, Clare, with equal enthusiasm (8.00). Secret History offers a story about a racial purity programme in the US which sounds chilling, starting in the 1920s and not abandoned until 1972 (9.00 C4).</p>

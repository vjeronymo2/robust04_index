			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 21 Apr (MTI) -- In recent days, Slovak  press reports and officials have hinted at an imminent  Hungarian-Slovak prime ministerial meeting, to focus on the two  countries' basic treaty. Slovak sources also suggested that  they had cancelled the programme. MTI asked Foreign Affairs  Spokesman Janos Herman if the meeting is on the agenda and what  topics would be discussed.    "The Hungarian prime minister has never been unwilling to  meet his Slovak counterpart and nor is he today," Herman said.  "Preparations have been made for the summit but the Slovak side  made the event conditional on issuing a joint communique on the  topics to be fixed in the basic treaty. The Hungarian side  could not accept this," Herman said, adding, "the statement that  the summit would have focussed on the basic treaty is  misleading."    "Prime Minister Peter Boross is prepared to hold talks with  Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik to give another push to the  development of bilateral ties and pave the way for the  settlement of conflicts. Hungary, however, cannot accept  preconditions and will itself not set preconditions. Hungary is  prepared to negotiate even after Slovakia refused to accept the  European Union's proposal for a temporary water division regime  at a recent meeting between the two ministers of environment,"  Herman said.    "So Hungary regrets that the Slovak side, as they said in an  official message to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, does not  wish to take part in a working meeting. Hungary's proposal for  a foreign ministerial meeting at the opening of a border station  still stands," Herman concluded.</p>

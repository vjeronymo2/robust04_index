			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Ahmad Jamal - Jazz Miles Davis said of pianist Ahmad Jamal that he was 'knocked out by his concept of space, his lightness of touch, his understatement, and the way he phrased notes and chords and passages'. This was in 1953 and the beginning of an association that saw the late trumpet player incorporating much of the pianist's repertoire into his own. Like the tenorist Sonny Rollins, who came to Davis's attention at the same time, Jamal has always sprinkled his own compositions over a repertoire of folksy standards - they share 'Surrey With A Fringe On Top' as a favourite. Unlike Rollins, however, Jamal has traditionally dissected his preferred tunes with a lighter touch and usually in a trio setting. Forty years on, the trio remains his chosen format but the sound has become richer, denser and if Jamal's concept and use of space, which so impressed and influenced Miles Davis remains, the vortex of sound which he created on Thursday in the octagon of the Union Chapel in Islington, London, puts his spatial awareness to another, more vigorous use. Accompanied by the churning drums of Yuron Israel and the discreetly busy bass of John Heard, Jamal was in a vociferous mood. Taking material from the new disc, Live in Paris '92 (Birdology 849 408), a mixture of originals and traditionals, versions of Caravan and his own Acorn were almost torrential. Waving over his shoulder to Israel and baring his teeth approvingly at Heard, the pianist's right hand trilled transparently while the left surged thickly. Where on record the Jamal pulse is magnified by tough electric bass, it was Israel's near funky drumming that projected the trio's sound into the vaulted arches of the Union Chapel. Quotes came thick and fast, from Bizet's Carmen to bebop's Monk, the bars measured by satisfied affirmations and cries from Jamal. Rising from the piano stool to put extra weight behind crashing block chords or leaning into Heard's pre-occupied rhythm, the pianist cascaded through a short set until the flow was interrupted by an untimely intermission.</p>

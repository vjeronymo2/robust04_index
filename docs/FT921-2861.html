			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: UK's share of world trade in manufacturing is queried Sir, Samuel Brittan tells us in his comments on the Budget ('Modestly in the wrong direction', March 11) that the UK share of 'world trade in manufacturing, after decades of falling, has levelled off, or even slightly risen in the last nine years or so', and that 'UK price and cost competitiveness, after a couple of years of deterioration, have now recovered to the mid-1980s level'. Table E1 of the February issue of the Monthly Review of External Trade Statistics shows that in the latest quarter for which volume figures are available, the UK share had fallen to an all-time low of 7.3 per cent, 11 per cent less than in 1982 and 8 per cent less than in 1983. Table F8 shows that in the same quarter our trade-weighted relative export unit values were a disastrous 11 per cent higher than the average for 1984-86, despite the huge reduction in profit margins and the very substantial reduction in the relative living standards of manual workers in the import-competing and export industries, manifest in the continuing inability of industry to retain skilled labour. The postwar decline in the UK share of exports of manufactures was reversed in 1971, following the realignments of 1967-69. It resumed after the Smithsonian agreement, but that was reversed again in 1975 and in 1977 following the devaluations of 1973-4 and 1976. During the whole period an increase in relative export prices has, not surprisingly, been consistently followed by a reduction in market share, and vice versa. The monetary and exchange rate policies of successive governments and their unwillingness to impose selective and penal controls in credit, ensured that sterling was less competitive when we joined the ERM even than in 1980-1981. Relative export unit values were then 22 per cent higher than in October-December 1976, 14 per cent higher than in April-June 1979 and 36 per cent higher than in July-December 1973. Corresponding falls in market share have been 27 per cent, 19 per cent and 30 per cent. There will, and indeed can, be no recovery while sterling remains overvalued within the ERM. No system of fixed exchange rates can allocate resources efficiently in accordance with the law of comparative costs in international trade. Pricing our goods out of home and overseas markets does reduce the RPI, but, as we have seen in the Budget, that advantage has to be paid for many times over by higher taxation and/or borrowing. Sadly, we are now entering an election campaign in which these real issues and problems can't be mentioned. Perhaps only the crisis which ensues afterwards will force overvaluation and unnecessarily high interests to the forefront and force an incoming government to act. If it doesn't, deflation will become a way of life. Austin Mitchell, House of Commons, London, SW1A OAA</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Union sights fixed on 5.7% 'You cannot say we have not been flexible,' Mr Vernon Hince, senior assistant general secretary and chief negotiator of the RMT transport union, said yesterday. 'But we have to settle the interim claim for the signal workers before we can negotiate on restructuring.' On that issue he remained as unyielding as he was two months ago when the signal workers' strikes started, although he added that the union 'does not want this dispute to go on'. In the current trial of strength Mr Hince seems in no mood to back down. He believes his stance reflects the opinion of most signal workers. 'We have phone calls all the time from (them) telling us to stand firm,' he said. The rejection of the union's strike call by its signalling supervisors 11 days ago had done nothing to lessen the workers' resolve. The RMT accepted the need for restructuring the pay and working practices of the signalling staff, but would not negotiate on a comprehensive package until past productivity improvements were rewarded. He remained sceptical of the Railtrack plan to bypass the union and seek agreement on restructuring with each signal worker. Mr Hince believes a substantial number would suffer a cut in earnings under the proposals and that concessions demanded by Railtrack - such as agreement to Sunday working - would not be adequately compensated for. Even if agreement were reached on an 'up-front' payment for the signal workers there was no guarantee of agreement on restructuring. Mr Hince said that, in spite of repeated requests, Railtrack had not revealed its calculations on the cost savings it could expect from the changes it wanted in signalling staff working practices. He was emphatic that Railtrack would have to provide the signal workers with an interim payment of 'at least 5.7 per cent', the figure the union insists was on the bargaining table on June 8 before the government intervened.</p>

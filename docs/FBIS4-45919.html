			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Yielding to mounting foreign  pressure, a government energy policy advisory panel is set to  propose reviewing Japan's ambitious plan to use plutonium for  energy, government officials said Wednesday [11 May].    The proposal by the Advisory Committee for Energy will lead  to a policy shift by the Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's  top energy policy board, which is now working on reviewing  Japan's long-standing policy of hoarding plutonium.    In an interim report to be presented in early June to the  minister of international trade and industry, the committee's  subpanel on nuclear energy will propose delaying construction of  a second plant to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce  plutonium, the officials said.    "The commission's review is likely to reflect a policy  change  by the advisory panel," said a senior official at the Agency of  Natural Resources and Energy.    The official said the policy change also reflects a glut in  global uranium supply and the resulting fall in demand for  plutonium as a result of the end of the Cold War. Uranium is a  key nuclear fuel.    "With uranium prices and demand for plutonium down, it will  be hard to make ends meet given the cost of building related  facilities," he said.    Construction of the plant is a key part of Japan's program  to  develop widespread use of nuclear technology for fast-breeder  reactors that produce more plutonium than they consume.    Japan is the world's only country to continue work on  development of fast-breeder reactors and has been accused of  undermining nuclear nonproliferation as plutonium is a key  component in nuclear weapons.    Although Japan has flatly denied any intention of developing  nuclear weapons, its pro-plutonium policy has spawned  speculation that it may build its own nuclear arsenal in the  future.    The committee's subpanel report will also propose reserving  spent nuclear fuel as it is, describing it as "resources which  are temporarily reserved" for future use. Plutonium can be  extracted from spent fuel.    The proposal suggests that nuclear policymakers still weigh  the value of domestically processed plutonium and hold out  prospects for future use of plutonium.    Japan relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy needs,  with some 30 percent of the nation's electricity being generated  by 42 nuclear plants.</p>

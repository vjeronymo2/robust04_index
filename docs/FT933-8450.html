			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / University cash crisis highlighted WIDESPREAD disappointment among applicants for university places after the publication of A-level results next week will intensify pressure for universities to be given extra sources of funding. This follows a record high number of applications and a cut in government funding - particularly for arts courses - which was not announced until most universities had already made A-level offers. Next week the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals will publish a report on four alternative methods to raise extra funds for higher education. These include student loans to be repaid through income tax once students are employed, or an increase in the level of income tax applicable only to graduates. Applications to UK universities as a whole have increased by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent, while the increase for 'old' universities - those other than institutions upgraded from polytechnics last year - was 9 per cent. Yet no funding has been made available to accommodate an increase in numbers. Instead, the government cut the tuition fees it would pay for each student in 'classroom-based courses' (excluding laboratory-based and applied subjects) from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300. This decision followed a swift expansion in which the number of students in higher education increased by 46 per cent over four years. The government is now aiming for a period of 'consolidation'. As a result, according to the Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca), tutors will be 'very tight' in vetting applications and many universities will demand a much more precise match between candidates' A-level grades and the grade standard expected by the universities. While all offers of a place must be honoured if the conditions have been met, there is likely to be no flexibility in dealing with candidates who narrowly miss their offer, or who achieve the correct grades but not in the subjects stipulated. The Polytechnics Central Admissions System (PCAS), which covers the universities upgraded in the past year, said the tightening followed years of systematic 'over-recruitment'. It said several institutions had already announced that no places would be available for classroom-based courses via the clearing process. The PCAS attacked the entire admissions system as 'flawed'. Mr Tony Higgins, chief executive, said conditional offers should be abandoned in favour of a fairer system in which applicants waited for their A-level results before applying. University terms would then start in November. He said: 'Applications should be based on known, not speculative, attainments.'</p>

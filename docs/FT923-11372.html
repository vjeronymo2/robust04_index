			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / US orders for durable goods rise in June US DURABLE goods orders rose by 2.3 per cent in June, reversing the 2.2 per cent decline of the previous month and underlining the bumpy course on which the economy is now set. The monthly increase exceeded market expectations and suggests that the July industrial production figures will improve on last month's 0.3 per cent drop. Most industrial sectors shared in the increase, though transportation orders, which had fallen steeply in May, went up by less than most. Yesterday's report adds some substance to the more optimistic mid-year White House economic forecasts published on Thursday afternoon. These project real annual growth of 2.7 per cent this year, up from the 2.2 per cent estimate of January, with unemployment dropping to an average 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from the 7.8 per cent recorded in June. While these figures are pretty much in the range of many private analysts' projections, accompanying comments by administration officials were criticised for their overtly political content. Both Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, and Mr Richard Darman, budget director, claimed that if Congress had passed the president's economic proposals the economy would not be in its present problematic state. Senator James Sasser, the Democrat from Tennessee, promptly recalled the presidential veto of an economic recovery bill which contained tax increases. Some more doctrinaire Republican conservatives, led by Mr Jack Kemp, housing secretary, are urging President George Bush to 'reinvigorate' his economic proposals by calling for even steeper tax cuts, including a 50 per cent reduction in capital gains taxes. They want their blueprint included in the Republican party election platform, to be decided next month. Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress this week the economy should gain momentum soon, but that unemployment was likely to remain above 7 per cent for the rest of this year.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTICLE ABOUT PROTESTS HELD ON ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> I thought that reporters were supposed to be dispassionate and fair. The  article "Tustin Denies 2 Anti-Abortion Bids" (April 4) states that "thousands  of anti-abortion demonstrators . . . and large numbers of pro-choice  demonstrators went head-to-head at family planning clinics across the  Southland."  </P> <P> In fact, the anti-abortionists were not able to muster more than 500 people on  weekdays or 800 on the weekend. Pro-choice people (defending 90 clinics and  having to disperse their people over a wide area) equaled or outnumbered the  anti-abortionists at every clinic that was attacked.  </P> <P> Also, I have never read the names (with towns) of landlords so carefully listed  in a newspaper when the landlords had not been negligent -- in any way -- of  their property or the law. Does your reporter believe that leasing property to  a family-planning clinic is a crime? If not, why is he inviting harassment of  these innocent people?  </P> <P> SHIRLEY BERNARD  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

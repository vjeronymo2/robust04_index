Floyd On Italy is beginning to make me wonder how reliable this man's previous series were. His ideas about Italian food look more and more like English and French ideas merely projected against Italian backgrounds. It is not the Italians but the English who eat pasta smothered in meat sauce, and not the Italians but the French who begin their recipes with great dollops of butter and end with lashings of cream. Though Italian cooking varies regionally it relies almost everywhere on superb fresh ingredients, generally cooked separately, with a marked absence of fancy sauces, or indeed fancy anything. You would not gather this from the BBC2 series (8.30). Channel 4 begins a repeat of Lipstick On Your Collar, the last series by Dennis Potter to be shown before his death.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Record foreign investment in Canadian paper FOREIGN investment in Canadian securities has reached record levels in recent months, due largely to a spate of bond issues by the provinces and their agencies. Statistics Canada said yesterday that net inflows in January totalled CDollars 6bn, up from CDollars 3.6bn in December and CDollars 846m in January 1992. The surge is in sharp contrast to net outflows last autumn, when investors were unsettled by uncertainty over the referendum on a proposed new constitution. Besides the return of calm on the political front, the gap between Canadian and US long-term interest rates widened by about 25 basis points in January to 1.25 percentage points. About 70 per cent of January's inflows were channelled into new bond issues, mainly by the provinces.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / People: Sir John Banham to chair Tarmac After 15 years at the helm, Sir Eric Pountain, the colourful Black Country businessman who led Tarmac through the 1980s, is stepping down as chairman of Britain's biggest housebuilder. He will be succeeded by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England and a former director-general of the CBI. Sir John, 53, became Tarmac's deputy chairman yesterday and will take over from Sir Eric, just 60, early next year. Along with Graeme Odgers and Bryan Baker, Sir Eric built Tarmac into one of the best-managed and biggest companies in its field in the early 1980s, having taken over as chief executive in 1979 and become chairman shortly afterwards. But Tarmac's fast growth strategy faltered with the onset of the recession in the UK and US, and Tarmac was left exposed to the collapse of house prices and sales. Early last year Sir Eric agreed to relinquish day-to-day running of the group to Neville Simms, who was appointed Tarmac's chief executive. Sir John, who started his career in the Foreign Office in 1962, had been widely tipped as Sir Eric's successor. After joining McKinsey &amp; Co in 1969, he gained wide industrial experience in the US and UK over the next decade before becoming the first Controller of the Audit Commission when it was established in early 1983. He has had long-standing interests in the area of housing, from his time at the Audit Commission on education, housing and social services, and in transport infrastructure, for which he was a leading advocate of increased investment while director-general of the CBI. Yesterday he said it was 'a great privilege' to take over from Sir Eric 'during whose chairmanship Tarmac's market capitalisation increased tenfold'.</p>

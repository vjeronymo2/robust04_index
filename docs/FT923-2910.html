			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading INVESTMENT activity prompted by the devaluation of the lira and cuts in German interest rates inspired very heavy trading in the derivatives market yesterday, writes Terry Byland. In the Footsie September contract, which expires on Friday, volume had exceeded 10,000 contracts by mid-morning and went on to reach more than 18,000 by the close. At the opening, the September contract moved almost in tandem with the underlying stock market and showed only a small premium. Traders struggled to continue rolling over September contracts into the December future, the latter also attracting heavy trade. Aggressive sellers then caused a setback in the September future, which dipped to around the 2,400 mark, showing a slight discount to cash. Renewed buying interest, encouraged by the improvement in sterling, finally took the contract to a close almost in line with the cash market. Business in traded options expanded to 41,702 lots from Friday's 35,499. Turnover in the FT-SE option increased from 16,529 to 17,560. The Euro-Footsie option saw 3,558 contracts transacted. In stock options, GEC topped the actives list with 4,650 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Report expected to lambast Credit Lyonnais team The French parliament will today publish an official inquiry into the problems of Credit Lyonnais, the beleaguered banking group. The report is understood to be fiercely critical of both the regulatory authorities and of the management team led by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the bank's former chairman. Credit Lyonnais, a public-sector company which is one of Europe's biggest banks, was forced earlier this year to ask the government to support a FFr44.9bn (Dollars 8.3bn) financial rescue to repair its balance sheet, after running up a net loss for 1993 of FFr6.9bn. The government immediately formed a parliamentary committee of inquiry led by Mr Philippe Seguin, the outspoken president of the National Assembly, to investigate the causes of the bank's difficulties. Although the inquiry is believed to be critical of the French treasury for its failure to heed warnings about Credit Lyonnais, it is understood to have identified Mr Haberer as the chief architect of the bank's shortcomings. Mr Haberer, who was appointed chairman in 1988 by the then-socialist government and ousted from Credit Lyonnais last autumn by the new conservative administration, is thought to have been accused of mismanagement but cleared of any personal misappropriation of funds. French press reports suggest the inquiry is critical of Mr Haberer's draconian management style, and of the failure of his management team to make full reports to the state on Credit Lyonnais's problems. These included its exposure to MGM, the crippled Hollywood movie studio, and to Sasea, the Swiss holding company which subsequently collapsed. Mr Haberer has, since the announcement of the rescue package, been removed from his state-appointed post as chairman of Credit National, another French banking group. A number of his senior executives at Credit Lyonnais have also left the bank following the arrival last autumn of Mr Jean Peyrelevade as its new chairman. However Mr Peyrelevade, who orchestrated the FFr44.9bn rescue package, is reported to have clashed with the government over the level of provisions he plans to report for the first half of this year. Societe Generale last week forecast that Credit Lyonnais, which had initially been expected to break even in 1994, would instead report a net loss of around FFr1bn for the year.</p>

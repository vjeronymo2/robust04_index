			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Judge allows group action on cash machines A JUDGE yesterday cleared the way for a mass legal action against banks and building societies by customers claiming to have lost money through fraudulent or 'phantom' withdrawals from automated teller machines. In the first significant judgment in the 'phantom withdrawals' action, Judge John Hicks QC allowed the actions to proceed together initially. But he made clear that judgments in cases where plaintiffs claim that bank technology has allowed withdrawals from their accounts even though they had not disclosed their personal identification numbers to others would eventually be made individually in the county courts. The judge also rejected as 'misconceived' an attempt to force the organisations involved - Barclays, Midland, Lloyds, TSB and Nationwide Building Society - to write to all customers telling them of the legal case and that they could join the action. The decision extends the practice of allowing mass actions in the civil courts. Mass actions have been common in cases involving disasters or the side-effects of drugs such as Thalidomide, where there is a single cause behind the complaints. This is thought to be the first occasion a mass action has been allowed when there are several different causes. In this case, there are differences in the cash machine systems operated by the banks. The test case involves nine customers claiming the return of a total of between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 20,000. The lead case involves Mr and Mrs James McConville, from St Helens, Merseyside, who say they lost Pounds 400 after their cash card was stolen. Following the judgment Barclays Bank said that it was to test the use of cameras at six machine sites. The bank said this would aid its efforts to prevent card fraud by allowing it to identify those carrying out fraudulent withdrawals. J. Keith Park, the solicitors co-ordinating the group action, said the judgment was a victory because it would allow legal costs to be spread, and give individual claimants the confidence to pursue actions against large banks and societies. The solicitors expect a further 30 customers and at least six further defendants - NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Abbey National, Halifax and Woolwich Building Societies and Western Trust and Savings Bank - to become involved in the action. The judge said the plaintiffs could use 'any means properly open to them' to encourage other bank customers with complaints about withdrawals to join the action. Mr Nick Davis, of J. Keith Park, said the firm had received about 1,000 inquiries from people claiming to have lost amounts from Pounds 40 to Pounds 9,000. National Westminster Bank is raising charges to retailers for which it processes credit and debit card transactions. The rise - averaging 7 per cent for credit cards and 9 per cent for debit cards - follows similar rises by other banks. The bank said it was offering to waive the increases to retailers who hired machines to check transactions for fraud electronically.</p>

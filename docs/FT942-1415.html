			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Disc-based travel planner launched Travellers in the north-west of England will be able to plan bus and train journeys on their home computers following the launch of a journey planner on a disc by Cumbria County Council. The computer programme helps find the most convenient journey by giving departure, arrival and connecting times for trips within the county and to main destinations outside, such as Manchester and Glasgow. The council hopes the Pounds 2.50 disc will be used by information centres, libraries, bus operators and hotels as well as local people and visitors with access to a computer. The programme lists 980 destinations and includes the timetables of more than 80 local transport operators. If the initial scheme is successful the council plans to update the disc every six months for the public and monthly for commercial organisations. The pilot scheme has cost Pounds 8,000. Further refinements may include allowances for road works and diversions, estimated walking times in town centres and between railway platforms, and details of bus boarding points. The Cumbrian disc is the first in the UK to include both train and bus timetables. British Rail has produced a disc of its nationwide timetables for the two past years, which sells about 4,000 copies at each six-monthly update, mainly to large companies. Individual copies cost Pounds 41 or Pounds 45 depending on the system used. Disc-based journey planners are used by the railways in the Netherlands, Norway, Finland and Denmark, and by two Danish bus companies. A disc covering all forms of public transport is available in the Netherlands.</p>

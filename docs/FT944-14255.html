			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Dollar faces renewed pressure The dollar may come under further pressure this week after reaching a post-war low against the yen in Friday's Asian trading. However early today in Tokyo the US currency was steady, trading around the Y97.4 level. The main obstacle for the US currency appears to be lack of investor confidence in the ability of US monetary authorities to act quickly enough to control inflationary pressures. Mr Avinash Persaud, analyst at J. P. Morgan, the investment bank, in London, said: 'There are clear signals that the US economy is growing faster than its long-term trend, while real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are below their trend.' With US mid-term elections due on November 8, traders expect the Federal Reserve to wait until its next open-market committee meeting on November 15 before raising rates. 'The market has taken the view that the Fed is leaving it too late if it waits,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, the Japanese bank. Even if the Fed does increase rates by half a point in November, analysts fear that may not be enough. 'There is a growing perception that we may need two further Fed increases before the end of the year,' Mr Hannah said. The Fed has so far pushed through five rate rises this year, taking the Fed funds rate from 3 per cent to 4.75 per cent. The possibility of central bank intervention to support the dollar last week prompted apparently conflicting remarks from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's under-secretary of international affairs. The leading economic statistic of the week - US third-quarter gross domestic product growth - will not be published until Friday. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist in London with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'The first four trading days will be a very good test of sentiment. If the dollar is to stabilise, it has the chance to do so in this data vacuum.' The dollar closed in New York on Friday at Y97.235 and DM1.50025, having touched Y96.5 and DM1.4880 in Tokyo.

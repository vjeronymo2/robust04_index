			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Gianfranco Fini, secretary general </F> of the National Alliance, by Yosi Bar in Rome on 15 June]    [Text] Ever since the Italian neofascist party joined the  coalition -- which sparked sharp protests not only in Israel but  also in Europe and the United States -- party leader Gianfranco  Fini has been courted by numerous correspondents, including  Israelis. Yesterday he granted YEDI'OT AHARONOT an interview.    Right at the beginning of the interview, Fini attempted to  improve his party's image and to shake off the term  "neofascist." "I am a rightist," he said. "I invented the term  `postfascist' only to help the reporters out."    Before the elections, Fini scored a major success in  improving his party's image by, among other things, giving it a  new name, suggesting its dissociation from its fascist past.  The trick worked, and the party (the National Alliance) scored  a fine achievement in the elections, joined the coalition, and  received five portfolios.    The Israeli Government was enraged and has decided to  boycott  the neofascist ministers in all forums until it is convinced  that they do not support anti-Semitic and racist stands.  Referring to this, Fini told YEDI'OT AHARONOT: ``I understand  Israel. It is the only country in the world I understand very  well, but my party members were elected democratically.    "I hope to pass the test put to us by Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres and the Israeli Government. It is only fair that  Israel should scrutinize the rightist ministers of the Italian  Government. It is your moral right. We will prove that we are  not in the least anti-Semitic or racist."    The leader of the right wing, as he calls himself, condemned  anti-Semitism, saying that Mussolini's racist laws were the  cause of many "atrocities." According to him, he supported  turning over Nazi criminal Erich Friebke who fled to Argentina,  and, along with left-wing activists, he even signed a petition  urging that Friebke be put on trial. He stressed that he has  severed his ties with Le Pen, the leader of the French extreme  right, and has reservations regarding the German Republikaner  party, which he defines as a neo-Nazi party.    "I have many Jewish friends who voted for me," he said,  adding jokingly: "How can I, with my crooked nose, be an  anti-Semite"?    Fini believes that there is no fear of a new wave of  anti-Semitism erupting in West Europe but cautions.  "Anti-Semitic winds are blowing in from East Europe," he  claimed.    Fini said that, as a child, he went with his parents to  visit  the Mauthausen concentration camp and witnessed the atrocities  of the Nazi regime. He promises to use an iron fist to curb the  extreme factions in his party.    "I can assure you," he said at the end of the interview,  "that the fact that the right is part of the Italian Government  will not impair its good relations with Israel. Previous  Italian Governments supported you in word; we will support you  in deed."</p>

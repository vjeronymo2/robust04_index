			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EBRD loan for car plant in Hungary THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) yesterday extended a DM125m (Pounds 43.5m) loan to help finance a new joint venture in Hungary, which amounts to the largest direct foreign investment in the country, and the bank's single largest loan to date. General Motors Hungary (GMH), a joint venture formed by General Motors, Raba, the state-owned manufacturer, and the State Development Institution, a state financial body, will help finance a DM501m engine manufacturing and car assembly plant in Szentgotthard, western Hungary, close to the Austrian border. General Motors will hold two-thirds of the shares. An EBRD banker said the deal would help 'upgrade' Hungary's manufacturing and industrial base. GMH aims to produce engines for General Motors Europe car assembly plants in Spain, Germany, the UK and Belgium. It also plans to assemble Opel Astra cars for the Hungarian market. The new plant begins operations later this year, will create 600 new jobs, and at full capacity, will assemble 15,000 Opel Astras, and 200,000 engines annually.</p>

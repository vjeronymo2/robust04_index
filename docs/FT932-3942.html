			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / French luxury goods maker's shares fall on profit warning LVMH, the French luxury goods company, yesterday warned of a reduction in net profits for the first half of 1993. Its shares fell on the announcement, closing down FFr27 at FFr3,683. The group, which owns Moet-et-Chandon champagne, Louis Vuitton luggage and the Christian Lacroix fashion house, made FFr1.3bn (Pounds 150m) in the first six months of last year. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that full-year net profits would nevertheless at least match those of 1992, when it made FFr3bn on sales of FFr21.7bn. The LVMH warning comes against a background of intense pressure on the luxury goods industry because of global recession and a shift in consumer taste away from the ostentatious values of the 1980s. Dunhill, the British group behind Mont Blanc pens and the Karl Lagerfeld fashion business, last week announced lower profits for last year. Mr Arnault said group sales had risen 4.5 per cent in the first five months of this year. He attributed the profits fall to the depressed economic environment and problems in the champagne market. Producers have been hit by poor sales and high grape prices. LVMH recently announced the first-ever job losses at Moet-et-Chandon, its flagship champagne house, triggering protests from the workforce last week. Mr Arnault said LVMH would fell the impact of the weak pound on its income from Guinness, the UK drinks group where it is a 24 per cent investor. Last year's cut in the Guinness contribution (to FFr681m from FFr1.1bn in 1991) was one of the main reasons for the overall decline in LVMH's net profits to FFr3bn from FFr3.7bn. LVMH, which has net debt of FFr14.5bn, expects to benefit from recent falls in French interest rates. Mr Patrick Houel, finance director, said the group would save FFr60m a year for every 1 per cent rate cut. Background, Page 20</p>

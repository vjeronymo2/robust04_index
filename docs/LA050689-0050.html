			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOSE CARRERAS REPAYS A PERSONAL DEBT IN SEATTLE  </P> <P> He came back. He sang. He conquered.  </P> <P> The drama at the Seattle Opera House on Thursday involved an opera star. But  the event wasn't an opera.  </P> <P> Actually, the plot resembled a soap opera. It stretched credibility right up to  the seemingly happy end. But this was non-fiction.  </P> <P> This was a drama of bravery bolstered by idealism and sensitivity. This, if you  will, was the Jose Carreras story.  </P> <P> Carreras, whose popularity places him right after Luciano Pavarotti and Placido  Domingo in the international supertenor sweepstakes, was stricken late in 1987  with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The prognosis was not encouraging.  </P> <P> After consulting medical experts in his native Barcelona, Carreras decided to  undergo the rigors of an autologous bone-marrow transplant at a pioneering  facility in Seattle, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. When he was  released, 14 months ago, he promised to return to sing a benefit recital for  the institution that apparently had saved his life.  </P> <P> Thursday night, with a little help from the Seattle Opera, he made good on that  promise. Having ventured a dozen concert appearances in Europe, he chose this  city for his American comeback. Engagements in New York and Washington are  scheduled later this month.  </P> <P> No one knew quite what to expect when Carreras made his brisk, self-effacing  entrance. Everyone was prepared to be indulgent. Standing ovations and floral  tributes were foregone conclusions.  </P> <P> The hero, now 42, looked a bit gaunt and pale. His courtly manner was  contradicted by a scruffy Don Johnson beard-in-progress, cultivated no doubt to  camouflage a recent bout with chicken pox. Even with the leukemia in remission,  his immune system remains severely compromised.  </P> <P> When he began to sing, it became clear to 3,000 adoring fans -- many of whom  had paid $100 for a ticket -- that Carreras would require no apologies. This  program would be an artistic experience, not just a sentimental exercise.  </P> <P> If anything, his voice sounded fresher, brighter, more sensuous and more  lustrous than it had been just before his illness. This was one advantageous  byproduct of the enforced period of rest.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, Carreras had confounded even his most doting admirers by  assuming heavyweight roles that threatened severe vocal damage. Having  persuaded the lyric tenor to undertake Radames in "Aida," Herbert von Karajan  next wanted him to attempt an even more dubious challenge: Verdi's Otello. The  result could have been disastrous, a replay of the pathetic Giuseppe di Stefano  saga.  </P> <P> On this blissful occasion, Carreras certainly did not sound like a tenor in any  kind of trouble. Wisely, he avoided arias and concentrated on a relatively easy  agenda of songs. Deftly accompanied by Lorenzo Bavaj, he performed them  exquisitely.  </P> <P> Apart from one smashing B-flat at encore time, he avoided stratospheric  flights. No matter. He sang with abiding pathos, disarming charm, considerable  finesse.  </P> <P> A critical churl might have noted a weak trill in the bel-canto repertory or  some distortions of the French idiom in obligatory melodies of Faure and  Duparc. Such passing blemishes seemed irrelevant, however, in light of  Carreras' expressive eloquence.  </P> <P> It will be impossible to forget the suavity with which he delineated Bellini's  "Malinconia" or the perfectly tapered pianissimo phrases with which he ennobled  the sentiment of Tosti's "Ideale." Few singers can equal his poise and passion  in music of Turina and Falla.  </P> <P> His command of the telling nuance and his ability to spin endlessly graceful  legato phrases elevates even a vulgar indulgence to high art. He can turn a  simple canzone such as Tosti's "Non t'amo piu" into a study of bittersweet  ardor.  </P> <P> To close the formal portion of the program, Carreras offered some Puccini  teasers: "Solo e amore," which foreshadows the "Boheme" quartet, and "Menti  all'avviso," which invokes "Donna non vidi mai" in "Manon Lescaut." These  subtle previews served as intriguing down payments on his return to bona fide  opera.  </P> <P> May it be soon. May it even take him to Los Angeles. He has come a long way  since he sang a cautious Cavaradossi to the steely Tosca of Birgit Nilsson at  the Music Center in 1974.  </P></p>

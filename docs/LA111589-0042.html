			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> CALABASAS TAKES SINGLE-MINDED APPROACH IN 10-8 QUARTERFINAL VICTORY  </P> <P> Natasha Pospich, Stacy Jellen and Alison Paris -- possibly the Southern  Section's top singles trio -- swept their matches Tuesday to lift Calabasas  High over Westlake, 10-8, in a 3-A Division tennis quarterfinal match at  Westlake Village Racquet Club.  </P> <P> Calabasas (15-0), the fifth-seeded team, won just one doubles match in  defeating the fourth-seeded Warriors (21-1).  </P> <P> "I figured Natasha and Stacy would be untouchables," Westlake Coach Connie  Flanderka said. "If we got any of those games, it would just be icing on the  cake."  </P> <P> Jellen and Paris each lost four games in three matches. Pospich, a junior who  has lost just four games all season, won her three matches by 6-0 scores.  </P> <P> The wins came as no surprise to Pospich.  </P> <P> "I know these people," she said. "I've played almost all of them in tournaments  so I knew I could beat them."  </P> <P> Calabasas Coach Bill Belatty says that his top two players assure the Coyotes  of six points.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to find a one-two punch like Natasha and Stacy," he said.  </P> <P> The Coyotes were, however, considerably weaker in doubles. Alyse Bartelstone  and Alison Levitt, Westlake's No. 3 team, defeated Samantha Meo and Tracy  Paris, 6-2, Melissa Pifko and Jenny Gilbert, 6-3, and Faye Reisman and Jenny  Rabin, 6-1.  </P> <P> Westlake's Kim Stewart and Ari Kia also won all three of their doubles matches,  one by default.  </P> <P> Calabasas will play top-seeded Capistrano Valley, a 12-6 winner over Laguna  Hills, in the semifinals Thursday at a site to be determined.  </P> <P> In another Southern Section match:  </P> <P> Katella 13, Louisville 5 -- The Royals (19-3) were eliminated in the 2-A  quarterfinal match at home as No. 1 singles player Maureen Sifferman was  defeated in three matches, 7-5, 6-1, 6-1.  </P> <P> City Section  </P> <P> Taft 7, University 0 -- Julie Koppekin, Taft's No. 1 singles player recorded a  victory in a 4-A Division quarterfinal at The Racquet Center in Universal City.  </P> <P> Taft will play Fairfax, a 4-3 winner over Grant, in a semifinal match Thursday.

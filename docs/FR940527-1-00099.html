			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This results in a net update recommendation of 0.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with ProPAC's recommendation not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose a payment rate increase for dialysis services. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 audited data support this decision. As the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out, these data show that independent renal facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composite payment rates are higher than their Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable costs, while hospital renal facilities continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report costs in excess of their payment rates. The audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not provide an explanation for the higher reported costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hospital renal facilities relative to independent renal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. However, auditors found that hospital renal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities often fail to maintain adequate records for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation costs in the renal department. Since hospitals'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are not affected by renal cost reports, Supplement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Worksheet I of HCFA&hyph;2552, hospitals do not always complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their cost reports accurately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although we realize the importance of regular renal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits, the budget for audits continues to decline. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not plan to conduct renal audits in 1994 or 1995. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have requested funds to conduct renal audits in 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During this 2-year interval, we would review the 1992 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 cost report data for those renal facilities in the 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that this analysis will provide cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about the ESRD program in lieu of audited data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these years. Furthermore, it will provide a basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzing cost data over time and allow for better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison of audited and unaudited costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Nursing Facility Wage Index (Recommendation 17)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary should collect data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee compensation and paid hours of employment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees of nursing facilities that care for Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients. Once these data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become available, the Secretary should develop a nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility wage index and use it to adjust Medicare skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing facility payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In recommending an adjustment to SNF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, we presume that ProPAC is referring to the SNF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost limits. We agree that HCFA should collect the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to develop a SNF wage index. In the conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report on OBRA 1993, the conferees indicated an expectation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA collect such data (H.R. Rep. No. 2264, 103d Cong.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1st Sess. 747 (1993)). However, we do not believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent to recommend implementing a SNF wage index to adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SNF cost limits until the accuracy of those data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the resulting wage index have been thoroughly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed. Under current Medicare rules, most SNFs are paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their reasonable costs for routine services subject to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost limit. The current methodology for computing the SNF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routine service cost limits utilizes the hospital wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to account for geographic variations in wages. Only about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35 percent of facilities have costs at or above these cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have maintained that, because hospitals and SNFs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally compete for employees in the same labor market,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one would expect that the relationship of hospital area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average wages to hospital national average wages would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fairly represent the relationship of SNF area average wages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to SNF national average wages. Therefore, we believe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital wage index is an accurate mechanism for adjusting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SNF routine service cost limits for geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations in wages. While certain limited studies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that a SNF-specific wage index may be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate, no substantial empirical data have been offered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refute our policy. The study undertaken by ProPAC utilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only limited data to develop a simulated wage index. Due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limited scope of this study, we believe it is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient basis for refuting the accuracy of the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index relative to SNF wages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We plan to begin collecting SNF wage data for potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in the development of a SNF wage index. These data will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help us answer two important questions related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a SNF wage index. The first is whether SNFs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are smaller than hospitals and have less sophisticated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting systems, can develop and provide accurate wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index data on a national basis. If such data can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided, our second question is whether differences between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resulting wage index and the hospital wage index would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be significant enough to justify the increased Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs involved and the increased reporting and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection burden on SNFs (especially small and rural SNFs),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fiscal intermediaries, and HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of SNF wage data also will allow us to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the potential impact of a SNF wage index on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments to individual SNFs. A change in the wage index may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favorably impact SNFs in some areas while it may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantage SNFs in other areas (possibly significantly),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even within the same State. While this latter point is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reason to avoid the use of a SNF wage index, it does point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out the absolute necessity for collecting accurate wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index data from SNFs for construction of the wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our experience with the development of a home health agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HHA) wage index is also relevant. In 1988, HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented an HHA-specific wage index based on data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from HHAs. Subsequently, HCFA and Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received numerous complaints from providers concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden that the reporting requirements posed and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy of the data. As a result, Congress retroactively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repealed its mandate for use of the HHA wage index and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required continued use of the hospital wage index. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused great confusion among both providers and fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until SNF wage data have been collected and examined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe it is premature to recommend their use for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment of either the SNF cost limits or any future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system that may require a wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Improving Outlier Payment Policy (Recommendation 18)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes the outlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1993 will improve the current policy for identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlier cases and determining outlier payments under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system. However, the following changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also should be implemented for FY 1995:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The estimated cost of the case and the outlier payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount should no longer be adjusted to reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's indirect medical education and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate share status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The marginal cost factor for cost outliers should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased to 80 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes would further increase the effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of outlier payment in protecting against the risk of large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses on some cases. They would also improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of outlier payments across hospitals, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that receive a large number of transfer cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission's first recommendation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to improving outlier payment policy concerns the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology we use to determine whether the cost of a case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the cost outlier threshold. ProPAC is asking that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare no longer standardize hospital costs to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of the indirect costs of medical education (IME) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the costs associated with serving a disproportionate share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of low income patients (DSH). The effect of standardizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hospital's charges to remove the effects of their IME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and DSH adjustments is to lower the ``costs'' of cases, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of applying the cost outlier threshold, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teaching and disproportionate share hospitals relative to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We responded to this same recommendation in our May 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30255). In that response, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that sections 1886(d)(5)(B)(i) and 1866(d)(5)(F)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act require that we pay hospitals for IME and DSH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with their outlier payments. Given this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirement, we believe it would be inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement the Commission's recommendation without a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change to the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yi Song-yol] </F>   [Text] No other government agency has recently gained more  weight than the Ministry of Environment as Koreans are becoming  more and more environment-conscious with the aggravating water  and air pollution.    In a bid to enhance the ministry's authority to control tap  water for example the ministry recently absorbed three sections  from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the  Construction Ministry.    Now the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the  maintenance of clean water from reservoirs to the tap of each  household.    The measure has been taken as the government has come to see  more than ever before the importance of supplying clean water  after the nationwide shock over contamination of the Naktong  River and several other important sources of drinking water.    But as purifying water for potable use is a very expensive  business, the ministry has decided to transfer it to the private  sector and industrial companies will gradually be directly  responsible for treating their own waste.    It means that the government will allow state-run  corporations or private companies to participate in the  operation of water purification plants, ministry official say.    Sophisticated equipment will be installed at filtration  plants at the lower streams of the Naktong and three other  rivers to supply safer tap water, according to a ministry  project.    As Environment Minister Pak Yun-hun has put it, the measure  to allow state-run corporations and private firms to participate  in running water purification plants is intended to permit more  experts to manage water quality.    Presently, water filtration plants are under the control of  the government. Most of the state-run water purification  facilities are manned by about 15 government employees, of whom  only two to three have the qualifications to be classified as  professional technicians.    "It is of utmost importance that qualified manpower be  assigned to deal with water treatment processes and the only way  that this can be financed is by transferring the business to the  private sector," Minister Pak says.    He hints, however, that this will likely increase the  charges  for tap water and that there's no other way to deal with the  situation since the government is suffering from a huge deficit  by carrying out the purification on its own.    The delegation of the business to private sector will only  be  effectuated on condition that the management structure is  completely overhauled so that no additional monitoring will be  required to ensure the highest rate of potability.    At the same time, the ministry is to map out plans to  introduce environmental taxes, issue bonds and instant lottery  tickets as a means of raising funds necessary to finance various  environmental improvement projects.    On the issue of waste treatment, industrial facilities  across  the nation will be told to equip themselves to deal with their  own waste instead of relying on government-run treatment plants.    At the same time, both individuals and enterprises failing  to  conform to regulation on the dissipation of garbage in public  places will be subject to heavy fines on the spot, the ministry  has decided.    But the ministry is to relax various regulations on the  installation of related facilities, including incinerators, so  that the industrial companies can cope with their waste and  reduce pollution at the point of its generation.    On the private side, greater efforts will be made to  encourage residents to actively participate in the separate  waste disposal system for maximizing the rate of recycling.    The initiation of garbage collection and treatment charges  in  accordance with the amount generated, which started in April,  plays a powerful role in enhancing the awareness of the public  in the role that they must play in protecting the environment,  ministry officials note.    Minister Pak has said his ministry will help government  officials and civic groups to jointly monitor the quality of  water. The ministry also plans to support campaigns sponsored  by the environmental groups to protect clean water.    "Also of substantial importance will be the launching of  joint surveillance groups among the government and civic  organization to maintain close watch on the quality of water,"  Pak says.    He says his ministry plans to invest about 30 billion won  this year to develop environmental technology, and will also  work out steps for the Green Round of multilateral talks, which  is expected to impose tougher environmental regulations on  Korean businesses.    He says the government seeks to sign agreements with  advanced  countries such as the United States, Japan and France to launch  joint research into environmental technology.    A ministry task force has visited the United States and  other  advanced countries in February to study recent trends in  environmental protection in those countries.    The ministry will also provide training programs on  environmental technology to officials from Asian countries like  China and Thailand.</p>

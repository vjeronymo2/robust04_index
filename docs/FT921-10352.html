			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Exports of Scotch earn record Pounds 1.8bn SCOTCH WHISKY exports earned a record Pounds 1.83bn last year, an increase of 7 per cent on the Pounds 1.71bn overseas sales in 1990. Exports to the rest of the European Community rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 717m, accounting for 39 per cent of worldwide sales. Mr Bill Bewsher, director-general of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the figures underlined the importance of the EC market to the industry and emphasised the need for a robust stand by the government to ensure fair tax treatment. Recent EC tax harmonisation proposals threatened to raise whisky prices, particularly in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, which accounted for half of export earnings from the EC last year. Sales to those four countries increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 364m. Mr Bewsher said: 'It is essential for the long-term well-being of the industry's exports that the government negotiate strongly to reduce and eventually eliminate the substantial discrimination which Scotch whisky faces in the EC. 'There is a real need to ensure that not only does Scotch whisky suffer no disadvantage in its major market, but that the wrong signal is not sent to the other 175 countries in which it is sold.' Export volumes to the EC increased by 1 per cent but declined worldwide by slightly more than 4 per cent to 227.75bn litres of pure alcohol. Brands bottled in Scotland were resilient to difficult trading conditions, exacerbated by the Gulf war in the early part of the year. Overseas volume sales of those brands declined only 2 per cent and earnings increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.49bn.</p>

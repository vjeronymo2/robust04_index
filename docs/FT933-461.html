			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Cases Lautro tries to prevent THE TYPE of cases Lautro is trying to prevent: A couple take on a five-year interest-only loan. At the end of five years, they will have to find the cash to pay the capital balance. An enterprising insurance sales agent, following the principle that suitability means the most suitable product sold by his company, signs up the couple for a 10-year savings policy intended to pay off the loan. His company simply does not offer a five-year product. This is a real example, and not surprisingly, when the loan matured, the savings policy could not pay it off. Lautro also cites the case of a young man in temporary employment who was sold a long-term savings plan. 'There was no evidence on the fact-find that the investor wished to save for that period; indeed, he appeared unlikely to be able to maintain any rate of savings commitment,' Lautro noted. In similar vein, Lautro notes the case of a divorcee who wished to invest Pounds 15,000 in a school fees plan for the education of her three sons. The sum fell far short of what would be needed to cover fees, but the adviser placed her investment in a highly volatile Japanese fund. Although returns in some previous years had been extremely rewarding, the woman could well have been forced to cash the investment in during a severe downcycle. Thus, the investment was unsuitable. These are among several examples cited by Lautro of sales of unsuitable products. The life insurance industry has maintained for years that the sale of unsuitable products is rare and that most people do obtain best advice.</p>

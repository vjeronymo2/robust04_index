			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / G7 'must give aid to Russia before referendum' THE Group of Seven western industrialised nations could and should put together a package of aid measures for Mr Boris Yeltsin's Russian economic reforms before April 25, the day of his Russian referendum, according to a senior German official. Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the ministry of finance in Bonn and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 'sherpa' for the G7 world economic summit, told a Washington audience that the target was necessary to give 'effective and visible support' to the Russian reform plans. He was speaking shortly before Japan confirmed meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers will be held in Tokyo on April 14 and 15, after the bilateral summit between President Bill Clinton and President Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3 and 4. Japan also announced that Mr Yeltsin will be invited to attend the G7 summit in Tokyo in July, a move immediately welcomed by other members of the group, including the UK and Germany, as a visible sign of western support for the embattled president. Officials in Bonn believe the G7 negotiators can come up with a three part package, including a deal for extremely close co-operation and monitoring of the Russian reform programme on a weekly, if not daily basis. The first part of the package would be the acceleration of payments from the Dollars 24bn package put together by the last G7 summit in Munich last July, relatively little of which has so far been disbursed. I The second part will be a micro-economic package of measures designed to bring western aid directly to the Russian population. Included are plans to develop new 'pilot islands' of privatisation and reform programmes, such as Nizhni Novgorod, financed by the World Bank, and Vladimir, where Germany is involved. The third part of the package, the officials say, would be to set up a mechanism for close co-ordination with the Russian government, through Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and now finance minister. The idea is to monitor the Russian reforms as closely as a central bank might monitor an ailing bank in a financial crisis, and to bring Mr Fyodorov into almost day-to-day contact with the western finance ministries to support his programmes.</p>

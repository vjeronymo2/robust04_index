			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] Legislators have rejected a call to offer China  additional funds for the new airport as a last-ditch bid to  break the Sino-British impasse over airport financing. The  Legislative Council [Legco] last night voted 23-18 against the  Liberal Party's proposal calling on the government to consider  further funding on top of the $60.3 billion it has already  offered China for the $158 billion project.    Legislators also failed to reach consensus on calls for the  government to submit its fourth airport financing package to  Legco for approval. But there was cross-party support for an  early resolution of the airport funding row, which could delay  completion of Chek Lap Kok Airport until after 1997.    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said it was too early  to preempt China's decision by offering more funds. "Would the  taxpayer think it is in his best interest?" he said. "We need  to strike a sensible balance. The need now is to get on with  talks on the fourth financing proposal."    British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials have been meeting  to discuss the funding package. But Sir Hamish said they did  not expect the long-awaited meeting of the Sino-British airport  committee to take place for some time. He said China was still  seeking details of the financing package before making a final  decision.    Sources say the government is willing to inject more equity  into the airport in order to reach agreement with China.    Liberal Party legislator Steven Poon said an early agreement  was vital for Hong Kong's future and the government should not  delay by arguing over equity injection.    Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said Hong Kong was  losing billions of dollars because flights were being turned  away from the overcrowded Kai Tak airport.    With the government estimating that Hong Kong's reserves  will  reach $120 billion by March 1997, Mr Poon said it could easily  afford more money for the airport.    But the United Democrats opposed the move and called on  legislators to condemn both the British and Chinese Governments  for turning the airport into a political issue.    Meeting Point legislator Fred Li said both Britain and China  were embroiled in political wrangling, ignoring the views of  Hong Kong people. His motion, which called on the government to  submit its funding plan for public debate through Legco, was  defeated by a narrow margin when council president John Swaine  had to cast the deciding vote.</p>

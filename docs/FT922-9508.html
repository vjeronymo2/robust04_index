			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Corsican stadium disaster French policemen carry an injured soccer fan to a helicopter after the Corsican stadium disaster on Tuesday in which 700 spectators were injured. French authorities said 10 people were killed when the stadium collapsed, near Bastia, but the regional prefect's office and public prosecutor put the figure at 26. The International Football Federation (Fifa) is now likely to ban temporary football stands made of tubular scaffolding, writes Ian Davidson from Paris.</p>

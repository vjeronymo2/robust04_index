			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bardon in the black with Pounds 2.1m at midway Bardon Group, the international aggregates and ready mix concrete company, yesterday announced details of a large new loan facility and management reorganisation as it published its first profits for 2 1/2 years. The company, which had net borrowings of Pounds 239m at the end of June, representing gearing of 69 per cent, said that it had agreed a Dollars 350m (Pounds 226m) four-year syndicated banking facility, stabilising its finances. Most of Bardon's borrowings are in the US. The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m on turnover of Pounds 140m in the first six months of this year, compared with a loss of Pounds 59.5m from turnover of Pounds 160.5m in the first half of 1993, when it wrote down by Pounds 60m the value of its UK sand and gravel dredging business. Operating profits rose by 10 per cent in the first half to Pounds 10.1m, thanks to a strong performance from its UK businesses which had increased profits by a third to Pounds 8.4m. Profits at the US arm, however, fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 900,000 due to bad winter weather which had restricted construction activity, and a delay in approving finance for the Massachusetts road programme. Bardon said that it had removed the divisional management structure of its UK and US businesses to shorten reporting lines, improve efficiency and reduce costs. These businesses would in future report direct to Mr Peter Tom, the chief executive. It had been agreed that Mr Stuart Lamb, previously US divisional chief executive, would leave the group shortly. The improvement in the group's finances meant that the pressure to sell businesses to reduce borrowings had been removed, said Mr Tom. An attempt to sell the UK aggregates dredging business - it is thought to Minorco - fell through last year. The UK businesses, including the dredging operations, were now benefiting from increased sales volume and higher prices as UK construction activity had risen. Prices also had risen in the US, but coated roadstone volumes in Massachusetts were significantly lower. Losses per share emerged at 0.1p (16.2p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.8p. COMMENT Massachusetts has tripped the group again, marring an otherwise good trading performance. Bardon's finances may be stabilised, but it is difficult to see how borrowings can be reduced to a manageable level from trading alone. A sale may yet be needed, but this can be at a time and price more of Bardon's choosing. A prospective yield of approaching 6 per cent on a maintained final dividend and a net asset value of about 65p should underpin the share price, which fell 2p to 43p yesterday. However, pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m this year and Pounds 28m next, putting Bardon on prospective multiples of 21 and approaching 15, indicates that this rating is unlikely to improve while borrowings remain high.</p>

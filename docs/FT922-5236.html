			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Observer: Durlacher's turn No prizes for predicting who will succeed David Burton as chairman of Liffe. Nick Durlacher, chairman of BZW Futures and Liffe's deputy chairman since 1988, would be entitled to feel miffed if he didn't get the job tomorrow. Burton, Liffe's longest-serving chairman, has presided over a period which has seen average daily volume surge from 61,000 lots in 1988, to over  1/4 m today. A soft-spoken Lancastrian with a passion for antique glass, it was hard at first to see how he could match his flamboyant predecessor, Brian Williamson (now chairman of Gerrard &amp; National). But the former chief dealer at Bank of America has done equally well. Given the combination of the family name and the backing of Barclays, it might seem that Durlacher is getting the Liffe chairmanship, rather than Jack Wigglesworth, for example, just because it's his turn. Not so, say his fans pointing to his hard work in areas such as compliance. Even so, when Liffe chief executive Michael Jenkins retires later this year  -after an accomplished decade at the top - it is important that he is replaced from outside. Futures are an arcane but by no means impenetrable subject - a head for deltas and stop-losses is not really such a rare commodity as the combination of management and marketing skill needed if Liffe is to enjoy an equally prosperous second decade.</p>

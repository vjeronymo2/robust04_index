			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE HARD LIFE AND TIMES OF BOB PROBERT  </P> <P> Bob Probert's arrest Thursday for allegedly smuggling cocaine into the United  States was another wretched episode in the life of a man seemingly bent on  self-destruction.  </P> <P> Rumors that his problems went beyond alcohol abuse had long been circulating  around the National Hockey League and scared off several teams that were  interested in acquiring him from the Detroit Red Wings for his size and brute  strength; it's unlikely he will play in the NHL again.  </P> <P> The Red Wings' tolerance of his outrageous disregard for curfews and  regulations created a huge rift because it established one set of rules for  Probert and another for everyone else. And the distraction of wondering whether  he would show -- and what shape he'd be in if he did -- dragged the Wings down  all season. They should be better than their record, barely above .500, shows.  Look for them to take off now that they don't have to worry about him and his  problems.  </P> <P> The Red Wings' organization helped Probert immensely by sending him through  various alcohol rehabilitation programs during the last two years and keeping  him on the payroll.  </P> <P> They may have done too much. Probert ultimately has to be responsible for  himself, and he is either incapable or unwilling to accept that. It's sad to  see anyone apparently tumble into the trap of drug abuse, but Probert walked in  with his eyes open and after being given more chances of rescue than most  people.  </P> <P> There should be a flurry of activity up until Tuesday's trading deadline. But  don't believe the Denis Savard trade rumors. He's going to stay in Chicago  because he's simply too valuable an offensive weapon and because if he gets  hot, he might lead the Blackhawks through two Norris playoff rounds.  </P> <P> Here are some people who might have new addresses:  </P> <P> Winnipeg center Dale Hawerchuk is being ardently sought by several teams. The  most persistent rumor has the Philadelphia Flyers landing him in exchange for  left winger Brian Propp, center Dave Poulin and a draft pick.  </P> <P> Hawerchuk would be a tremendous addition to a corps that includes Ron Sutter  and Keith Acton. But Philadelphia can't afford to trade away wingers, so Propp,  who is playing well, may not be dealt.  </P> <P> The Flyers and Buffalo Sabres are looking for goaltenders. Quebec's Mario  Gosselin might fit the bill in Philadelphia, and Buffalo may get Toronto's Ken  Wregget.  </P> <P> The St. Louis Blues and Jets discussed a deal that would send defenseman Brian  Benning and center Tony Hrkac to Winnipeg for veteran defenseman Randy Carlyle  and winger Andrew McBain. Bad deal for St. Louis. General Manager Ron Caron,  who seems to make 90% of his trades with Montreal and 9% with Calgary, can do  better if he needs help on defense.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Kings would like a defensive-oriented defenseman and have asked  the Toronto Maple Leafs about Borje Salming. They have few draft picks left to  give, though, and to give up another young player would be most foolish.  </P> <P> Edmonton General Manager Glen Sather reportedly wants Walt Poddubny (whom he  had briefly), Michel Goulet or Peter Stastny from Quebec. His best shot is  Poddubny, who wouldn't mind leaving the French-speaking city and could help the  Oilers' power play.  </P> <P> Toronto is willing to move Tom Fergus and Ed Olczyk, and the New York Rangers  might make a pitch for Olczyk, a strong forward who plays center or wing. What  do the Leafs need? Everything.  </P> <P> Former Sabres star Gilbert Perreault, coach of Victoriaville in the Quebec  Major Junior Hockey League, on his job: "Anybody can coach. It all depends on  how the players understand you and how much respect you get from them. Respect  is what separates winning coaches from ones who don't win."  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Regulatory separation would upset system that works well Sir, Lord Alexander's contribution to the debate about self- regulation ('Single City regulator proposed', November 23) is to be welcomed. The views on a 'system of tribunals' proposed by such an eminent lawyer and City practitioner will be studied with interest. Nevertheless, I am concerned that his views on separating retail and professional investment practitioners into separate regulatory organisations are somewhat over-simplified. At present, stockbrokers dealing with private clients - obviously retail business - are regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority, alongside their colleagues who act for 'professional' clients. This system has considerable merit, and benefits stockbrokers, their clients and indeed the regulators, as all business transacted on the Stock Exchange is governed by one self-regulatory organisation (SRO). The system's merits were recognised by Sir Kenneth Clucas, Sir Bryan Hayes and the foundation committee establishing the new Personal Investment Authority. All have agreed stockbrokers should continue to be regulated by one SRO, namely the SFA. I am sure that Lord Alexander would not want to upset a system which is working very well solely to satisfy a theoretical division between retail and professional business. M V Baker, chief executive, Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, 20 Dysart Street, London EC2</p>

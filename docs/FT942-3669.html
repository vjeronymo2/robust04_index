			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Long road to true democracy - Vernon Bogdanor questions the legitimacy of a system that fails to mobilise popular consent The 1994 elections to the European parliament raise two questions. The first is whether direct elections are able to confer democratic legitimacy to the European enterprise. The second is whether that enterprise has any chance of succeeding without a radical change of direction. The most striking feature of the elections is the small percentage of Europeans who can be bothered to vote. In 1979, 63 per cent of electors in the Community voted in the first elections for the European parliament. This disappointingly low turnout was ascribed to the parliament's lack of powers, an excuse no longer available. Yet, in 1994, for the third successive election, overall turnout fell - to 56.5 per cent compared with 58.5 per cent in 1989 and 61 per cent in 1984. Given that voting in three countries - Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg - is compulsory, it is probable that only a minority of electors were voluntarily prepared to offer even that minimal endorsement of European Union symbolised by the act of voting. The parliament, it is now clear, is unable to create a European consciousness among the electors. This failing is not contingent, but inherent in the operation of European institutions. Domestic elections succeed in conferring legitimacy because they fulfil three functions. They offer the voter a choice of government, a choice of who should lead that government, and the choice of a set of policies. European parliament elections fulfil none of these functions. The government of the Union is shared between the Council of Ministers and the Commission but the composition of neither of these bodies is affected by European elections. The leadership of the Union, in the guise of the person who will succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the Commission, is decided, not by the voters, but by backstairs dealing between the governments of the member-states. The future policies of the Union are decided through bargaining by the political leaders of the core member states - France, Germany, and Spain. Rather than conferring democratic legitimacy to the European project, European parliament voting has thus become a series of separate national elections, or rather perhaps national opinion polls, with the function of charting the changing fortunes of the main domestic political forces. Even here, the elections are deeply flawed owing to Britain's stubborn insistence on maintaining its first-past-the-post system. Can the European Parliament really claim a mandate to represent the opinion of its 269m voters, when it is supported by just over half of these voters, and when its representation is so distorted? If there has been one noticeable transnational trend in these elections, it has been the success of the right in three of the five large member-states of the Union - Germany, Italy and Spain. Yet, because of the exaggerative effects of the British electoral system, the UK Labour party will be by far the largest party in the parliament, and the Socialists the largest of the party groups. There is a striking contrast between the progressive transfer of competences to the European Parliament and the lack of popular involvement of the European electorate. The failure to mobilise popular consent is the main weakness of the European project. If the Union continues to transfer further competences to a European level and extends majority voting in the Council of Ministers, it will become further alienated from those it claims to represent. In reality, the development of the EU has revealed a more fundamental chasm in European politics than that between right and left, more profound even than that between Europhiles and Eurosceptics. It has opened up the most dangerous of political divides, that between the people and the political class. In Britain, France, Germany and Italy, all the main political parties have favoured the European enterprise although large minorities of the population are against it. With no legitimate outlet for anti-Europeanism, voters will turn to less respectable alternatives, the National Front in France in 1984 and 1989, Germany's Republicans in 1989, and, in Italy, Mr Silvio Berlusconi and his neo-fascist allies in 1994. The European Parliament, intended as a counterweight to the bureaucratic and technocratic elements of the Union, has become, as perceived by its electors, a part of that very technostructure. Any reform of the EU's institutions must begin by giving the electorate of Europe the power to choose its government. One way to achieve this is by direct election of the Commission. But that would require a treaty amendment. In the current climate, this would not be passed. Under Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome, elections to the parliament are to be conducted by a uniform electoral procedure in all of the states. If Britain could be persuaded to agree to this provision, it would be possible to produce common transnational lists for the European elections. It could then be accepted that the winning lists should form the Commission, which would be composed of members of one political colour, and could thus could offer the political leadership that Europe so badly needs. The European elections of 1994 mark the end of the road for a particular conception of Europe, one symbolised by the benign despotism of Delors. The elections none the less constitute both a challenge and an opportunity for European leaders. The opportunity is to help create a European consciousness, without which the construction of Europe cannot even be contemplated, let alone completed.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Submissions not meeting these requirements cannot be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Items To Receive Accelerated Duty Elimination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Articles in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that are proposed for accelerated duty elimination are listed in Annex I to this notice. Lists of articles in the Mexican Tariff Schedule of the General Import Duty Act and the Customs Tariff of Canada that are proposed for accelerated duty elimination are listed in Annexes II and III, respectively. Inclusion on this list does not signify that the parties have agreed to accelerate elimination of its duty, only that the parties will consider doing so. Comments of the public on the advisability of an acceleration will be taken into account in determining the U.S. position with respect to each product under consideration. Petitions received by January 25, 1994, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 23, 1993, but not listed in this notice, shall be considered during the next round of tariff acceleration discussions with Mexico and Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advice of the United States International Trade Commission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States International Trade Commission is being furnished with the list of articles published in Annex I of this notice for the purpose of securing from the Commission its judgement as to the probable economic effect of accelerated elimination of U.S. duties under the NAFTA on industries producing like or directly competitive articles and on consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advice of the Private Sector Advisory Committee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 103(a) of the Act, private sector advisory committees are being furnished with the list of articles published in the Annexes of this notice for their advice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Articles That May Be Considered in Negotiations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Please read this section carefully. Except as noted, all articles provided for in the subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that are listed in the Annexes to this notice are being considered for accelerated duty elimination. A description of articles provided for in these subheadings is available for Annex I in the ``Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (1994), Supplement 1,'' U.S. International Trade Commission Publication 2690. The ``Customs Tariff'' of Canada and the Mexican ``Tarifa de la Ley del Impuesto General de Importaci&oacute;'' (Tariff Schedule of the ``General Import Duty Act'') should be consulted for a description of the articles provided for in the tariff subheadings in Annex II and III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For subheadings listed in the Annexes with an asterisk, only certain products will be considered for accelerated tariff elimination. A list of the specific products which will be considered is available (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the NAFTA itself, the tariff acceleration exercise will result in three separate bilateral agreements between the United States and Mexico, the United States and Canada, and Canada and Mexico. Thus, in some cases, acceleration is not being considered among all three parties, as indicated in the Annexes, and a subsequent agreement to accelerate may not include all countries indicated in the Annexes. As a rule, accelerated duty elimination is being considered on a reciprocal basis on the equivalent tariff subheadings by the parties involved. In many cases, however, one or two parties may already provide NAFTA duty-free treatment to one or both of the other parties. In such cases, the Annexes do not list products already eligible for NAFTA duty-free treatment. A concordance showing the equivalent items in all three tariff schedules, including those already duty-free, is available (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles E.

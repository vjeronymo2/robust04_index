			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Heaven and Hell: The fishing was diabolical - Hugh Dickinson, Dean of Salisbury Cathedral, concludes the series 'OH HELL]' I said. The rain was horizontal wire. The boat dipped in the steep waves whipped up across the loch by a September storm. Mackay tugged at his oars. Suddenly, after four hours of fruitless flogging with my rod, I was into a fine sea trout. It leapt gleaming into the air. The line went slack. I had lost it. I was 16 years old and the saddest youth on earth. I had known heaven and hell in 30 seconds. Mackay made no comment, but as we trudged back through the driving mist to the House three miles away he told me a story. I wish I could reproduce the rolling 'rs' and Highland lilt. 'There was this fine gentleman, lad, who loved his fishing. Spent all his spare cash and some more; trout, salmon, pike, bass, sharks. A famous angler he was. Not that his wife or his bairns saw much of him. But his picture was in all the sporting papers. And then he died. Died with a rod in his hand and a trout on the line. 'Well, lad, he arrived on the Other Side and was greeted by a Shining One who welcomed him warmly. Shook his hand too. 'Ah, Mr Johnson, we've been expecting you. What'd you like to be doing then?' 'What? Can I choose?' 'Well, of course you can. That is what this place is for.' 'So naturally our Mr Johnson asked if he could fish. Indeed he could. Finest salmon river you've ever seen. Finest tackle. Finest weather. Water just right. More flies than you'll see in your Natural History Museum. So he set up his rod, our Mr Johnson, and started to fish. And first cast - wham into a 10lb salmon. In 20 minutes it was in the net and on the bank. What a river. And would you believe it, next cast just the same. And the next. Come noon he'd ten great salmon salmon, as like as peas in a pod, all lined up on the bank. 'So our Mr Johnson, he's mighty pleased with himself now isn't he? It's been a good morning. Time for a dram and his sandwiches maybe. So he starts back up the bank to the fishing lodge. On the way he meets the Shining One. 'Now,' says the Heavenly Being, 'Where d'you think you're off?' ''Well,' says our Mr Johnson, pleased as pleased can be, 'had a wonderful morning. Ten 30lb salmon. What d'you think of that? Thought I'd knock off for a bite of lunch and a drink. Don't want to spoil it, eh, by overdoing it.' ''Sorry about that,' says the Angel 'but I'm afraid you can't stop. You just get back over that river and carry on catching salmon. For ever and ever. Where do you think you are - in Heaven?'' The trouble is, it does not add up. Heaven and Hell have inbuilt illogicalities. Here and now we get glimpses of both. 'Hell is other people,' says Sartre. 'Heaven is other people,' say I. I spent some time the other day studying a splendid Doom painting sprawled across the chancel of a local church. I do not know if it really did persuade the Wiltshire yokels of the 14th century to mend their ways. Frankly I rather doubt it. I certainly do not want to join the queue of po-faced bishops and skinny noble ladies being welcomed into Heaven by a supercilious St Peter. The gory activities on the Hell-side of the arch are much more interesting. The Devils are the only people hugely enjoying themselves, stoking eternal fires with terrified humanity. Hell is clearly Heaven to them. But an eternity of sado-masochism is hardly my recipe for a believable heaven or hell. We do such things better on earth. 'Pate de foie gras to the sound of trumpets,' decided Sidney Smith. But pity the poor geese. It must have been hell for them. And who pays the trumpeters? Hell, like fictional villains, is easier to to imagine; after all we see it nightly on our television screens. But Heaven? I knew an elderly Irish aristocrat who was convinced that Heaven was an endless vista of parkland sculpted by an angelic Brown) with woods and hills embowering white Palladian halls. Didn't Jesus say, 'In my Father's house are many mansions?'  -'Angel] Fancy seeing you here. Isn't He just a heavenly Host' But who cooks the meals and dead-heads the roses? I forgot: They never wither do they? The Heaven we paint is a kaleidoscope of 'high' experiences which cannot possibly co-exist in this time space sequence. But are they fragments of light from-other realm of being where time runs every which-way and space curls in upon itself like some cosmic mizmaze? Or just sparks from the bonfire of our own humanity? Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I think they are just our own sparklers we have lit to keep the night at bay. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays I think they are the eternal stars. And Sundays? Where does He come into it - if at all? Well if He exists He must be All-Holy, All-loving and All-Wise. And that means that at some time - Beyond Time - he just has to do some totally mind-boggling work of New Creation that so ravishes the human heart that every human being who has ever lived, whatever horrors and torment they endured will be able to say: 'It was worth it for this]' Now that I cannot imagine. But then, I tell myself, and half believe it: if I had been around 10bn years ago and some passing angel had pointed to the incandescent fires of Alpha Orion and said: 'One day that is going to be cheetahs and parakeets and Milton and Bach and Gary Linneker - not to mention Marilyn Monroe' - I would have taken a whopping bet against it - and lost. If, out of that, He can make this, what can He not make out of this Heaven? I will bet on it. And Hell? That is the place for people who prefer things as they are.</p>

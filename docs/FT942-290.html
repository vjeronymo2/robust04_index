			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): The sophisticated art of reciprocity - International Cartels / Kenneth Gooding finds a re-telling of industrial history instructive and enjoyable The Co-operative Edge: The Internal Politics of International Cartels by Debora L. Spar Cornell University Press, Pounds 24.75 273 pages In November 1980 Gordon Waddell was unlucky enough to be recognised by a BBC correspondent while enjoying an evening at the Bolshoi in Moscow. Waddell at that time was an executive director of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and a former son-in-law of Harry Oppenheimer, then Anglo's chairman. This was a time when the Soviet Union was insisting it had no contacts at all with South Africa, 'the racist citadel of apartheid', while the South African prime minister P. W. Botha was claiming that his people were fighting against a 'total onslaught by Soviet Communism'. So why, the BBC correspondent politely inquired, was Waddell, a representative of South Africa's most powerful mining and industrial group, being feted by Soviet officials? Waddell stoicly refused to comment. But within the discreet worlds of the diamond and gold trading communities, Waddell's appearance in Moscow came as no surprise. They knew that for many years the Anglo group and its diamond twin, De Beers, had been involved with the Soviet Union in some form of 'orderly marketing arrangements' for diamonds and gold. The international diamond cartel organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation could not have survived without solid support from the Soviet Union. The CSO still controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds and 25 per cent of the stones it sells come from the former Soviet Union. This reciprocity was beautifully illustrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1990 De Beers loaned Russia Dollars 1bn - thus doing more than any country at that time to help the Russians solve their shortage of hard currency. In return De Beers shipped stockpiled diamonds to London as collateral for the loan and signed an exclusive, five-year marketing agreement with Russia - thus ensuring that Russia would not be tempted to raise money quickly by dumping diamonds in the west. Debora Spar, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, comes to be analysing the diamond cartel via a circuitous route. She intended to examine how the Soviets sold their natural resources on world markets and how they manipulated this trade in pursuit of political gain. 'Very quickly,' she recalls, 'I realised that the real puzzle was not why the Soviets were not competing more vigorously but why they were co-operating so effectively,' - particularly with their South African counterparts. Spar also says that she became interested in cartels, 'not for their own sake but rather for what they can teach us about the politics and processes of international co-operation'. She chose four cases: the formal and highly successful diamond cartel; the sophisticated but informal collaboration in gold; a failed cartel and subsequent anarchy in uranium; and the silver market, where there is little evidence of co-operation. Her central observation is that co-operative behaviour among producers is not determined solely by the structure of the market in which they operate. Cartels form, she argues, not only because a market is predisposed to joint action, but also because at least two major producers have certain internal characteristics that enable them to initiate and maintain a co-operative relationship. She says autonomous competitors - those with the power to discipline and command their own internal factions - will best be able to make the commitments that enable them to take part in and perpetuate co-operative endeavours. Also, insofar as a successful cartel involves a continuous process of bargaining, it will be best managed by those producers able to keep the circle of negotiators small, the rules flexible and the power to retaliate as strong as possible. The Soviet Union, with its centralised power, was matched for autonomy by the South African corporations. Spar says: 'De Beers and Anglo American have long been joined to and protected by a vast corporate conglomerate. All firms in the network are linked to one another and, ultimately, to the top of the corporate pyramid and the Oppenheimer family. The 'empire' is effectively controlled by its centre and remains resistant to outside pressures and internal squabbles . . . In the Oppenheimer companies very little decentralisation has occured. Integration remains the guiding principle and control resides firmly at the top.' In setting out her case histories, Spar makes some unforgiveable factual mistakes - for example, a simple examination of the annual reports would have prevented her making the ludicrous assertion that RTZ's board is 'composed of many of the same people who run various other parts of Harry Oppenheimer's empire'. She also fails to mention that the size of a particular market is an important factor in its suitability for cartelisation. Harry Oppenheimer himself once told me that Opec was misguided to believe that producers could control prices in a market as big as the oil market. But you do not have to agree with Spar's theories to enjoy her re-telling of some fascinating industrial history.</p>

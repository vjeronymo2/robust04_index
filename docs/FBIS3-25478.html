			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The negotiating council has decided to send a  written invitation to the Freedom Alliance inviting them to join  the council. Negotiating council Chairman Pravin Gordhan said  he had received feedback that members of the alliance would  appreciate an invitation requesting some kind of a response to  the constitutional proposals. Mr. Gordhan said the council  expected the alliance to respond to the invitation by early  evening. The council is processing a package of constitutional  concessions and amendments to secure the Freedom Alliance's  participation in the election.    The government and the ANC [African National Congress]  earlier submitted their proposals to the negotiating council at  Kempton Park. The Freedom Alliance did not attend the meeting  at the World Trade Center.</p>

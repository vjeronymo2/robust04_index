			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Austrian group in the red mid-year RADEX HERAKLITH, the Austrian fireproofing materials and building supplies group, reported a loss of Sch48.2m (Dollars 4.3m) for the first half of 1993 compared with a Sch59.4m profit in the same period last year. Revenues dropped by 12 per cent to Sch4.37bn. Mr Hellmut Longin, chief executive, forecast a slight improvement in full-year profits from last year's Sch130.4m, mainly because of an anticipated Sch80m to Sch90m profit at the Heraklith Baustoffe building materials subsidiary. Mr Longin also said that both Radex and its two quoted subsidiaries would maintain their dividends. The group has been hard hit by the slump in the steel industry. Its Veitsch-Radex subsidiary is the world leader in supplying magnesite to line blast furnaces.</p>

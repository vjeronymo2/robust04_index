			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Reclaiming VAT around Europe - Michael Skapinker looks at the obstacles to recovering taxes on business services Stay in London and you can get back the value added tax you pay on your hotels and meals. In Amsterdam, you can claim back VAT on your hotel bill but not on meals. In Paris you lose it all. Anyone who believes the single market and the European Union are established facts has never looked at the tortuous procedures business travellers have to go through to reclaim VAT on business services. In principle, someone travelling on business from one EU country to another can reclaim VAT spent on certain services. The first difficulty is establishing which services. The UK and Germany are generous to business travellers, allowing them to reclaim VAT expended on hotels, car rental and other transport, petrol, meals, professional fees, conferences, trade shows and training courses. Countries such as France, Ireland and Italy are less open-handed. Most EU countries allow business travellers from outside the Union to reclaim VAT. Some, like Italy, do not allow non-EU citizens to reclaim unless their own countries offer reciprocal arrangements. For those who have managed to understand what can be reclaimed, the bureaucratic battle has only just begun. There is no central clearing house for VAT reclamation. Nor does the EU have a single working language. Applications in Denmark must be completed in Danish, in Greek in Greece and Dutch in the Netherlands. Even then for those who do manage to fill in the forms in the correct language, there are traps everywhere. Among the most common is failing to get the right invoice for services; invoices must specify what VAT was paid. Another mistake is to have an invoice made out to the company's subsidiary in the country in which the expense was incurred. Instead, invoices must be made out to the company in the business traveller's home country. Understandably, given the complications, many companies do not bother to reclaim. They write off VAT paid in another country as part of the cost of doing business abroad. That was the attitude taken by management consultants Arthur D. Little until a year ago. William Stormont, a director of the consultancy, says: 'Our travel bill was very large, but reclaiming VAT is a very labour intensive exercise. Understanding the attitudes in each of the countries was quite a deterrent as far as we were concerned,' he says. The consultancy turned to Meridian Vat Reclaim, one of several companies now specialising in making claims. In one year, Arthur D. Little has received Pounds 4,500 back after commissions. Stormont admits it is not a fortune, but adds that every bit helps in these difficult times. UK Customs and Excise publishes a VAT refunds booklet called notice 723. It is available free from HM Customs and Excise, VAT Overseas Repayments, Custom House, PO Box 34, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, BT48 7AE.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        Big expenditure items on which VAT is reclaimable in EC (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Hotel      Car    Petrol      Meals                             Rental  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria             10           -         -         20 Belgium             -        19.5*      19.5          - Denmark             -            -        25          - France              -            -         -          - Germany             15          15        15         15 Greece              -            -         -          - Ireland             -            -         -          - Italy               -            -         -          - Luxembourg          3           15        18          3 Netherlands         6         17.5      17.5          - Norway              -            -         -          - Portugal            -            -         -          - Spain               15 or 16    15        15   15 or 16 Sweden              12         21*        21         21 UK                  17.5      17.5      17.5       17.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Transport    Professional    Conference    Training                                        Fees   Trade Shows     Courses  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria                  10              20            20          20 Belgium                   -            19.5             6        19.5 Denmark                   -              25            25          25 France                    -            18.6          18.6        18.6 Germany             7 or 15              15            15          15 Greece                    -               -             -           - Ireland                   -              21            21          21 Italy                     -              19            19          19 Luxembourg                3               6             6           6 Netherlands               6            17.5          17.5        17.5 Norway                    -               -             -           - Portugal                  -              16            16          16 Spain                                    15            15          15 Sweden                   21              25            25           - UK                     17.5            17.5          17.5        17.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *One half of Vat is eligible for reclaim Source: Meridian VAT Reclaim  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

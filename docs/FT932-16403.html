			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Channel rail link will put commuters last in line Sir, In his article 'Final search for the missing link: the case for the Channel tunnel rail link is persuasive, but who will fund it?' (March 31), Richard Tomkins paints the 'embarrassing' picture of 'high-speed international expresses from Paris and Brussels' which will find themselves having to queue 'behind British Rail commuter trains' for access to London. Can he be really serious? Any regular user of British Rail knows that it will be the commuter that has to queue. I feel a dose of reality therapy is required for Mr Tomkins. Perhaps you could get him to use his journalistic talents to establish what the likely fare at today's prices for the journey on the high-speed link from the tunnel to London might be.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 12 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen today defended the legality of the recent  71.2-percent increase in the price of gasoline, which yesterday  the Court of Constitutional Guarantees (TGC) declared  unconstitutional.    The president questioned the legal status of the court's  members as Samuel Belletini, the president of the National  Congress, "swore in" Gonzalo Machado, the government  representative at the TGC, as the court's chief justice.    In addition to declaring the price hike unconstitutional,  the  TGC ordered the suspension of all other effects of the  presidential decree, stating that the increase "could be very  detrimental to the country's future."    Duran-Ballen said that the previous Rodrigo Borja  administration (1988-92) appointed Machado as a nonvoting member  of the TGC and, as such, he cannot very well represent the  current administration. He also questioned the authority of the  other TGC members, whose terms were extended in light of  differences prevailing in Congress regarding the appointment of  new members.    Duran-Ballen said, "Belletini made an arbitrary decision by  installing a presidential representative I did not appoint." He  announced that Attorney General Carlos Larreategui [name and  title as received] will appeal the decision before the  Constitutionality Court of the Supreme Court of Justice.  According to constitutional reforms approved in 1993, the  Constitutionality Court can ratify or overturn TGC decisions,  which were previously indisputable. The president recalled that  the TGC itself previously had not accepted Machado because he  did not meet the court's age requirements.    Of the 11 nonvoting TGC members, six met to discuss the  issue  and five voted in favor of the unconstitutionality of the  decree. The order triggered demonstrations that are threatening  to continue if the government upholds the validity of the price  hike that has increased the cost of living for the Ecuadoran  people.    According to recent reforms made to the laws governing  hydrocarbons, the president has the authority to set the price  of oil products in Ecuador, which was a member of OPEC up until  last year. The oil industry produced 40 percent of the  government's budget, and the drop in the price of oil on the  international market created a controversial deficit. The  government tried to cover the deficit by passing new tax laws,  which the Congress rejected, and then decided to raise the price  of gasoline.    Contrary to the trend in other countries, the Ecuadoran  Government said if the price of crude goes up on the  international market, the price of gasoline may go down.</p>

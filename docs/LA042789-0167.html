			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> LOARA WINS WITH A 10-RUN INNING  </P> <P> Loara High School's 10-run inning Wednesday was just enough to end Los  Alamitos' seven-game winning streak and create a two-way tie for first in the  Empire League.  </P> <P> Loara overcame an 8-1 deficit by scoring 10 runs in a wild fifth inning and  edged Los Alamitos, 11-10, on a windy afternoon at Loara.  </P> <P> Loara (10-10 overall, 7-3 in league play) sent 15 batters to the plate in the  fifth and pounded three Los Alamitos pitchers for nine hits, including six in a  row, to erase the Griffins' seven-run lead. Chris Hoffman's two-run double to  the gap in left-center and Czach Hallock's two-out triple down the right-field  line that scored the go-ahead runs were the key blows in the inning.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos (12-9, 7-3) held an 8-1 lead after three innings of play,  capitalizing on six walks and flexing its muscles with home runs by Anthony  Napolitano and Doug Kieck.  </P> <P> Napolitano hit a three-run homer in the second inning over the 343-foot sign in  right field that gave Los Alamitos a 5-0 lead. Kieck's two-run homer over the  325-foot sign in left field pushed the Griffins ahead, 8-1, in the third.  </P> <P> Todd Gragnano, Los Alamitos' starting pitcher, allowed a solo homer by Loara's  Matt Draber in the second that hooked just inside the left-field foul pole.  </P> <P> "I kept telling my players that we only needed one big inning, but I didn't  expect anything like that," said Roby Megill, Loara coach. "I didn't even  realize we had scored that many runs."  </P> <P> Mike Gibson, Los Alamitos coach, was well aware of how many runs Loara scored.  Afterward, Gibson voiced his displeasure with his pitching staff's inability to  protect a big lead.  </P> <P> "This looked like it was going to be an easy one," Gibson said. "I was thinking  about subbing some kids in the last two innings. You would think that when a  team scores 10 runs, they're going to win the game."  </P> <P> Loara had 11 runs going into the sixth and that almost wasn't enough. Los  Alamitos quickly narrowed an 11-8 deficit to one run when Gragnano hit a  two-run homer to right, giving the Griffins their third homer of the day.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos had the tying run on with no outs after Darren Sugiyama opened the  seventh with a single and got a big break when Loara catcher Chris Hoffman  misplayed a sacrifice bunt attempt.  </P> <P> But Sugiyama took the Griffins out of the inning when he was called out at  third trying to advance on the bunt. Loara retired the next two batters to hang  on for an unlikely win.  </P> <P> "The last time we played Los Alamitos, we had a 6-0 lead and lost, 10-6,"  Megill said. "After the fifth inning, I walked by Mike and asked him, 'Does  this look familiar?' A win like this has got to pump the kids up."  </P> <P> El Dorado 5, Cypress 1 -- Jay Hassell (2-2) pitched a one-hitter for El Dorado  at home. Hassell, a senior, had a no-hitter going until the sixth inning when  he gave up a leadoff single. Hassell struck out 10 and walked just one for the  victory.  </P> <P> Matt Luke went two for three with a double and an RBI, and Dave Moore went two  for four with an RBI, a double, and two stolen bases for El Dorado (13-8, 5-5).  </P> <P> Esperanza 7, Katella 3 -- Roger Weems (2-3) pitched 6 1/3 innings and Brian  Pickler pitched the final two-thirds of an inning for the save for host  Esperanza (8-8-2, 2-7-1). Keith McDonald, and Rich Hills had solo home runs for  Esperanza. Hills also had a double. Katella falls to 13-7, 6-4.  </P></p>

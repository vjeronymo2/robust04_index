			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / US court ruling throws insurers into confusion US life insurance companies are bracing themselves for an administrative upheaval affecting Dollars 570bn of assets, after the Supreme Court ruled yesterday that these funds must be managed in line with pension protection laws. The court said an insurance company must meet the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for premiums paid by a group pension plan, even when the money is placed in its general account. Some insurance executives feared the ruling could oblige companies to set up segregated accounts for their group pension clients, which would create great difficulties in dividing the assets now pooled in their general accounts. Worries about the solvency of many insurance companies have led some pension plans in recent years to ask for segregated accounts, but three-quarters of the pension fund assets held by insurance companies are still pooled in general accounts. General accounts have been thought to be governed primarily by state law, which in most cases says all policy-holders must be treated equally. The federal act, though, can require additional protection for pension plan participants.</p>

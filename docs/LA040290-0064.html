			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1,000 LITHUANIANS RALLY IN L.A. TO SUPPORT HOMELAND;  </P> <P> SECESSION: ACTIVISTS PROTEST 'SOVIET OCCUPATION' OF THE REPUBLIC. THEY CALL ON  THE U.S. TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON GORBACHEV.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 Lithuanian activists thronged outside the Federal Building in  Westwood on Sunday to protest increased Soviet pressure on their homeland to  renounce its declaration of independence.  </P> <P> As Lithuanian community leaders exhorted the Soviet Union to permit  independence in the Baltic republic, demonstrators torched the Soviet flag,  chanted anti-Gorbachev slogans and hoisted signs denouncing "Soviet occupation"  of their country.  </P> <P> Speakers also criticized President Bush for playing what they see as too  limited a role in the republic's efforts to win freedom.  </P> <P> "We are protesting the Bush Administration's silence and refusal to give  diplomatic representation to the Lithuanian government," said Tony Mazeika, the  director of the Baltic American Freedom League.  </P> <P> Mazeika said that Lithuanian activists are incensed over several bilateral  trade agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "(Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev needs those agreements," he said. "He  needs them to stay in power. They are very crucial. But the Lithuanian people  need to be free."  </P> <P> On March 11, the republic declared its independence from the Soviet Union,  which annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940. Estonia has pledged to  join the Baltic independence movement, and Latvia is expected to follow suit.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, Gorbachev urged the republic to renounce its declaration of  independence and negotiate with the Kremlin within provisions of the Soviet  constitution.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian government has shown no willingness to back down, however, and  in Westwood, demonstrators cheered that stance and vowed that Lithuanians would  withstand any Soviet efforts to deny the tiny Baltic state its freedom.  </P> <P> "The Lithuanians are determined in their hearts to do everything in their means  to gain independence," said Lithuanian national Arvydas Jakeliunas, who arrived  Sunday in Los Angeles to visit relatives. "The troops are working on them  psychologically, but they are determined not to let this stop them."  </P> <P> The Lithuanians, who were joined in their protest here by small bands of  Armenians and Estonians, called on the United States to step up pressure on the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get as many Americans as we can to demand freedom for  Lithuania," said Aldona Venckunas, who fled Lithuania in 1950 with her family  to escape what she called Soviet repression. "We want Bush to support us in  stronger words and economic sanctions. We don't want any 'favored nations'  trade agreement with the Soviet Union."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Government of the Republic of Estonia has issued  a statement in connection with the Estonian-Russian talks. The  Government expresses regret over the Estonian-Russian talks  breaking off due to the Russian side's unconstructive behavior.  The Russian side's attempt to back down on the agreed deadline  for the troop withdrawal does not allow for the initialling of  an already drafted troop withdrawal agreement. Russian  insistence on additional conditions, including one on the  Estonian Government having to pay the Russian Government $23  million, is in conflict with the international obligation which  Russia has taken upon itself, which is to withdraw the troops  from Estonia quickly, in an orderly manner, completely and  unconditionally.    The Government statement says that in this situation the  Government of the Republic of Estonia protests against Russian  attempts to destabilize the situation in the Baltic Sea region.  The Government states once again that the Russian troops must  be completely withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of  Estonia by 31 August 1994 at the latest. The Government appeals  to Russia to abandon its unconstructive attitude and continue  talks; it proposes to Russia to hold consultations at a high  political level. The Government of the Republic of Estonia  reaffirms the existence of Estonian goodwill to continue talks  in this situation.</p>

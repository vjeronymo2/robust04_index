			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Air fare competition impossible if airlines remain subsidised Sir, Great expectations and hopes were kindled in the minds of the travelling public by talks on liberalisation of air transport in Europe, particularly in regard to cheaper fares. Most thought that what had happened in the US would also happen in Europe with competition being keener and with fares accordingly being reduced. However, what has happened in Europe has been very much a damp squib from the consumer's point of view for the simple reason that air transport in Europe is organised very differently from that in the US, in that it is dominated by national airlines, most of which are technically bankrupt and losing vast sums of taxpayers' money because of overstaffing and inefficiency. There is little or no comp-etition on most routes, and certainly if the fares were to reflect the operating costs of these airlines, they would be much higher than they are at present. However, this does not prevent new entrants being deterred by unfair competition, predatory pricing, capacity saturation and denial of prime-time slots at major airports. Most new entrants to the aviation business, attracted by liberalisation, are private airlines. But private airlines whose motive is profit can-not compete in a field where profit is a secondary consideration. The European Commission, unfortunately, is understaffed and powerless to enforce regulations which would ensure fair competition, and thus a fair deal for consumers. In Europe at present there are roughly seven airlines technically bankrupt, and these are Air France, Alitalia, Iberia, Olympic, Aer Lingus, TAP and Sabena. There will be no real competition and liberalisation as long as these national airlines receive massive support from the various governments, a support which is denied to the private sector.

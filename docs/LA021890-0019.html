			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: FABULOUS '50S  </P> <P> Forest Whitaker is headed for Harlem, circa 1956. He'll star in "A Rage in  Harlem," playing one of two brothers (the other's uncast) who, though polar  opposites, come together over the course of "a nightmarish, roller-coaster  weekend" in the New York neighborhood.  </P> <P> Bill Duke will make his feature directing debut, with filming expected to begin  in late April.  </P> <P> "The comedy in this action-comedy will be very dark," said Kerry Boyle, who'll  co-produce with Stephen Woolley for Palace Prods. Miramax Films will distribute  the $8-million film.  </P> <P> Scripted by John Toles-Bey, "Rage" is based on a 1965 Chester Himes novel  originally published as "For Love of Imabelle." It was Himes who created  Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson -- the Harlem cops who first came to  the screen in "Cotton Comes to Harlem" (1970). Look for the duo to return -- as  supporting characters -- in "Rage."  </P> <P> Look, too, for Danny Glover -- in "a small, but very important role," a  character named Easy Money. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

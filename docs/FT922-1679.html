			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Japan adds a new number to its exports THE LATEST Japanese export to hit the UK is not a car or a new kind of electronic camera but the mathematics textbooks of Mr Toru Kumon. For decades, British educators have assumed they had little to learn from Japan. Even though Japan's schools produced well-trained young people, it was generally thought their good academic results were achieved mainly at the cost of excessive discipline. Mr Kumon, a 78-year-old retired teacher, believes the methods he has used in Japan for over 30 years work well with children anywhere. His books have been introduced in the US and elsewhere but until recently they were virtually unknown in the UK. Now he is expanding fast. At the start of 1992, there were just two British Kumon-trained teachers. By the end of the year there will be 50. Mr Kumon has no time for teaching 'concepts' or letting children 'discover' maths for themselves by playing with coloured bricks or pocket calculators. Instead, he relies entirely on children working their way through 3,800 pages of repetitive exercises. The worksheets are designed so that children can work on their own all the way from kindergarten games to differential calculus. The teacher guides children through difficult stages and corrects answers to make sure that a child gets full marks before moving from one level to another. With Mr Kumon, the only acceptable mark is 100 per cent. For lower scores the sole remedy is more practice. Mr Kumon talks with a passion which belies his years. 'Almost all children can do better if only they are properly taught,' he says. 'If a top teacher teaches an average child, the child's ratings go up. If a top child is given an average teacher, the child's ratings go down. Those educators who are not willing to learn themselves should give up teaching.' Mr Kumon, himself a retired teacher, devised his methods in the early 1950s when he was helping his young son with his maths homework and later devised programmes for learning Japanese, English and other languages. Now he has 1.6m pupils in Japan and 1.9m worldwide. Like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, Mr Kumon loves to give examples of the achievements of Kumon-trained children. His current favourite is a five-year-old Japanese girl studying English who can write critical evaluations of university-level texts. He holds up her worksheet, complete with comments scrawled in five-year-old handwriting on a passage from Mr Edwin Reischauer, a noted American scholar and former US ambassador to Japan. Mr Kumon also has available assessments of the merits of his methods. Unfortunately, there are none from Japan because the Ministry of Education does not allow his materials to be used in schools, nor has it carried out any comparative tests. But outside Japan, where Kumon materials are mostly used in regular schools, the method has been examined more rigorously. For example, at Christ Episcopalian School in Texas, the average maths score of six-year-old children rose during a year from 53 per cent to 81 per cent, as measured by a widely used American test. The average score for 10-year-olds rose from 76 per cent to 94 per cent. Other schools in Texas, and in Alabama, Michigan and Mississippi reported similar advances. Critics say that the samples are too small to offer conclusive proof. Even though thousands of American schools have studied Kumon materials, only 300 have actually introduced them. Critics say Mr Kumon puts too much emphasis on repetitive drills. The workbooks, they say, are boring and expensive, and the method itself is little more than glorified rote-learning. Mr Kumon's supporters in the US reply that the results speak for themselves. Most American teachers who use Kumon materials do so for just 15 to 20 minutes a day - as a supplement to other textbooks, not as a substitute, so the children do not get bored. Like any iconoclast, Mr Kumon himself brooks no criticism. Teachers who oppose his methods are simply 'looking after their own jobs. They don't want to admit they're wrong.'</p>

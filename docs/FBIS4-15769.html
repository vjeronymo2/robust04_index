			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] Bakyt Ospanov, chairman of  the State Committee for Land Cadastre and Tenure, comments as  follows on the presidential decree on improvement of land  cadastre:    Land is Kazakhstan is only owned by the government, but when  people sell their individual houses or gardens, they virtually  sell the land on which these gardens or buildings are located.  The government is losing a lot of money thereby as it does not  participate in these transactions. This new decree gives us a  simple solution that does not affect the constitutional legal  basis. In accordance with this decree, heads of local  administrations do not sell the land which belongs to the state,  but sell the right for using this land during one's life time  and for leaving it to be used by one's heirs. In other words,  ownership on land is separated from ownership on life-long  inherited right for using this land. This means that land  relations are included in the market turnover, thus creating  conditions for accumulation of additional mortgage means on  banking accounts. The government becomes the main regulator of  land relations and receives profit in the form of dues from  these transactions.</p>

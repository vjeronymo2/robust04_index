			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Clerides scores upset win in Cyprus THE CONSERVATIVE challenger in the Cyprus presidential election, Mr Glafcos Clerides, yesterday won a narrow upset victory over President George Vassiliou, Agencies report from Nicosia. Mr Clerides, a 73-year-old veteran of Cyprus politics, campaigned for changes in United Nations proposals aimed at ending the division of the island between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The official result last night gave Mr Clerides 50.3 per cent to Mr Vassiliou's 49.7 per cent in the second round of voting -  a majority of fewer than 2,000 votes. The challenger had trailed in the first round of voting a week ago, but supporters of an eliminated candidate switched to him in a run-off vote. With the margin of victory so thin, the Vassiliou camp at first refused to concede defeat and demanded a recount in the Nicosia district, but this was rejected by the chief election officer. Mr Vassiliou, a 61-year-old millionaire backed by the communists, won an unexpected victory five years ago. Clerides supporters last night burst into wild celebrations, driving through the streets of Nicosia in cars draped with Cypriot and Greek flags, and honking car horns. The so-called UN 'set of ideas' for the future of the divided island was a dominant campaign issue. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops seized the northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup in Nicosia backed by the military junta then ruling Greece. Mr Clerides has not rejected outright the UN proposals to reunite the island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. But he has said key clauses need to be rewritten. Mr Clerides has said he will postpone UN-sponsored talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and launch intensive efforts to take Cyprus into the European Community.</p>

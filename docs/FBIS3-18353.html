			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "NATO Problematic for Right </F> Too"]    [Text] Rome -- [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary]  Gianfranco Fini, the gentleman of Italian politics, writes it,  but will not speak it. He is too cautious and too polite to  speak this dirty word during an election campaign. Fini is not  [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti and does not believe that  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi should be fooled with. So in  his article, published in small print in IL SECOLO, the MSI  organ, it is difficult to find "Renewing NATO," the proud MSI  objective proclaimed anew in the National Alliance's program.  NATO has caused real problems for the progressive alignment,  and it looks like it is now about to create disarray within the  freedom alignment.    Mistrust is perhaps too weak a word, but hatred is perhaps  too strong. The fact remains that the National Alliance  absolutely cannot abide the Americans. Its dream is a great  Europe, with East and West at last united, with "no subjugation"  to the United States. "European autonomy in political and  military decisionmaking." The first political decision would be  an alliance with South America. "A comprehensive understanding  embodying broad plans, with Italy and Spain as its vanguard of  special influence."    There would also be a "30-year European plan for Africa."  This is the "European pillar" -- a force "competing" with the  United States and the Far East.    This is no mere side issue and related issues are clarified  still further: The National Alliance says that the Maastricht  Treaty too must be rejected (it is demanding a revision of the  treaty) and of course that it is necessary to ensure that,  "Germany's reunification" be followed by Italy's, with the  return of Istria, Fiume [Rijeka], and Dalmatia, "by means of  international treaties." This Super Europe must also have a  seat on the UN Security Council.    Remember Berlusconi? He said: "I will confine myself to the  facts. I have read Fini's program; it is a liberal democratic  program." Another disappointment: Berlusconi's free market  economy, the driving force behind the promised Italian miracle,  is virtually rejected by Fini.    Of course, free enterprise is encouraged, but beware: "The  state must create a social market economy." Privatization,  sure. But it must facilitate "popular share ownership" across  the nation. So it is necessary to avert the danger "of outright  colonizations of entire production sectors." This, because "we  must not forget that our European partners vigorously protect  their own enterprises." So privatization must be carried out  without encouraging "domestic or foreign competitors that want  only to acquire centers of production with the aim of creating  monopolies or oligopolies."    There must be some protectionism, and let this not upset  Professor Martini, Berlusconi's economist.    Will a conflict now break out? Fini and Berlusconi have  other things to think about. However, free trade and  Atlanticism have always been fixed principles for Giorgio  Caradonna -- a long-time deputy with 11 trials and seven  sentences behind him, one of the few MSI figures friendly toward  Israel. He is a nonconformist. His motion at the National  Alliance constituent assembly was thrown out and he was left  without a job. He is not running for reelection.    Caradonna has therefore turned to bureaucratic channels.  Unable to have the judiciary approve his motion, he has  initiated proceedings against the entire MSI. Who decided on  its new symbol? Who decided on its candidates? "If I win this  case," he explained enthusiastically at Rome's law courts  yesterday, "the National Alliance lists throughout Italy will be  invalidated, and the party will be unable to contest the  elections."</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Forty more face trial in Kuwait for collaboration with Iraqis KUWAIT opens trial proceedings tomorrow against 40 more people suspected of having collaborated with the Iraqis during the emirate's seven-month occupation. This resumes a process which was suspended last June and will revive the close attention of human rights organisations. The suspects are to be tried for 20 cases arising from the Iraqi occupation, including allegations of torture or complicity in torture, in what are expected to be open hearings in a state security court. Human rights groups estimate that around 100 people are still detained for alleged offences during the occupation, while 164 have already been tried, in proceedings which began in May last year and were widely condemned for their harshness. In these trials 29 people were sentenced to death - later commuted to life imprisonment - 72 were jailed, many for life, 15 fined, three passed on to other courts and 45 acquitted. Many of the acquitted, particularly Palestinians and Jordanians, are believed to have been deported under a programme, now supervised by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has seen between 50 and 100 people bussed out of Kuwait weekly. International anger over the initial trials - during which one Iraqi youth was jailed for 15 years for wearing a Saddam Hussein T-shirt - combined with Kuwait's lifting of martial law has, in the view of human rights organisations, led Kuwait to improve trial procedures. It has abolished indefinite detention without trial, set up regular review courts for detainees, introduced an appeal court and freed many suspects for lack of evidence. But groups such as Amnesty International, which says it will send an observer to the latest trials, say the procedure is still far from ideal: many defendants still do not have defence lawyers. Moreover, they still do not know whether adequate witness testimony will be available for people charged with torture. Although some charges in the present trial could carry the death penalty, human rights activists suggest that even if some are imposed, they are likely later to be commuted. However, they also suggest that Kuwaitis remain unforgiving towards those accused of collaborating in atrocities during the occupation.</p>

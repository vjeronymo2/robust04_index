			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], a powerful party in the coalition government, hopes to  push to replace Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with its own  leader, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, a senior party official  said Friday [8 April].    Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic  Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the  next premier, but added, "there is the question on how we should  go about this with the current coalition framework. It is a  delicate matter in finding a balance."    He also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling  coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party, may join the cabinet.    Funada was speaking to reporters at a press conference after  an emergency meeting of executive members of Shinseito.    At the gathering, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito who is considered to be the coalition's top  strategist, said, "we have to be as quick as possible in  electing a new prime minister to succeed our goals...so as not  to frustrate the reform process."    Hosokawa announced earlier in the day that he would step  down  and an emergency cabinet meeting later accepted his decision to  resign.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen opposition stated that from 180 to 300  people had been killed as a result of the armed clashes in  Grozny last Sunday.    The Chechen Interim Council, which opposites [as received]  to  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said that innocent people had  suffered during these clashes, including women and children.    Official authorities in Groznyy refuted this information  saying that no more than ten people had been killed and no more  than sixty wounded.    The armed clashes between government forces and the militant  group of Ruslan Labazanov took place in a district of Groznyy.  The clashes followed the order to disarm illegal armed  formations in Chechnya issued by Chechen Military Commander  Sultan Geliskhanov.    The opposition headquarters refuted the government statement  that a wide-scale and decisive struggle against crime had begun  in the republic. The opposition said that the Chechen  leadership had started the bloodshed in order to eliminate the  members of the armed group whom it had considered as supporters  not so long ago.    The Interim Council said that opposition activist Labazanov  was a witness to many criminal actions by the leadership. That  is why the decision was taken to kill him, an opposition  representative, who did not want his name to be revealed, went  on to say.    Labazanov has managed to flee with a group of militants.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Activists fear 'union barons' will decide leadership race THE SIGHT of union leaders queueing to endorse Mr John Smith as successor to Mr Neil Kinnock has been 'very bad for Labour's image', Mr Mike Craven, head of the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, the constituency party pressure group, said yesterday. The worry for Mr Craven, and others, is that 'union barons in smoked-filled rooms' will decide the election after little consultation with their members, giving further credence to the idea of Labour as a plaything of unrepresentative union leaders. The unions, representing 40 per cent of the votes in Labour's electoral college, prefer Mr Smith as successor to Mr Kinnock. The leadership of three main unions, the GMB and TGWU general unions and the AEEU, the craft union merged from the AEU and the EETPU, have already declared for Mr Smith. However, in spite of the tight timetable, the main unions will probably ballot their members. Membership ballots would at least give Mr Bryan Gould, or any other candidate, the chance to challenge that recommendation. Mr Gould may also win backing from Nupe, the public-service union, the National Communications Union and other smaller unions. In the previous elections the unions have used a wide variety of methods to consult their members. Some have balloted members. Others have consulted through union branches, and a third group has left it to their executives or annual conferences to decide. Although there now appears to be pressure for balloting, not all unions will be able to, or want to, conform. The tight timetable makes balloting difficult to arrange, the cost could be considerable and cannot - like some other ballots - be recouped from the government. The MSF technical union will 'consult as widely as possible through the branches' says Mr Roger Lyons, general-secretary designate. Mr Tony Clarke, deputy general secretary of the UCW postal union, says: 'We will consult through branches. A postal ballot would cost Pounds 30,000 and, judging from union elections, the turnout would be about 20 per cent. Democracy would not necessarily be served.' Ballots in the TGWU and the AEEU could cost more than Pounds 100,000. Mr Nigel Harris, a member of both the AEU executive and Labour's national executive, supports a quick election. 'I do not think we could have had a situation in which the party was in limbo for six months,' he said.</p>

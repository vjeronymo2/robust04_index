			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Baker upbeat on Mideast peace process MR JAMES BAKER said in Jerusalem last night that he was optimistic about progress in Middle East talks and welcomed moves by Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to curb Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. After talks with Mr Rabin, the US secretary of state struck an upbeat note which contrasted with the tense relations between the US and the previous Israeli government led by Mr Yitzhak Shamir. Mr Baker signalled a shift in Washington's attitude to Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees, hitherto blocked because of Mr Shamir's refusal to stop settlements. 'I share what I believe is your optimism for the opportunity of moving forward in the peace process,' he said as he stood alongside Mr Rabin, who has promised to accelerate the US-brokered negotiations begun last October in Madrid. Mr Rabin thanked the US for its readiness to take part in the acceleration of the peace process and 'the improvement in relations between the two countries'. In a further move to advance the talks, Mr Rabin is to fly to Cairo tomorrow to meet President Hosni Mubarak, in what will be the first meeting since 1986 between the leaders of Israel and Egypt. Mr Baker will today have further talks with Israeli officials and will meet Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem before travelling to Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia this week. At its first cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Rabin's Labour-led government decided to halt the establishment - pending review - of some 10 Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Last week, the housing ministry temporarily froze unsigned contracts for new building in existing settlements while a similar review was conducted. Although he has stopped short of a complete freeze, Mr Rabin hopes his gesture will win the US loan guarantees needed to help Israel finance the absorption of mass migration from the former Soviet Union, and facilitate progress in Middle East talks. Washington and the Arabs regard settlement expansion as an obstacle to peace. Mr Baker said: 'Let me say it will make a big difference, certainly with respect to the views and positions of the US. I am quite confident that we will be able to make the point with the Arab countries and Arab representatives that we now have a government here that is serious about limiting this question with regard to the settlements.' However, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian peace team that will meet Mr Baker on Monday, said: 'We think that all settlements have to stop and are illegal, and if we are to maintain the integrity of the peace process, then all settlement activities must come to a halt.' Mr Baker, whose meeting with Mr Rabin was picketed by rightwing demonstrators opposed to the peace process, spent 90 minutes with Mr Rabin immediately after arriving in Jerusalem. The meeting was the start of Mr Baker's five-nation trip to revitalise the Middle East talks. He said that while no date had been set the talks were expected to resume in Rome in September.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC THINK TANK COMBINES FAITH, JUSTICE;  </P> <P> RELIGION: THE CENTER OF CONCERN IS DEDICATED TO SOLVING WORLD PROBLEMS WITH  INSPIRATION AND EXPERTISE.  </P> <P> There's nothing about the big white clapboard house in the family-oriented  neighborhood of northeast Washington to suggest that its occupants are out to  change the world.  </P> <P> For the past 17 years, that has been precisely the goal of the Center of  Concern, a kind of Roman Catholic think tank dedicated to solving worldwide  problems of injustice by throwing expertise and religious commitment at them.  </P> <P> "We're bleeding-heart liberals, but we do our homework," said Father James Hug,  director of the center.  </P> <P> "From the earliest beginnings of the center, we have tried to bring a faith  perspective to the cause of justice," said Father Peter Henriot, who was  director until leaving earlier this year for a yearlong sabbatical in Africa.  "It is not simply a matter of linking faith and justice, but of seeing that the  one is incomplete without the other."  </P> <P> In the 17 years since the Center of Concern was founded with the joint backing  of the Society of Jesus and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, it has  played a significant role in the church's social justice ministry.  </P> <P> Through books, pamphlets, study guides, videotapes, seminars, workshops,  symposiums and consultations, the center has provided expertise and inspiration  to a wide range of people and on a variety of topics.  </P> <P> With a senior staff of six, the center last year produced 10 books and four  videotapes and led or participated in nearly a score of conferences and  seminars on topics ranging from the international debt crisis to an exploration  of women's liberation.  </P> <P> "Our agenda emerges out of the sense of need and the interest of people on the  staff," said Hug.  </P> <P> One example of the center's work was the role staff members played in the  Catholic bishops' pastoral on economics, from start to finish. Four center  staff members participated at the preliminary hearings held to help shape the  pastoral, Hug said.  </P> <P> Then the center was asked to critique the first draft of the pastoral. "We were  told our critique had the single greatest influence" on the final draft, Hug  said.  </P> <P> Once the final document was released, Hug did a condensed version of the  pastoral for wide distribution in the churches, and Henriot produced a  videotape on it.  </P> <P> "By not being a part of the (bishops') conference, but by being the friendly  critic, we were able to have a strong influence," he said.  </P> <P> A key part of the center's aim currently, he said, is the development of  networks -- the putting together of people and groups with common concerns.  "There is a real need for global collaboration," he said, "a growing sense that  we have to be able to collaborate with people in different parts of the world.  . . .  </P> <P> "We try to see ourselves as brokers, putting together people from other parts  of the world with key people in this country."  </P> <P> Not all of the center's activities are rigorously cerebral. Every year, in what  has become a welcome tradition, the staff throws a big "y'all come" potluck  picnic for the scores of people -- Protestant as well as Catholic -- in the  nation's capital who work on behalf of social justice.  </P> <P> It is a welcome opportunity for people with common goals and similar  perspectives to renew old friendships and make new ones.  </P> <P> The guest list for the picnic is not screened as carefully as, say, a White  House dinner, and one year the invitation was inadvertently read on a local  radio station. "I thought there were an awful lot of people I didn't know,"  Henriot said, recalling the confusion.  </P> <P> But the burgers and baked beans kept coming, and everyone got fed.  </P> <P> While founded by the Jesuits and the bishops' conference, the center remains  independent of both -- "a central player in the mix without being part of it,"  the director said.  </P> <P> Its budget, currently just over $600,000, comes from individual contributions,  fees for lectures and other staff services, and from educational outreach  programs.  </P> <P> Henriot sees some irony in the fact that the house that now accommodates the  Center of Concern, with all of its liberal, post-Vatican II ideas, was  previously occupied by a group of Mexican nuns who had been brought here to  serve as cooks at a nearby seminary, now defunct.  </P> <P> Over every window in the house the nuns had nailed up colorful portrayals of  the bleeding sacred heart of Jesus, a devotional symbol in high favor with some  conservative Catholics.  </P> <P> The nuns "put them up as protection against break-ins," Henriot explained. It  was an expression of spirituality not appreciated by the urbane and  sophisticated Jesuits, who promptly took them down.  </P> <P> "Within a week, we were broken into," he said.  </P></p>

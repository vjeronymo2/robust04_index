			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANDFILL GROUP APOLOGIZES FOR FLYER MISSTATING DUMP'S SUPPORT  </P> <P> A group of landfill firms trying to win support for a garbage dump in Elsmere  Canyon has circulated a flyer throughout Los Angeles County incorrectly  implying that the Santa Clarita City Council has endorsed the landfill proposed  for construction just outside city limits.  </P> <P> Bill Kalpakoff, president of the California Disposal Assn., apologized for the  flyer Wednesday, saying the trade group would clarify the city's position in a  later mailing. "I'll make sure it's corrected," he said.  </P> <P> The council has repeatedly said it will not officially support or oppose the  dump until it reviews an environmental impact report on the project expected  this spring. Mayor Jo Anne Darcy called the flyer "pretty presumptuous."  </P> <P> "There's no agreement," Darcy added. "It's not a done deal."  </P> <P> Jill Klajic, a local anti-dump activist, said the flyer damages the efforts of  Santa Clarita citizens who oppose the landfill. "This is awful, this is just  awful," Klajic said.  </P> <P> About 1,000 flyers were mailed last month to the media, elected officials,  chambers of commerce and community leaders in the county, said Hy Weitzman,  executive director of the association. The one-page flyer touted a tentative  agreement between the Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of  Supervisors to operate a dump in Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> "It appears now that there is a light at the end of the garbage crisis tunnel,"  the flyer began. "If all goes as planned, and there are no political delays  caused by opposing groups, we could have additional landfill space available as  early as 1995."  </P> <P> The flyer continues: "The proposed new landfill will be located in Elsmere  Canyon, near the city of Santa Clarita. Five entities are involved: the city  and county of Los Angeles, the County Sanitation Districts, the BKK Corporation  and the city of Santa Clarita."  </P> <P> The flyer also says that Santa Clarita would be given land by the city of Los  Angeles for a city hall site and would be paid for each ton of garbage dumped  in the canyon.  </P> <P> The flyer does not mention, however, that Santa Clarita would receive the land  and money only if the Santa Clarita City Council agrees not to oppose the dump  or that the council has not approved the agreement.  </P> <P> Weitzman said he was not aware that Santa Clarita had not endorsed the dump and  said the association did not intend to misrepresent the city. Weitzman said he  obtained his information for the flyer from the County Sanitation Districts.  </P> <P> Steve Maguin, head of solid waste management for the Sanitation Districts, said  the districts are well aware that Santa Clarita has not endorsed the Elsmere  dump and that the flyer probably resulted from a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> Weitzman said the California Disposal Assn. is a trade group composed of about  35 companies in the county and is affiliated with the statewide California  Refuse Removal Council. The association plans to send out monthly flyers to  keep local leaders aware of plans for landfills, Weitzman said.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, meanwhile, has scheduled a public forum to  discuss the city's options concerning the dump. The forum will be held Jan. 24  at 6:30 p.m. in the Hart High School auditorium.  </P></p>

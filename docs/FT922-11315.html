			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Books: Mightier than the bully - FT Children's Book of the Month I SAW ESAU edited by Iona and Peter Opie, illustrated by Maurice Sendak Walker Books Pounds 9.99, 160 pages SIR Walter Scott was greatly troubled by the initial response from scholars and men of letters to his proposal in 1832 that he produce a work on fairy tales. Wasn't such a thing beneath the dignity of a great literary man such as himself? The consequence was that he found himself obliged to make it 'a neat thing' that would be 'obnoxious to ridicule'. This story is told in the preface to a book entitled The Classic Fairy Tales, published almost 20 years ago by Iona and Peter Opie. If the study of children's literature in our day is no longer felt to be beneath contempt, we have in part the Opies to thank. Over the past 40 years, Iona and Peter Opie have made an inestimable contribution  - in such books as The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren (1959), The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951) and Tail Feathers from Mother Goose (1988)  - to our understanding of the relationship between literature and the oral tradition in so far as it relates to the world of childhood. Assiduous folklorists, they have been the Brothers Grimm of our times; and their studies have always been enlivened by a characteristic mixture of childish curiosity and academic rigour, humour and seriousness. This month sees the publication of I Saw Esau, a remarkable collaboration between the Opies and the acclaimed illustrator of children's books, Maurice Sendak, author of Where the Wild Things Are, In the Night Kitchen and many other award-winning titles. Sendak's most revolutionary work was first published in the 1960s, and it was shocking for its lack of sentimentality. Sendak set that whole generation of children's illustrators a positive example by confronting childhood fears head on  - the fear of the dark; the fear of monsters; the fear of feeling helpless and small in a world of giants. Somehow his illustrations managed to tame, normalise, and even to domesticate such anxieties. You might even say that he was at one with all those efforts that have been made in the 20th century  - by psychoanalysis, surrealism and much else  - to bring about a fruitful, healing accommodation between the world of fantasy and everyday reality. The new book has a curious history. The Opies gathered these rhymes in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and the collection was published in a small, limited edition  - paper was strictly rationed in those days. One copy alone survived from that printing, tucked away in the back of a cupboard. Forty years later it was rediscovered and shown to Maurice Sendak in New York who, enthused by the content, agreed to illustrate it. This collection of 170 rhymes is subtitled 'The schoolchild's pocket book' and it is indeed a vade mecum, a book for all occasions, zestful, humorous, but also savage and macabre. There are rhymes of insult and retaliation; rhymes of teasing and repartee; counting rhymes, skipping rhymes; tongue twisters, riddles and general teasers; lashings of nonsense and bamboozling circular narratives. Sendak has illustrated it in zestful colour throughout, enthusiastically filling up every available inch of blank space with illustrations small, medium and large  - squawling babies; shrieking maids in mob caps; horned ogres with vast, cavernous mouths; leaping dogs and cavorting donkeys; and everywhere, those rumbustious children in rags and tatters and big top hats, fleeing, skipping, jumping, cartwheeling off the edge of the page. There are as many different kinds and style of illustration as there are subjects to match and fishes in the seas. What never fails to charm and surprise us about the collection itself is the fact that there is such a demonstrable continuity between past and present. Among the nonsense verses we find the following familiar lines, for example: One fine day in the middle of the night / Two dead men got up to fight / A blind man came to see fair play / A dumb man came to shout hurray. A note to the rhyme informs us that this is one of the oldest forms of nonsense, and then goes on to cite an amusement that was jotted down in the notebook of a minstrel in 1480. The translation reads as follows: I saw three headless (men) / playing at ball / A handless man served / them all / While three mouthless (men) / sang and howled / Three legless (men) / drove them away . . . Rhymes may die for whole generations, it seems, then mysteriously reappear in a slightly modified form elsewhere. Like the thistles in Ted Hughes's fine poem of that name, they come fighting back over the same ground, vigorous as ever. In this book, they are part of the schoolchild's armoury  -a way of overcoming fear and embarrassment, a magical means of incapacitating the school bully with mere words. And mere words, of course, endure.</p>

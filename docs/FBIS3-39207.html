			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that Turkey  views positively and supports the decision NATO made on  Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday.    In a statement prior to the True Path Party General  Administrative Council meeting, Ciller said Turkey has for a  long time been defending the need to preserve  Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity and to respect human  rights. Pointing out the need to lift the arms embargo or to  launch an air raid to achieve that goal, Ciller recalled that  Turkey had submitted this plan to the United Nations. She  continued:    [Begin Ciller recording] We had earlier proposed that the  Serbs positioned on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo be moved  back 20 km and that they surrender their arms. We had also  proposed that an air raid be launched in the event they did not  comply with these conditions -- in other words, that a  transition period be established prior to the air raid. We  support this decision made by NATO. We believe that it is  positive. [end recording]    Ciller said the violence is continuing in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and humanity is waging a struggle for life and dignity. Pointing  out that the innocent people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should either  be given the opportunity to defend themselves or be protected,  Ciller added that the NATO decision is a significant step in  this direction. Noting that during her contacts with various  leaders she was informed that such a development would occur,  Ciller concluded by saying:    [Begin Ciller recording] I hope that a better solution will  be reached through peaceful means within 10 days. We will stand  by this decision to the end. I would like to state once more  the need to begin the air raid immediately if any clashes take  place. [end recording]</p>

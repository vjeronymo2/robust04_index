In the area of Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  former allies are engaged in artillery duels while Moslem  artillery units are firing at Croats in central  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the region of Novi Travnik, Kiseljak and  Fojnica.    Croats are shelling Moslems in the valley of the Lasva, and  the shelling is particularly heavy near Gornji Vakuf and  Bugojno, also in central Bosnia.    Regular troops from the Republic of Croatia are also still  fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite U.N. Security Council  decisions that they must withdraw.    The Croatian Army launched a strong artillery attack from  Croatian territory against Serb areas in Posavina, a region in  northern Bosnia along the border with Croatia. The attack  directly threatened the Bijeljina-Banja Luka road which links  eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic.    Bosnian Serb military circles interpreted this attack as  resulting from the latest Croat-Moslem ceasefire agreement and  underscored that Bosnian Serb forces did not return fire after  Croat artillery launched attacks from the left bank of the Sava.    Provocative and offensive actions by Moslem units against  the  Serb side also continued in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and were  even stepped up in some areas, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb  military circles.    The heaviest Moslem mortar and artillery attacks took place  in eastern Bosnia from the regions of Kalesija and Olovo, where  the Moslem infantry was also active.    Meanwhile, Moslem units are regrouping and moving their  weapons on the Kladanj-Zivinica direction.    In northwestern Bosnia, Moslem artillery-infantry attacks on  Serb territory, which began several days ago, continued from the  region of Bihac.</p>

First deputy chairman Peter Weiss told the deputies  who were present that parliament chairman Ivan Gasparovic had  left the parliament building together with Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar immediately after the unsuccessful talks held by  the representatives of parliamentary parties this morning.    According to TA SR [Slovak news agency], this meeting had in  effect ended after the prime minister refused to join the talks  because Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, was  present at the meeting. Vladimir Meciar does not recognize  Milan Knazko as an elected parliamentary representative.  Because the representatives of parliamentary parties refused to  accept Meciar's request that Milan Knazko should leave the  meeting, Vladimir Meciar said, according to parliament deputy  chairman Ludovit Cernak, that the meeting was not legitimate and  was anticonstitutional. Immediately after that, Vladimir Meciar  left the room.</p>

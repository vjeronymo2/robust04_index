			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Behind the Curtain of Massacre in Iraqi </F> Kurdistan"]    [Text] The wretched hands of America, Turkey, and France  are clearly visible in the savage massacre that is taking place  against the Muslim Kurds in Iraq.    The wave of massacre of Kurdish Muslims adopts its true  meaning when viewed precisely within the framework of plots by  arrogance which are aimed at the dismemberment of Iraq and at  creating a reliable base for the West's forces in northern Iraq.    The issue took on a serious nature with the creation of a  "safe haven" in Iraq. And it was within the framework of this  plan that American and French forces, using Turkish support  facilities, tried to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan. The formation  of a parliament followed by the establishment of an independent  government constituted the next phase in the series of more  serious steps by arrogance to create a "second Israel" in the  region. And now the Western countries and especially America  feel that the Muslim Kurdish forces are obstructing their  objectives and that their plans to fully dismember Kurdistan may  be foiled.    It is precisely because of this that during its recent talks  with Jalal Talabani, Washington made the continuation of  military, economic, and security assistances as well as  propaganda support for Talabani contingent on getting rid of  Islamic Kurdish movements and explicitly called for the  uprooting of Islamic groups from northern Iraq.    Turkey too has displayed a nauseating stance on this issue.  On the one hand, the Ankara government feels that fanning the  flames of secessionist movements in northern Iraq also affects  Turkey's national security and has explicitly expressed its  concern over joint U.S.-French plans in northern Iraq which  specifically come within the framework of creating a safe haven  in Iraqi Kurdistan and, on the other, it is tempted to gain  access to Kirkuk's oil resources and to play the role of the  West's gendarme in northern Iraq.    Public opinion in Iraqi Kurdistan finds it difficult to  understand why the Ankara government has started the most savage  massacre and suppression of the Kurds in Turkey while at the  same time it is being so generous in strengthening the Kurds in  Iraqi Kurdistan. Moreover, the officials of the Ankara  government have repeatedly used the Iraqi Kurdish leaders to  achieve their goals, even during the suppression of the Kurds in  Turkey. Turkey even granted Talabani a "Turkish diplomatic  passport" and included him in a Turkish delegation that visited  Washington for talks.    Even if the Ankara government considers all these things to  belong to the past and claims that it has reviewed its past  policies, nevertheless the issue is that today operations by  America, France, and Britain in Iraqi Kurdistan within the  framework of Hammer Force are carried out with the help of  Turkish support units, specifically at Incirlik base.    It is now very obvious that from its very outset, the Hammer  Force never intended to establish stability and balance in the  region; that it has always tried to throw the region off  balance, to create instability, and to establish a "second  Israel" in the region; and that it has gradually implemented  plans that have harmed and will continue to harm Turkey too.    In addition, let us not forget that it has never been  possible to establish equilibrium and stability in this  sensitive area with a "hammer" and that experience has shown  that any abuse of power--and in such a nauseating manner, at  that--has only led and will lead to a vicious cycle of  uncontrollable events in the entire region.    The major point here is that once again, the Iraqi Kurds  have  been fooled by America and its other allies; and it is highly  possible that this time too they will only realize the depth of  the tragedy when it is too late and when even those who consider  themselves in control of the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan will  have lost control.    Whatever the objectives, methods, and outcome of this  disgraceful game, the view of the Islamic Republic of Iran of  the incidents in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have been repeatedly  pointed out by the officials of the system, can be summed up as  follows:    1. The people of Iraqi Kurdistan, like the rest of the Iraqi  people, have suffered from tragedies throughout the past few  decades, and the solution of their problems cannot be separated  from or placed outside the framework of a radical solution to  the problems of Iraq.    2. Any type of solution to the problem of Iraqi Kurdistan  should be sought within the framework of safeguarding the  independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Iraq;  and naturally any type of secessionist movement, even under the  pretext of saving the Iraqi people from Baghdad's pressures, is  unjustifiable.    3. Any decision, movement, or step for solving the problem  of the Iraqi people should come from the Iraqi people themselves  and should certainly not involve political or military  interventions by foreigners. If not, foreigners will get an  opportunity to infiltrate the area. Today we see how the Muslim  Kurds of Iraq are getting a bloodbath from other groups of Iraqi  Kurds and how, within the framework of dismembering Iraqi  Kurdistan, once again more people are being expelled from their  homes and are facing "forced deportation"; and if they refuse,  they have no guarantees that they will stay alive.    All these problems and incidents once again testify to the  just, correct, and strong stances of the Islamic Republic of  Iran vis-a-vis the problems of Iraq--both as far as the Shiites  in the South, the Kurds in the North, and people any other place  in this oppressed land are concerned--and it proves that America  and its allies are pursuing wretched objectives in the region  and only want to exploit the Kurds and others for their own  motives.</p>

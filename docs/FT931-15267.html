			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Saddam defiant as allies bomb Iraqi missile sites: More than 100 US, British and French aircraft take part in raid IRAQI president Saddam Hussein remained defiant last night after US, British and French combat aircraft launched their first strike against Iraq since the Gulf War two years ago. The three-hour raid, seemingly limited to attacks on surface-to-air missile sites and command centres in the southern no-fly zone set up by the allies last August, was launched from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk in the Gulf and from air bases in Saudi Arabia. Washington described the raid as a success, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said allied aircraft had inflicted serious damage on Iraqi targets. One Iraqi soldier and three civilians were killed in the attack, according to Iraq's INA news agency. Three soldiers and four civilians were wounded. In a bellicose response, Mr Saddam, in a televised speech to the nation, vowed that Baghdad would confront any future raid and urged his depleted air force to fight back. Iraqi forces met last night's raid only with a modest amount of anti-aircraft fire, and all allied aircraft were said to have returned safely. The Iraqi leader said: 'Another battle has started. Another jihad (holy war) ordained by God, so that we can attain another great victory for you, the Iraqi people.' His tone contradicted an earlier apparent climbdown at the United Nations, where Iraq pledged to halt incursions into Kuwaiti territory and to authorise UN flights into Iraq, two of the UN's main demands. US president George Bush - who yesterday entered the last week of his presidency - said he had no reservations about ordering the attack. 'A coalition of strong allies has performed in superb fashion,' he said. He underlined Washington's commitment to the sovereignty and security of Kuwait by recommitting some ground forces to the country. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said a 'task force' - which according to US army chiefs would number some 1,700 including support staff - was being dispatched. Mr Fitzwater noted that Baghdad had earlier renewed its intention to retake Kuwait. An editorial in the Iraqi government newspaper al-Jumhouriyah yesterday revived Iraq's claim of sovereignty over Kuwait, vowing that 'Kuwait shall return to Iraq in defiance of the Security Council and America' and as an 'integral part of Iraq'. The strike involved 80 strike aircraft and 30 support planes. It included British Tornado strike aircraft, six of which are stationed at Dhahran in north-eastern Saudi Arabia, with cover provided by six of France's Mirage 2000 fighters, also based there. 'Preliminary information indicates the mission was accomplished,' said Mr Fitzwater. 'All of our planes have returned to their bases.' He said the targets were 'several missile sites' in the southern part of Iraq. The US and its coalition partners stood ready to take 'additional actions' to assure Iraqi compliance with ceasefire terms, he added. Mr George Stephanopoulos, a spokesman for Mr Bill Clinton, said the President-elect fully supported the air attack. He said Mr Clinton stood 'four-square with the president in his determination to ensure compliance with all relevant UN resolutions'. In London, Mr John Major warned that the 'limited and proportionate' response to Iraq's violations of UN resolutions could be followed by further military strikes. At the UN in New York, ambassadors of the US, Britain, Russia and France - the four permanent members of the Security Council - formally warned Iraq to expect further action if it did not comply with the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. Their warning was delivered to Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador at the UN, who said after the raid, but before Mr Saddam's broadcast, that his government would remove no more equipment from Baghdad's former naval base at Umm Qasr, located in territory that has now been ruled by the UN to belong to Kuwait. Nor would it block UN inspectors from flying their own planes into Iraq. Mr Yoshio Hatano, Japanese president of the Security Council, last night told reporters that it appeared that Iraq had met the demands made concerning border incursions and the transporting of UN weapons inspectors. But he was waiting for a formal Iraqi letter to that effect. These recent actions by Iraq, along with violations of the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel established in August by the western allies, threatening missile movements and attacks on UN relief operations in Kurdistan, formed part of what the US and its partners saw as a pattern of provocation by Iraq. In the past, similar conciliatory statements by Iraqi envoys have also been undermined by defiant words from their president at home.

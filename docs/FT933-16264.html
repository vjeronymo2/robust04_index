			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Warning not to cut housing cash A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs is expected to warn the government tomorrow against reducing the proportion of public money used to fund housing association projects. Associations have been expected to raise an increasing proportion of private finance to construct or acquire homes for social housing. A report from the environment committee, however, will urge ministers that the rate of government grants to housing associations should not fall further unless procurement costs fall or the government as a whole takes a view about the impact of a lower rate both on rent affordability and on benefit dependency. Average grant rates have fallen from 75 per cent in 1991-92 to 67 per cent in 1993-94, as the crackdown on public spending has increased pressure on the housing budget. The Treasury has already identified the housing budget as an area for possible savings. The committee emphasises that if the rate falls further it will increase the need for housing associations to raise more money privately as well as through forcing up rents. But, it argues, raising rents may discourage potential private investors, reluctant to commit themselves to the increased risk that tenants will not be able to keep up their payments. It expresses particular concern about the position of specialist and smaller housing associations, which already have the most difficulty in attracting private finance. Officials at the Department of the Environment expect the committee to be relatively neutral on the question of allowing private developers to compete for government housing grant. Some Tories have enthusiastically put forward the idea as a way of getting better value for money and of challenging the dominant position of the housing associations. In what looks like a compromise, however, the report is said merely to recommend a study into the feasibility of such a move. Home, costly home, Page 12</p>

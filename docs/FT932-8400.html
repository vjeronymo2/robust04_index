			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Europe's new cold warriors: Mars is stepping up its battle with Unilever in the ice cream market The European cold war between Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, and Mars, the US food manufacturer, is hotting up. This month, a new front was opened when Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission launched an investigation into ice cream makers' distribution practices. The inquiry, which will focus on the Pounds 350m UK market for 'impulse' ice creams typically sold by small corner shops, marks an important advance for Mars' three-year legal and regulatory assault on Unilever's grip over ice cream sales across Europe. The ferocity of the conflict, and the boisterous public relations campaigns mounted by the two sides, show that this is no ordinary trade dispute. At its heart lies a struggle for a rapidly-expanding business worth billions of pounds a year, which is central to both companies' future. Unilever is defending a commanding 40 per cent of European ice cream sales, valued at about Pounds 6bn annually at retail prices. Ice cream is among the most profitable and fast-growing of all the group's Pounds 11bn worldwide food operations - owing to a stream of product innovations which have recently injected new life into a previously unexciting business. The catalyst was Mars' launch in 1989 of premium-priced ice cream versions of its chocolate bars. Almost overnight, it created a thriving luxury sector of the market into which many other manufacturers, including Unilever, have moved and which is now the industry's biggest source of profits growth. The problem for Mars is to avoid becoming a victim of its own success, as rivals increasingly challenge its early lead. The company needs to secure its position quickly to achieve satisfactory returns from its heavy investments in ice cream - but also because it is under increasing competitive pressure in its other businesses worldwide. Mars' answer has been to attack Unilever's control over distribution and, in particular, its long-standing use of a practice known as 'cabinet exclusivity'. This involves supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to small retailers who sell the bulk of impulse ice creams, on condition that the freezers do not carry competitors' products. Hostilities broke out in 1990, when Unilever obtained a court injunction in Ireland prohibiting Mars ice creams from being stocked in Unilever cabinets. Mars retaliated by appealing against the ruling and complaining to the European Commission that the Anglo-Dutch group's distribution methods violated EC competition law. Last year, Brussels handed Mars a partial victory by outlawing separate arrangements used by Unilever and Scholler, a German ice cream producer, to keep rivals' products out of German retail outlets. The European Commission expressed reservations about the commercially more important issue of cabinet exclusivity, but it said it needed time to investigate. When EC competition authorities will pronounce is not known. Nor is it clear what will happen if Brussels, the MMC and the Irish court hearing Mars' appeal reach different conclusions. But for the two companies, at least, the issues in dispute are clear-cut. Mars contends that cabinet exclusivity unfairly inhibits entry into the ice cream market and penalises smaller producers, particularly in the many small retail outlets which have room for only one freezer. Unilever counters that it is entitled to exclusive use of its own cabinets, and that its strength in ice cream stems largely from its products and marketing expertise. It also points out that six companies have entered the UK ice cream market in the past five years. These arguments have failed to convince Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director general of fair trading. When referring the case to the MMC, he suggested that cabinet exclusivity was 'a major factor' in the growth of Unilever's share of ice cream sales and that consumers would benefit if retailers were free to stock a wider choice of products. Sir Bryan's stance has heartened Mars. Some food manufacturers and independent industry experts, however, claim to detect a hint of desperation in the company's legal campaign and its readiness to shed some of its habitual secrecy in an effort to drum up favourable publicity. The campaign comes at a time when the privately-owned Mars is fighting an uphill battle in established core businesses, notably confectionery, of which it is the world's largest producer after Nestle of Switzerland. The company's shares of its three biggest markets - the US, Britain and Germany - are in decline, in spite of an aggressive marketing effort and product innovations and relaunches. Rivals are also nibbling away at Mars' sales of pet food, its other main product line, in several countries. Some observers attribute these reverses to senior managers' preoccupation with the ice cream business and to a recent sweeping reorganisation of Mars' European operations. Several competitors report an unusually large number of job applications from disaffected Mars executives, who say the company's new European structure has left them confused about their roles. Making a success of ice cream appears, therefore, of vital importance to Mars, which has built a Pounds 20m plant in eastern France to supply the entire European market. So far, however, its market penetration has been uneven. Though the company will not disclose its total European ice cream sales, the bulk is believed still to be in Britain, where it had about 10 per cent of the Pounds 770m ice cream market last year. Mars' strength in the wrapped impulse sector, which is at the heart of the distribution battle, depends on whose figures you believe. The company claims 16 per cent of the UK market last year. Unilever puts Mars' share at 10 per cent. Both agree, though, that Unilever had about two-thirds of the market, and that Mars' share fell slightly from 1991. What is clear is that competition in the UK is set to intensify following Nestles recent acquisition of Clarke Foods, the UK's second largest ice cream maker. Not only is Nestle the world's biggest food manufacturer; it also distributes and stocks Mars' ice cream in the 20,000 cabinets it owns. Nestle will not say whether the arrangement will continue beyond this year. But that seems doubtful, given that the two companies compete directly in confectionery and that Nestle says it strongly favours cabinet exclusivity. No wonder Mars' lawyers are working overtime. But how much does the company stand to gain if they succeed? Most observers agree that the profits and sales of Unilever, which has invested Pounds 20m in exclusive cabinets in the UK alone, could be dented if the practice were banned. But few think the damage would be severe or long-lasting. Mars says its products emerged as best-sellers from a recent trial by a chain of UK newsagents, which replaced freezers supplied by manufacturers with its own cabinets. Since the trial was instigated and financed by Mars, though, the results can hardly be deemed conclusive. But many independent experts think Mars is investing too much faith in its efforts to open the market. They point out that competitors of all sizes are still pouring into the premium ice cream business. Many offer broader ranges than Mars, which has relied entirely on making ice cream versions of its leading chocolate brands. 'I think Mars is rather behind in the competitive game now,' says Mr Clive Richardson of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite. 'It should have won these legal battles three years ago, when it had the market to itself.' Undaunted, Mars insists it will press its legal campaign to its conclusion and is confident of victory. But whatever the courts and regulators decide, the company's struggle to re-capture its early lead looks as though it may have only just begun.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD ICE CREAM SALES, 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Pounds m) at manufacturers' selling price                  Unilever  Nestle  Scholler  Haagen Dazs  Breyer  Mars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe              1,500     200       400           50       -   150 North America         200     150         -          200     300   100 Rest of World         150     150         -          100       -     - Total               1,900     500       400          350     300   250  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNILEVER'S EUROPEAN ICE CREAM SALES, 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 Share of               Market volume   Market value*     Unilever      Unilever's                  (litres m)     (Pounds m)  market share  European sales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                 520          1,000           40%             25% Italy                   400            700           40%             19% UK                      420            500           40%             13% Scandinavia             300            400           35%             11% Spain                   180            300           30%              7% France                  320            400           20%              5% Benelux                 160            300           30%              7% Other                   200            300           50%             11% Total                 2,500          3,900           40%            100%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * at manufacturers' selling price  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Henderson Crosthwaite  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

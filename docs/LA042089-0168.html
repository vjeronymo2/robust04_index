			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HALL, MASTER CHORALE MERGER APPLAUDED BY ARTS COMMUNITY  </P> <P> Leaders of the county's musical community reacted positively to Tuesday's  announcement that the William Hall Chorale of Pasadena would be merged into the  Master Chorale of Orange County, forming a 150-member "superchorale" under  Hall's direction.  </P> <P> At the same time, they held out hope that the newly strengthened organization  might still merge with Orange County's other choral organization, the Pacific  Chorale.  </P> <P> "This is clearly a forward step," said Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the  Orange County Performing Arts Center, who was present for the announcement. "It  clearly strengthens both the financial and the artistic base of the Master  Chorale."  </P> <P> Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific Symphony, who also attended the  meeting at which the merger was announced, agreed that it "is a very good  thing. I'm pleased to see Master Chorale is strengthening its forces. I look  forward to much success for the chorale."  </P> <P> At the same time, he said: "My personal hope continues to be that both the  Pacific Chorale and the Master Chorale could eventually merge, providing one  extraordinary group of singers which would truly be Orange County's ensemble."  </P> <P> The symphony has performed with the Pacific Chorale for the past 10 seasons and  is committed to performing with it through next season, Spisto said. Any future  decisions regarding joint performances, he added, would have to involve the  symphony's incoming new music director.  </P> <P> Last year, after 10 months of negotiations, talks between the Master and  Pacific chorales collapsed when members of the Pacific insisted that their  longtime musical director, John Alexander, head the merged organization.  </P> <P> Alexander said yesterday that "the great sadness of the announcement is the  demise of the William Hall Chorale," which has "provided a major chorale force  in Southern California."  </P> <P> Alexander added that his organization is "on a very firm footing" and "stronger  than we've ever been. Any arts organization is sustained by the enthusiasm of  its supporters. The Pacific Chorale has that. We can live side by side as long  as the organizations respect each other."  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we'll retain our subscription base and augment it," said Anne Nutt,  who chairs the Pacific Chorale.  </P> <P> Pacific's development director, Bonnie McClain, predicted that the merger is  "not going to affect our funding," since "our subscription base it pretty well  set." She noted that the Pacific Chorale's repertoire is strictly classical,  where the Master Chorale appeals to those who "want to go to pops and Broadway  concerts."  </P> <P> The question of whether the county can support two choral organizations remains  open, as far as the Pacific Chorale is concerned.  </P> <P> "I personally think it would be better if there was one chorale," McClain said.  "Things would be more cohesive. We'll see."  </P></p>

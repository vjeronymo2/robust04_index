			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daria Gorodisky: "Fini: Split in North Is </F> Bossi's Fault"]    [Excerpts] Milan -- "If the anti-Occhetto [secretary of the  Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] front is split in the north,  the fault lies with the lamentable selfishness not of the  League, but of [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi, who  refused to accept the AN [National Alliance] in the pole of  freedoms." Speaking in Milan yesterday, [AN leader] Gianfranco  Fini did not tire of saying so to the crowd that filled piazza  del Duomo (almost 20,000 people), and to reporters, both Italian  and foreign, curious to observe this new Italian Right.  [passage omitted]    Fini is convinced that a large proportion of League voters  will support the AN this time and that in any case, "since the  League is a regional phenomenon, it cannot impose conditions."    But Fini wanted to discuss other matters. He was keen to  stress that the national and social Right is ready to govern:  "This is the only new factor in Italian politics, whereas the  Left is an exacerbated repetition of what has been done for the  past 30 years." We must beware, therefore, because "politics has  been dominated by the Center-Left for the past 30 years. If  Occhetto wins, we will have a Left-Center coalition government."    The danger, Fini said, comes not from the Right, but from  Occhetto's men (who, in the guise of progressives, in fact  "favor the major industrial groups to the detriment of small and  medium enterprises. There can be no economic development under  the PDS") and "from the specters of [Mino] Martinazzoli's  [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] and [Pact for  Italy leader] Mario Segni's center, who want to help to  establish a government of left-wing forces." The MSI [Italian  Social Movement] secretary stressed that this center is  "ambiguous because it has sought unacceptable allies such as La  Malfa [Italian Republican Party Secretary]. We thought had  disappeared without trace, like former Prime Minister Amato,  champion of antisocial policies, and that Jurassic relic of the  First Republic that answers to the name of Zanone [Italian  Liberal Party]. We may yet have to report them to the police  for attempting to restore the five-party alliance." In the  evening, however, he added in Genoa that "poor Martinazzoli is  aware now that he is bound to emerge the loser and, at the same  time as he rules out an accord with the Right, he shows that he  has already decided to reach an agreement with the Left." With  regard to the election results, Fini is sure that the AN "will  go well beyond 10 percent." And if the pole of freedoms were to  win, could Bossi-Attila ("who is still shouting about  corruption, but who has taken bribes, even though he blames it  on some idiot just passing through") become crucial to the  formation of a government? "This, on two conditions," Fini  said: "clarity on the issue of national unity and identity and  on the duties of a policy of solidarity between north and south  and between the strong and weak sectors of society."

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistani Inflexibility"] </F>   [Text] Why has Islamabad suddenly set its face against  continuation of the Indo-Pakistan dialogue initiated by the  Foreign Secretaries just two weeks ago? Two causes are  indicated. The first is the compulsions of domestic politics.  This factor has, of course, always had a decisive influence on  the Pakistani stand on bilateral talks. But the latest brusque  refusal to pick up the thread of the discussions between J.N.  Dixit and Shahryar Khan, is a particularly striking instance.  J.N. Dixit and Shaharyar Khan had themselves envisaged a  resumption of the dialogue soon enough. This was the  implication of the clear Indian offer to submit detailed  proposals in search of common ground on Siachen and Sir Creek.  This apart, Benazir Bhutto herself had given ample cause for the  belief she was interested in an understanding on Siachen. Since  then the climate in Pakistan has been anything but favourable  for serious talks with India.    Nawaz Sharif has stepped up efforts to portray the PM [prime  minister] as one who is inclined to do a deal with India on  Kashmir. The Pakistani decision not to go ahead with a  resolution in the UN General Assembly seeking to censure India  for alleged human rights violations has especially drawn much  flak in the Pakistani media as well as in the National Assembly.  Other domestic difficulties, too, have somewhat weakened her  position. Not the least of them has been her quarrels with her  mother and brother both of whom seem to be determined to  embarrass her in every possible way. If the upshot of all this  has been to persuade her not to accord relations with India a  high priority, it is a logical sequel.    Conceivably, the rigid tone of the Pakistan Foreign Office's  statement ruling out a continuation of the bilateral dialogue --  reflected in the call to "finalise modalities" for a plebiscite  in Kashmir -- may also mean a felt need for a review of all that  has been done to hasten annexation of Kashmir. Pending the  outcome of any such exercise, it is a common practice for  Foreign Offices to reiterate fundamental positions on  contentious issues with an air of finality. In purely rational  terms, a thorough review should be a natural corollary to the  failure of the frenetic campaign carried on by Pakistan abroad  to compel India to concede Kashmir. In the last five years,  Islamabad has left no stone unturned to convince the rest of the  world that India is committing a genocide in Kashmir and that  the only way of putting an end to it is for India to hand over  the territory to Pakistan. But this has hardly had the desired  impact. What then should be done? The policy-makers in  Islamabad cannot possibly avoid asking themselves this question  any longer. Further, Islamabad's tussle with pro-independence  Kashmiri groups in Pakistan has intensified. All this adds up  to a major challenge to both the security and foreign policy  establishments in Islamabad. How they will cope with it is hard  even to guess.  *</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Great Portland shows 7.3% fall to Pounds 16.2m GREAT PORTLAND Estates, the property investment company, reported a 7.3 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 16.2m, for the six months to end-September. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.4p from flat earnings of 5.6p. The company expects to maintain its total dividend for the year at 10p, but warned of possible future dividend cuts. 'In view of conditions in the property market, shareholders should not assume that the dividend can be maintained at this level,' said Mr Richard Peskin, chairman. He expected second half profits broadly similar to the first. 'Since I last reported some five months ago, interest rates have fallen but no real signs of increased economic activity are, as yet, discernible,' he said. The fall in profits was mainly due to a rise in net interest charges from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 19.4m, offset by a rise in rental income from Pounds 33.3m to Pounds 41m. This resulted from a series of acquisitions in 1991-92 which reduced central London exposure from 83 per cent to 67 per cent and increased retail and industrial property from 14 per cent to 24 per cent. The results benefited from a fall in the effective tax rate to 21 per cent, as a result of tax allowances on capital expenditure and prior year adjustments. This left post-tax profits at Pounds 12.9m, compared with Pounds 11.9m a year ago. Voids fell from 7 per cent of floor area to 6 per cent and from 10 per cent of gross rental income to 7.5 per cent. Tenants were found for over 125,000 sq ft of space, while 66,000 sq ft returned through lease expiries or tenant failures. COMMENT Yesterday's 7p fall in Great Portland's share price, triggered by the placing of a stake owned by Costain, interrupted their extraordinary recent performance. Over the past month, the shares have risen by more than 30 per cent, as its high dividend yield combined with lower interest rates and a flurry of London investment deals to spark an improvement in investor sentiment. This revival in confidence may now have run its course. Although no one was surprised by yesterday's hint of a forthcoming dividend cut, it underlines the pressures on Great Portland's cash flow. Some 15 per cent of its rental income may be eroded by lease expiries and tenant defaults over the next three years, resulting in, at best, relettings at lower rents and at worst, heavy bills for refurbishment and empty rates. Most analysts expect the dividend to fall by 20 per cent to 8p in the year to March 1994, which would put the shares, at 123p, on a prospective yield of 8.7 per cent. While that must have attractions for income funds, the case for Great Portland's shares is less clear when the falling value of its buildings are taken into account. On the admittedly bearish assumption that net assets fall to 160p by March next year, the shares are on a relatively narrow discount to assets of 23 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers' Association, who will step down from his post in  May, looked back at his term of office during which he was quite  busy in dealing with economic frictions between Japan and the  United States. On the Big Three, he said: "We can welcome the  fact that they are beginning to respond to our demand that `they  should make cars which suit the Japanese market.'" In this way,  he positively assessed the changes in the stand of the Big  Three, who have begun to produce cars with a steering wheel on  the right-hand side.</p>

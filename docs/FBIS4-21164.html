			<p>Against   Country   <F P=102> AB1404223594 Lagos NTA Television Network in English 2000  GMT 14 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> AB1404223594 </F> <F P=104>  Lagos NTA Television Network </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Excerpts] The Federal Government has rejected the recent  categorization of Nigeria by the United States of America as one  of the four countries not cooperating with it in the fight  against drug trafficking. The head of state, General Sani  Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today  in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives.  State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha  described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a  productive government-media partnership:    [Begin recording] Nguw: The head of  state's briefing centered on six issues: Government-press  relationship, the economic policy, foreign policy, the imminent  constitutional conference, drug trafficking, and the  Nigerian-Cameroon dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of  the highlights of the briefing was his reference to the United  States' recent listing of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in  the fight against drug trafficking as a political smoke screen,  without doubt a genuine component of the United States policy on  drug control. Gen. Abacha said the United States' pronouncement  was a surprise, especially as Nigeria's efforts at combating  drug trafficking are well known and have been recently applauded  by the American Embassy in Nigeria and the United States drug  administration. He said his administration would, however, not  be deterred in the fight against drug trafficking.    Abacha: Be that as it may, it should be understood  by all concerned that this administration is going to continue  its fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes just  from our concern to ensure that the drug taking culture does not  take firm roots in our society. We shall intensify our antidrug  crusade. Of course, we believe it is right to do so in our  national interest and to protect our society from its cancerous  effects that we have observed in Western societies. We urge the  Western governments to look inwards into their own societies and  curb the excessive appetite of their own citizens, which creates  the demand for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any  hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people. [passage  omitted]</p>

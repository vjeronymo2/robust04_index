The official Croatian news agency HINA said the shelling  broke out late Saturday and continued into Sunday morning. The  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) confirmed the fighting but not  the casualty report.    Shelling in the Gospic area of southern Croatia increased  Sunday with UN troops counting 87 Croatian Army shells to 80  fired by Serb forces. One shell landed 20 metres (yards) from a  positions held by Czech UN troops, while two mortar shells fell  between 100 and 200 metres (yards) from another Czech post,  UNPROFOR said. The Czechs had reported sporadic shelling in the  area late Saturday.    The fighting comes a week after both sides extended to March  31 a Christmas ceasefire. Until now the truce had been  respected in three of four zones controlled by secessionist  Serbs and monitored by UN troops.    The truce has been violated on numerous occasions, mainly  around the strategic Maslenica bridge, the only route linking  Zagreb with the heavily populated Dalmatian coastline in  southern Croatia.    Croatian Serbs seized the Krajina region in the civil war  that broke out in 1991 when Zagreb declared independence from  Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.</p>

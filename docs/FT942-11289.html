			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Wetherspoon recruits for a heady future Tim Martin, the 38-year-old New Zealander who founded and then floated the pub operator JD Wetherspoon, has brought in another young man to help him run the rapidly-expanding chain. Martin has shared the roles of chairman and managing director since the group came to the market in October, 1992 - a period which has seen the size of its estate grow from 44 pubs to 77. The choice of Mark McQuater, 34, as the group's new managing director seems partly designed to allay any concern among institutional investors that Martin might overstretch himself, as the group expands beyond its London base. If reassuring institutions was their brief, the headhunters who came up with McQuater appear to have pressed all the right buttons. A Scottish chartered accountant, he has experience with both big-company procedures in the drinks industry and the City. For the last five years McQuater has been working in Scotland with Natwest Venture, the clearing bank's venture capital arm. Before that, he spent three years with Scottish and Newcastle Breweries, working on corporate transactions and group planning. McQuater - who Martin first met in 1987, while signing a deal with S&amp;N  - will concentrate on the day-to-day management of the group, allowing the chairman to concentrate on strategic development. JD Wetherspoon's slick marketing - which involves reserving up to a third of its bar space for non-smokers - has proved successful; another 10 pubs will soon open. The splitting of his roles is unlikely to mean a drop in salary for Martin, who last year earned Pounds 128,000; but the issue is scarcely a burning concern. The group's shares have more than doubled since coming to the market, and the 18 per cent stake held by Martin and his wife is now worth nearly Pounds 25m.</p>

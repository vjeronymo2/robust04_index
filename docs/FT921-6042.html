			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Cartels The European Court's ruling that Commission decisions should be signed in all Community languages by Mr Jacques Delors brings to mind an ancient, but alas defunct English legal defence that you cannot be successfully charged by a policeman wearing his helmet back to front. Investors would be unwise to assume, though, that other EC cartel culprits will now get their fines quashed. The court tends to back Brussels where it can, so will doubtless be capable of finding another technicality to uphold the Commission's appeal.</p>

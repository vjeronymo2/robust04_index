			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Take the Trouble To Explain...."] </F>   [Text] The State Duma has made a decision to invite  Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's representative in the  Federal Assembly, and Federation Council Chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko to one of its next sessions in connection with the  situation which has taken shape around the Russian Federation  General Prosecutor's Office. The deputies voiced concern at the  fact that President Boris Yeltsin's edicts have dismissed all  the deputy general prosecutors and would like to receive  explanations of the reasons for this decision.    At the proposal of Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov, the State Duma  instructed the parliamentary committee for security to study the  question of the Russian president's dismissal of the three  deputy general prosecutors.    He was supported by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, a representative of  the Communists' faction, and by the agrarian faction which has  issued a statement today asserting that the president's edicts  on the General Prosecutor's Office were adopted "counter to the  Constitution." The agrarian faction believes that in this case  Boris Yeltsin's actions "contradict the Social Accord Treaty and  the commitment he has made to operate within the framework of  the Constitution and on the basis of the law."</p>

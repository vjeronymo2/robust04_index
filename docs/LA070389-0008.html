			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMA ON THE OFFENSIVE  </P> <P> Leaders of the American Medical Assn. have unleashed a double national campaign  opposing legislation that would place caps on doctor payments under Medicare  and publicizing what they regard as the "deficiencies" of Canada's health  system. It looks a bit like a reversion to the days when the AMA fought  Medicare and Medicaid and vilified Britain's national health care.  </P> <P> The sensitivity of organized medicine may be understandable. Both the target  expenditures under consideration for physician payments in Medicare and the  Canadian model of universal health insurance are methods of limiting what  doctors can charge. Similar limits already have been applied to hospitals  serving Medicare patients with resultant savings.  </P> <P> What is less understandable is the deceptiveness of the campaign. Canadian  medicine is being portrayed as "socialized," whatever that means, and as  restrictive in care. The national and provincial governments do indeed play a  part, but essentially it is universal insurance that rations care by limiting  access to high technology in much the same way that American medicine rations  care by excluding 37 million Americans from any form of health insurance. The  expenditure targets for Medicare, recommended by the Physician Payment Review  Commission created by Congress, is being portrayed also as a means of rationing  care when it would be more accurate to say it is a means of rationing payments  to doctors. It was proposed only when every other effort to contain medical  inflation was circumvented by a proliferation of procedures, tests and other  services.  </P> <P> The Canadian model is not likely to be translated to the United States, but  American doctors would do well to recognize that it delivers care of equal or  higher quality at substantially less cost. The expenditure targets for Medicare  may not be a perfect answer, but they hold more promise than the practice  guidelines now being advocated by some AMA officials.  </P></p>

Figures released by the municipal people's bank show that  the  city's total savings deposits by the end of February amounted to  62.6 billion yuan.    In 1993 the city saw a record amount of savings deposits of  17.27 billion yuan. This year saw a continuing growth, with a  total of 2.65 billion yuan added in January, up 1.21 billion  yuan from the average monthly increase in 1993.    In February the city had another 3.43-billion-yuan increase  in savings deposits, a hefty 6.07-percent rise from the same  period last year.    The figures also show that residents' income remained  stable,  and about 92 percent of the depositors were optimistic about  future income trends.    More aware of risks, local people have reduced blind  investment and have begun to put more money in the bank. Most  of them prefer long-term deposits to short-term ones.    Of the total increase in savings deposits in the first two  months of this year, fixed deposits accounted for 97 percent.</p>

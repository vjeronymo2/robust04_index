			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO JOIN A SOFTBALL LEAGUE IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Last call to sign up for the fall season of softball leagues in some cities in  Orange County: Fields are already reserved, and teams are playing in the  majority of cities.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, the team must be registered with the city. Only men's and co-ed  leagues are offered. (Co-ed teams require five men and five women players.) The  level of play must be specified (A, B, C or D with A the most proficient) as  must the type of game: men's or co-ed fast or slow pitch. The application must  specify preferences for playing field, day and time (first through sixth  choices). The name of the team and the names and addresses of the players must  be provided. The fast-pitch league requires nine players on a team; the  slow-pitch league requires 10. In the last few years in Santa Ana, the number  of softball teams per season has averaged more than 600 (there are four  seasons), according to Randy Hoopii, recreation program coordinator.  </P> <P> In the city of La Habra, teams must fill out a registration form and pay a fee  to join the men's or co-ed leagues. In the two remaining days of registration,  the community services department will take applications as long as slots are  available.  </P> <P> In San Juan Capistrano, sign-ups are taking place right now and will continue  through tomorrow. Only men's softball is offered for the fall season; co-ed  teams begin in the summer.  </P> <P> The softball league in Laguna Beach accepts only locals. Players must live  within the Laguna Beach Unified School District boundaries or have proof of  employment within the city limits. There are men's and women's leagues but no  co-ed league. Prices and leagues are designated by the circumference of the  softball used, 12- or 16-inch.  </P> <P> A point system is utilized in cities such as Orange and Santa Ana to determine  registration priority. Points are awarded to teams with members who are  residents. In Santa Ana one point is also awarded to a team that played during  the previous season or to a team from a workplace located in the city. If too  many teams sign up and some must be eliminated, teams with the most points get  top priority. The system also encourages teams to seek out their neighbors to  fill their rosters. Non-residents are not excluded, but they get no points.  </P> <P> In Seal Beach, points are awarded only to teams that have played previously in  the league.  </P> <P> In Mission Viejo, leagues (organized by the Saddleback Valley Recreation  Services) are nearly full, but an independent softball league still has space  in its men's C and D leagues, which play on Sunday nights.  </P> <P> The deadline has passed for leagues in Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa,  Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine, La  Palma, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach, Placentia, Tustin, Westminster, Yorba  Linda, and leagues are already in play. Dana Point is connected with Capistrano  Bay Parks and Recreation. The city of Brea will not have a league until the  spring. None exists in Villa Park.  </P> <P> Here are the costs and other information about leagues still open this fall:  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH  </P> <P> * Cost: $436, men's 12-inch; $308, men's 16-inch; $286, women's 12-inch  </P> <P> * Deadline: Tomorrow for men's 12-inch; Sept. 21 for men's 16-inch and women's  12-inch  </P> <P> * Information: (714) 497-0716, Ron Lutz  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL (YMCA)  </P> <P> * Cost: $35 non-member, $30 members; full team $360 to $420 (12 players  required)  </P> <P> * League options: men's and co-ed, slow pitch (with 12-foot pitch arc)  </P> <P> * Sign-ups: Tomorrow, 5 p.m.  </P> <P> * Information: (714) 831-YMCA, Derek or Eric  </P> <P> LA HABRA  </P> <P> * Cost: $320  </P> <P> * League options: men's and co-ed, slow pitch  </P> <P> * Deadline: Tomorrow  </P> <P> * Information: (213) 905-9708  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> * Cost: $425  </P> <P> * League options: men's (C and D levels), slow pitch  </P> <P> * Information: (714) 552-8315, Ron Byrd  </P> <P> ORANGE  </P> <P> * Cost: $300  </P> <P> * League options: men's and co-ed, slow pitch  </P> <P> * Times: Monday-Friday games begin at 6:30 p.m.; Sundays at noon  </P> <P> * Deadline: Sept. 15  </P> <P> * Information: (714) 532-0383  </P> <P> SANTA ANA  </P> <P> * Cost: $440 fast pitch; $330 slow pitch  </P> <P> * League options: men's and co-ed, fast pitch or slow pitch  </P> <P> * Season: Sept. 24-Dec. 14.

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE OF THE OLD  </P> <P> Your toadying article on the American Assn. of Retired Persons ("Empire of the  Old," by David DeVoss, Feb. 12) was sickening. This is the group that supported  the Catastrophic Coverage Act and was responsible in great part for its  passing. This detrimental act is costing seniors millions of dollars in extra  taxes each year at rates to increase annually.  </P> <P> AARP is also the organization that was against equitable Social Security  payments for "notch babies" (born 1917-1921), who can get $100 less monthly  than those born before or after.  </P> <P> Your cover picture and title, "Empire of the Old," should have been titled  "Empire of the Gold." AARP leadership and officers are not helping members,  merely themselves.  </P> <P> BARBARA NOLTE  </P> <P> Cherry Valley  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / How to stand out in a crowd: A marriage of technologies is one way forward for poorly performing consumer electronics groups There is something profoundly wrong with Europe's electronics industry. Last year, Thomson of France lost Dollars 300m in consumer electronics. Siemens of Germany lost about Dollars 600m in personal computers and semiconductors. Nokia of Finland lost Dollars 130m in consumer electronics. Philips of Holland made a net loss of almost Dollars 500m overall. The industry, it seems, has lost its way. While the recession has not helped matters, the roots of the problem go deeper. Take, as an example, television sets. Industry executives will tell you that nobody has made money producing TVs in Europe for five or six years. Even the mighty Matsushita of Japan, which supplies Europe with Panasonic sets from a big new factory in Wales, has lost money in the UK market for a decade. It is natural enough that companies should make losses on new products while they build up sales. But TV sets have now become a basic commodity, like cornflakes. Cornflake manufacturers make handsome profits: why not TV manufacturers? Fortunately for electronics companies, parts of their industry can still be highly profitable: in particular, telecommunications and defence, where customers are mostly governments and markets are tightly restricted. But in free markets even the best companies find it hard to make a living. In an industry as vast and fast-growing as electronics, there should be room for everyone. So why do companies keep handing out their products for less than they cost to make? Ten or even five years ago, European executives would have had a simple answer: the Japanese, with their trade barriers, their cheap finance and their obsession with market share. Now that the Japanese industry has troubles of its own this excuse is heard less often. Other excuses must be found. Most of them are unpersuasive. In consumer electronics, executives say, the problem is the power of the distributors. This seems absurd. The world's biggest specialist electronics store chain is said to be Dixons of the UK. By comparison with the world's food retailing giants, Dixons is a tadpole. But the big food companies like Nestle or Unilever enjoy margins of which electronics companies can only dream. A more substantial argument has to do with the high cost of investment. Professor Walter Kunerth, executive vice-president of Siemens, says: 'To set up a new technology costs a lot of money. To justify that expense, you have to build big capacity. Then you need volume to justify the capacity.' And, as the production chief of a consumer electronics group says, this makes it harder for companies to get out. 'The barrier to exit in this game,' he says, 'is a high invested cost. If you're in it on a global basis, the sunk cost is huge.' On the other hand, he points out, that same investment entails a very high depreciation charge. So even if a company is making losses after depreciation, it may well be generating cash. 'That's why we all chase volume at the expense of profit,' he says. The snag about this argument is that, by implication, it writes off whole chunks of the industry as a giant commercial blunder. Companies are trapped by their investment mistakes of the past, and are thus obliged to throw good money after bad. While such things are not unknown elsewhere, it seems odd that a sophisticated industry like electronics should produce managerial incompetence on this scale. There is a further argument to explain consumer electronics' demise which is perhaps more credible. 'The industry has worn out its consumer appeal over the past 10 years,' says the head of business development at a European group. To appreciate his point, ask yourself what make of radio you have in your kitchen, or what kind of TV in your front room. A surprising number of people cannot remember. But they do know what kind of car they drive or what brand of breakfast cereal they eat in the morning. 'Cars are an element of social distinction,' the executive says. 'A TV set is not. You can take pride in having a lousy TV set, as a sign of having better things to do with your time.' The manufacturers are thus in a jam. If you are looking to buy a video recorder or clock radio, you will tend to stick to a few names you know: Sony, Philips, Panasonic and so on. The manufacturers spend heavily on marketing to remain in that exclusive club. But the chances are you will base your final choice on price, since in other respects there will be little to choose between them. Perhaps the fixation of consumers on price has a more basic cause. It is a truism in electronics to say products cost less than they used to, and in future will cost less again. This is mainly because of the industry's phenomenal record on productivity. 'If Rolls-Royce had achieved the same productivity gains as the TV industry,' says the business development chief, 'a Rolls would cost the same today as a bicycle.' The snag for the companies is, of course, that the industry has given away all of these productivity gains to the customer. Worse, it has created a perpetually shifting environment in which the consumer cannot form an impression of what constitutes fair value. This kind of slippery slope is the nightmare of any consumer manufacturer or retailer; in creating it, the industry is the victim of its own success. As if all this were not enough, there is the looming shadow of Japan. Historically, the low price environment worked in Japanese companies' favour. This can be simply illustrated in financial terms by comparing two giants of the world industry, Philips and Matsushita. In 1982, Matsushita had sales of about Dollars 14bn, compared with Philips's Dollars 16bn. Since then Mat-sushita has kept its prices and margins relentlessly low, and its growth has been ferocious. By 1992 it had sales of Dollars 61bn, against Philips's Dollars 32bn. In a decade, the Japanese company went from being smaller than Philips to twice its size. In the process, Matsushita built up formidable cash flow and balance sheet strength. Compare the financial performance of the two companies in last year's recessionary conditions. Philips's cash flow, net of capital investment and dividends, was Dollars 166m. Matsushita produced a torrential Dollars 1.9bn. Thus, while Philips's gearing ratio - net debt measured against equity - rose from 148 per cent to 167 per cent, Matsushita's fell from 42 per cent to 31 per cent. If this sounds too one-sided to be true, there are signs it may be changing. Japanese giants are under pressure on two fronts: their domestic market has fallen sharply, and their shareholders are demanding more profits and dividends to compensate for the share-price collapse over the past two years. In Europe, this results in the bizarre spectacle of Japanese companies pleading for higher prices. Mr Katsuro Sakakibara, Matsushita's main board director in charge of European operations, says: 'We have raised our selling prices twice this year. Very few of our competitors raised theirs. We cannot operate at a loss, and also we feel someone must sell at a reasonable price. It is then my strong hope that other people will correct their attitude to pricing. So far, nothing has hap-pened.' 'Beyond a certain level,' an executive of a European company says, 'the price war doesn't make sense. I'm convinced the tougher economic environment in Japan will make Japanese companies more reasonable in the long run. They cannot expect to compensate huge price declines with huge volume increases, as they did in the 1970s and 1980s. There are fewer companies left to kill, and those that are left don't want to die.' And, the executive points out, Far Eastern competitors no longer have the access to cheap capital they used to have. 'The Japanese and Korean companies used that capital to build up stocks,' he says. 'Nowadays, they will find volume increases expensive to achieve.' But if this takes pressure off European companies in the short term, no one believes it solves the fundamental problem. It simply means the Japanese are in the same boat as everyone else. So how is the industry to achieve its salvation? Dr Ron Sommer, head of Sony's operations in Europe, gives a clue. 'When you think about competitors,' he says, 'you perhaps think about Philips, Thomson and Matsushita. I don't. I think about the telephone companies and the computer companies. Those markets are intermingling.' The industry, he argues, will look different as a result. 'On the one hand, there may not be so many companies. On the other, you will categorise them differently. You will start to look at telecoms, computer and entertainment companies in one block rather than clearly separating them. That doesn't mean I see Sony in the 21st century producing a mainframe or putting a telephone line from the US to Europe. I don't see IBM or AT&amp;T producing a Walkman either. But there are plenty of new businesses where we will cross over. Tomorrow, there may be a video dial tone to your home via the telephone line. That must have something to do with Sony.' A European rival agrees. 'In 10 or 15 years, personal communications, computers and so forth will all be one world. That probably will mean alliances. It's difficult to assess what kind: mammoth new companies, or consortia of companies often in unrelated industries with ties of cross ownership along the lines of the Japanese keiretsu model. It's impossible to be clear. But it is clearly a world where levels of investment and barriers to entry will rise.' This process of rationalisation and co-operation is not confined to consumer electronics. Siemens, as Professor Kunerth points out, has already formed an alliance to develop the technology for the 256 M-Dram chip, the next generation computer memory chip, with Toshiba and IBM. 'The development cost alone runs into billions,' he says. 'Then you have to decide to set up a factory. To get the pay-off on your R&amp;D the factory has to sell high quantities, which can only be done worldwide. I don't know where the factory will be, but there will be only one to supply the world market.' All this, he argues, is the inexorable result of increased technological sophistication. 'The higher the level of technology, the more the need for capital, the fewer the players and the greater the need for a big market. With a 256 M-Dram, you can do things with one component where you needed 10 or 20 before. So the total quantities go down, which puts more pressure again on the number of players.' In this process, the companies will start to look very different. To the outsider, Professor Kunerth says, Siemens may seem a monolith. Below the surface, various alliances are developing. 'Different companies within Siemens have different kinds of co-operation with other companies. It can be a marketing co-operation, or a development co-operation, or even a joint venture, such as we have with Matsushita in passive components (commodity devices). On the one hand, you have to concentrate on your core competencies. On the other, you have to sell businesses, co-operate, go into minority positions and so on.' The result could be a series of loose federations, in fact, a new kind of capitalism. 'The future structure of our industry will be much more complex,' Prof Kunerth says. 'The same companies will compete in one field and co-operate in another. This is only possible if you have mutual trust and common business ethics. If you have been hitting someone on the head for years, co-operation is very difficult.' This, then, is the vision of the future: a world in which the mingling of technologies and the rising burden of investment mean there are only two or three dominant players in a given area. The fewer the competitors, the less the competition and the higher the profits. There is one big risk. The industry got itself into this mess in the first place by pumping out volume to justify past investment. It is now talking about still greater investment, requiring still greater volumes. What is the guarantee that in the brave new world, the old suicidal competition will not con-tinue? 'I can't say,' Prof Kunerth says simply. 'But it's the only way. If you don't do it this way, you're certain to lose money. You won't survive.'</p>

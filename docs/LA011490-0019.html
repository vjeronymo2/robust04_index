			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A BACKWARD PLACE BY RUTH PRAWER JHABVALA (FIRESIDE: $7.95)  </P> <P> In this delightful comedy of manners, Ruth Jhabvala uses the story of three  English expatriates in Delhi to examine the changing role of women in a society  divided between liberal, imported British values and traditional, paternalistic  Indian mores.  </P> <P> Clarissa's patronizing efforts to "go native" in grubby peasant costumes  embarrass her friends; brittle, blond Etta places so much emphasis on her  European sophistication that she becomes a self-caricature. Inspired by the  love of her impractical Indian husband, sensible, level-headed Judy learns to  reconcile seemingly inimical traditions into an agreeable way of life. Rising  above her compatriots, she demonstrates the superiority of spiritual resources  to mere creature comforts.  </P></p>

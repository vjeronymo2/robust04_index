			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Plans for ITV ownership rules are expected today The ITV companies will find out at 8.30am this morning how the government proposes to change the ownership rules governing the industry. In an echo of the 1991 announcement of new franchises by the Independent Television Commission, the government will make its intentions clear by fax. The expected liberalisation, which would allow some of the large ITV companies to take over each other could lead to the launching of immediate bid battles. Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday licence, is expected to launch a bid for Central, the second largest company, in which it has a 20 per cent stake. Granada will move against either Central or London Weekend in which it holds 20 per cent. Meanwhile, the commission is examining ways of improving the chances of launching Channel 5 as a national channel using existing technology. This is in response to a revival of interest in the concept in spite of the commission's rejection last December of the only bid for the franchise. Time Warner, the media group, is among those which have submitted expressions of interest in the new channel. A total of 76 submissions were received last month on options for the future of Channel 5, which included using the available frequencies to help launch digital television in the UK. MAI, the financial services and advertising company which controls Meridian Television, is among those which have expressed interest in running a conventional television channel. The commission is likely to take a decision on whether to advertise a new Channel 5 licence in January.</p>

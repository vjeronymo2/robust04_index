			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  has sent a letter to the president of the European Union seeking  urgent international measures to protect Palestinians in the  occupied territories following the Hebron massacre.    "I believe that the Palestinian people should be afforded  international protection as a matter of urgency until we are  able to achieve security, stability and prosperity," 'Arafat  told Greek President Andreas Papandreou, whose country currently  heads the rotating EU Presidency, in his two-page letter dated  Friday.    The letter was written shortly after the assassination of 52  Moslems by a Jewish settler who shot his victims as they were  praying at a mosque in the town of Hebron.    "The massacre took place before the eyes and with the  knowledge of the Israeli Army which has checkpoints and  observation posts both at the entrances to the old town of  Hebron and at the entrances to the mosque itself," 'Arafat told  Papandreou.    He added that Jewish settlers opposed to the ongoing  Israeli-  Palestinian peace process must not be allowed to endanger that  process "and undermine the foundations we wish to lay for a new  period of rapprochement, good neighbourly relations and  cooperation in Palestine and the Middle East."    He said that unless the controversial issue of Jewish  settlements is resolved by the international community, there is  little chance for peace.    "I am convinced that you will wish to make every effort to  remove the source of the crisis, for the settlements are one of  the most dangerous threats to the progress of the peace  procedure, indeed a threat of actual failure."</p>

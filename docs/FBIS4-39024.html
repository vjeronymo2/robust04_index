			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy chairman of  the Council of Ministers, believes that the relations between  Russia and South Korea should develop not to the detriment to  contacts with North Korea. I wouldn't like to talk of sharp  confrontation with North Korea, Soskovets told a RIA  correspondent.    Russian firms and enterprises display noticeable interest in  North Korea. The former USSR built their many enterprises and  production capacities. This is our potential machine -- the  metallurgic and energy market -- and it is not expedient to lose  it for political reasons. At the same time the deputy prime  minister pointed out that North Korea should unconditionally  comply with the UN demands on nuclear power engineering.</p>

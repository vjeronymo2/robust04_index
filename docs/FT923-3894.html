			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Attempt to prevent vote buying OPPOSITION parties in Brazil are demanding that all government expenses be subject to Congressional authorisation until after the vote on impeachment of President Fernando Collor, to prevent any attempts at vote buying. The timetable for impeachment has set the vote for the last week of this month. The opposition claims that Mr Collor's political advisers are using government money to fund projects so as to solicit the votes of the 168 Congress members needed to fend off the impeachment initiative. The financial markets have reacted enthusiastically to the timetable, which they hope will mean an early end to the crisis. The main Sao Paulo stock exchange index rose 3.5 per cent early yesterday, after a 7.5 per cent rise on Tuesday.</p>

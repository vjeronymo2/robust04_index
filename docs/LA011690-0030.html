			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEK GIRL ABDUCTED NEAR BORDER  </P> <P> San Diego police are asking for help in the search for a Mexican teen-ager who  crossed the border Friday at San Ysidro and is believed to have been kidnaped.  </P> <P> A suspect is in custody, police said.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Erica Lillian Perez Ramirez, 16, and her  sister, Ana Maria Perez Ramirez, 20, crossed the border about 8 p.m. Friday and  waited inside a restaurant in the 600 block of East San Ysidro Boulevard for a  man who was supposed to take them to a "drop house," where they would be  transported farther north.  </P> <P> When the man arrived, he told the women that he could take only one of them in  his car. Robinson said the elder Ramirez refused to be separated from her  sister. The man then grabbed the teen-ager, threw her in the back of his car  and sped away.  </P> <P> On Sunday, a San Diego police officer was questioning several men outside a bus  station while Ana Ramirez sat in the police car. As the officer spoke to the  men, one of them walked away, Robinson said. Ana Ramirez yelled that he was the  man who had grabbed her sister.  </P> <P> The officer stopped the man, and Ana Ramirez identified him, Robinson said.  Daniel Lopez, 30, of Sampson Street in Logan Heights, was arrested on suspicion  of kidnaping and on possession of heroin, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The car, a brown Datsun B210 with Baja California license plates, was found in  the 400 block of East San Ysidro Boulevard.  </P> <P> But, Robinson said, police have found no trace of Erica Ramirez.  </P> <P> She was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, black jeans and black boots. She is  5 feet, 2 inches tall, weighs 115 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes.  </P> <P> Anyone with information about this incident should call the department's San  Ysidro division at 236-5901.  </P></p>

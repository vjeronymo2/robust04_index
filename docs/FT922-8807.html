			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (3): A difficult transition - Profile of Jonas Savimbi MR Jonas Savimbi cuts an incongruous figure in the Portuguese colonial house he temporarily inhabits in Luanda. The guerrilla leader turned politician today seems less confident of his role and more thoughtful about the future. The Angolan capital has been his base since September when Unita, the movement which has fought a guerrilla campaign against the MPLA government since independence in 1975, transferred personnel from its headquarters in Jamba in southern Angola. Mr Savimbi, 58, who studied in Lisbon and Lausanne, has led Unita since he launched it in 1966. After completing his degree in 1965, he left Switzerland for China where he trained in guerrilla warfare. Politically he says he now stands 'more in the centre than on the right or on the left.' On economic policy, he believes in the free market economy because, he says, 'private ownership creates incentive.' After 16 years of war, the transition is painful - from rural guerrilla base to urban life, from waging war to preparing for power, from army leader to politician. The transition to democracy and the end of the cold war have both proved mixed blessings for Mr Savimbi. 'We have been getting support from South Africa, from the US. The major motivation to support us was to fight communism. Today that is not there. Now the Americans would deal with an MPLA government which won the election just as it would deal with a Unita government.' The process is already under way. South Africa is establishing relations with the MPLA government in Luanda while the US has expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses within the rebel movement. Unita has recently admitted to the murder late last year of two of its senior members by fellow Unita compatriots. Mr Savimbi says 'the incidents have to be deeply deplored.' He adds: 'It was not a decision of the leadership. It was differences in our own ranks. Which is why on our side we accept responsibility. I accept responsibility. Because it is my organisation.' The unity of the organisation, once cemented by the common enemy of communism, is showing signs of strain. Mr Savimbi admits that he is finding it difficult to convince his fellow commanders of the efficacy of peace and the merits of a democratic party. Fellow Unita members are also baulking at changes within the organisation. 'In a party you have to accept different thinking - a different line does not mean that people have to go away from the party but that these people are on the left, these people are on the right. But it is one party. In a guerrilla movement you can't do that. You always have to think about the objective. And everybody will try to conceal or to concede his difference so that the objective has to be attained. That is the real difficulty,' explains Mr Savimbi. Mr Savimbi was adamant that Unita would 'never go back to guerrilla war'. 'If we lose the elections, which up to now I don't think will happen, like Mr Kinnock, we will have to go to party and ask people to make a judgment of me'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian sources  have stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat intends to return to  Jericho and Gaza in July leading the Palestinian leadership and  PLO institutions.    The sources stressed that a final and definitive date for  'Arafat's return has not been set despite much talk about  unrealistic dates. They say the return is likely to be in July  so that it will precede the dates of municipal and legislative  elections and they note that the elections, due for October, are  inconceivable in the absence of 'Arafat and PLO institutions and  agencies connected with the election campaign.    The sources said 'Arafat will return to Gaza and Jericho  accompanied by 400 high-ranking leaders and agencies associated  with the daily routine who have not been separated from 'Arafat  for a quarter of a century.</p>

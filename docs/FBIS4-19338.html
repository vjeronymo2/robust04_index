			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bombers May Have Set Off Bomb North </F> of Rome"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 15 -- The huge bomb found  Thursday evening [14 April] by a road north of Rome may have  been blown up by those who planted it, and not by a police robot  as originally thought, investigators said Friday.    The bomb, containing between 50 and 70 kilos of explosive  material, was deemed too complicated for defusing manually by  police explosives experts who examined it yesterday evening. The  terrain on which it had been left was too rough to allow a robot  to disconnect the many wires on the device.    A strong jet of water was therefore pointed at the bomb, in  a  move which should have deactivated it, but instead it blew up,  leaving a crater six metres by four metres across and almost two  metres deep.    In their initial examination of the bomb, which was spotted  under a pile of branches by the side of a road north of Rome by  a local petrol station manager, police experts came to the  conclusion that the device was to have been detonated by a radio  command, possibly from as far away as a kilometre.    By blowing up the device "with surgical precision" as the  operation to deactivate it began, the bombers may have "wished  to destroy all the evidence," said investigators.    The three cardboard boxes, full of synthetic explosives,  were  linked by a mass of wires and connected to two batteries and a  voltmetre, which measures the volts of a battery. The detonator  was believed to be inside one of the boxes which explosives  experts decided to leave unopened. A remote control aerial was  sticking out of one of the boxes which were still relatively dry  when found by police, despite the wet terrain on which they had  been placed. The attempted attack was the work of "true bombing  professionals," investigators said.    The bomb was intended for an ordinary, rather than an  armoured, vehicle, but even a large car would have been blown  many metres into the air, with little hope for those inside,  said well-informed sources.    The target of the attack is believed to have been Mafia  supergrass Salvatore Contorno, who lives nearby the bomb site.</p>

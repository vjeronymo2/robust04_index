			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It might be possible for NHTSA to develop an alternative approach to solve these problems, such as considering the place where the incomplete vehicle is manufactured and the place of final stage manufacture to both be final assembly points. However, any such approach would be complicated and itself require a departure from the express statutory language. Given that the total number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling Act is relatively small and the fact that the statutory definitions do not appear to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage, the agency believes it is appropriate to simply exclude all such vehicles from the requirements related to items 1 and 2 of the label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final stage manufacturers are required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. The agency is specifying, for purposes of item 3 of the label, that the final assembly point for multi-stage vehicles is the location where the incomplete vehicle is assembled. The agency is specifying this location because, unlike the location of final manufacture, it will always involve significant final assembly operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Recordkeeping Requirements; Supplier Certifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210(d) provides that the agency must promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out section 210, including regulations to establish a procedure to verify the required labeling information, and regulations applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign. As discussed in the NPRM, in order to verify the information provided on labels, NHTSA contemplates that it would conduct, on an occasional basis, an audit of the information provided on a label. Such an audit would involve requiring the vehicle manufacturer to provide the agency with the manufacturer's basis for the information it provided on the label, e.g., all relevant certifications from suppliers, a listing of parts, cost information, and all calculations used by the manufacturer to derive the information provided on the label. NHTSA would check whether the manufacturer's methodology was consistent with agency regulations. The agency would similarly require individual suppliers to provide the basis for the information and certification that they provided manufacturers or allied suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure that the agency can conduct such an audit, as well as otherwise enforce the labeling requirements, NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain all records which provide a basis for the information they provide on labels, and to similarly require suppliers to maintain records providing the basis for the information and certification they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers. Noting that EPA requires fuel economy records to be retained for five years after the model year to which they relate, NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain records for five years after December 31 of the model year to which the records relate, and to require suppliers to maintain records, which form a basis for the information they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers, for six years after December 31 of the calendar year set forth in their submissions to manufacturers/allied suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether manufacturers should have the option of maintaining records electronically. The agency stated that it believes manufacturers and allied suppliers should retain the original copies of information provided by suppliers, but sought comment on whether to allow them to retain the certifications and other information obtained from suppliers electronically, specifically in the form of electronic images. NHTSA proposed to permit manufacturers and suppliers to maintain all other records in either paper or electronic form for purposes of data storage, provided that in every case all of the information contained in the record is retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous commenters argued that certifications and other information should be permitted to be submitted to manufacturers/allied suppliers electronically, as well as stored electronically. AAMA stated that it objects to manufacturers receiving and maintaining original copies of certificates. That organization stated that with the enactment of the Customs Modernization Act, GM, Ford and Chrysler are developing process to collect all content and customs data electronically. Ford argued that electronic storage is more efficient and cost effective and is consistent with the recently signed Customs Automation Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota also recommended against any requirement to obtain or retain actual paper certificates. It stated that the rules should allow all required records to be retained electronically. APMA stated that the proposed requirements to require suppliers to generate paper originals for certificates would be burdensome and impede the spread of EDI. That organization stated that the adoption of the AIAG/EDI package into the content reporting requirements under NAFTA is expected to begin in 1995. It recommended that all records be allowed to be kept in any medium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda stated that it supports the proposal to require written certifications by suppliers to manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nissan stated that it believes that a five to six year retention period is excessive. It suggested a retention period for manufacturers of three years after December 31 of the model year to which records relate, and, for suppliers, a retention period of four years after December 31 of the calendar year set forth in the certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to permit certifications and other records to be submitted and retained electronically. The agency believes that this is consistent with the approach being taken by the Federal government in related areas, and with section 210's requirement to establish regulations that avoid imposing unnecessary and costly burdens on the manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has also decided to require records to be maintained for the periods proposed in the NPRM. As discussed above, these requirements ensure that records are maintained for five years after the end of the model year to which they relate. The agency disagrees with Nissan that the retention period is excessive. A possible audit of the information provided on a label could take substantial time, particularly given the need to trace the information back to suppliers. NHTSA also notes that the cost of maintaining records is substantially reduced to the extent that manufacturers use electronic means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to require vehicle manufacturers to submit to the agency three copies of the information that will appear on each carline's label. The agency proposed to require submittal of this information for each carline not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is delivered to dealers for that model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

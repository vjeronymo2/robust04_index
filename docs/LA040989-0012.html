			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, THE OSCAR SHOW WAS ONE BIG CARR CRASH  </P> <P> Carr had the media around the country, most especially the Los Angeles Times,  eating out of the palm of his hand. He was seen and heard everywhere promoting  an Oscar show that was supposed to be spectacular and full of surprises. There  were none, and it was a typically boring awards show.  </P> <P> Allan, if you are producer next year, please bring on the real Hollywood stars:  De Niro, Streisand, Midler, Davis, Redford, Pacino, Beatty, Dunaway, Minnelli,  Murphy.  </P> <P> JAMES LAZARUS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

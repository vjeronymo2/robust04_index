			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Trade News: APEC countries urged to instigate process to ensure policies on track Australia yesterday urged the 18 countries which signed the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation 'free trade' agreement to instigate a regular process to ensure that their trade policies were on track, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Senator Bob McMullen, the country's trade minister, said he envisaged a process similar to the Gatt trade policy review mechanism, which would help to 'provide assurance that all Apec participants are moving forward towards free trade and investment'. He said that there were four main areas which needed close attention if the declaration was to be turned in action. These were the review process; the development of a dispute settlement system; agreement on industry specific measures and timing; and a decision on how comprehensive the deal should be.</p>

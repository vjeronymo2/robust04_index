			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and  Inspection's [BAI] six-day examination of Chongwadade  [presidential office] starting Friday is being watched keenly  since it is the first audit of the Kim government's presidential  office.    Although the BAI is scheduled to check only the general  accounts of the Secretariat and the office of security service,  the general public is interested in how much President Kim  Yong-sam's Chongwadae has spent over the past year.    Presidential aides, reportedly paying close attention to  their preparations, are well aware that Kim's Chongwadae will  invariably be compared with that of former President No Tae-u,  whose overspending was pointed out by the board.    As soon as the BAI decided to audit Chongwadae, officials  checked their own records on spending, contract papers and  materials purchased, then classified them for the inspectors,  sources said.    "Led by President Kim himself, we have tightened our belts  and maintained an austere office here," one of the aides said.  "There would be almost nothing that could be cited as wasteful."    "Actually, we have been worried that the BAI would skip its  audit of Chongwadae," said another confident presidential aide.    "This will be an opportunity for us to demonstrate that the  Kim Chongwadae is different from all previous Chongwadaes," he  added.    In contrast to a Chongwadae brimming with confidence, BAI  officials appear to be diffident over their upcoming task.  Basically, there will be nothing they can fault Chongwadae for  if the presidential office is as clean and austere as officials  claim.    "What would the general public think then, if we come up  with  nothing to show?" said one BAI official.    In other words, they are worried that some might accuse them  of having "overlooked problems."    The BAI was said to have favored skipping Chongwadae this  year since it was audited last year, but finally decided to go  ahead for fear of criticism that the independent auditing agency  recognizes "some sanctuaries," according to BAI insiders.    The 10 BAI officials assigned the job of inspecting  Chongwadae are already sifting through documents from the  presidential office while still inspecting the Culture and  Sports Ministry.    This shows their determination to dig out something at  Chongwadae, said one observer.    Last year, the BAI revealed no less than 25 instances of  unjustifiable expenditure, adding up to 645 million won in  overspending in 1991-92 by No Tae-u's Chongwadae. Most of the  money was spent on luncheons, dinners and presents.</p>

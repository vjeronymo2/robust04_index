			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / People: IPE's growth potential attracts Christmas Trevor Christmas, the new director of business development at London's International Petroleum Exchange, is in the odd position of hoping that his most recent experience at British Petroleum will have little relevance to his new job. He was one of six BP executives charged with planning ways to slim down the European workforce, a skill which he hopes won't be needed at the IPE. The growth potential of the IPE, which last month saw a record number of futures contracts traded, was its main attraction, Christmas says. That is in contrast to the oil industry, 'which many people consider to be mature, and where the current name of the game is to become more efficient', a process that almost invariably means consolidation and cutbacks. Christmas' career at BP International began after graduating with honours from the LSE. His 23 years with the company included stints as an oil trader in New York and Tokyo before taking on the recent European assignment. It was during that trading experience in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s that he became familiar with the IPE. Another attraction of the IPE job is the opportunity to operate 'on a world stage rather than just a European one'. That, however, could mean even more time away from home as he has made a priority of meeting as many IPE clients as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.V. Zyablov, S.A. Shavgulidze; UDC 621.391.15] </F>   [Abstract] The use of concatenated systems as a coding  standard for telemetry channels recommended by the Consultative  Committee for Space Data Systems (KKSKD) whereby the code system  consists of identical external Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and a  single convolutional code with memory and free distance is  discussed, and the possibility of realizing an additional energy  gain in such systems using generalized concatenated codes is  investigated in the case where there are eight external  Reed-Solomon codes, and the total concatenated code length is  32,640 bits. The study shows that generalized convolutional  block codes with different external Reed-Solomon codes are much  better from the energy viewpoint than simple convolutional  concatenated block codes. The structures based on quaternary  phase modulation (FM4) which employ the property of signal  system embedding and two different internal convolutional codes  result in an additional energy gain, and the total energy gain  compare to the CCSDS standard in the most optimum simulation and  analysis points reaches 0.9 dB. The findings point toward the  expediency of using the proposed generalized concatenated  structures in channels with white Gaussian noise, particularly  in space and satellite communications systems.

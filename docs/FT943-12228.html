			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Inco loss widens as deliveries decline Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, has suffered deeper second-quarter losses. It blamed a dip in prices and lower deliveries of nickel and platinum-group metals. The loss widened to USDollars 7.6m, or 7 cents a share, from USDollars 2.2m, or 3 cents, a year earlier. First-half losses grew to USDollars 67.6m, or 60 cents a share, from USDollars 24.8m, or 25 cents, largely reflecting one-time restructuring charges. Second-quarter net sales dipped to USDollars 590m from USDollars 604m. Operating earnings halved to USDollars 22m. The average nickel price realised in the second quarter was USDollars 2.82 per pound, down from USDollars 2.93 a year earlier, but above the USDollars 2.77 realised in the first three months of 1994. Inco's performance has been hit this year by lower deliveries of company-produced nickel and platinum-group metals. The fall was blamed on production shutdowns and the accumulation of nickel inventory ahead of summer holiday shutdowns in Canada. Deliveries of purchased nickel, on which little or no profit is realised, have, as a consequence, been higher than normal. These adverse factors were partly offset by higher cobalt and copper prices, and a slight improvement in operating results from the alloys and engineered products business. Finished nickel inventories totalled 75m lbs on June 30, up from 51m lbs on March 31 and 72m lbs last December.</p>

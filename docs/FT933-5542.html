			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Comodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE futures fought their way back into the plus column by the close of trading yesterday after sustaining another sharp decline in the morning. The November position slipped to Dollars 1,245 a tonne at on stage, repeating Tuesday's Dollars 20 fall, before ending at Dollars 1,263, up Dollars 2 on the day. The rally was attributed to a steadier performance in the New York arabica market and continuing concern about availability of good quality beans for immediate delivery. The latter factor was reflected in the widening of the September/November premium by Dollars 7 to Dollars 75 a tonne. COCOA prices also ended off the lows, but still down on the day. Stronger sterling was putting pressure on the market as the December position fell to Pounds 824 a tonne. Later the price rallied to Pounds 829 a tonne, down Pounds 3 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange the three months delivery ZINC price slid below the Dollars 890-a-tonne mark on speculative selling, but then held relatively stable. It closed Dollars 2,25 down at Dollars 887.25 a tonne. The GOLD price failed to hold yesterday's move above Dollars 370 a troy ounce, closing in London at Dollars 369.75 an ounce, down Dollars 1.55 on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

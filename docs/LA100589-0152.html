			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Bogota newspaper that was bombed last month in retaliation for its crusade  against Colombia's drug lords may have to shut down, according to Luis Gabriel  Cano, president of El Espectador. He said the 102-year-old, family-owned  newspaper has begun losing money since the bombing. "If we don't receive some  support, we cannot continue," added Cano, who is in Washington in part to seek  support from news organizations. He said the car bomb that exploded near his  offices Sept. 2 caused about $2.5 million in damage. With a circulation of  about 200,000, El Espectador is the second-largest daily in Colombia.  </P></p>

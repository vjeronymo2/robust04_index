			<p>940429 FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Water purification on the move Clean water is scarce in many remote parts of developing countries. Meaubile Water Systems, a UK company, has developed a treatment system that can be put on a truck or left in one place. The unit, incorporating a filtration and treatment system, can handle some 550 litres an hour, using chlorine dioxide to clean the water as it comes from the contaminated source. 'Dams have been built, boreholes drilled and water tanks erected but if the water is tainted or contaminated, disease and death will follow,' says John Wright, managing director. Meaubile can also be used by breweries and food and drinks companies. Wright, seeking funds for production, has spoken to a Thai trading company about possible local manufacture.

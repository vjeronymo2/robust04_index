			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: The man who made the BBC THE EXPENSE OF GLORY: A LIFE OF JOHN REITH by Ian McIntyre HarperCollins Pounds 20, 447 pages WHEN OCCASION demands a hero, and one appears, the whole world gains. Such conjunctions are infrequent enough. But one occurred when a vaultingly ambitious, energetic Scotsman applied for the post of General Manager in the newly-formed British Broadcasting Company. He did not know what 'broadcasting' was, but he got the job; and the rest, in the unimpeachable phrase, is history. The man was John Reith. Ian McIntyre's account of his life is based on Reith's diary, which, owing to its author's curiously powerful mixture of honesty, innocence, perversity and ambition, is a stupendous work of self-revelation - and sometimes of great literary merit. McIntyre reports that he came close to tears at times while reading it, and one sees why: Reith felt everything with the keenness of a razor, whether it was love, hope, exultation or despair; and could not forbear to report it. Most people, however successful they appear to others, view their own lives as a chapter of failures and disappointments. Reith did so especially, because he believed with some justice that he had immense gifts that were never properly employed. Eric Linklater described him as a 'Rolls Royce engine attached to a wheelbarrow', and if Reith's own visions about his proper sphere are any measure of his gifts, they were grand: he saw himself as Prime Minister, Viceroy of India, Secretary-General of the United Nations. As it was, he did something finer and greater, though he did not appreciate the fact: he created the BBC. Reith was the youngest son of a Glasgow Free Church minister. Theirs was a pious household, and Reith was fiercely religious throughout his life - 'Do you accept the teachings of Our Lord Jesus Christ?' he would ask BBC applicants. He wanted to attend university, but was obliged by his father to take an engineering apprenticeship instead. The two salient features of Reith's young manhood are his passionate love for his friend Charlie Bowser, and the first world war. For a decade he and Charlie, who was a boy in his teens when they met, were as lovers in all - it appears - but the carnal sense. They wrote ardent letters to each other, slept together, bathed naked together in Highland streams, kissed and prayed together. In the end Reith could not accept Charlie's marriage, although he had arranged it; and the bitterness of the affair's ending lasted the rest of Reith's life. The war was a better mistress for Reith. He revelled in the challenge, and were it not for his arrogance and corner-cutting, which put him at odds with superiors, he might have shone. But after 11 months in the trenches he was hit in the face by a sniper's bullet, and took the resulting dramatic scar to America, where he was posted as supervisor in an arms factory producing rifles for the British Army. Here he discovered powers as an orator, and was feted as a wounded young hero pleading the case for America's entry to the war. The infant BBC and John Reith were as if tailored for each other. Despite a curmudgeonly inclination to intolerances of various kinds, Reith had just the right mixture of principle, cussedness, conviction and vision to create a public service of excellence. He fought for the BBC's independence, nourished its growth, fiercely demanded the highest standards throughout, and after 15 years in charge left it as a model of public service broadcasting for the world to admire - which, despite the efforts of wreckers in recent years, it still does. The BBC gave Reith his stage. Almost as soon as he took charge he was in the company of ministers and princes, close to the heart of affairs. He revelled in it. When he left in 1938 to become Chairman of Imperial Airways he did not realise that he was relinquishing the heart of things for what was, in the light of his ambitions and talents, the margins, and that he was to dwindle there for the rest of his days. He entered the Commons briefly, and then went to the Lords, serving as a minister first under Chamberlain and then Churchill, whom he hated; but the ministries were junior, and he was a difficult colleague; Churchill sacked him, and thereafter he growled on the fringes of public life, fretting at the waste of his hopes. McIntyre does not hypothesise about Reith. He lets the facts speak for themselves, and they speak eloquently. Reith was a giant - a modern Magog - physically, in his talents, in his failings and frailties. There is something gripping about his hubristic tale; when a man is enormous in his hopes and agonies he is a compelling spectacle, and although one cannot like Reith - he is too egomaniacal, vainglorious, domineering, Sabbatarian, pompous and emotionally blundering - one cannot help admiring him for his energy and grand ideals. This is a highly readable book about a very extraordinary man.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A COMPELLING 'ST. MATTHEW' AT BACH FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Bach Festival has been the pillar of local musical life since  1934. The current edition ended Sunday with a "St. Matthew" Passion that  clearly showed why -- a dramatically urgent, musically and spiritually  compelling reading of a repertory monument.  </P> <P> Thomas Somerville presided with characteristic calm and incisive authority over  the large forces filling the First Congregational Church chancel. He delineated  the levels of action and meditation carefully, shaping the large-scale scenas  as attentively as individual choruses and arias, and made sure that the  ravishing music always carried forward the drama.  </P> <P> The Passions, though, are essentially a musical version of readers' theater,  and depend on -- demand -- a convincing narrator. In the case of "St. Matthew,"  this fluent storyteller must also cope with an awesome vocal challenge to  stamina, range and finesse.  </P> <P> Tenor Bruce Johnson did so with consistent glory. The strain could be heard by  the end of Part I, but he remained an amazingly clear, astonishingly expressive  Evangelist, one who sounded like an immediate witness to the events he  described.  </P> <P> As Christ, baritone Kenneth Knight proved equally adept vocally. But almost  everything he sang was a little too slow for dramatic impact. Somerville may  have wanted it to contrast with the swift surroundings, but the result sounded  predicated on the time-dishonored cliche that sacred equals solemn.  </P> <P> Holly Shaw Price supplied a sweet, fluid soprano, as completely committed to  the textual points as to the sinuous music. Veteran mezzo Florine Hemmings had  trouble with disappearing low notes, but rose convincingly to the demands of  "Erbarme dich."  </P> <P> Tenor Alvin Brightbill sang on the very edge of technical control, but with  clarion sound and thrilling exigency. Bass Michael Gallup offered rich, ripe  sounds, but did little to distinguish between the bluster of Pilate and the  submissive sweetness of his arias.  </P> <P> The divided chorus, dominated by the basses, made mighty noises where  appropriate. It otherwise contributed tellingly phrased chorales and captured  the reflective ache of the opening and closing choruses.  </P> <P> The crack orchestra, also divided, gave finely detailed support, though  scrambling to follow Somerville on occasion. Violinists Kathleen Lenski and  Roger Wilkie, flutists Gary Woodward and Lisa Edelstein, and oboists Peter  Scott and Electra Reed provided pertinent obligatos, rising to real brilliance  in Wilkie's case.  </P> <P> Cellist Roger Lebow, buried physically and sonically in the dense mass of  musicians, also had taxing solos, and anchored an accommodating continuo  contingent that included harpsichordist Grant Gershon and organist Lloyd  Holzgraf.

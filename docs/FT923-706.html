			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers move in on share prices THE ADVANCE in UK share prices extended over the past week and a half met a significant check yesterday morning when the stock market re-assessed the parliamentary speech from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, as well as the prospects for the UK economy outside the ERM. The FT-SE raced ahead by more than 36 points in early trade but turned back sharply very early in the trading session. Reports that ministerial sources in Germany had speculated on the possibility of a mini-Europe, excluding Britain were denied. But the fall in sterling to a low against the D-mark unsettled a London market conscious of the steadier trend in the French franc. Also discouraging were signs of political pressures on the UK government after Thursday's parliamentary debate and the resignation of a Cabinet member. By the close of trading in the UK, when Wall Street was showing a fall of 25 Dow points, London stocks were sliding lower. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,601 exactly, the net fall of 20.2 bringing it to the lowest level of the day. The session opened very strongly as the blue chip stocks responded to strength in stock index futures in late trading on Thursday. Led by the December contract on the Footsie, the stock market's underlying index moved up quickly. But when the future contract lost heart, the stock market soon turned down and attempted rallies in the second half of the session proved of little avail. The fear that falling sterling may refuel inflationary pressures was again reflected in strong gains in index-linked government bonds, which added around of a point yesterday. Long-dated gilts continued to resist downward pressure, losing only  1/4 point or so, while the shorts, although a touch easier, looked for a further cut in base rates soon. Seaq volume remained high at 693.3m shares, compared with 671.2m on Tuesday. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail or customer business on Thursday was worth Pounds 1.4bn. But, despite the recovery in retail business, the market continues to resound with complaints that the present quote-driven dealing system on the London stock market has become impossible to operate profitably and there are increasing pressures for a change to an order-driven system. Retail business in equities rose sharply this week as the reduction in UK base rates to 9 per cent encouraged hopes that rates are headed lower.</p>

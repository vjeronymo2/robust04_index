			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply concerns lift coffee prices to fresh peaks ROBUSTA COFFEE prices renewed their uptrend at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday as traders followed through on Wednesday's late rally. Although the export retention scheme agreed by both Latin American and African producing countries earlier this month continued to underpin market sentiment, traders thought the latest upsurge, which took prices to the highest levels since the dollar contract was launched in March 1991, was mainly due to technical factors. Second-position November futures closed Dollars 23 up at Dollars 1,263 a tonne, after touching Dollars 1,273 a tonne at one stage. But the concern about nearby supply tightness that traders said was fuelling the rise was reflected in the fact that the prompt September position was up Dollars 36 at Dollars 1,308 a tonne. The second position price has risen by Dollars 61 so far this week and is now Dollars 444 above the low reached four and a half months ago. Dealers told the Reuter news agency that there appeared to be fairly limited nearby supplies available and with the uncovered position on the futures market declining only very slowly and remaining above 9,000 lots some of the holders of short positions were getting nervous and looking to take cover. They said the next upside technical target was in the Dollars 1,325 to Dollars 1,350 a tonne area for the November position, but some thought the market had become overbought and were looking for a downside correction first. Cocoa prices also saw fresh peaks early in the day, but fell back after running into profit-taking. The rise, which took the December futures position up to a 22-month high of Pounds 824 a tonne at one point, was seen by traders as a resumption of the recent technically-based uptrend, which had been interrupted on Wednesday. They said bullish chart patterns coupled with concern about supply tightness against a background of an expected further drawdown from world stocks was keeping sellers at bay. But resistance built up as the price moved towards the Pounds 830-a-tonne mark and the December price drifted back to close at Pounds 810 a tonne, up just Pounds 5 on the day.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / A potential world-beater: The US economy is emerging from a protracted recession in leaner and fitter condition It is time to junk much conventional wisdom about the US economy. Until recently, most analysts assumed the recovery from recession would remain abnormally weak. And looking further ahead they assumed that the US would continue to decline economically relative to other industrial countries, principally Japan and a more unified European Community. Both assumptions are now looking shaky. A clutch of much stronger than expected data suggests the US recovery is finally beginning to take off. And the economy that is emerging from recent structural upheavals is looking a potential world-beater. Output per hour increased 2.7 per cent last year - the fastest productivity growth in 20 years. As Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress recently, the post-recession economy is a 'different animal': policymakers have to come to terms with the implications of a 'dramatic' improvement in productivity, especially in the sprawling service sector. With productivity increases translating into impressive gains in corporate profits, US share prices are hitting record highs and the dollar is beginning to climb relative to other leading currencies. For internationally mobile capital, the attractions of the US economy are enhanced by worse than expected performance just about everywhere else. Growth throughout Europe is being held back by the strains imposed by German unification and currency instability. Japan, meanwhile, is struggling with its worst financial crisis in decades. President Bill Clinton shows few signs of appreciating his economic good fortune. He is not only inheriting a lean, productive economy, he is inheriting the most encouraging inflation outlook for a generation. Consumer prices are expected to rise by only about 2.5 per cent-3.0 per cent this year and next. And the figures could be even better if the 4 per cent productivity growth rate of the fourth quarter of last year is sustained. Mr Clinton, however, continues to talk as though the recession were barely over and in his State of Union address on February 17 is expected to announced an economic stimulus worth about Dollars 30bn, or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product. This is expected to be split roughly evenly between immediate increases in federal spending, to take effect this fiscal year, and an investment tax credit (plus other growth incentives) that would be backdated to last December. He will also announce longer-term plans to tackle what he regards as two equally important deficits. The first is the familiar budget deficit, now running at about Dollars 300bn but expected nearly to double within a decade because of runaway growth of spending on healthcare and other 'entitlement' programmes. The second is the 'investment deficit', a reference to relatively low levels of public and private spending in areas such as education, training and infrastucture. As Mr Clinton works on his economic strategy, the signs of accelerating growth are becoming too numerous to miss. Preliminary figures suggest real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter - the fastest pace since the Reagan 'boom' of the 1980s and well above most analysts' projections. It followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter and constituted the seventh successive quarter of growth since the official end of the recession in the spring of 1991. A host of other data supports the GDP figures, which some now expect to be revised up, rather than down. New orders for durable goods rose 9 per cent between November and December, one of the biggest increases on record. The index of leading indicators registered its biggest gain for nearly a decade in December. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable barometer of conditions in manufacturing - surged to 58 per cent last month, its highest level since the summer of 1988. Home sales soared at the end of last year, reflecting the delayed impact of a sharp decline in interest rates. The composition of the GDP figures, moreover, was unexpectedly encouraging. Growth did not reflect temporary factors such as a rebuilding of corporate inventories or a collapse in the personal savings rate. On the contrary it mainly reflected robust growth of consumption - supported by unexpectedly large increases in personal incomes. Corporate investment in plant and equipment and residential construction surged, mainly as a result of lower interest rates. Mr Clinton is fretting, however, because the rate of job creation remains disappointing. On Friday, the Labour Department reported an increase in non-farm employment last month of slightly more than 100,000, about a third to a half the increase expected in a 'normal' recovery. Since the end of the recession, private-sector employment has been almost static - a startling turnaround after the creation of 21m jobs in the Reagan years. Public anxiety is being fuelled by a steady flow of job cuts at leading blue chip companies such as computer maker IBM, retail group Sears Roebuck, and car manufacturer General Motors. But even the job outlook is not quite as bad as White House rhetoric would suggest. Friday's employment figures showed that the proportion of different industrial sectors hiring new workers has risen sharply in the past three months. The unemployment rate fell to 7.1 per cent. That is still higher than at the end of the recession and well above the 5.5 per cent 'natural rate' - the rate reckoned to be consistent with non-accelerating inflation. But it is sharply down from a peak of 7.7 per cent last June and far less than European levels of about 10 per cent. Officials are also worried that the recent upbeat numbers are overstating the economy's likely growth this year. Early figures for January show few signs of retrenchment: car dealerships and department stores are both reporting strong sales. However, the fourth quarter figures were distorted, for example by rebuilding after hurricane damage in Florida and by the bringing forward of bonuses in the securities industry to avoid higher taxes this year. Exports, resilient so far, could yet be hit hard by the sharp slowdown in many overseas markets. Nor can Mr Greenspan's famous 'headwinds' be forgotten. These structural factors, including cuts in defence, still high levels of personal and corporate indebtedness, glutted commercial real estate markets and restraints on credit supply to small business, remain potential drags on growth. The best that can be said is that a natural healing process seems well advanced. Having failed to predict two previous 'dips', the US forecasting fraternity thus remains understandably cautious. The consensus view is that the underlying growth rate is a solid 3 per cent, rather than the near 4 per cent rate of late last year. The big question is whether the US economy is experiencing more than a cyclical rebound. With the defeat of the Republicans in the election, a debate about the economy's underlying strength is getting under way. In this year's Economic Report of the President, Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, dismissed 'declinist' fears that the US is losing ground relative to other industrialised countries. He claims that the US is more internationally competitive than it has been in decades and that it accounts for a larger share of the industrial output of the 24 rich members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development than it did in 1970. The share of US exports in GDP has risen rapidly to about 11 per cent against 8 per cent in 1987, reflecting the success of American companies in winning back market share overseas. Living standards, measured properly to reflect differences in internal prices, remain the highest in the world. Mr Boskin is probably overstating his case: the revival of US exports, for example, was helped enormously by the dollar's depreciation since 1985. But something important did happen in the 1980s, partly as a result of an overvalued dollar: US industry suddenly woke up to the reality of foreign competition. Faced with higher quality, and usually cheaper, products from Japan and Germany, it began a fundamental reappraisal of work practices and business strategy. The fruits were evident first in sharp gains in manufacturing productivity. According to OECD figures, productivity in US manufacturing rose by about 55 per cent between 1980 and 1991, compared with gains of less than 40 per cent in Germany and Japan. Manufacturers thus extended an already sizeable productivity lead relative to their rivals. But inefficiency in the US service sector (which was absorbing huge numbers of baby boom workers) meant that overall productivity growth was only about a third of the average 1.5 per cent annual pace in industrialised countries. The importance of recent productivity numbers is that they suggest that the US service sector - which accounts for three quarters of value added - is now undergoing a restructuring akin to that of manufacturers in the 1980s. In the fourth quarter of last year, overall productivity actually grew slightly faster than manufacturing productivity, suggesting that service companies were improving their efficiency even faster than manufacturers. Productivity always rebounds after recessions, so it is too early to be certain that a long-lasting transformation of services is under way. But it is certainly consistent with other trends, such as a shake-out of white collar jobs and heavy investment in computer technology. The notion that US business in undergoing a renaissance of sorts is born out in other ways. The quality of US cars, for example, is greatly improved. Symbolically, the best-selling car last year was a Ford rather than a Honda. And while IBM's problems are typical of those of aged 'national champions' everywhere, all of the young companies competing for its mantle - Microsoft, Intel and so forth - seem to be American. US capitalism has not lost its capacity for innovation. The Clinton administration still faces formidable problems. Ms Laura Tyson, Mr Boskin's successor at the CEA, is justifiably concerned about the steady rise in inequality in the past decade and the rising numbers of full-time workers who cannot earn enough to keep their families above the official poverty line (a yardstick based on the income required to buy food and other essentials.) The rise in inequality is real and it explains much popular discontent about the economy. The gap in income and wealth between the top 20 per cent-30 per cent of well-educated graduates and the rest of the population - Mr Clinton's 'forgotten middle class' - seems to be growing relentlessly. Ironically, it may be partly a consequence of the US's successful adaption to the rigours of global competition. Being internationally competitive means paying the going world rate for different factors of production; the problem for many US workers is that the going rate for low-skilled work is substantially less than what is required for a comfortable US life-style. The answer, as President Clinton argues, lies mainly in improving the education and training of workers at the bottom of the pile - an important requirement in addressing the so-called 'investment deficit'. The other, depressingly familiar problem is the federal government's inability to balance its budgets. The latest projections suggest the deficit will stabilise at about Dollars 300bn (or slightly less) in the next few years and then rise steeply again. In principle, this drain on private sector savings is easily stemmed: the deficit could be eliminated entirely over four or five years without imposing any measures that are not already commonplace in most other OECD countries. The US simply has to choose from a menu of unplatable options that includes: deeper cuts in defence spending, tougher controls on the price and volume of medical services, higher taxes on federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption, preferably both. Mr Clinton's unofficial target is for annual budgetary savings of about Dollars 145bn within four years. This would enable him to project a deficit in his final budget of about Dollars 200bn. He is certain to raise the top rate of income tax and to cut defence spending, but his resolve on more controversial issues, such as a broad-based energy levy, has yet to be demonstrated. But if he can convince the electorate that everybody (especially the rich) is being asked to make a fair sacrifice, he may prove a more effective budget-trimmer than sceptics fear. The deficit will remain a headache. But it is not enough of a drag to abort this private-sector led recovery. The productivity revival looks genuine and offers a real chance of sustained non-inflationary growth. The irony is that much of the credit should go to George Bush, who lost the election because he followed a classic piece of economic advice and chose to sit there rather than do something. The result was an agonisingly slow, but eventually solid, recovery.</p>

The SDL fears that if Meciar's government is dismissed, some  parties will lose interest in the elections, he added.    "If people underestimate the need for new elections, they do  not understand the depth of political crisis in Slovakia," Weiss  said. The position of the SDL is influenced by the fact that  some unnamed politicians are ignoring the need for elections for  which the SDL has been calling for a year, he said.</p>

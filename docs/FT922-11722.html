			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Mulford warns over Germany's deficit MR DAVID Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, warned yesterday that the German fiscal deficit could persist for much longer than previously anticipated, and create a lasting drag on world economic growth. 'Germany has a large fiscal deficit and a tight monetary policy, and this is having a major spill-over effect in Europe,' Mr Mulford said. 'It's causing high interest rates and low growth, and contributing to unemployment,' he said. Germany faces a grilling on Sunday from its partners in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, led by the US, over how it plans to deal with the soaring deficit. The International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook report, released this week, also called for cuts in the German deficit to enable European interest rates to fall. US officials have been at pains to make clear that they do not blame Germany's Bundesbank for the high level of the country's interest rates. They see the budget deficit as the core of the problem, this having bloomed as the cost of absorbing eastern Germany has mounted. The under-secretary said that, although Germany's deficit now amounted to 3-3.5 per cent of gross national product, the country's total public sector borrowing requirement, including borrowing by public institutions such as the Treuhand privatisation agency or the state railways, was beyond 6 per cent of GNP. He acknowledged that the US general government deficit also stood at about 6 per cent of GNP, but said this was not a structural deficit and would decline as the effect of the savings and loan industry rescue began to disappear. Mr Mulford expressed the fear that, in Germany, the deficit was financing growth in the eastern part of the country largely through income transfers, rather than through productive investment. 'This raises the question of how long this is going to go on, and whether it is a structural problem,' he cautioned. The under-secretary said he did not want to put himself amid Germany's policy debate, but Treasury officials say that Bonn needs to demonstrate a serious enough commitment to curbing its fiscal deficit so as to provide a background that might persuade the Bundesbank it could safely begin to lower its interest rates. 'We did provide the background for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates by 400 basis points,' a senior Treasury official said. Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and Slovenia have filed applications for membership of the International Monetary Fund. The three republics, seceded from Yugoslavia, will join a waiting list behind the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union, whose applications are expected to reach a vote by the IMF's board of governors next week.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Senators Urge Aid for Pickens: Thirty two senators urged the Bush  Administration to pressure Koito Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts  supplier, into seating corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. on its board.  Although Pickens is Koito's largest single shareholder, the firm's management  has refused the Texan's attempts to gain either a board seat or access to  confidential corporate information. Pickens has attempted to turn his battle  into an international trade issue, arguing that his rejection by Koito  symbolizes the closed nature of Japanese corporate culture.  </P></p>

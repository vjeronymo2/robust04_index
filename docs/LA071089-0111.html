			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KNICKS HIRE JACKSON, 33, AS COACH  </P> <P> The Knicks hired Stu Jackson as head coach of the team today, ignoring  questions about his inexperience.  </P> <P> Jackson, 33, a Knicks assistant under Rick Pitino the last two years, has not  had a previous head coaching job at any level. He is now the youngest coach in  the NBA.  </P> <P> Jackson's inexperience will be offset by two assistants with acknowledged  skills in dealing with players -- Paul Silas and Ernie Grunfeld. Silas is a  former coach of the San Diego Clippers and a star forward for the Hawks,  Celtics and SuperSonics. Grunfeld was the team's radio analyst the last two  seasons after retiring as a Knicks player.  </P></p>

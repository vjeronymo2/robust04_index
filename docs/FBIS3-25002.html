With only days left for Nigerians to offer their ideas  about the proposed national conference, two meetings -- one in  Kaduna in the north, the other in Ibadan in the southwest --  have been far from mealy-mouthed in their offerings. From  Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] The two meetings in Kaduna and  Ibadan this week are part of the nationwide search for what has  been described as a more equitable framework for national unity  in the light of the crisis which followed the annulment of last  year's presidential election. The two meetings reflect the  widespread disenchantment with both the Babangida military  regime and military rule generally. The Ibadan meeting is an  ethnic gathering by traditional rulers and so-called leaders of  thought in western Nigeria to draw up a Yoruba memorandum for  the constitutional conference. The Yoruba leaders are still  smarting under the annulment of the presidential election  believed to have been won by Bashorun Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba  man. They are therefore insisting that Nigeria's political  problems could be solved only on the basis of that election. A  report from Ibadan today said that the Yoruba leaders were also  proposing that Nigeria be turned into a loose federation of  eight powerful regions with a weakened central government which  will be responsible mainly for foreign affairs and defense  against external aggression.    On their own, the traditional rulers are requesting  constitutional recognition of their status and the assignment to  them of specific roles in national affairs. They said that they  would submit their memorandum to the conference commission on  Monday [7 February], three days to the closing date.    The Kaduna meeting, organized by the Ahmadu Bello  University,  is being attended by political leaders and academics drawn from  all parts of Nigeria. The key speakers are former military  rulers, General Olusegun Obasanjo and Muhammadu Buhari, both of  whom pulled no punches in denouncing the regime of their former  colleague, President Ibrahim Babangida for bringing Nigeria to  its present prostrate political and economic situation. The  meeting is considering, among other issues, Gen. Obasanjo's  suggestion that Gen. Sani Abacha should announce a definite  tenure for his government and that the decisions of the  constitutional conference should be subject to approval only at  a national referendum.

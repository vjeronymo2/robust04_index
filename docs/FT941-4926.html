			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / People: Insurance moves Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, is to stand down as chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about 9,000 of the insurance market's Names, at the organisation's annual general meeting this summer. Shaw has been chairman of the association during a turbulent two-year period, building up close links with the market's reform-minded leaders, David Rowland and Peter Middleton, but says that his commitments at Tate &amp; Lyle and elsewhere mean he can no longer devote sufficient time to Lloyd's. The ALM committee has proposed Sir David Berriman, chairman of the Rose Thomson Young action group, as Shaw's replacement.</p>

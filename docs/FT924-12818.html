			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: CrossRail improvements at Royal Oak FRANK GRAHAM has been awarded another civil engineering design contract by CrossRail, this time for the covered way and ramp at the Royal Oak section of the project in West London. This follows only six weeks after being appointed for similar work at the Allen Gardens section, Shoreditch. Commencing at the western portals of the bored tunnel drive 15 metres below Paddington, the new work comprises a 350 metre section of cut and cover, which may be carried out using continuous bored pile walls. This is followed by a 200 metre long ramp which climbs, in open cut, to connect with tracks at ground level. The Royal Oak section is complicated by the fact that it passes under two road bridges. The value of the construction work is estimated to be Pounds 11.5m on a March 1990 basis. The CrossRail scheme, a joint development between London Underground and British Rail Network SouthEast, involves building a twin-bore tunnel, 9.6 kms long, across central London between Paddington and Bethnal Green. This will link rail lines to Reading and Aylesbury in the west and north-west to those serving Shenfield in the East. The Pounds 1.7bn scheme will greatly reduce journey times across the region and relieve congestion on the Underground.</p>

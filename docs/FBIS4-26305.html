			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma  Ying-jeou will travel to Washington on Saturday to inform US  officials that Taiwan no longer intends to pay for the  repatriation of illegal Mainland Chinese immigrants ferried by  Taiwan boats to the United States or to neighboring countries  from which the immigrants can enter the United States, a local  newspaper said Monday [20 June].    UNITED DAILY NEWS reported that after attending the National  Association of Attornies General 1994 summer meeting in San  Antonio, Texas Wednesday through Saturday, Ma will fly to  Washington, where he will hold talks with US officials about the  two recent incidents where Taiwan was forced to pay to have  mainland immigrants repatriated from Guatemala.    A Taiwan fishing boat carrying more than 100 mainland  illegal  immigrants last August had sailed straight for Guatemala, and  one carrying more than 130 mainland immigrants in April was  intercepted by the US Coast Guard off the US coast and towed to  Guatemala, where it had been headed anyway. Guatemala  repatriated all the immigrants and crew.    Ma will argue that because the illegal immigrants had come  from Mainland China and that their final destination was the  United States, the issue of repatriation should have been solely  between the United States and Mainland China, and that the cost  of repatriation should have been borne by the owners of the  Taiwan ships.    The skippers of the two boats had promised the mainland  immigrants that they could gain easier access to the United  States through Guatemala, which maintains diplomatic ties with  Taiwan.    An official with Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Ministry said that  Taiwan has cooperated with the US by allowing its Coast Guards  to inspect the ships in international waters.    He said that though Taiwan has no obligation to pay for the  cost of repatriating the mainlanders, Taiwan agreed to do so in  the end after pressure from the United States.    He said that the ministry agreed to pay for political and  humanitarian reasons, and also to protect the image of the  nation.    The official noted that both ships had their operating  licenses revoked a long time ago. The boat caught in April had  had its operating license revoked in March, but had continued to  operate as a driftnet fishing boat, he said.    Ma is also expected to discuss with the US side a US request  for assistance in cracking down on international drug rings and  the possible signing of extradition agreements.</p>

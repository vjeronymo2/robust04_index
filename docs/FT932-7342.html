			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Germans opposed to Emu A single currency and European monetary union are opposed by 60 per cent of Germans, according to the latest Eurobarometer poll on EC opinion, which more predictably shows 65 per cent of Danes and 60 per cent of British against, writes David Gardner in Brussels. Overall, however, 52 per cent of Europeans favour a single currency, with 38 per cent against. However, there are big majorities for a common foreign and security policy - averaging 66 per cent to 19 per cent across the EC - and wide support (77 per cent against 13 per cent), everywhere except Denmark, for a common defence regime. Majority opinion in all countries except Denmark, Germany and Greece, moreover, supports EC military intervention in Bosnia to establish peace. Support for the EC has nonetheless dropped since the twice-yearly Eurobarometer last appeared in November. Maastricht is supported by 41 per cent, with 24 per cent against and 35 per cent undecided. More strikingly, 47 per cent are unhappy about democracy in the EC. The Commission withheld the poll results until the Danish referendum on Maastricht was over.</p>

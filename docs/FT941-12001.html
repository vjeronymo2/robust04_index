			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chubb premiums continue to rise Chubb, the US property/casualty insurer, recorded a further advance in premium income in the final quarter of last year, although after-tax profits fell on lower investment gains. The growth in premiums for the year as a whole was driven by a 10 per cent advance in specialty commercial insurance, while personal and standard commercial lines grew at a slower pace. Net income for the latest quarter dropped to Dollars 160.5m, or Dollars 1.80, a share from Dollars 197.5m, or Dollars 2.21, the year before, as investment gains dropped sharply to Dollars 25.4m from Dollars 77.4m. Chubb further improved its underlying business, with net premiums up at Dollars 895m from Dollars 799m the year before. For the year, premiums rose 8 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn, or 12 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn, after a one-off item. Lower catastrophe losses contributed to improved underwriting performance for the quarter. The company's combined loss ratio for the three months was 99.9 per cent, down from104.7 per cent. For the year, the underwriting results were hit by a Dollars 357.5m after-tax charge, announced in the third quarter, to cover asbestos-relatedclaims. As a result, the combined ratio for the year rose to 114.8 per cent (99 per cent before the asbestos charge) from 101.1 per cent the year before. The asbestos charge reduced net income for the year to Dollars 324.2m, or Dollars 3.69, or Dollars 344.2m before accounting changes, from Dollars 617.1m the year before. This included total post-tax investment gains of Dollars 151.6m for 1993, up from Dollars 123.6m in 1992. American General, the consumer finance and life insurance group, recorded a net loss of Dollars 164m for the last three months of 1993 as it wrote off Dollars 300m of acquired goodwill on two life insurance subsidiaries it plans to sell. The loss, equivalent to 76 cents a share, compares with a profit of Dollars 134m, or62 cents, the year before. Of the group's three divisions, retirement annuitiesand consumer finance saw increases in their earnings in the period, to Dollars 37m andDollars 50m respectively, while life insurance earnings dropped to Dollars 72m from Dollars 82m on lower investment yields and a higher tax charge. For the year, net income was Dollars 204m, or 94 cents, down from Dollars 533m, or Dollars 2.45, in 1992.</p>

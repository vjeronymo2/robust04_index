			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BP's rich promise BP has delivered the goods much faster than investors expected. The 19 per cent increase in its dividend is all the more impressive given that it relates to a quarter during which crude prices averaged only Dollars 14. Since BP was able to increase profits and pay down Dollars 600m of debt in such a tough environment, the board felt it was time to let shareholders have a slice of the action. Though chief executive Mr David Simon was anxious to deflate expectations that 20 per cent annual dividend increases would now be the norm, there is clearly much more to come. The group is about to kick into the next phase of its restructuring programme, designed to improve operating performance by Dollars 1bn a year. Meanwhile, worldwide economic recovery should sharply enhance BP's earnings from the highly cyclical chemicals and refining businesses. Within three or four years, the dividend should be back at the level it was before being halved in the dark days of 1992. Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in BP's share price, which follows strong support for the stock in recent months, means the scope for further out-performance is reduced. But judged against its main international peers, the possibility for capital gains has not vanished entirely. Measured as a proportion both of earnings and of gross cash flow, the share price still looks cheap. Moreover, BP's ability to increase earnings is probably somewhat greater than that of its rivals, given that it is still coming slightly from behind. It is only on a yield basis that the shares look expensive. But, given the new dividend policy, that is less of a concern than it was.</p>

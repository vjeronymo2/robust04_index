			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Scientists Develop Superconducting Transistor: Government and University of  Wisconsin researchers have developed the world's first high-temperature  superconducting transistor, a device some hope will lead to faster computers  and other improved electronic equipment. The transistor, used to control  electrical current, is able to operate at higher subzero temperatures than  earlier superconductors, scientists said. The transistor was developed at the  University of Wisconsin and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.  </P></p>

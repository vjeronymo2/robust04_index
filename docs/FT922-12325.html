			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Chicago's reputation washed away: 'City that works' pays for its budget shortcuts CATASTROPHIC flooding of downtown Chicago last week, after an underground tunnel burst, did not dampen the city's die-hard commercial instincts. Within days, T-shirts marking the event were being sold and retailers able to open their doors were using the calamity to lure in customers with 'flood sales'. While the crisis is not over - clearing the flood waters will take at least another 10 days - the initial sense of panic has evaporated. The continuing inconveniences, such as reduced public transport and restricted parking, barely ruffle Chicagoans, whose stoicism in coping with the city's harsh weather is almost limitless. But the flood has been crushing for business. The inventories of many downtown retailers floated for several days in their basements and electrical power and telephone service are still cut in some office buildings. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, has managed to create an emergency electrical hook-up, partly using its own generators, but it could not hold a full trading session yesterday. A full session is planned for today, but the CBOT will have to fly the records of each day's trades to an office in the Chicago suburbs for processing. It hopes a reliable electricity supply will be restored by next Monday. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce estimates that lost sales and clean-up expenses have already cost businesses Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m), before infrastructural damage is taken into account. A temporary office to dispense federal government disaster relief has been taking applications from businesses since Friday. A handful of older buildings may never be able to reopen as it is suspected their foundations have been permanently damaged. The city, too, has been knocked hard; its mass transit department is estimating it will take Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) to repair subways, into which water leaked from the flooded tunnel. Extra police, firemen and other services have cranked up expenses for an already strained budget. And the bill for plugging the tunnel hole and clearing the flood waters is expected to run close to Dollars 1bn, which the city does not have. Trying to put the best face on things, Mayor Richard Daley is asserting that the city can still lay claim to its fame as 'the city that works'. But the statement rings hollow in the wake of evidence that foot-dragging and penny-pinching by city bureaucrats may have led to the calamity. The roots of the problem go back to last September. The company that installed pilings to protect a bridge over the river from passing barges allegedly did not comply with the terms of its contract. It was to remove the old pilings and place new ones in the same locations, because of underground 'structures'. Instead, the company did not remove the old pilings and drove the new ones into the riverbed in such a way as to crush the tunnel's wall. The company says it was given oral permission to sidestep the contract's terms by city officials. Despite being informed of a resultant slow leak in the tunnel three months ago, public works officials dithered over bids to conduct the repair as they exceeded the city's own estimate of Dollars 10,000. Last week the leak burst into a car-sized hole, pouring more than 250m gallons of the Chicago River into the city's turn-of-the-century coal tunnel system and downtown building basements. The mayor has sacked one department chief and some dozen more heads are expected to roll. Ironically, Mr Daley himself, instead of being held responsible for the crisis, has won considerable public approval for the way he has handled it. This is a tribute not only to how tirelessly the mayor has worked to resolve the problem, but to his formidable public relations machine which went into overdrive to point the finger at lesser officials. Some have suggested the Chicago disaster is a harbinger of what is ahead for many US cities, whose ageing infrastructure is deteriorating and whose budgets, teetering near or in the red, cannot be stretched. Prof Clark Barrett, an expert on urban infrastructure at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said: 'Cities play on the margins of safety. There's no reward for fixing things.' Or as one Chicago resident watching efforts to plug the tunnel's hole put it: 'The politicians ain't gonna spend money that nobody can see.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] No traces of uranium or other radioactive substances  have been detected in the metal boxes seized at the  Thai-Cambodian border and suspected to contain uranium.    Several metal boxes, each painted "uranium" in English on  one  side were seized by police in Aranyaprathet over a month ago.    They were later sent to the Office of Atomic Energy for  Peace  for examination.    In a press statement issued on Friday, the office said it  carried out radioactive and X-ray fluorescent examinations of  the boxes and its contents.    The findings showed no traces of uranium or other  radioactive  substances, the office added.    The office said it had twice before examined similar kinds  of  metal boxes and the results showed a low emission of  radioactivity.</p>

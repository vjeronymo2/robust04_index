			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Treasury choice signals spending curbs MR MICHAEL Portillo's appointment as chief secretary to the Treasury points to battles ahead as the government attempts to bring public expenditure under control. At this time of year it is commonplace for ministers and Treasury officials to forecast that the annual public expenditure round will be 'the most difficult in years'. But the prediction will be truer this year than in most. The ingredients for tough negotiations between Mr Portillo and his Treasury officials on the one hand and the spending ministries on the other are in place: Mr Portillo is a supporter of low taxation as the way to create a strong economy. Provisional spending plans already envisage a pronounced deceleration in the growth rate of government expenditure to 7.9 per cent in 1993-94 and 5.5 per cent in 1994-95 compared with 10.7 per cent in the current and 13.7 per cent in the past financial years. The Tory manifesto commits the government to reducing the share of income taken by the public sector. It says public spending is peaking at 43 per cent of gross domestic product in the recession and that the aim is 'to reduce this steadily as the recovery gets under way'. On the other hand the recession has reduced tax revenues and boosted benefit payments. The absence of recovery in the first quarter of this year might mean that the Budget spending projections for 1992-93 are too low and its tax revenue forecasts too optimistic. Already the Treasury is concerned that higher than expected spending on single parent and disability benefits is causing social security outlays to grow faster than anticipated. Mr Portillo may find he will have to cut public expenditure growth targets in 1993-94 and subsequent years if the government is to keep to its goal of balancing the budget over the business cycle and reduce the public sector borrowing requirement from the Pounds 28bn forecast for 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn for 1993-94 to Pounds 6bn in 1996-97.</p>

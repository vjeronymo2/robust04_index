			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The return of our troops from Somalia is continuing.  Our troops must leave the country by 31 March. Carmen Lasorella  interviewed Carmine Fiore, the commander of the troops.    [Begin recording] [Lasorella] General, within two months  everyone will be back home. Will the mission in Somalia remain  unfulfilled?    [Fiore] The mission in Somalia is not unfulfilled; it is not  yet finished. We intervened in the country as part of a team --  an international team. We must neither have the presumption nor  the worry of trying to resolve the problem on our own. We are  leaving the game at this point, but other players are coming  onto the field. Let's hope that they play the game as well if  not better than we did.    [Lasorella] The United Nations set itself schedules and  objectives. Neither these objectives nor these deadlines were  reached. We cannot speak of success, so what can you say about  the current situation?    [Fiore] As I said before, the mission has not finished yet.  The results will only be added up at the end.    [Lasorella] You have gone through a notable experience. What  must be strengthened -- more planning, more coordination,  perhaps less waste of energy?    [Fiore] There are two main problems. One concerns the Armed  Forces, and we will study this problem in great depth; the  other, in my opinion, concerns administration. There should be  greater cooperation between the ministries in order to improve  our effort.    [Lasorella] So we could have done more?    [Fiore] We could certainly have done more.    [Lasorella] There are two months left. Do you think that  they will be difficult months?    [Fiore] I think so. We must remember that the game is not  over yet. It will be difficult, especially in the final days.  [end recording]</p>

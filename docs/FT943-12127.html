			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Unionists demand speedier talks on Ulster The Ulster Unionist party moved yesterday to exploit criticism of Sinn Fein's rejection of the Downing Street declaration by signalling its willingness to resume round-table talks on Northern Ireland's future as soon as next month. In a statement released just ahead of a meeting between the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr John Major, the UUP  -the province's largest party - said bilateral talks between the parties and the UK government should be speeded up. In a move apparently designed to paint the DUP into a corner, the UUP said there were 'hopeful signs' that 'all other parties' were prepared to participate in talks 'with a view to joining in a four-party discussion in August'. There was no sign of a more emollient stance, however, in Mr Paisley's comments when he emerged from his hour-long meeting with the prime minister. Flanked by Mr Peter Robinson, DUP MP for East Belfast, Mr Paisley said the party would not participate in talks held on the basis of last year's Anglo-Irish declaration, which he described as 'a sop to the IRA'. Presenting the prime minister with a detailed memorandum describing the joint declaration as the 'foundation stone for . . . a constitutional monstrosity', Mr Paisley called for immediate and decisive government action to break the 'balance of terror' in Ulster. He said Mr Major had 'made a fool of himself' by allowing himself to be 'strung along by thugs, murderers and liars'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary - who also attended yesterday's meeting - said it was 'very important' to urge Mr Paisley to return to the talks process. Sir Patrick said the government was 'patient' and wanted to 'find out from Mr Paisley what he really has to fear in the joint declaration, and in sitting down with the other parties and talking'. Describing the tone of yesterday's meeting as 'sombre', Sir Patrick said he was nevertheless encouraged because the DUP was 'moving ground' on the question of why it would not join in talks. Senior officials said later that Sir Patrick's comments did not mean the government would wait for Mr Paisley before pressing on with political talks. They emphasised that no party had a veto on progress. The UUP's suggestion that round-table negotiations could resume in August was interpreted by some as a pre-emptive strike against the framework document, under preparation by London and Dublin, which the two sides hope to complete in the autumn. This aims to cover relations between Ulster and Dublin and London and Dublin, in addition to the province's internal politics. The UUP has been pressing - with the support of some Tory backbenchers  - for the government to concentrate on agreeing an outline for devolved government in the province before moving on to the two other sets of relationships. Bilateral discussions will continue tomorrow with a meeting between UUP representatives and Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister.</p>

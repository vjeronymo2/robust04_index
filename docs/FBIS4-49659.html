			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Fang (0719 2397)] </F>   [Text] Changchun, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 150,000-sedan  production line project of the Volkswagen company under the  First Automobile Group I/E Corporation -- China's largest modern  sedan manufacturing base -- has entered the final stage of  construction. The First Automobile Group I/E Corporation  recently held an oath-taking and mobilization meeting to pledge  mass effort to complete the project and put it into operation  before the end of this year. Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice  premier, who was on an inspection tour in Jilin, attended the  meeting and praised the project's fast progress in construction.    The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a  major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is  currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery  industry. For this reason, the party Central Committee and the  State Council have expressed concern for and paid great  attention to this project. Requiring an area of 218,000 square  meters, the project will have internationally first-class  equipment. When the first phase of the project is completed,  the production line will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The  total investment for this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When  the second phase of the project is completed, the company will  be able to turn out 300,000 sedans a year. When the entire  project is completed, the company will become China's largest  modern sedan manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf  sedans. After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and  foreign designing and construction units which carried out  design construction, installation, and production debugging  simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment  has been completed. With the arrival of all the ordered  production equipment, 1,552 sets in total, the installation of  equipment and the testing of production processes are now in  full swing. A modern sedan production base with four large  buildings has taken shape. By the end of last year, the company  had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta sedans for sale on the  market. When the project is completed and put into operation by  the end of this year, the company's self-sufficiency rate in  manufacturing [vehicles and their required parts] will reach 40  percent.    To complete the project according to schedule, the  corporation, with the support of the Jilin provincial party  committee and the provincial government, organized eight special  construction groups, with workers of the corporation playing the  main role, and proposed that "let us work hard for eight months  to complete the construction of the 150,000-sedan-capacity plant  and put it into production by the end of this year." To  strengthen organizational leadership over the project and to  accelerate its pace of construction, the Jilin provincial party  committee and the provincial government formed a "decisive  battle" leading group headed by Governor Gao Yan, and a project  command, which will ensure the progress and quality of this  project.    Speaking at the mobilization meeting, Zou Jiahua praised the  rapid progress of the project, saying: While developing the  production of sedans, the First Automobile Group I/E Corporation  has completed the remodeling of its major product, medium  trucks, and it has ensured good quality. It not only has  secured a stable share of the domestic market for medium trucks  but also has exported a large number of them. The corporation  has built a production base capable of manufacturing 60,000  light-duty vehicles a year, and the advantage of large-scale  operations is beginning to yield results. Its spectacular  achievements in as short a period as several years are the  results of implementing the party's line of reform and opening  to the outside world under the care of the party Central  Committee and the State Council and under the direct leadership  and support of the Jilin provincial party committee and  provincial government, and these are also due to the concerted  efforts made by the corporation's workers and staff members. On  behalf of the State Council, Zou Jiahua gave his regards to the  100,000 workers and staff members of the corporation who are  working hard to develop China's automobile industry, as well as  to the foreign experts working for the corporation.    Zou Jiahua said: The automobile industry is a pillar of  China's national economy. The First Automobile Group I/E  Corporation is one of the country's 10 key enterprises of pillar  industries. Facing intense international market competition,  the corporation must strengthen itself, enhance its ability to  participate in international competition, and turn itself into a  large automobile industry group as soon as possible. The First  Automobile Group I/E Corporation has already developed in an  all-round way the production of medium trucks, light cars, and  sedans. Its most crucial task now is to complete the  150,000-sedan production base soon. Although the project had a  late start and involves more difficulties, its construction has  progressed rapidly. We must complete the major project in two  years. Zou Jiahua encouraged the builders to make new  contributions to the development of China's automobile industry.</p>

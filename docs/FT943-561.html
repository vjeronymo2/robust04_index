			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: CRA rules out deal over 'three mines' plan CRA, the Australian mining group in which Britain's RTZ has a 49 per cent stake, yesterday refused to make concessions over its industrial relations policy in return for a possible easing of the country's restrictions on uranium mining. The issue had arisen at the ruling Australian Labor party's conference in Hobart, where there has been talk of delegates approving a relaxation of Australia's long-standing 'three mines' policy. This limits uranium mining to three mine sites, one of which is now worked out. If the policy was changed, CRA would be one of the mining companies holding known uranium reserves which might then be developed. Some union delegates who hold key votes have sought to link concessions on uranium mining to CRA's industrial relations policy, which has encouraged employees to move towards individual staff agreements and away from centralised awards. Yesterday CRA said that 'the company's policy of offering the choice to its award employees, at some locations, to work under staff conditions would not be affected by current debates about the future of the ALP's 'three mines' policy'. CRA considered the two issues be be 'unrelated', and added that 'the use of uranium policy as a backdoor means of achieving industrial relations objectives' was 'wrong'. The stand-off seems to suggest that any revision of the three mines policy is unlikely, although it is possible that the expansion of uranium mining to other non CRA-owned sites might still be considered. Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources group, has won a second licence for the construction of a steel roll-forming plant in China. Work on the ADollars 12m (USDollars 8.8m) plant will begin in October in the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development district.</p>

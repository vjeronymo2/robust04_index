			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: British art set fair for revival - Off the Wall The organisers of the 20th Century British Art Fair, which opens at the Royal College of Art on Wednesday and runs until Sunday, have pulled in the Big One. London's leading modern art dealer, Leslie Waddington, has agreed to take part. He has withdrawn his pronouncement that London is artistically dead and will show works by Henry Moore, Peter Blake, David Hockney, and more. His participation sums up a revivalist mood. The fair has grown to almost 50 exhibitors and concentrates on British art which shows 20th century progressiveness without lapsing into the conceptual avant-garde. Another important newcomer is the New Art Centre, with sculptures by Hepworth, including 'Ascending Form (Gloria)' at Dollars 300,000, Frink and Armitage. The loan exhibition consists of paintings from the Financial Times collection. This is the first time works from the collection have been on public view. The fair began in 1988, near the peak of the market, and was an instant success. One dealer sold a painting by SJ Peploe, the Scottish Colourist, off his stand to a stranger for Pounds 275,000. This year Duncan Miller is offering a very fine Peploe, indeed the largest he painted, 'Interior with seated girl', for Pounds 175,000. Julian Hartnoll, who is showing 'kitchen sink' artists like John Bratby, reckons that many prices are now only 50 per cent of the levels six years ago. Private collectors can now afford to buy again and anyone who dreamed of owning paintings by the likes of Wyndham Lewis, Carel Weight, Patrick Heron, Stanley Spencer, Graham Sutherland, Ivon Hitchens, Augustus John, in fact all the established names of the century, should hurry along. It is a dumb arts organisation which is not launching a re-building appeal in the hope of attracting National Lottery money. Most start their projects at Pounds 1m and then add a nought, or two. So it is refreshing that Leighton House in Kensington, the home of the High Priest of Victorian art, Lord Leighton, is only seeking Pounds 400,000. It wants the money not to build, but to return to the past, to recreate the garden, the grand Arab Hall, and the artist's studio as they might have looked on some mythical day in the 1880s. Lord Leighton has just popped out and you idly wait in his home. His easel, brushes and props are all in place in the studio, and you can just catch the conversation of his deserted supper guests, murmuring away round the dinner table. This is strictly heritage restored. With Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, a Leighton lover since his school days, heading the appeal it stands little chance of failing, and the house should be ready for even more visitors (it already gets 42,000 a year) by January 1996, when there is a big Leighton show at the RA to celebrate the centenary of his death. It would be interesting to open other artists studios in the neighbourhood. Val Prinsep, GF Watts, Marcus Stone, William Burges (with a particularly fine Pre-Raphaelite interior) and Luke Fyldes, all lions in their late Victorian day, lived within pot throwing distance. Their homes are now occupied by such contemporary luminaries of the cultural scene as Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and cinematic foodie Michael Winner. Once again British programme makers have triumphed at the Prix Italia, Europe's oldest broadcasting festival. Standards among the 77 television programmes competing for the three prizes have been higher in 1994 than at any time in the past 20 years. Yet the BBC won the main prize for drama with The Snapper, Roddy Doyle's sharp but hilarious story about teenage pregnancy in a rumbustious Dublin family; and for music with Strange Fish, the television version of Lloyd Newson's remarkable modern ballet danced by the DV8 company. Furthermore, in the documentary category - the only one they did not win outright - the BBC won the special prize with Black Daisies For The Bride, a harrowing but undeniably original programme dealing with Alzheimer's disease. Prix Italia and special prizes are each worth 15m lire (Pounds 6,000). Christopher Dunkley will report in full in Wednesday's television column.</p>

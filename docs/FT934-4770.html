			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unions will seek wage increases to counter 'damage' of Budget (2) Sir, In your Budget '93 special, you stated: 'The projected public sector pay freeze on which all the figures are predicted remains a heroic assumption.' The chancellor said that pay increases for public sector staff would have to be paid for by greater efficiency. The workload in the fire service has increased by 65 per cent. We are operating without the approved number of firefighters in post. For these people, and millions of others trying to deliver essential services to the community, heroism is a daily duty. They deserve better than a further two years of pay restraint in order to rescue an incompetent government. Ken Cameron, general secretary, Fire Brigades Union, Bradley House, 68 Coombe Road, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey KT2 7AE</p>

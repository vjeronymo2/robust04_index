			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Oslo expects to meet EU deadline: Norway's new foreign minister gives optimistic view of entry negotiations Norway's new foreign minister, Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, said yesterday that Oslo could complete its negotiations for entry to the European Union by the deadline of next month and go on to win approval from the Norwegian electorate in a referendum in the autumn or early winter. Mr Godal's assessment, in an interview with the Financial Times, was the most optimistic to date from a country usually seen as the most difficult case in the present EU enlargement talks, which also include Austria, Finland and Sweden. It came despite what Mr Godal acknowledged were 'disappointing' positions taken by the EU this week on the issues of regional and agricultural aid and the prospect of further hard negotiations on fisheries policy. Mr Godal, who took over as foreign minister last month following the death of Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, said he did not underestimate the problems but that they could be overcome given 'a sufficient degree of creativity' from both sides. 'I think we have strong political will in the (EU) council of ministers; we have strong political will on the part of the applicant governments. There is a political momentum now in the whole procedure which could favour a solution to the remaining problems by early March.' In that case, a referendum was likely in 'autumn or early winter', he said. He was encouraged by a recent increase in public support for membership. 'It is modest, but it is followed by an even larger decrease on the No side. So, with a good negotiated result, and with the likelihood of Swedish and Finnish entry and the further activation of the political arguments (in favour) I foresee a Yes majority. It won't be easy, but we are closer to that than people normally imagine, both in Europe and at home.' However, Mr Godal, who was previously directly in charge of the EU negotiations as trade minister, made clear he expected the onus of compromise needed to conclude an accession agreement to fall on the Union side. Norway is demanding that Nordic agriculture be treated permanently as a special case and wants a transition period for adjustment of its high farm subsidies to EU levels. It is refusing to allow Union access to its fisheries beyond quotas already agreed under the European Economic Area accord and wants to continue to manage independently fish stocks in its northern-most waters. But Mr Godal said his country's agriculture and fisheries were 'peanuts in the broader European context'. Norway would be a net contributor to the EU. The accession agreement also had to 'pass the test of a referendum' among a sceptical Norwegian electorate. 'It really depends on the political will and recognition among the Union members to realise the importance of our positions,' he said. 'Why should they not give a clear signal to their negotiators on agriculture and fisheries that for foreign policy reasons they have to find solutions to these problems? . . . to the extent that this will be reflected in the negotiating positions, we will have a solution.'</p>

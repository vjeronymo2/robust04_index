			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / A consuming interest in China: Big manufacturers of branded goods are fighting over a potential market of 1.2bn people We're going to paint Shanghai red,' enthuses a gung-ho Unilever executive, standing beside a small back-street kiosk covered in red flags advertising the Anglo-Dutch group's Omo detergent. As the global soap war reaches China's biggest city, he is battling head to head with the Ariel and Tide brands of his global rival, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US. The paler Ariel flags, first raised only a fortnight ago, flutter above a neighbouring store. Fighting for flag and shelf space store by store across Shanghai, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble both want to win a dominant position in this important city. Their ultimate goal, however, is the country at large, the biggest virgin territory yet to fall to the makers of internationally branded consumer goods. Both are pouring in money and people. Unilever alone plans to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) a year for the next five years to lift its Chinese sales from Dollars 200m this year to Dollars 1.5bn by the end of the decade. 'China's top of the list' of Unilever's target emerging economies, says Mr Morris Tabaksblat, the group's Dutch co-chairman. Its size and underdevelopment are 'the great attraction to all branders like us', he says. Other companies investing heavily in recent years to plant their brands include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in soft drinks, Fosters and Miller (part of Philip Morris) in beer, McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken (part of PepsiCo) in fast foods, United Biscuits and CPC in foods. But only the three global giants - Nestle of Switzerland, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever - are likely to have the financial and human resources, marketing and distribution skills to put a broad portfolio of products into national distribution. For the companies themselves, success in China is an important leg in the global race for dominance. Since China opened its doors to foreign investment in 1979, international companies have gazed in awe at the potential market of 1.2bn people. It was not until the late 1980s, however, that they were able to form their first joint ventures. For the big three consumer goods producers, the wait has proved worthwhile. It gave time for China to tackle rural, urban and then financial reform. The resulting rapid economic growth created a relatively affluent urban population, eager and able to pay much more for Unilever's Magnum ice cream bars, Nestle's powdered milk and Procter &amp; Gamble's shampoos than for inferior local brands. Money can also be made from less wealthy consumers. Unilever has a joint venture with the largest toothpaste manufacturer in the world, a government-owned Shanghai company. The venture, which already produces 550m tubes of toothpaste a year, has the biggest Chinese brand, Zhongua, with a 16 per cent market share. 'We believe we can reach 300m urban consumers plus another 300m rural consumers who have access to urban distribution systems,' says Mr Anton Lenstra, chairman of Unilever China. The big three have elves challenging financial goals. Nestle, for example, plans to build sales from SFr200m (Pounds 99m) a year now to SFr1bn within the next few years. They are all working through joint ventures with local state-owned companies and taking larger majority stakes in each successive venture as their experience grows. Nestle and Unilever, old hands in developing markets, sought out their Chinese partners on their own. Procter &amp; Gamble, more at home in developed markets, broke into China with Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate. Putting together some ventures can be a painstaking process. Nestle negotiated for 13 years before signing its first deal - a powdered milk plant in Heilongjiang province (formerly Manchuria). It drew 27 villages into a milk gathering network, used Swiss experts to teach local agents animal husbandry and hygiene, and built chilling centres to collect milk brought in by bicycle, wheelbarrow and on foot. Production of milk powder and infant formula has risen from 316 tonnes in 1990 to 10,000 this year and capacity is being tripled. All three international groups use both their global brands and local ones to reach a broader market. Unilever's concentrated Omo powder sells for 22 yuan (Pounds 1.63) a kilogramme, and regular Omo for Yn17, while a leading regional brand acquired last week will sell for about Yn10, in line with other good domestic brands. On ice cream, Unilever's prices range from under Yn1 for a Chinese brand ice lolly to Yn6 for its internationally known Magnum ice cream bar. A machine operator in one of Unilever's Shanghai plants would have to work for nearly an hour to earn the money to buy a Magnum. 'We are pricing our products to where the consumer is prepared to pay,' a foreign businessman says. One danger is competition from local producers, which will rapidly improve their own quality to challenge the multinationals. Foreigners argue, however, that the cost of making higher-standard products will force locals to charge prices similar to theirs. Furthermore, any competition, whether from locals or other foreigners, will broaden product ranges and raise consumer demand for western-quality goods. Pricing is a relatively simple issue compared with the myriad organisational problems confronting foreign enterprises. Supplies of raw materials and packaging can be inadequate, services such as television advertising production sub-standard, and distribution a nightmare. It can take three weeks to deliver goods from Shanghai to Beijing - a distance of 1,000km - using the overburdened transport system. The government's highly ambitious rail, river and road development plans will take many years to complete. It will be another three years or so before foreign freight companies have built up their activities sufficiently to offer manufacturers effective cross-country distribution. The nation's wholesaling and retailing system remains heavily dominated by the state-owned organisations. Entrepreneurs are still small scale and foreign retailers, new to China, tend to focus on upmarket consumers. Unilever cannot use, for example, the extensive state-owned toothpaste distribution system to deliver soap powder into small towns. Until both distribution tiers function more like a western system, multinationals' sales efforts will be curtailed. One critical shortage, however, is of managerial staff. Multinationals have begun recruiting directly from universities, where educational standards are high, particularly in languages and sciences. The first business programmes have begun, but employers still find they must invest heavily in training to instil western business practices and attitudes. At least one multinational admits the shortage of white-collar personnel restricts growth. 'We couldn't grow any faster if we wanted, because of that one constraint,' says a senior executive. Workers on the factory floor also need training, especially where using high technology such as computer controls on state-of-the-art production equipment. On a more mundane level, Unilever has had to make spitting a sacking offence in its ice cream factory to curb the Chinese habit. So far nobody has fallen foul of the measure. There remain political and economic risks in doing business in China, including concerns over whether the Beijing government can keep economic development and provincial governments under control. Brisk inflation and devaluation could badly distort foreign investors' calculations of local and imported raw material costs and the selling price needed to cover them. Multinationals that have a reputation for being cautious and calculating have set themselves ambitious growth targets. Shareholders will see little return over the medium term, as the money from profitable ventures is ploughed back into Chinese investments. Setbacks are inevitable, given the complexity of the task and the strains on resources. But the big three have all decided over the last few years to commit themselves to heavy Chinese investments. As one foreign businessman says: 'If you wait until the risks in China are lower, then you will simply be too late.'</p>

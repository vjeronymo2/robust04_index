			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Stockdale witnesses verbal ping-pong US Vice-President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore engaged in some heated exchanges last night in the only vice-presidential debate of the election campaign, which culminates on November 3. Mr Quayle, in a finger-pointing, aggressive mode, accused Mr Gore of environmental extremism and a tendency to weakness on national security. But mostly he was intent to charge that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, was someone who could not tell the truth. Mr Gore, more even-tempered but unwilling to let Mr Quayle change the subject, mostly stuck to the Democratic script of emphasising economic issues. But he also said the Republican campaign had now been taken over by right-wing extremists out of touch with the interests of real Americans. Retired Admiral James Stockdale, running mate to Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, often seemed overawed by the occasion and completely lost the thread of his prepared opening statement. Some of his short responses verged on inarticulation. On one issue, health care, he confessed he was 'out of ammunition' and had nothing more to say. But he managed one telling early intervention, observing after one particularly sharp verbal volley between Mr Quayle and Mr Gore: 'I think America is seeing right now why the nation is in gridlock.' He said at another point: 'I feel like an observer at a ping-pong game'. To the extent that Mr Stockdale expressed his opinions, his conservative sympathies were evident, especially on the environment and defence, though not on abortion. This stands in contrast with Mr Perot, who is usually more critical of President George Bush than Mr Clinton. Mr Quayle repeatedly accused Mr Gore of 'pulling a Clinton,' by which he meant not telling the truth. This, he said, disqualified Mr Clinton from earning the trust of world leaders. He said that, as vice-president, he had been tested by fire. One of Mr Gore's better moments was when he seemed to catch Mr Quayle out on his knowledge of nuclear disarmament agreements with Russia. He also probably scored good political points with his arguments that concern for the environment 'can create jobs' as it was doing in countries such as Germany and Japan. Vice-presidential debates are rarely influential in the winning of the White House and the initial reading of last night's confrontation was that this would be no exception. Neither Mr Quayle nor Mr Gore landed the telling blow inflicted on Mr Quayle by Senator Lloyd Bentsen for the Democrats in their confrontation four years ago. As the running mate of the front-runner, Mr Gore probably had the most to lose and the often-derided Mr Quayle the most to gain. Neither disappointed their supporters.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont threatens tax rise if PSBR overshoots MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday gave a clear indication that the government will raise taxes or cut spending if the public sector borrowing requirement does not start to decline as the economy recovers. Answering questions on the government's Autumn Statement, he told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee that the government wanted to move towards a balanced budget over the economic cycle. Although it was appropriate to allow the PSBR to rise in a recession, Mr Lamont admitted there were difficulties with public finances the longer the recession lasted. 'If as the economy recovers it emerges that we have an underlying deficit, that is something that we will have to address.' Last week's Autumn Statement revised upwards the expected PSBR for 1992-93 to Pounds 37bn from Pounds 28bn envisaged at the time of the March budget, and indicated that the borrowing requirement in 1993-94 could reach Pounds 44bn. Mr Lamont said yesterday that some aspects of the borrowing requirement, such as rising social security costs, would be self-correcting. But he made clear that the government could take action over spending or taxation to meet its objective of moving towards balance over the cycle. Mr Lamont denied that the government had changed the fundamental objective of its economic policy which was to achieve sustained non-inflationary growth. The measures introduced last week to aid industry were not a U-turn or a kick-start, he said. The government had not embarked on a programme of fiscal stimulus because it would be risky to add to borrowing through a large public spending project or lowering taxes. The chancellor said the 3 percentage point cut in interest rates and sterling's substantial devaluation amounted to an 'enormous relaxation' of monetary policy since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism. He said he would not hesitate, however, to raise interest rates if sterling fell too far and endangered the inflation objective. Mr Lamont ruled out any return for sterling to the ERM until the UK is firmly out of recession and there is greater convergence between German and British monetary policies. He denied the UK would be forced to join in the second phase of European Monetary union if it ratified Maastricht.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Launching Lufthansa A great deal is riding on the Lufthansa share sale, which kicks off with the pricing of its rights issue today. This is not because the issue is particularly large. Investors will be offered about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in stock as a result of the government not taking up its rights. The importance is rather that Lufthansa is seen as a trial run for the much larger Deutsche Telekom float scheduled for 1996. The Lufthansa issue will be the first time the German government has sold stock through a book building process. As such, it gives investment banks the chance to prove their technical prowess and so position themselves for the multi-million dollar fees anticipated from the Telekom float. The enthusiasm of the banks, of course, carries dangers for investors. There is such a large cast of banks involved that shareholders will be hard-pressed to find an independent voice to advise them on valuation. Bankers wishing to curry favour with Bonn cannot be expected to put out sell notes in advance of the offer. So there is a risk that the stock price could become inflated during the book building period. But if the shares continue to retreat from their mid-summer peak, Lufthansa will start to look attractive again. Over the past two years, the airline has made a break with its public-sector past. Cost-cutting and the recovery in aviation traffic are turning losses into profits. Lufthansa is still less efficient than British Airways and KLM. But it looks well-placed to compete in Europe's increasingly deregulated aviation market.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE'S PLEA TO COOL OFF ON NEA IS SPURNED;  </P> <P> REP. DANA ROHRABACHER SIGNALS THAT HE WILL HAVE NO PART OF ANY COMPROMISE AND  PROMISES THAT THERE WILL BE A VOTE ON DECENCY STANDARDS.  </P> <P> Despite the White House's call Wednesday for a yearlong "cooling off" period in  the battle over obscenity and the National Endowment for the Arts, Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) defiantly asserted that he will not suspend his fight to  impose decency standards on the agency.  </P> <P> Speaking on the House floor Wednesday, Rohrabacher, who represents northwestern  Orange County, told his colleagues, "I can assure all of those concerned . . .  (that) there will be a vote on standards, as to whether or not federal dollars  should be channeled to obscene or indecent art."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, who in the last year has helped lead the attack on the beleaguered  agency, added, "The American people will be watching that vote."  </P> <P> Congress had been expected in the weeks ahead to consider legislation that  would prolong the life of the NEA for another five years. However, the White  House this week indicated that it would seek only a one-year extension.  </P> <P> The move was intended to avoid a full-scale battle this year between those who  wish to impose decency standards on artwork that is funded by the agency and  those who believe such efforts represent a heavy-handed attempt at government  censorship of art.  </P> <P> A one-year extension would continue the work of the agency, which annually  spends more than $170 million, and give partisans on both sides a chance to  work out their differences, White House officials have said.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, however, signaled Wednesday that he would have no part of any  compromise.  </P> <P> "There will be a vote on this issue (of decency standards) whether it is a  one-year authorization or a five-year authorization," the first-term  congressman said during his brief address to the House.  </P> <P> In an interview later, Rohrabacher said he didn't think his stand would cause  any problems with the White House. "I think that President Bush is trying to be  as loyal as he can to his own appointee (NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer), even  though his appointee is basically blowing it."  </P> <P> The controversy over the NEA began last June, when it was disclosed that the  25-year-old agency had helped support separate exhibitions that included  homoerotic photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe and a photograph by  Andres Serrano depicting a crucifix immersed in a jar of urine.  </P> <P> Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) last summer persuaded the Senate to pass  an amendment to an NEA appropriations bill that would have barred the agency  from supporting obscene or indecent artwork, or artwork that casts slurs on any  race, religion or ethnic group. Rohrabacher unsuccessfully led the fight for  the so-called "Helms amendment" in the House.  </P> <P> Instead, Congress approved language that banned NEA support only for "obscene"  artwork, but the language did not specify who determines whether art is  obscene. In addition, Congress created a commission to study the process  through which the NEA makes grants.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher earlier this year said he would move to attach language  establishing content standards for NEA-supported artwork to the NEA  authorization bill to be considered this spring. In addition, he said he would  later act to eliminate all funding for the NEA when a separate appropriations  bill is considered later this summer.  </P> <P> At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday: "Our position  has been that we're willing to accept this one-year (reauthorization), while  they look at this. . . . If members come up with amendments, why, that's their  business. . . . Our general position going in is simply a one-year extension."  </P> <P> A conservative Republican whose background is firmly rooted in libertarian  philosophy, Rohrabacher has said that government has no legitimate interest in  financing private artwork. At the same time, he has said the government should  not intrude into what an artist does "on his time, with his own dime."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher argues that the issue is not censorship, but taxpayer sponsorship  of artwork that would offend most of the taxpayers who are helping to pay for  it. Setting standards for taxpayer-supported art is an appropriate fallback  position if the government is going to pay to support artists, he has said.  </P> <P> A recent Times Orange County Poll found that 57% of a random sample of 600  registered voters in Orange County disapprove of the government setting  standards based on obscenity or controversy for government-supported artwork.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher on Wednesday said he simply does not believe that the poll is  accurate.  </P> <P> "Suggesting that the people of Orange County don't care if their money is  flowing to indecent or sacrilegious art has got to be the most inaccurate  presentation of their views I've ever heard. Why do they elect people like me?"  Rohrabacher said.  </P> <P> The Times Orange County poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; aAssociates of  Irvine, did not ask voters whether they generally favor or disapprove of the  concept of government support for the arts, regardless of whether the  government imposes standards on the art's content.  </P> <P> Earlier, Rohrabacher told his colleagues in the House, "The American people  don't want their tax dollars going to pornographic or sacrilegious art in any  form.  </P> <P> "Because their position is out of sync with the morals and values of the  American people, the opponents of standards have been going through enough  acrobatics to qualify for a job with Ringling Bros."  </P></p>

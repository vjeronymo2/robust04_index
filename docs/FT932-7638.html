			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Smith warns Major over 'a privatisation too far' MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday called on the government to bow to public opinion and drop its 'crazy' proposals for privatising British Rail, the Post Office and British Coal. He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of acting like a 'runaway train' by ignoring the verdict of the voters in recent elections that they were opposed to any further privatisations. Mr Smith warned the prime minister that if he refused to listen to the British people 'privatisation will be his Waterloo'. Mr Smith, in a speech to the Welsh Labour party conference at Llandudno, ridiculed the performance of Group 4, the security company, in escorting prisoners to the courts - 'the privatisation scheme that allowed enterprising prisoners to privatise themselves'. Instead of learning the lesson of what was 'a privatisation too far', he said, the prime minister was taking this 'ideological claptrap' into areas which even his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher, had realised were beyond the pale. Mr Smith also scoffed at Mr Major's appeal for a climate of partnership between government and industry, made earlier in the week at the Confederation of British Industry's annual dinner. The Tories had 14 years in which to build such a partnership, Mr Smith said, so why should anyone believe they were serious about it now? Mr Smith underlined the role played by Mr Major as chief secretary to the Treasury, chancellor and prime minister in the conduct of policy which produced a Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement and threats to the welfare state. He said that the prime minister, having broken his pledges on tax, now seemed set on tearing up his promises not to cut public expenditure. Mr Smith accused the government of shaming the nation with its strategy of trying to boost inward investment by selling Britain as a low-skill, low-pay economy. The strategy was doomed because there would always be countries which would do the work more cheaply, pay their people less and exploit them even more. Dealing with his proposals to improve the Labour party's internal democracy, Mr Smith denied that they involved breaking the links with the unions. Under existing arrangements political levy-paying union members already made a voluntary contribution to the party and they would be encouraged to play a full role at constituency level by paying a special membership rate. Mr Smith said: 'It is a twin-track strategy - one member, one vote, but also many more members, many more votes.'</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley rises to Dollars 139m MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, yesterday continued Wall Street's spate of strong earnings when it reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 139.1m. The profits were ahead of the Dollars 120.1m reported in the first quarter of last year, but the figures were not directly comparable because the company has changed the end of its first quarter to April from March in previous years. Morgan Stanley, which this week lead-managed the sale of General Motors' Dollars 2.1bn share offering, the largest ever by a US company, has been benefiting from a rising stock market and a boom in new issues of equity. However, its shares dropped in trading yesterday, to stand at Dollars 51 3/4 , down Dollars 1 5/8 , at the close. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, said investment banking revenues were supported by an active equity underwriting calendar and increased financial advisory revenues. Global sales and trading activity remained strong, although somewhat below the record levels seen in the first quarter of last year. The figures were helped by the realisation of investment revenues from its stake in Coltec Industries, a company which was floated on the stock market during the period. Earnings per share for the quarter totalled Dollars 1.62, against Dollars 1.54 in the first quarter of last year, while revenues were Dollars 808m, against Dollars 748m. Investment banking revenues were Dollars 270m, up from Dollars 187m. Morgan Stanley's trading revenues on its own account dropped from Dollars 393m to Dollars 291m, while investment revenue rose from Dollars 5m to Dollars 31.2m.</p>

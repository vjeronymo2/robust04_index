			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Integrated approach is the real innovation on competitiveness Sir, Your editorial 'A manifesto for business' (May 25), commenting on the government's white paper on competitiveness, welcomed some of the aspects of the white paper but in our view did not draw sufficient attention to the really important innovation contained in it. This is that the white paper treats UK competitiveness as a systems issue and brings together in one stream of activity the things which the whole of government and industry need to do. This contrasts with the tradition that each department of state should pursue its own departmental view of what the UK economy needs. For instance, there is, for the first time, an integrated analysis of the impact of education and training on competitiveness, as your editorial acknowledged. Moreover, the white paper does not just dwell on what companies should do - it makes it clear that government and industry need to work together to improve our competitiveness just as we see happening in so many other countries, ranging from the US to the newly industrialised countries.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Richard Norton-Taylor report: "Opposition Fails To Life </F> GCHQ Ban"]    [Text] Demands by opposition leaders yesterday for an end  to the union ban at GCHQ [Government Communications  Headquarters] the Government's intelligence-gathering centre,  were rejected when an opposition move to restore union rights  was defeated by 283 votes to 222 a government majority of 61.    John Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, told the  House  of Commons the Government had never explained its assertion that  union membership led to a "conflict of loyalties."    He accused the Government of "mulish obstinacy" -- members  of  unions worked on sensitive, secret work at the Ministry of  Defence, the Cabinet Office and Whitehall's Joint Intelligence  Committee.    The Labour/Liberal Democrat amendment to the Intelligence  Services Bill fell at the start of the debate on its report  stage.    Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery accused the  Government of "tilting at invented windmills." He referred to  the case of John Cook, one of 14 GCHQ staff dismissed for  refusing to give up their union rights. Mr Cook, a former cipher  clerk, was later honoured for his work during the Falklands War.    Labour leaders tabled amendments designed to strengthen the  accountability of the security and intelligence agencies.    Under the bill, a committee of parliamentarians is, for the  first time, to monitor the three main security and intelligence  agencies -- M15, M16 and GCHQ.    It is expected to be chaired by Tom King, the former defence  secretary, and will consist of five Tory members, three Labour  and one Liberal Democrat.    The committee has a limited role "to examine the  expenditure,  administration and policy" of the three agencies. It will not  have the power to call for papers and persons, and witnesses  will not be required to give evidence on oath. The Government  has strict control over information provided to the committee,  which will have no staff of its own.</p>

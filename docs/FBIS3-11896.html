			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer: "Britto Repeating Collor's Growth"] </F>   [Text] Brasilia--A comparison of the paths followed by  Fernando Collor and Antonio Britto--in terms of their  performance in pre-election polls--emerged last week as a strong  argument by those who feel that the former minister of social  security will be the candidate capable of charming Brazilians  over 16 years of age on 3 October. The man in charge of the  polls that guided Collor after the end of 1988, political  scientist Marco Antonio Coimbra of the Vox Populi Institute,  supports that argument to some degree and believes that the  major similarity between the two is "the personification of  something new."    The argument that Britto is now repeating the rising curve  shown by the Collor "phenomenon" at the start of 1989 and that  this could indicate to political parties interested in a  candidate in the center that the path "lies that way" is  supported by Deputies Miro Teixeira and Gustavo Krause--both  above suspicion in theory. They do not belong to the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], nor do they belong to the  same trend of political opinion.    Even so, on different days during this week of tension  between the executive and legislative branches precisely on the  issue of the presidential race, the two men circulated through  various congressional circles with the same message. "This is a  unique opportunity that Britto cannot let slip," said Krause.  "No doubt about it, the phenomenon is the same; the percentage  curves are very similar," Miro agreed.    Far from Brasilia in Belo Horizonte, a calm Coimbra has been  working intensely since the middle of last year on polls  concerned with this race. He is coming up with technical  analyses which, if they do not support the view held by the  congressmen, at least do not overthrow it completely. In  Coimbra's opinion, the close similarity between Britto and  Collor lies in their identification with the idea of renewal.  "Despite the frustration with Collor, who also represented  renewal, the voters still prefer someone who strikes them as  being less tainted by old political vices," he said, and he then  presented the figures that are beginning to be used to point up  not the similarities but the differences. At the start of 1989,  the polls showed that 50 percent of the voters would choose the  candidate whose image indicated a lack of ties with the old  power structures--in other words, someone new.    Now--"perhaps a little because of fear of the disappointment  caused by Collor"--there has been a change unfavorable to  Britto. The winning profile is no longer that of the squeaky  clean. First of all, the voters are saying that they prefer a  candidate "with labor--union--ties." Score one for Lula. Second,  however, there is still a desire for something new. And that is  where Britto's rise in popularity comes in, although with a  difference compared to Collor. The poll respondents feel that  unlike Collor, who had been a deputy, mayor, and governor, the  former minister lacks any other experience in government.  Coimbra interprets this to mean that they like Britto very much.  But that they think he should run at some future time.    But one fact is causing the pendulum to swing back in  Britto's favor. Out of 50 politicians whose names were presented  to respondents with the request that they assign them a score of  from 1 to 10, Britto scored highest. He received a 7, and with  the exception of Jaime Lerner, who got a 5, all the others  scored a rousing 1, 2, or 3.    Getting back the comparison between Britto and Collor,  Coimbra recalls that at the start of 1989, Collor's standing  with the voters was more or less what Britto's is now. It  hovered around 6 or 7 percent, whereas the former minister now  stands at around 8 percent. But Collor was known to only 12  percent of the voters, whereas Britto is known to 50 percent.  Since the other candidates--Lula, Maluf, Brizola, and Quercia,  for example--are known to 95 percent of the voters, Coimbra's  conclusion is that like Collor, "Britto has room to grow." Less  room than Collor had, but much more than any of the other  current candidates.    As far as differences are concerned, Coimbra introduces  another element, this one unfavorable to Britto. "Collor entered  the race with the image of leader, savior of the fatherland, and  fighter in all areas. Not Britto. The voters know that he solved  an extremely important problem in the Ministry of Social  Welfare, but only one. This means that he still has the image of  a specialist, and that is not good in a paternalistic country,  where the voters want the candidate to solve not one but all the  problems in their lives."    But Coimbra draws attention to one basic fact. "Over 50  percent of the voters do not know anything about this election.  They have no idea of the date on which it will be held or even  that it will cover three levels of government." This, he says,  indicates two things. The first is that in Brazil, every  election is a surprise from the standpoint of rules. The second  is that the game is still very much in its beginning stages and  that the voters are very apprehensive, distrustful, and  uncertain as to who they will vote for.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rallies against D-Mark STERLING enjoyed a strong rally against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed by the clear hope in both foreign exchange and money markets that the Bundesbank would cut its official discount rate at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz. The UK currency advanced 3 1/2 pfennigs on the day, closing at DM2.3700. It also enjoyed a strong rise against the exchange rate index, which measures the pound's value against a basket of currencies. Sterling ended 110 basis points higher at 77.1. The pound's strength was partly due to several factors specific to the UK. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, suggested at the weekend that there would be no further cuts in UK rates for some time to come. Yesterday's data for UK money supply showed that M0 rose 0.7 per cent in February for a 4.8 per cent gain year-on-year, suggesting a rise in consumer spending. But the main factor behind yesterday's improvement in sterling was the indication at the G7 finance ministers' meeting in London at the weekend that the Bundesbank was prepared to see further falls in money market rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, indicated a more relaxed attitude to falling interest rates. He said the changes in the minimum reserve requirements for German commercial banks should prompt a slight fall in money market interest rates. Mr Schlesinger's comments helped to unwind tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday. The French franc firmed to a close of FFr3.394 against the German currency, from a previous FFr3.400. However, there was concern last night that the market was too optimistic about the possibility of the officially posted rates being reduced. Market participants expecting an easing in the repo rate, at which the Bundesbank provides wholesale funds to commercial banks, may be justified. But Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the main requirements of an easing in the discount rate were not in place. The German government's Solidarity Pact has not been agreed, wage agreements in the manufacturing sector have not been completed and yesterday's consumer prices figure, at a 4.2 per cent year-on-year rise, was not encouraging. Yesterday's lacklustre performance by the dollar, which gained  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark to finish at DM1.6465, may push the Bundesbank in the direction of cutting the discount rate. In New York the US unit advanced to DM1.6547. One dealer said there was now less risk that an easing of policy would raise the prospect of imported inflation by depressing the German currency. But Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London remained sceptical. 'The market may be pricing in too much from the Bundesbank this Thursday,' he said.</p>

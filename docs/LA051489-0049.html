			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECESSION BLUES WON'T PLAY ABROAD  </P> <P> Virturally all indicators show the American economy slowing down, and worries  about a recession are mounting. In this unprecedented sixth year of a business  expansion, even optimists are holding their breath.  </P> <P> A deep slump would be a deadly blow to many debt-strapped Americans and  companies, but it could also lead to a major foreign-policy confrontation with  the two countries on which America most depends -- Germany and Japan.  </P> <P> Since the mid-1970s, whenever American growth has stalled, Washington has  pressed Bonn and Tokyo to rev up the growth engines in order to stimulate  American exports. Although the strategy never really worked -- governments  aren't altruistic -- it continues to be the conventional prescription in  Washington and Wall Street whenever America is in economic trouble.  </P> <P> Now, with U.S. trade deficits stuck at $120-billion levels and the surpluses of  West Germany and Japan showing no sign of shrinking, Washington's arm-twisting  could start again. If on top of the trade imbalance there is a recession in  America, the United States is likely to turn up the heat full blast.  </P> <P> And we can expect West Germany and Japan to say, simply, "Get lost."  </P> <P> For Bonn, the idea of abandoning its tight-fisted anti-inflationary policies to  accommodate Washington is a non-starter. Under American urging, Germany tried  reflating its economy in 1978. It saw its own price levels jump as a result,  and vowed never again to be a "locomotive" for the United States  </P> <P> Japan, too, will say "no." Its economy grew by almost 6% last year. In 1989 it  is projected to outpace the growth of any other industrial country. The message  from across the Pacific is apt to be clear: Enough is enough.  </P> <P> In both countries, companies are producing flat-out, wages are moving up and  inflation is rising. Their inclination is to raise their interest rates and  contain growth, not accelerate it. Last month the Bundesbank, West Germany's  central bank, stunned everyone by doing just that. Speculation is rife that the  Bank of Japan will follow suit.  </P> <P> Each government is in a weak position to take any measures that are not  immediate vote-getters. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity is at an all-time  low, and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, mired in a bribery scandal, has  already announced his resignation. His Liberal Democratic Party will be  scrambling for years to regain popularity.  </P> <P> Both countries have increasingly less reason to kowtow to America. Not only has  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made them feel less in need of American  protection, but their economic dependence on Washington is weakening.  </P> <P> West Germany sees its economic future not in trade with North America, but in  the markets of a more integrated Western Europe. Japan, in contrast to the days  when the American market was its only real option, today is building a trade  and industrial empire from Seoul to Sydney and rapidly expanding its financial  and industrial links to Europe.  </P> <P> In the event of an American recession, both Bonn and Tokyo would probably  believe, genuinely, that nothing they do could really help us. They would say  to themselves that the answers to U.S. overconsumption, poor savings and  investment and lagging productivity lies in Washington, Wall Street and Peoria  -- not abroad.  </P> <P> By their inaction, America's two key allies would in effect be demanding that  the United States put itself through a painful and protracted wringer. But they  are, after all, our creditors and such hard-nosed behavior is typical.  </P> <P> A confrontation between America and its allies ought not to surprise the  industrial nations' finance ministers and central bankers. Since 1985, when  they started to manage the dollar, they knew they were dealing with the symptom  and not the root problem -- which was that America was living beyond its means  and doing nothing about it.  </P> <P> With Bonn and Tokyo staying on the sidelines, it is not hard to envision  red-faced, frustrated congressmen screaming for retaliation. Because of our  $175-billion budget deficits, there will be no way to use government spending  to boost the economy out of recession. And because of a precarious dollar --  now held up by high interest rates -- the Fed would be scared to ease up on  rates to stimulate growth, lest foreigners with dollar investments dump our  currency and cause it to collapse. Without these fiscal and monetary tools that  Washington has historically used to overcome serious downturns, the only thing  to hope for would be a foreign bailout -- and it will be a vain hope.  </P> <P> Given today's hair-trigger markets, even a shouting match between Washington  and its allies could send the stock and currency markets into a tailspin. But  it could also aggravate a host of security-related problems with Bonn and  Tokyo.  </P> <P> There are no easy answers for the Bush Administration, especially as long as  lip-reading is in vogue and shameful gimmickry substitutes for a farsighted  fiscal policy. But there should be no illusions about where our most explosive  foreign policy problems could be.  </P></p>

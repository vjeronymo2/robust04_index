			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 3  February.    A study by the Foundation for Latin America Economic  Research  shows that Argentina's industrial production has increased more  than 40 percent since Argentine currency was pegged to the U.S.  dollar at one-to-one parity in March 1991. Industrial  production surged in 1991 and 1992 and leveled off in 1993, when  it expanded only 3.5 percent. Industry's good performance is  due mainly to the growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 27  percent of the GDP, especially car manufacturing, which grew 460  percent in that period.

The agreement will take  effect in April and expires 31 December, the government  reported. The Agriculture Secretariat said Argentina still can  export 215,000 metric tons of wheat to Brazil left over from the  1993 agreement. This will bring total 1994 exports to 550,000  metric tons.

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 24m investment for Croda Croda International, the chemicals and coatings group, yesterday announced plans to invest Pounds 24m to exploit rising demand for its speciality chemicals. Buoyant chemical sales underpinned a 5 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 19.5m, and contributed to increased turnover of Pounds 210m (Pounds 191m) in the six months to June 30. Underlying profits rose by 12.7 per cent after stripping out last year's Pounds 1.2m pension credit, but the group admitted it had been hit by capacity constraints at some plants. In a bid to overcome those problems, it plans to spend Pounds 15m on new facilities at its UK plants and invest sizeable sums on developing its Pennsylvania factory in the US. Shares in the group, however, fell 9p to 377p yesterday after the group said its strong chemicals performance had been dented by losses in its cosmetics and toiletries business and heavy environmental costs in the coatings division. 'The cosmetics business has done badly and taken the shine off the results,' said Mr Michael Valentine, chairman. The division, which manufactures products such as lipstick and nail varnish, reported trading losses of Pounds 500,000 - a Pounds 1m drop on last year's profit. Coatings, meanwhile, reported reduced profits of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.4m) following the disposal last year of most of its printing ink business and rising environmental costs in the US. The two divisions were, however, overshadowed by progress in the chemicals business, which saw trading profits rise from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 21.6m. Mr Valentine said the improvement reflected rising demand for personal care ingredients and the group's success in overcoming higher raw material prices. The Pounds 24m investment programme is expected to increase the dominance of the chemicals business, and the group said it would sell US inks operations and the cosmetics business 'at the right price'. Earnings per share rose from 9.4p to 9.9p, and the interim dividend is 3.1p (2.95p). COMMENT If Croda can resolve its capacity constraints rapidly, it should be set fair for some time to come. The chemicals business, relying mostly on natural ingredients, has weathered raw material price increases related to flooding last year. With the cost of its ingredients set to fall, it should be able to push up its margins in a buoyant market. With volume sales at the highest level since 1974, however, the picture should be rosier than it is. Parts of the coatings division and the entire cosmetics business are up for sale, but finding buyers has not proved easy. Their weak prospects are expected to hold full year profits at Pounds 42m and the shares - on a forward multiple of 18 - look pricey. But they remain below the chemical sector average and are probably worth holding on to for existing investors.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO WELCOME MAT  </P> <P> Golly, I didn't realize that the state of Washington is becoming a private  sector of our nation ("Welcome to Seattle . . . Now Go Home," by Ann Japenga,  Aug. 24 ). Will we be required to have a visa to cross their border? Proof of  inoculations? Will this apply only to Californians? If so, what actually  constitutes a "Californian"?  </P> <P> Gee, I'm third-generation, but the vast majority of people I've known and met  weren't even born in this state. Does having a California license plate  automatically make one a native? When did the welcome mat get trashed that was  spread before us in 1962 when Seattle held the World's Fair? The color of our  money hasn't changed.  </P> <P> LaMAE NORMINGTON, Anaheim  </P></p>

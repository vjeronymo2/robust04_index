			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Human rights a precondition of trade Sir, You say in 'China and the Gatt' (January 31) that the west cannot ignore gross violations of human rights in its relations with China, but that trade relations should focus only on the policies that affect trade. China's human rights abuses do affect trade. The denial of freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively distorts the labour market. The use of children and millions of prisoners in export industries constitutes unfair competition which can hardly be portrayed as a 'comparative advantage'. Apologists for China, particularly those European and US investors who have largely abandoned production in their own countries and are now fearful of import restrictions, argue that the best way to advance social change is through permitting foreign investors in the country to make even bigger profits. Some hope] US pressure over most-favoured-nation status proves the contrary. For the first time ever, the Chinese have indicated their willingness to discuss human rights. More, not less, pressure is needed. Was it not such pressure that restored democracy in central and eastern Europe? The continuing arrests of worker activists for 'counter-revolutionary activities' and the forcible internment of some in psychiatric institutions is an affront to humanity. China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be denied until it accepts international standards on human and worker rights. Trade with China should be strictly limited until it eliminates its inhuman abuse of its workforce. Why must we kow-tow to multinationals making expensive toys and training shoes, in abysmal conditions often using workers as young as the children for which these products are intended in the west? World trade relations should focus on the social dimension. If they move in that direction, then China's economic policies will almost certainly become more market-oriented.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The news conference that ended a few minutes ago at  134 Rakovski Street [headquarters of the Union of Democratic  Forces, SDS] in Sofia concentrated on the fact that  constitutional order in the country is under threat.    Prime Minister Berov suffered a vote of censure on 19 May  but  failed to offer his resignation, SDS leader Filip Dimitrov  declared. What is more, he added, parliament's refusal to  accept the cosmetic changes proposed by the prime minister  represent a new vote of no confidence in him, in the sense of  Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Dimitrov added  that Berov is also attempting to infringe on Article 8 of the  country's basic law, which regulates the division of powers. In  his view, the cabinet is therefore governing without legal  foundation, while parliament is supporting this lawlessness. It  is clear that in this dramatic situation we will demand standard  solutions, Dimitrov declared, but he did not reveal the tactical  steps that the SDS has in mind. He appealed to the media to be  more energetic in acting to end the lawlessness in the country.</p>

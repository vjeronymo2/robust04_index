			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Hanoi offers all help in hunt for missing GIs: US derided for movie-driven fixation with unknown fate of servicemen MR DO MUOI, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling communist party, yesterday issued a challenge which Washington will find hard to resist if it wishes to avoid courting further international ridicule for its fixation with US servicemen missing from the Vietnam war. Vietnam, the communist party chief told a group of visiting US senators in Hanoi, would provide whatever help was needed to assist the hunt. Pressing home the point, he asked them three times to say precisely what they wanted so it could not be said that Vietnam had failed to co-operate. This week the six Americans staffing the MiA (missing in action) office in Hanoi - up a staircase with a stained carpet in the Boss Hotel - were joined in Vietnam by the five senators from a select committee on PoW/MiA affairs and by 58 investigators who will conduct the latest in a series of month-long searches for living US prisoners and the remains of US servicemen. The US also maintains offices in Hawaii, Bangkok, Phnom Penh and Vientiane to conduct and co-ordinate the hunt. Vietnam, desperate to persuade Washington to lift an economic embargo which deprives it of funds from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, says it has spent half a million man hours on the hunt for MiAs in the past four years. Vietnamese officials and American businessmen anxious to start work in Vietnam are unable to contain their frustration at the US administration's refusal to lift the embargo. Few senior American officials believe there are really any living US captives in Indochina, and they admit in private that their policies are driven by popular fantasies stoked by the film industry rather than by hard evidence. Detailed investigations more than a decade ago found no proof that any living Americans had been left behind after the war's end in 1975, one US official involved in the search said, 'but the public perception has changed, and public perception does drive government policy'. Senator John Kerry, chairman of the select committee, said as much himself this week when he told a news conference in Phnom Penh that 'politics is perception' and cited a public opinion poll showing that two thirds of Americans think their fellow countrymen may still be held against their will in Indochina. The US administration lifted a ban on direct telecommunications between the US and Vietnam a week ago, but has linked the full restoration of relations to a 'road map' of conditions which embraces not just the MiA issue but the successful implementation of a peace accord in Cambodia. US presidential candidates have shown no inclination to alienate voters by following Brown, whose medals are displayed in the 'Exhibition House of Aggressive War Crimes' in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) with the message: 'To the people of a united Vietnam. I was wrong. I am sorry.' For Vietnam, the worst aspect of the embargo under the Trading with the Enemy Act is the US veto on aid from the multilateral institutions, which could help the country develop its meagre infrastructure and finance economic reforms. Vietnam is also prohibited from buying US equipment, such as aircraft, although Coca-Cola imported from neighbouring countries or smuggled through Cambodia is freely available and businessmen say Vietnamese-made garments with Korean or Taiwanese labels are exported to the US. The US is derided by Vietnamese and expatriates alike for its obsession with 'captive' MiAs, but US investigators insist that economic pressure has made the Vietnamese more forthcoming in locating remains and that the Vietnamese authorities could do still more to assist the search. At the centre of the dispute is the unknown fate of 135 of the 2,266 missing Americans, because many of the rest are known to have died at sea or in the air or been obliterated in landmine explosions. US officials speak of differences between hardliners and liberals among Vietnamese communist officials over how to respond to US demands for information, and say there is forensic evidence that some of the remains returned to the US had been stored above ground for a time - and therefore could have been handed over sooner. On the Vietnamese side the one positive effect of the embargo, according to Vietnamese officials and foreign businessmen and diplomats, is that it has forced Hanoi to enforce strict financial discipline and make its way in the world without the easy credit which has been the ruin of many a developing country. The government, however, is openly resentful of the US refusal to restore ties when Vietnam has withdrawn from Cambodia and provided assistance in the search for MiAs, as demanded by the US 'road-map'. The Vietnamese think the Americans are still sore because they lost the war. 'If we declare war with the US today and say we are defeated tomorrow, then the embargo would be lifted,' was the sarcastic comment of Mr Le Bang, who heads the Americas department at the foreign ministry. 'The MiA issue is not really the fault of Vietnam or the US government but of the Vietnam syndrome.'</p>

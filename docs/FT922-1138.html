			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / MGN was hit by fraudulent collusion says chief MIRROR Group Newspapers and its pension funds were hit by 'fraudulent collusion' by a group of senior individuals, Sir Robert Clark, chairman of the newspaper group, said yesterday. The blunt statement came as Sir Robert was explaining to shareholders for the first time what had happened since the flotation of the company in May 1991, the death of Robert Maxwell in November and the rapid collapse of the Maxwell empire. MGN, whose main titles are the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People, made an attributable loss of Pounds 388.2m in 1991. Its pre-tax profit was Pounds 50.1m, but there were extraordinary losses of Pounds 421.5m net of tax. The MGN chairman detailed at least 28 'unusual' payments of more than Pounds 1m each last year from the group's bank accounts. The effect appeared to have been to benefit Maxwell controlled companies at the expense of MGN and its pension funds. The board accepts, Sir Robert said, that there were weaknesses in MGN's internal controls. 'However, no system of internal control can protect a company against fraudulent collusion.' 'Ultimately the losses sustained by MGN can be attributed to collusion by a group of senior individuals, directors and officers who acted fraudulently and in secrecy. At the time, the directors did not have firm evidence to doubt the honesty of those individuals.' Asked to whom he was referring, Sir Robert said he could not go further for legal reasons. The chairman's 96-page review and accounts for the year to December 29 last year goes into detail about some 'unusual transactions' - not necessarily illegal - and the provisions made for extraordinary losses. It says that nine of the 28 unusual payments, which together totalled Pounds 180m, were authorised by Maxwell alone with the others being authorised by more than one person. 'The persons involved were primarily Kevin Maxwell, who was not then a director of the company (MGN), Ian Maxwell and Michael Stoney,' Sir Robert said in his review. Mr Michael Stoney was deputy managing director (finance) of MGN until December last year. The unusual transactions included a Pounds 50m loan from Bankers Trust for MGN which did not come to the company but appears to have paid another Maxwell group debt to the US bank. Sir Robert said the extraordinary loss of Pounds 421.5m was principally caused by the misappropriation of assets from MGN and its pension funds and the insolvency of companies controlled by Maxwell. The largest single item is an estimated Pounds 193m pension fund deficit which the company has agreed to put right over the next 14 years - with specially low payments for the first three years. In contrast with the enormous losses, Sir Robert said MGN was trading strongly and increasing its share of circulation in the popular newspaper market.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government says its attention has been  drawn to reports saying that a meeting of northern elders forum  with the elected conference candidates from the northern states  is to held on Saturday [18 June].    In a press release issued by the chief press secretary to  the  chief of general staff, Mr. Tsika Ngwozu, the Federal Government  restated that the ban on meetings of all political associations,  regional, or ethnic groupings is still in force, and that any  breach of the ban will not be tolerated. It said law  enforcement agencies had been directed to ensure that such  meeting of the northern elders forum, or that of any other  political, regional, or ethnic grouping, does not take place in  any state of the federation.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Jas Wilkes shares fall Shares in James Wilkes fell 6p to 176p yesterday after the specialist engineer said that, other than recent speculation concerning the intentions of Suter, the industrial conglomerate, it was not aware of any specific reason for the recent share price increase. The shares jumped 17p to 182p on Tuesday, but the company said yesterday that it was not currently in discussions with Suter or any other party. Earlier this month, Suter raised its holding in Wilkes to 5.21m shares (29.53 per cent). Suter said then that the shares were for investment purposes and no decision had been made about the next course of action.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Henry's growing hospitality Saudi Arabia's Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal limited his comments on last week's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in the Four Seasons hotel chain to a couple of plain-vanilla sentences in a press release, writes Bernard Simon. He left the rest of the explaining to Chuck Henry, a former investment banker who has emerged as chief dealmaker in propelling the prince into a sizeable player in the international hospitality industry. Henry, 41, describes himself as 'a consultant with a single client'. He met Prince Al-Waleed a year ago, while he was a director with CS First Boston's hotel and real-estate division, which was advising Accor, the French group, and the prince on their (ultimately unsuccessful) bid for the Meridien hotel chain. Henry set up his own company, Hotel Capital Advisers, in New York last July. He will supervise the prince's investment in Four Seasons. It will come as no surprise if Henry emerges as one of the Saudi's two nominees on the Four Seasons board. 'It's the hope of any investment banker to stop being a middleman and start being a principal,' says Henry. The Four Seasons deal comes on top of the 37-year old prince's investments in Citicorp and Euro Disney, among others, which fit his preference for capital-intensive, global businesses with strong brand names. Henry also spearheaded the purchase last July of a 50 per cent stake in Fairmont Hotels, a smallish, San Francisco-based chain. According to Henry, Prince Al-Waleed's interest in the hospitality industry was sparked two or three years ago. 'A lot of people' approached him to buy hotel properties during the recession, when real-estate - especially hard-hit hotels - were out of favour with investors. The Four Seasons deal is unlikely to be either the prince's or Chuck Henry's last foray into the hospitality industry; Henry says more are in the pipeline.</p>

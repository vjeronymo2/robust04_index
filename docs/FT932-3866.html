			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago Board of Trade wants cash for trash THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, the world's biggest commodities exchange, is teaming up with a major US recycling group in an experiment to create an organised cash market for recyclable materials. The exchange expects to offer markets in glass and two types of plastic on a screen-based trading system within a year. Spot trading in different paper grades may be added if the initial markets are successful. Patrick Arbor, the CBoT's chairman, said the same principles that created the exchange's massive grain markets should apply to recyclables. 'The problems which currently frustrate commerce between collectors, processors and end-users of recyclable materials are similar to those which plagued the grain market for which the CBoT was founded in 1848,' he said. Noting that municipalities and other collectors were accustomed to handing glass and plastics as waste, rather than commodities, Ms. Kathleen Meade, of the Washington-based Recycling Advisory Council, which is co-operating on the project, said the CBoT market would help to standardise the products. The exchange, working with an industry committee, will develop quality and delivery specifications and rules for resolving trade disputes.</p>

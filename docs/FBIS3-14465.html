			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "official Palestinian spokesman;" place and </F> date not given]    [Excerpts] Once again some Arab brothers have tried to  cause confusion regarding the issue of Jerusalem during UN  Security Council debates on Resolution 904. This resolution was  adopted to condemn the massacre in the sacred al-Ibrahim Mosque  in Hebron, and to take important measures, for the first time,  on this significant international level. Especially important  is the comprehensive aspect of this resolution, which is binding  on all members of the international community. In relation to  holy Jerusalem, the resolution deals with it as an integral part  of the Palestinian territories that have been occupied since  June 1967.    The clarification supplied by the U.S. Government on the  paragraph concerned prompted the Islamic and Arab groups to  begin activities in New York and Washington to immediately take  up the issue with the U.S. Administration. The administration  has recently clarified its position, and despite feverish  attempts by the Jewish lobby in the United States, the final  status of Jerusalem will be discussed within a period not  exceeding two years from this date.    Holy Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Palestine;  therefore, we stress our total belief in our right, religion,  and holy Koran [passage omitted]. Jerusalem is an integral part  of Palestinian national sovereignty; God Almighty has honored us  by making us its loyal guardians; we defend it with our lives  and with the cascades of blood that have not ceased to flow for  one single minute along the path of the Palestinian and Arab  holy war to defend the two holy places -- sacred places of  Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be upon him, and Jesus  Christ, God's peace upon him.    Stemming from this principle, we will not accept any Israeli  or non-Israeli control over Jerusalem, because it is the capital  of our independent state of Palestine. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / OECD calls Sweden to order Sweden was told bluntly yesterday it was living beyond its means and should take tougher measures to reform its welfare policies. The pension and benefit systems should be overhauled, labour market laws eased, and new ways found to finance state debt, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in its latest report. 'Given the limits to sound financing of welfare expenditure have already been surpassed, the country cannot simply continue as if nothing has happened,' the organisation stressed. Tough action was necessary to prevent a 'rising tide of unemployment and budget deficits' from destroying conditions for stable economic growth. Unemployment, including people on training schemes, has risen to 13 per cent of the workforce, while the budget deficit at 14 per cent of gross domestic product is one of the highest among OECD members. The organisation's report said unemployment and sickness benefit levels were still high by international standards, and the pension system needed to be put on a sounder financial footing. It called for measures to increase labour market flexibility, including reforms of employment protection legislation. It also urged the government to signal its commitment to low inflation by introducing index-linked debt instruments. The OECD expects the economy to start rebounding this year from its worst downturn since the 1930s. It forecasts GDP growth of 1.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.2 per cent in 1995, significantly less optimistic figures than government forecasts of 2.4 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively. The OECD believes the export-led recovery, which became evident last year following the sharp weakening of the krona, will continue over the next two years. But it is not so optimistic about prospects in the domestic sector, where it expects demand to stay weak. Unemployment, excluding those on training schemes, is forecast to peak this year at 8.8 per cent of the workforce before easing next year to 8.4 per cent. 'Even with some likely recovery of business investment in response to lower interest rates, unemployment can be expected to rise further before beginning to fall slowly. Similarly, with revenue growth remaining subdued, progress in reducing the huge government deficit will also be slow,' the OECD warned. On the positive side, it said it expected inflation to remain low and the external balance to move into surplus.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OECD SWEDISH ECONOMIC FORECAST  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              1993      1994      1995  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Final domestic demand*                       -5.3      -1.2       0.9 Gross domestic product*                      -2.7       1.5       2.2 Current account balance (as % of GDP)        -0.1       1.3       2.7 Unemployment                                  8.2       8.8       8.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Percentage changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: OECD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

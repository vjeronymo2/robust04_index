			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Isaykin, executive director of the </F> Volga-Dnepr Airline, by VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT correspondent  Valeriy Ageyev: "The Volga-Dnepr Airline Is Extending its  Boundaries"]    [Text] We have informed our readers time and again  about the activities of the Russian "Volga-Dnepr" Air Freight  Company, which today is the country's largest air carrier. In  its 3 years of existence, the company has demonstrated its  ability not only to survive under difficult economic conditions,  but to substantially extend the boundaries of its activity. The  company's results in 1992, when it increased the volume shipped  from 12.3 million metric ton-kilometers in 1991 to 94.2 metric  ton-kilometers, attest to its success. The airline's activity is  also respected because it was one of the first in Russia to  export not only raw material, but competitive high-tech  transport services in the international market.    VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT correspondent Valeriy Ageyev asked  Aleksey Isaykin, the executive director of "Volga-Dnepr," to  answer a few of the questions asked most often by the  newspaper's readers.    [Ageyev] Aleksey Ivanovich, has your company made any unique  shipments lately?    [Isaykin] Yes, not long ago one of the airline's An-124-100  "Ruslan" aircraft delivered a single load of 130 metric tons to  the Australian city of Perth--a 20-meter unit for repairing the  footing of offshore drilling rigs. Our pilots spent 28 hours in  the air, bypassing airports in Istanbul, Madras, and Singapore.    The transportation of 232 metric tons of stage equipment for  the Michael Jackson world tour, as well as the 120 metric tons  of concert equipment for Madonna's tour through Latin  America--these were operations that were not so much unique as  they were noisy.    [Ageyev] But the unique trips are certainly not the only  aspect of your activity.    [Isaykin] You are right. Our company is not limited to  unique  flights. On 18 November, we delivered 6 metric tons of  humanitarian cargo from the United States to Ulyanovsk. These  were medicines and medical equipment donated by parishioners of  St. Luke's Church in Oklahoma City to the Ulyanovsk Oblast  hospital. Together with the humanitarian cargo, we carried oil  drilling equipment to Russia from the United States.    [Ageyev] "Volga-Dnepr" has developed the reputation of a  reliable partner in the world market today. What have you  accomplished in the field of international cooperation?    [Isaykin] Our relationships with foreign partners are not  limited just to the contracts to carry cargo. A delegation from  Oklahoma State University was in Ulyanovsk in October 1993.  Bobby Henn [as transliterated], a professor of international  marketing, and the regional manager of the Air Express  International airline conducted business seminars for 8 days for  "Volga-Dnepr" employees. The subject of the seminars dealt with  an analysis of the situation in the world market for air freight  service, the study of management strategy for entering the world  market, the problems of managing an international air freight  airline, and familiarization with the specific nature of the  market for air freight service and its industrial base.    At the conclusion of the American specialists' visit, an  agreement was reached on training for our company's employees at  Oklahoma State University.    [Ageyev] What kind of new transportation services can  "Volga-Dnepr" provide today?    [Isaykin] We want to extend our activity in other directions  as well. In addition to carrying large-sized and extra-heavy  loads, "Volga-Dnepr" can offer a new form of service. We are  prepared to provide for the reception of foreign delegations and  the organization of business meetings and visits in the Yak-40  aircraft. The economy and business class cabins have been  furnished with upholstered furniture, which is convenient both  for business negotiations and a quiet rest. Our Yak-40 also has  the equipment needed to organize the passengers' meals.    [Ageyev] Does "Volga-Dnepr" have any objectives for the very  near future?    [Isaykin] Unquestionably. First of all, the airline's  short-term goal is to become Russia's number one air freight  company. And our long-term goal is to become one of the world's  leading air freight companies.    In order to achieve these objectives, we have worked out a  definite strategy, which includes improvement in the management  of the company and its material and technical base and creation  of a favorable image for the company both in our country and  abroad, as well as superior knowledge of the world market's  requirements for air freight service, and meeting them in a  timely manner at the level of world standards. We are continuing  to form our team of professionals who are prepared to work in  other countries and we are developing an advanced system to  provide information support.    We are also trying to maintain good relations with our  partners. In many respects, we are obligated to the "Aviastar"  AO [Joint-Stock Company]--the Ulyanovsk Aviation Industrial  Complex, our main stockholder--for our successful activity. The  "Aviastar" AO builds the An-124-100 "Ruslan" aircraft, which  forms the basis of our fleet. Incidentally, there are six  "Ruslans" in it at present. In addition, because of cooperation  such as this we do not need spare parts for any aircraft  equipment.    It seems to me that by having such support and a finely  tuned  operating mechanism, "Volga-Dnepr" is capable of reaching the  goal it has set: to become Russia's leading air freight company  and one of the leaders in air freight service in the world  market.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Observer: Going a bomb Kuwait looks to have developed its own variant of Russian Roulette in the shape of the '170 Rule' being bandied around by Kuwait City residents jittery about renewed Iraqi attack. Many have bought all-terrain vehicles in readiness for a fast escape across the desert. The trouble is that the sands hide millions of mines and such left from the Gulf war. Hence the rule, based on the idea that if you hit the mines fast enough, you are safely past them before they explode. 'Anything over 170km a hour and you can watch them go off in your rear view mirror,' says one expatriate. He has not yet tried it personally, however. Nor is it clear whether the rule includes allowance for 10 per cent speedometer error.</p>

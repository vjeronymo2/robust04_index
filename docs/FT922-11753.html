			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow little changed in two-way activity Wall Street US SHARE prices were little changed in strong two-way trading yesterday, which suggested that investors remained divided about the outlook for corporate earnings and stock market values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.48 down at 3,338.77. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.45 to 409.81, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks edged 3.18 higher to 578.23. Turnover on the New York SE was a brisk 219m shares, and declines narrowly led rises by 870 to 837. For the second day, trading was hampered by uncertainty about the near-term direction of share prices. After last week's big gains, achieved in the wake of better than expected first-quarter corporate results, some investors appeared concerned that the market might have overreached itself, while others seemed confident that a further improvement in earnings over the next three quarters justified continued buying. First-quarter results flooded in, moving a variety of stocks. Transamerica forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 46 1/2 after the insurance and financial services group reported a record first-quarter operating income of Dollars 80.7m. Also reporting record first-quarter profits was Anheuser Busch, the country's biggest brewer, which nevertheless lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 after news of an 11.5 per cent improvement in net income to Dollars 224m. Other stocks higher on earnings news included Harley-Davidson, up Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 57 1/2 , the publishing group Times Mirror, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 36 3/8 , and Caterpillar, which rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 3/4 after reporting a Dollars 132m loss, smaller than forecast. Citicorp, which revealed higher profits on Tuesday, climbed a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 1/2 after PaineWebber, the broking house, upgraded its rating on the bank's stock from 'unattractive' to 'neutral'. AMR, parent of American Airlines, which recently led other domestic carriers with a dramatic overhaul of its fare structure, fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 65 3/4 after British Aerospace said AMR would buy 15 of BAe's Jetstream planes. Ralston Purina firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 after the company said it was spinning off its Continental Banking division. Dow Chemical firmed  1/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 in spite of a 32 per cent fall in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 531m, while Bristol-Myers Squibb shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 5/8 after predicting that 1992 full-year income would rise by between 15 to 17 per cent. On the Nasdaq market, Intel rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 in turnover of 1.9m shares after announcing plans to reduce prices on its 'flash' microchips in what may herald a price-cutting war among makers of memory chips and disk drives. Amgen dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 55 in spite of first-quarter net income of 43 cents a share, up from 26 cents a year ago. Canada THE Canadian dollar again took centre stage on the Toronto stock market as equities partially recovered from a fresh early fall after the currency showed some revival later in the day. The currency was sold off on Tuesday and early yesterday due to concern over Olympia &amp; York. The composite index picked up from a day's low of 3,361.6 to close a net 13 points down at 3,367.7. Declines outpaced advances by 325 to 229 after volume of 26.3m shares. Nine of 14 stock groups closed lower, led by the real estate group, which fell a further 3.7 per cent.</p>

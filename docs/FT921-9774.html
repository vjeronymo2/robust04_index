			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Answers that need repeating: FT writers talk to Nelson Mandela about the ANC's policies on issues such as nationalisation MR NELSON Mandela has a credibility gap, and he knows it. Fresh from rubbing shoulders with the elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the African National Congress (ANC) president wryly recalled the group discussions. 'They put all these questions, on nationalisation or violence, and I would deal with them. At the end they would clap.' Mr Mandela paused, smiled ruefully, and added: 'The following day, the same people raised the same questions. In spite of their ovations, I had to start all over again.' His Davos message - rethinking nationalisation, encouraging foreign investment in a post-apartheid South Africa, honouring external debt - had not been helped by apparently conflicting reports from Johannesburg. In his London hotel room last Friday, on his way home, Mr Mandela spoke to the Financial Times about a controversial week. During a two-hour exchange he revealed his growing doubts about nationalisation. He remained inflexible in his support for economic sanctions. He repeated his personal preference for a coalition government, 'even assuming the ANC is returned with an overwhelming majority'. Sometimes he gave the impression of making policy on the hoof, as in his comments about alternatives to nationalisation. Sometimes he seemed ingenuous, taking at face value welfare donations from big business. But it was a remarkable performance: vigorous, articulate and good humoured. Most of the questions raised, whether in Davos or by the FT, are not new. But as South Africa moves closer to a post-apartheid government, in which the ANC will have the prominent role, the answers become more pertinent. It is two years ago tomorrow that the world's most famous political prisoner walked free after 27 years in detention. Political power is now moving from the white house of assembly to the multi-party Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), where negotiations over an interim government are on the verge of a breakthrough, says Mr Mandela. The ANC president has been central to the process, with President FW de Klerk. Neither man, however, can be entirely confident that his constituency will hold up as the transition unfolds. Mr de Klerk's ruling National Party is losing ground to the extreme right. Mr Mandela has to keep an eye on the left wing of the ANC, and an angry young generation who are impatient for radical change. But while the white right fears majority rule, it does not differ from Mr de Klerk on economic issues. For many black South Africans, however, economic policy could determine their vote: state take-over of industry is synonymous with rapid redistribution of wealth; and repudiating apartheid's debts can be readily justified. Last week, these two critical issues came under rigorous scrutiny, both by Mr Mandela's black constituency and the business community. Mr Mandela's reassurances at Davos were, it seemed, being questioned by both blocs at home. A draft of Mr Mandela's main address obtained by a Johannesburg weekly business magazine contained a section - dropped from the final text - which advocated putting 'some key enterprises into public ownership'. And no sooner had Mr Mandela told delegates at Davos that an ANC government would honour external debts, than the ANC publicity department in Johannesburg promptly raised doubts. It issued a statement implying that the ANC might not, in fact, honour loans made to the 'present illegitimate South African regime and its agencies'. New foreign borrowing had to await the installation of a multi-racial interim government. Since the main advocate of this view within the ANC is said to be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's secretary general and viewed as a potential successor to the 73-year-old Mr Mandela, the warning was significant. Mr Mandela tried to put the record straight in London. Mr Ramaphosa - 'a young man of considerable ability destined to occupy a very important position in our political life' - had not been accurately quoted. 'He accepts the fact that it would be a disaster,' the ANC president said, 'to say we would not pay the debts entered into by the regime.' But while some questions were answered, uncertainties remained. A statement issued on Friday by Mr Mandela accepted 'an obligation to pay foreign debts . . . incurred by the present regime in the normal course of administration before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community'. What, anxious creditors might ask, was 'the normal course of administration' under apartheid? Recent South African bond issues, the statement continued, are 'totally unacceptable', an attempt to 'bust financial sanctions adopted by the international community'. Mr Mandela was asked what sanctions were being busted. 'The sanctions which have hit South Africa most are the financial sanctions,' he replied, 'because they cannot get loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank . . . Banks which have now given a loan to South Africa are breaking those very sanctions.' Mr Mandela is right in his reference to the IMF and the World Bank. But the bond issues do not contravene any law other than the one the ANC leader went on to enunciate: 'We have recommended to the international community that sanctions be applied against South Africa by everybody. And anybody therefore who violates those sanctions is not acting in the interests of the people of South Africa as interpreted by us.' If Mr Mandela seemed unrealistic on the issue of economic sanctions, most of which have been repealed, his comments on nationalisation suggested a fundamental change. The legacy of apartheid 'cannot just be addressed through stimulating economic growth', he argued. 'Without state intervention, it is impossible to achieve redistribution.' Two years ago, most ANC officials - including Mr Mandela - would have said nationalisation was the answer. Some officials still do. But Mr Mandela, citing advice from world leaders with credentials which he must hope will satisfy even the most radical of black South Africans, appears to have undergone a change of heart. The collapse of communism has strengthened the hand of critics of nationalisation, he said. 'What is more, we have had discussions with people like Li Peng, (prime minister of the Peoples Republic of China,) and they have given us a different scenario. 'Li Peng, the head of a Marxist state, has said that difficulties which they faced with their economy induced them to reduce state participation . . . and they are considering other measures to reduce the involvement of the state. Now that was a big shock]' exclaimed Mr Mandela, relishing his anecdote and the chuckles from his audience. Vietnam 'was even more disillusioning to us', revealed Mr Mandela, who is inclined to use the Thatcher 'we'. A senior minister told him how Vietnam had allowed 'more scope to private enterprise and to reduce state participation. Very cautiously, very diplomatically, he suggested to us that we had to examine the question of nationalisation. 'We want to attract investment,' he continued, 'but nationalisation is the sword of Damocles hanging above the heads of the people who want to invest. . . As long as nationalisation is our policy, it is clear to me that we are not going to attract investors.' He gave a clear indication of his thinking on nationalisation: the ANC should 'be able to (achieve redistribution of wealth) without nationalisation'. He suggested that he would prefer to redress the legacy of apartheid in other ways: tax reforms, partnerships with the private sector and by encouraging land redistribution through a land bank. He was aware that a battle might be looming at the ANC policy conference next April. 'I am not saying that my colleagues will be convinced that the time has come to abolish nationalisation.' But he will tell them that they have to choose between nationalisation and foreign investment. As at Davos, however, Mr Mandela may have to repeat his message before it gets through.</p>

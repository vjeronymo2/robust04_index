			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK fails to speed HK liaison group talks BRITAIN yesterday failed to persuade China to speed the work of the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) which deals with problems arising from the colony's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Though talks in London between Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and UK premier John Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd were described by British officials as 'constructive,' many issues remain to be settled before the handover. These include the HK government's plans to 'corporatise' the Hong Kong Radio and Television organisation, which the Chinese oppose, and UK demands to know what use the Chinese People's Liberation Army intends to make of military facilities in the colony. While Qian reaffirmed China's commitment to the 1984 Anglo-Chinese joint declaration on Hong Kong and the memorandum of understanding on the building of the colony's new airport, he rejected British procedural proposals for speeding work in the JLG. Britain had suggested specific deadlines be set for replies to proposals made by either side. The British leaders again declined to insist on faster implementation of Hong Kong's embryonic democratic system, saying they intended to raise the issue formally in the JLG soon. But Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, said in Guangzhou (Canton) yesterday that any alteration to current plans would need a change to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. Qian used his visit to London to deposit the instruments of China's adhesion to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He called the move 'a major step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons'. Mr Major raised human rights issues, particularly the recent sentencing in China of 11 political dissidents, and appealed for clemency for Wang Jun Tao, who is known to be ill. His appeal was neither accepted nor rejected by Qian, but China has agreed to allow an all-party group of British MPs led by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former foreign secretary, to visit China to look into human rights.</p>

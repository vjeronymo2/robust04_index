			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bela Marko, chairman of the Democratic Union </F> of Hungarians in Romania, and Executive Chairman Csaba Takacs by  Janos Gyarmath; place and date not given: "There Has Been No  Breakthrough"]    [Text] At the initiative of Romanian President Ion  Iliescu, the dialogue with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania [RMDSZ] reopened on 1 February, after an interval of  almost a year. The long "diplomatic" recess in itself shows the  tension between the presidential body and the RMDSZ, mainly as a  result of the fact that the RMDSZ remained uncompromising even  after its Brasov congress, did not discard its goals, and  consistently adhered to its program; President Ion Iliescu has  repeatedly expressed his resentment because of this. In his  view, the national minority issue in Romania has been  satisfactorily settled in every respect according to the  international norms, the causes of possible differences of views  should be sought only among the minorities themselves, primarily  the RMDSZ, who are fighting for privileges rather than for  rights. Although Iliescu has hardly changed anything in his  concept, he nevertheless invited the leadership of the RMDSZ for  a dialogue on 1 February, probably in view of the events and  unfavorable international reactions, as well as out of certain  political considerations.    [Gyarmath] We have already cleared up the misunderstanding  that it was President Iliescu, and not the RMDSZ, who initiated  this meeting. As far as I know, the RMDSZ had prepared for the  meeting and was ready for dialogue. Mr Marko, how did you  actually prepare for this meeting, and what was its goal?    [Marko] It is well known that the RMDSZ had not been in the  presidential palace for almost a year, but this does not mean  that every contact was severed. Thus, before the start of the  end-of- the-year consultations initiated by Ion Iliescu, it was  not yet clear whether the parties of the Democratic Convention  would appear together or separately, so we prepared for both  possibilities. As is well known, a joint delegation met with  Ion Iliescu after all, and our representatives, including  myself, were also part of this delegation. However, under these  circumstances, we could only summarily mention our particular  demands and ideas. At the end of the talks, the president came  up with a proposal to meet him separately, and we could not  reject this offer because our organization favors an open  dialogue and also because we had things to say to him. Our goal  was finally to hand over the package of documents prepared by  our Executive Committee.    [Gyarmath] What is in this package?    [Marko] Let us begin -- precisely because of its timeliness  owing to the approaching Council of Europe deadline on Romania's  implementation of its proposals -- with our memorandum to the  Council of Europe and its appendix, which we sent to Strasbourg  recently. The package also contains the bill on national  minorities and autonomous communities formulated by the RMDSZ  and registered by Parliament, a bill that we included for  purposes of information and study, as well as numerous analyses,  memoranda, and documentation regarding education,  self-government bodies, the restitution of church properties,  the fate of the convicts from Hargita county and Marosvasarhely  [Tirgu Mures], and the increasingly tense inter- ethnic  relations in the Kovaszna and Cluj counties. When describing  the package of documents at the beginning of the meeting, I  stressed that it contained all the essential problems facing the  Hungarians living in Romania, and it listed not only the  unsolved problems but also the solutions.    [Gyarmath] Therefore, we can practically call it a package  of RMDSZ proposals....    [Marko] Obviously, because we presented solutions to the  national minority issue and how the problems of the Hungarian  community in Romania should be treated. We also indicated that  this meeting was taking place at a time when four months had  already passed since Romania's acceptance onto the Council of  Europe, and two months before officials would visit Romania to  see which Council of Europe proposals this country had  implemented. We concluded that, in our opinion, none of these  proposals had been implemented! Thus, the RMDSZ has not seen any  progress either in the past four years or the past four months!  Obviously, a lot of questions could already have been resolved,  such as the issue of the convicts of Zetelak, Oroszhegy, and  Marosvasarhely, which the president himself and other  responsible government officials had promised would be solved by  the end of last year.    [Gyarmath] How did the president receive all this?    [Marko] After a short presentation of the package of  documents, we had a long talk and discussion for more than three  hours, in the course of which we reviewed the essential issues  included in these documents. I must immediately point out that,  as I see it, the president has not changed his position  expressed during previous meetings. Therefore, we told him  that, as long as he thinks that there are no problems in  legislation and in shaping legal frameworks in Romania, while we  claim that we need totally new legal frameworks here, we cannot  imagine how to seek a solution. Therefore, all that happened was  that I myself and my colleagues listed and presented our  positions on these issues with arguments and documents. The  mere presentation of the problems showed that the situation was  stagnating and opposite trends were emerging.    [Gyarmath] What conclusion did you draw in the end?    [Marko] As I see it, the president continues to hold a  totally different position from ours; thus, the two positions  have not come closer to each other and there has been no  breakthrough. We can, however, call it a positive development  that the president declared that they would study the documents  presented by us and we would be informed about their conclusions  in writing. At the same time, the president proposed to make  this form of a dialogue a regular feature: a meeting every  quarter of a year. In connection with this, we told him that  this only made sense if these dialogues took place in the spirit  of solutions, that is, if there is progress after these  meetings. We refuse to engage in fruitless and empty dialogues.  Of course, many things happen and many things are said at a  meeting of more than three hours.    [Takacs] These negotiations have again proved the opposing  viewpoints from which we approach the issues and democracy in  Romania. It is well known that the RMDSZ is in favor of a  general democratic restructuring, and the national minority  issue is one of the components of this restructuring. At the  same time, our opinions also differ on whether Romania's  interests coincide with the interests of the current government.  The positions regarding Romania, the Romanian people, and the  processes that accelerate or hinder this democratic  restructuring became clear during the meeting. Thus, although  Ion Iliescu made a lot of critical remarks about the RMDSZ  address during this meeting, we refuted all of them one after  the other. For example, he criticized us for sending a  memorandum to the international forum and for formulating a  reminder after four months. It clearly transpired from his  approach to this and other issues that we have different ideas  about democracy and progress. After all, strengthening local  government bodies, decentralization, and the depolitization of  state institutions are not only in the interest of the Hungarian  minority but also in the interest of the Romanian people.    [Gyarmath] Thus, do you feel that a dialogue of the deaf  took place in the Cotroceni Palace?    [Takacs] Not exactly, because, in my view, during the talks,  the president slowly began to realize not only that the RMDSZ  was presenting the issues from its own viewpoint, but that these  issues can be either acceptable or disputable from the viewpoint  of a political evaluation and approach. We stressed that in  these documents, which also include proposals for solutions, we  are starting from the facts, and not from presenting our  demands, and it is impossible to refute the elements of reality.  Nor is it refutable that general democracy and the introduction  of European norms is also in the interest of Romania, and not  only that of the opposition or of the RMDSZ. Therefore, we  think that everything that is good for European democracy and  everything that raises the standards of these societies in every  respect is also good for Romania. Strangely enough, if we or  the opposition say that, they regard it as a hostile  manifestation. Therefore, we asked the president to try to  build an objective information channel that shows reality,  rather than serving power interests. For example, Iliescu had  just learned that the judges in the trial of the Zetelak affair  were Romanians, not Hungarians. It also transpired that the  president had no idea of the discriminatory measures used in  appointing people in Kovaszna county and of the ethnic pressures  on so-called non-Hungarian families and children. Although it  is clear that all this involves a violation of the Constitution,  the president said that he had no idea of these things. Even if  this is true, it does not mean that he is free from  responsibility, because he himself chose his advisers and all  those who inform him. Therefore, we can say that his team as a  whole works uniformly against the Hungarians. We stressed that  we were open to dialogue, and the fact that we handed over our  document package for studying is a sign of this and, of course,  we expect a response both in words and deeds. Thus, from our  viewpoint, I regard this meeting as important because it  provided an opportunity to inform the president about the issues  and the political goals of the RMDSZ clearly, unequivocally, and  without distortions, goals that we will not give up for any  opportunistic considerations. As for making the dialogue  between the presidency and the RMDSZ a regular one, we must  stress that there is only sense in holding such meeting  regularly if it has no hidden or show-policy aims, if the RMDSZ  achieves results, and if the meeting is not used to show  "results" to the international public opinion. In other words,  the RMDSZ cannot and will not be a partner with any government  that makes use of a policy of delay. We did not commit  ourselves to negotiate for decades; we committed ourselves to  only negotiate if there is a hope of achieving results.    [Gyarmath] How would you evaluate the meeting?    [Takacs] Obviously, we have a lot of reservations, and we  can hardly say that we have found understanding. However, we  cannot say that the meeting was useless. By presenting this  document package in the spirit of our congress held in Brasso  [Brasov], all we did was to put the ball into our opponent's  court. No one will be able to say now that he does not know or  understand what we want; we have carried out the necessary  clarification.    [Gyarmath] Have you felt any political will toward resolving  the issues, or even one single issue?    [Marko] Neither the opposition nor the RMDSZ should have any  illusions or believe that any political change will take place  soon. However, given that this issue requires a more lengthy  explanation, I think we should let life give an answer and wait  and see what happens.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd </F> by Andrew Marr and Donald MacIntyre; place and date not given]    [Text] Think of the Old Tories and, chances are, you think  of Douglas Hurd. In a government which seems increasingly  febrile and undignified, he remains a relict of patrician calm  -- unflappable, poised, his standing in the party apparently  undiminished by foreign policy controversies. The same  qualities that so handicapped him in the leadership contest  against John Major more than three years ago seem now rather  valuable and rare. However confused they are about other  ministers, the grassroots Tories still trust Douglas. Now he is  in charge of writing the party's European manifesto, doing the  thinking for the campaign widely seen as Mr Major's last chance.    This is not the way he would like to see his task. Speaking  publicly for the first time about his strategy for that  election, he argues that the party itself would not stand for  another parliamentary coup: "I think it would be so silly that  it won't happen. The shock of what happened in 1990 is still  quite strong among active Conservatives, and I think the idea of  that happening again would horrify them, so it would be crazy."  It would be electorally self-destructive? "Yes."    Logically, that might be so. Politically, it is hard to deny  that a fresh outburst of factional fighting over Europe,  followed by terrible losses, could send the Conservative Party  into such a jellied state that Mr Major would be putsched. Mr  Hurd is well aware that the job of constructing a unifying  European policy is not only intellectually difficult but, in  terms of politics, essential. So how is he going about it?    The theory may sound optimistic, too convenient to be true.  It is essentially that the dragon of federalist centralism has  died of old age. St George is not needed: "The founding  fathers of the Community looked at a Europe which had been twice  shattered in this century and they said we really mustn't let  loose the nation states to do this again." But now, argues  Hurd, the danger of a war between Britain, France and Germany  has gone, and with it the need for the centralising model  devised to prevent it.    That being so, the centralisers are all caught on the wrong  side of history. Germany, France, even President Delors, now see  the need to retain the nation state and to limit the power of  Brussels, leaving Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the more  extreme Tory federalists out of date. Maastricht was a  compromise, Hurd says. And yet the countries of Europe only just  got it through by a handful of votes, in Denmark, in France, in  the British Parliament. "I think the view which is simply  centralising is an old-fashioned one. There are plenty of  people who hold it still but I think it's old-fashioned, and  gradually it's losing ground. It's no less European to argue  for the kind of Europe that I'm talking about than it to argue  for what I call the old-fashioned view, that gradually, bit by  bit, decision making moves to the centre...."    This will be hailed by all but the hard-line Europhobes as a  distinct tilt to their position, a coded acknowledgement that  they were right. It offers rather less to Mr Hurd's old allies  on the "Positive European" wing of the party. There will be a  ban on xenophobic rhetoric in the campaign, no echoes of the  disastrous "Diet of Brussels" sloganising of the 1989 campaign.  But anti-centralism is still anti-centralism, however modulated  and civilised the tone in which it is expressed.    The tactics, though, are as interesting as the theory. Mr  Hurd has identified the Conservative Party's relationship with  the European People's Party -- the grouping of mainly federalist  centre-right parties in the Union -- as a potential weak spot in  the campaign. So the Tories will distinguish between their  loose "alliance" with sister parties, and Labour's subordinate  role as a wing of the European socialist grouping. Labour will  be at tacked for the views of continental socialists while the  Conservatives will deny any responsibility for the views of  their allies.    There is, of course, a contradiction here: if the Europeans  are moving against centralism, why be so careful to distinguish  the British Tories from their sister parties? But this is  perhaps one of those nuances which will be lost in the  campaigning.    It would be a considerable achievement to limit the Tory  split on Europe. But Mr Hurd acknowledges that the campaign  will be fought on the Government's general reputation too, and  that ill-disciplined factionalism among Tory politicians could  blow apart the carefully constructed platform. He distinguishes  between real differences over policy and principle, when  "serious politicians are entitled to make their view known", and  the current factionalism, which he regards as more trivial,  though dangerous: "a tendency, I don't say to start the  telephone conversation, but when asked for views to chatter away  without a great deal of thought, sometimes attributably,  sometimes, unattributably, without considering whether the  impression given really corresponds to reality. And I think  that phase...has to be brought to an end. It has done the  Labour Party a lot of harm in the past, and it will do us a lot  of harm if it continues."    Leaders can only do so much: they rely on the discipline of  the party always. But is this a Government that deserves to  survive? When asked whether he can imagine entering the next  election with a government record of which he can feel proud, Mr  Hurd gamely says that this is what he expects to happen. He  lists the conventional hopes of economic recovery, progress on  education and law and order, a consensus on Europe. So far as  "the basics, as they're now called" are concerned, he is clearly  not hung up on the words and suggests less morally charged  alternatives such as "common sense" or "the fundamentals."    But what of the so-called sleaze factor, the idea that  standards of public morality are not all they should be? Is  this something that is simply of interest to the chattering  classes which will fade away with economic recovery? Mr Hurd  thinks not, and takes a fairly robust view on the need for  ministers and MPs to be closely scrutinised. Scandals were  "dealt with...through a mixture of public criticism and  misfortune" which could be "harsh."    Unlike Lord Howe, one of his predecessors in the Foreign  Office, he was relaxed about the Scott inquiry into the Matrix  Churchill affair. He was, he says, "reassured" by his  appearance at the inquiry at the "tone and content" of the  issues the inquiry was concentrating on. It is too early to  say, but those issues seem "light years" from the "penumbra"  created by many of the press stories about the inquiry.    And on the Pergau dam affair, if it is being said that it's  wrong to sell defence equipment to Malaysia, and it's wrong that  in all circumstances Britain's aid effort should help our  exporters round the country, then he says he is rather looking  forward to appearing before the Foreign Affairs Select  Committee. But anyway, he insists, no one in his department  brushes these issues aside as trivial. Every Question Time,  every appearance at the Public Accounts Committee or Scott, he  says, are "huge events" and have to be treated accordingly.    What is finally striking about Douglas Hurd is his  resilience, his dogged optimism where optimism seems  unreasonable. It may be partly a facade, but it's also about  that mysterious Tory quality, "bottom." This is how  Conservatives used to be.</p>

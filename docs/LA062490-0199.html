			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO / BRADLEY INMAN;  </P> <P> TREASURER'S CAMPAIGN COMES CALLING ON THE INVESTMENT BANKS  </P> <P> For the past few months, state Treasurer Tom Hayes has been wearing two hats --  one as campaigner, the other as guardian of the state's public purse. That  can't be easy for a button-down guy who is a novice on the campaign trail and  who is just beginning to master his current job.  </P> <P> Hayes -- a 43-year-old ex-Marine who was appointed to the job in January, 1989,  and won the Republican primary earlier this month -- is portrayed by his  supporters as a fiscal taskmaster and a steady hand at the helm of the state's  vast financial empire. During the general election campaign, voters will be  reminded of his credentials as a champion of the competitive bidding process  and as a trustworthy custodian of California's AAA credit rating.  </P> <P> But with a formidable opponent in Democrat Kathleen Brown, Hayes faces an  expensive statewide campaign that depends on a lot of big contributors.  </P> <P> Recently, campaign fund-raising and the state's financial affairs have crossed  paths, illustrating what a wobbly tightrope Hayes must walk.  </P> <P> On April 26, Hayes solicited proposals from 16 of the nation's largest  investment banking firms on issuing $150 million in revenue bonds for  construction of the California state prison in Madera. Companies such as Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.; Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.; Lazard Freres &amp;  Co.; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.; Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, and First  Boston Corp. were contacted. Their proposals were due back in the Treasurer's  office May 4.  </P> <P> On May 16, the investment bankers were notified that all of the firms invited  to submit proposals had done so but that the Treasurer's office would delay a  decision on which firm would manage sale of the bonds.  </P> <P> During this time, many of the same firms or their employees were invited to  campaign fund-raising luncheons for Hayes. A $1,000-a-plate affair was  scheduled for May 10 at the executive dining room of Security Pacific Bank in  Los Angeles and a $500-a-plate gathering for May 24 at the Bankers Club in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Critics see a conflict of interest. "You should not be raising funds from those  people who you are soliciting (state business) from," argues Ruth Holton,  legislative advocate for Common Cause. "Even if it wasn't a deliberate attempt  to coerce a contribution, there appears to be a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> Hayes was not available for comment, but spokespersons for his campaign and the  Treasurer's office denied a link between his fund-raising activities and  decisions in the Treasurer's office.  </P> <P> "We can't just stop the business of the state because Tom has a campaign to  run," said Donna Lucas, of the Treasurer's office.  </P> <P> Assistant Treasurer Russell Gould said his office's guidelines prohibit the  staff from getting involved with Hayes' campaign. Campaign manager Brian  Lungren said lists used for the fund-raisers were not obtained from the  Treasurer's office and that campaign officials had no knowledge of the Madera  prison project.  </P> <P> "We are no different than any other campaign," Lungren said. "We rely on local  fund-raising consultants, and they often have developed lists from other  campaigns, such as Bush, Reagan and Deukmejian."  </P> <P> The Hayes campaign also taps a "house list," which is made up of 6,000  contributors who have previously donated to him. Lungren said there's little  doubt that some names on the Treasurer's bidding list would also show up on  fund-raising rosters. In fact, all of the firms on the bid list for the Madera  prison project have previously contributed to the Hayes campaign or have key  employees who contributed. In 1989, Hayes received at least $80,000 from these  companies or their employees.  </P> <P> Moreover, there is nothing illegal about an elected state officeholder  soliciting political contributions from the same groups that do business with a  state agency -- unless there is a quid pro quo between candidate and  contributor.  </P> <P> What about the appearance of a conflict of interest? "We are going out with  RFPs (requests for proposals) all of the time. This is no different," Lucas  said.  </P> <P> One investment banker, who asked to remain anonymous, had a different view. "It  was breathless timing," he said. "Never have I seen such a hurried attempt to  issue a bond and then have everything be put on hold -- all right before the  (primary) election."  </P> <P> But Gould cites other reasons for delaying the Madera prison bond sale: "Just  about the time we were making plans to go to market, the governor announced the  $3-billion budget deficit. That's not a good time to make investor decisions of  this magnitude."  </P> <P> The investment banking community has a mixed view of the matter. "This is an  example of how politicalized the process can get," complained a banker who  asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> "I don't see any relationship between the two (fund-raising and the bids),"  said a representative from Prudential-Bache. "Maybe it's because I receive so  many fund-raising requests this time of year. I've got seven on my desk right  now."  </P> <P> First Boston apparently felt that attending the San Francisco fund-raiser would  hurt its chances of doing business with the state, so it didn't attend. "It may  sound odd, but we were worried that appearing on the list of attendees might  hurt us in the long run, given Mr. Hayes' widely proclaimed divorce between  policy and politics," managing director Michael George said.  </P> <P> Campaign manager Lungren declared flatly that contributors won't get special  treatment when it comes to awarding state business.  </P> <P> "Tom has been up front about his commitment to competitive bidding and open  about his fund-raising philosophy," Lungren said. "If contributors want to  demonstrate their support of open and competitive bidding, they can contribute  to the campaign, but all they can hope for in return is that they will be  treated fairly."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> WestAir Is Streamlining: Commuter-flight operator WestAir Holding Inc. of  Fresno said it will close its United Express regional headquarters in Pasco,  Wash., to reduce management costs. The closure, which will eliminate about 75  jobs, is unlikely to disrupt commuter service in the Northwest, WestAir said.  After the restructuring, WestAir will have an Atlantic coast division operating  from Dulles Airport near Washington and a West Coast division operating from  hubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Sacramento and Fresno.  </P></p>

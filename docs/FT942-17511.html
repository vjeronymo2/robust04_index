			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Wait for the film SCOTTISH SAMURAI: THOMAS BLAKE GLOVER 1838-1911 by Alexander McKay Canongate Press Pounds 25, 162 pages Job losses and employment pressures are hardly new, even if they are causing pre-millennial stress in most of today's developed countries. They date, no doubt, from the earliest days of civilisation. Even in Japan, pressure to cut industrial costs by booting out more and more workers was building up steam more than a century ago. Take tea-sifting. In 1867, a resourceful and lusty Scottish businessman, Thomas Glover, anxious to boost the profits of his three Nagasaki tea plants, hit upon a way of using steam-driven machinery to sift tea. The British consul's Report on Trade in Nagasaki for 1867 observed that the machinery was doing remarkably well, but that 'a better constructed and finished machine is now on the way out from England . . . It is a great saving in manual labour, which is a great consideration in an establishment where 1,600 hands are generally employed during the tea-firing season.' This machine - invented and constructed on the spot - was state-of-the-art. We do not learn from Scottish Samurai how many of the 1,600 workers were thrown into the street by Glover's invention, but the author reckons that some of Glover's drive and inventiveness rubbed off on the Japanese. We are also told that Glover can be regarded as one of the guiding spirits of Japan's 20th century economic miracle. Scottish Samurai is a remarkable story. The son of a Scottish coastguard officer, Glover left Aberdeen as a young man, first for Shanghai, then for Japan. He became an entrepreneur, ship-builder, gun-runner, anti-Shogun rebel and adviser to Mitsubishi. He was a friend of Japan's first prime minister and was decorated by the emperor in 1908. He was also a man of the flesh, fathering at least four children by Japanese beauties. There is a bridge leading into Nagasaki's red light district of Maruyama which the Japanese call the Shian Bashi, or Hesitation Bridge. Further in there is a second bridge, Omoikiri Bashi, or Made-Up-Your-Mind Bridge, for the tumescently-committed. Glover, it seems, was not one to have been deterred by Shian Bashi. This is a great story: the sort that Bernardo Bertolucci would pay good money for. The book, however, is unengagingly written and gaspingly over-priced. It seems to have been partly sponsored by Aberdeen city council. Nothing wrong with that, especially, except that Pounds 25 for such a flatly-written tale (the author is 'employed by a major oil company on an oil production platform in the North Sea', if you please) is impertinent. Skip the book, and just hope that someone films it.</p>

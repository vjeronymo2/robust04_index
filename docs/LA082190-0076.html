			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET SCENE;  </P> <P> BOOM AND BUST IN MOSCOW: THE SAGA OF TWO U.S. FIRMS;  </P> <P> BUSINESS IS FINALLY GOOD FOR IBM BECAUSE IT HAS THE COMPUTER GOODS THAT THE  TECHNOLOGY STARVED SOVIET PUBLIC WANTS.  </P> <P> After sticking it out through years of mediocre-to-bad U.S.-Soviet trade  relations, IBM can finally afford to do business its own way, according to the  head of its Moscow office, Burt Polishook.  </P> <P> Throughout the world, IBM uses community projects to market its products and  hires only local nationals, Polishook explained. "IBM is known for being a  citizen of the community in all the big cities of the world. But the ability to  do community projects depends on the financial shape of the IBM office."  </P> <P> And even though the company has been represented here for 18 years, it wasn't  until late last year that the Soviet office generated enough business for IBM  to use those same techniques here.  </P> <P> Polishook refused to talk in figures or percentages about the growth of IBM's  business in the Soviet Union, but he made it clear that the goods his company  has to offer are in huge demand.  </P> <P> "This country is computer starved," he exclaimed. "Business is clearly getting  better each year."  </P> <P> As an illustration of how the company's community service projects work,  consider its program, several months old, of supplying computers and know-how  for workshops on computer use for the disabled and in public schools. At its  own expense, IBM also sent 18 Soviet computer professors to IBM's European  education center in Belgium to train them in the IBM way of teaching computer  science to schoolchildren.  </P> <P> "The reception has been extremely positive, and we did get a contract out of  it," Polishook said. The Soviet Education Ministry signed a contract with IBM  this spring to supply 13,000 computers to secondary schools across the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> "We got the contract because we showed that we understand the use of computers  in education, and we demonstrated our capability to support the computers, not  just sell them and walk away," Polishook said.  </P> <P> In the last four months, IBM has also started recruiting Soviet computer  specialists to help out with marketing and servicing its products. So far, the  company has lined up agents in Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Dnepropetrovsk and  elsewhere. These agents are the first step toward staffing IBM's Soviet  operations exclusively with Soviet nationals, following its pattern nearly  everywhere else.  </P> <P> None of this would have been possible without an improvement in superpower  relations, Polishook said.  </P> <P> Until recently, IBM was limited to selling small computers to Soviet clients  because of restrictions set by the 17-member, U.S.-led Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. But last month Cocom significantly  eased its rules, and now IBM can market its main-frame computers to Soviet  clients for the first time.  </P> <P> "What we see is great interest in the large systems from government ministries,  institutes and joint ventures," said Polishook, nattily attired in a navy-blue  suit. "Business is better because we can offer more and because they want  more."  </P> <P> Superpower economic relations were generally lukewarm at best even during the  detente years of the 1970s. Then-President Jimmy Carter ordered a virtual trade  freeze after the Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in 1979. IBM  director and chairman emeritus Thomas Watson Jr. was U.S. ambassador in Moscow  during that difficult time.  </P> <P> "After Afghanistan, I don't think we could sell anything," Polishook said. But,  he added, IBM is now profiting from its decision to tough it out in Moscow  during those hard times.  </P> <P> "It really helps us," the executive said. "We have a customer base, we know how  to do business here and we're still willing to be flexible."  </P> <P> Despite the demand for computers, IBM, like most foreign firms, is limited in  its sales to Soviet businesses because they lack freely convertible currencies  like dollars or yen.  </P> <P> Until recently, for example, IBM refused to sell computers for anything but  freely convertible currencies -- a policy meaning that, like most foreign  firms, IBM's sales were limited by the Kremlin's hard currency shortage. It's  still a problem, but now IBM is also bartering with Soviet clients.  </P> <P> Many foreign computer firms are competing for the Soviet market, but Polishook  said IBM is ahead of the pack because of its name recognition. Even Soviet  computers and software are designed to be IBM compatible.  </P> <P> Polishook said the elements are in place for a real turnaround in the Soviet  economic system. "The future has never looked better here," he said. "Both the  desire for change and the understanding of what needs to change are here.  </P> <P> "It will take years for it to happen. You have to think of it as a point in  history. If you see where they've come from and in what time frame they've done  it, then you realize the right things have been happening."  </P> <P> American businesses, he said, can be part of the change.  </P> <P> "If you start out knowing business here is not what it is in New York or Paris,  and you're committed to helping change the system -- then you're part of the  solution," he said.  </P></p>

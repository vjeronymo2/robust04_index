There emerges a strange phenomenon of IOU slips of  five different colors prevailing in the realm of circulation.  These slips have become the lubricants in China's financial  sector just next to the renminbi as a secondary instrument of  payment.    As an economic center and hub, China's financial sector was  quite abnormal this summer. There was a shortage of cash and  funds. There emerged a phenomenon of so-called, "All five sons  passing civil examination with flying colors" -- namely, white  IOU slips, red IOU slips, green IOU clips, yellow IOU slips and  black IOU slips. For a short period, these slips have become the  lubricants in China's financial sector, next to the renminbi as  a secondary instrument of payment.  <H5>  White IOU Slips Owe Peasants Several Billion Yuan </H5>   1. White IOU slips. These are IOU slips issued by the state  in lieu of cash when it purchases farm and sideline products  from peasants. In recent years, the purchasing departments in  China's rural areas, particularly the grain and cotton producing  districts in Central Plains, are short of funds. They have  issued a large number of white IOU slips. When the purchasing of  summer grain crops started in June this year, a large amount of  funds earmarked for the purchasing of grain crops did not arrive  on time. Misuse of state funds is everywhere. The 11 billion  yuan earnest money needed for the purchasing of grain crops and  cotton in the country fail to arrive on time. According to  statistics compiled by the Bank of Agriculture in May, only six  billion yuan in cash are available.    Since ancient times, the symptom of peasants selling grain  to the state but failing to get paid has always indicated that  troubled times are coming. News of small scale riots stirred up  by peasants to buy chemical fertilizer in panic keeps pouring in  from various localities. In this connection, the State Council  held a special telephone meeting demanding that the local  authorities ensure that funds for the purchasing grain and  cotton arrive on time and that the phenomenon of issuing white  IOU's must be eliminated. Liu Jiang, Minister of Agriculture,  said that all the funds from the central authorities have  already arrived. Wherever IOU slips appear, the responsible  persons there will be severely punished, he added.  <H5>  Green IOU's Owe Recipients of Postal Remittance Debts </H5>   2. Green IOU's. These IOU's are issued by post offices to  postal remittance recipients for the money they owe. Such green  IOU slips began to appear in Central South, Southwest and North  China at the beginning of 1993. They reached a peak during the  Spring Festival.    For example, a large number of civilian workers from  Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and other localities rushed to the  coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian to find jobs. When they  earn money, they remit money back to their home towns. The  amount of such remittances is on the increase every year. As a  result, post offices at and below the county level are unable to  pay cash to the recipients of such postal remittance because of  shortage in funds. Whenever there is a trade fair, peasants  often gather around the post office to withdraw money, but the  post office is unable to pay in cash. Peasants in some  localities are so angry that they break into post offices and  beat up the postal clerks.    According to a CHINA DAILY report, the situation whereby  peasants attack post offices prevails in 11 provinces. A survey  shows that there are 200 million green IOU's in Hunan, 300  million green IOU's in Sichuan Province, and each IOU owes 500  renminbi in average. The main reason for this is attributed to  the unreasonable form for settling accounts for postal  remittance. Due to the fact that various departments fail to  recognize the use of post offices as a main channel of fund  circulation and that the banks cannot meet the demands of rural  post offices in drawing money to pay for the post remittances,  postal office have no other choice but issue more green IOU  slips.  <H5>  Red IOU's Owe Worker-Investors Debts </H5>   3. Red IOU's. These are receipts with red stamps issued by  the enterprises and institutions in various localities when they  borrow money from their staff members and workers. This is a  form of fund-raising from staff members and workers in one's own  unit.    Officials point out that there are more and more red IOU  slips in various localities throughout the country. No one can  accurately compile statistics in this connection. In 1992 alone,  the total amount of money raised in society reached more than 50  billion yuan Renminbi. It was as high as 20 billion yuan during  the first quarter of this year.    Due to the fact that red IOU slips constitute an internal  fund-raising form in an enterprise or institution, the interest  rate is usually higher than that paid by the bank for saving  deposits or bond dividends by a large margin. Various units try  their best to extend their tentacles to all sectors of the  society. The most common form is to exploit peasants. For  example, a factory in a certain city in Sichuan Province used  the hiring of workers as a bait. As long as a peasant can pay  5,000 yuan, he or she can work in the factory. As a result, it  raised more than 300,000 yuan in a few days. This constitutes an  irresistible temptation to peasants who are unable to work in  the cities for generations.    The trend of internal money borrowing is like the Eight  Immortals crossing the sea, each one showing his or her special  prowess. Some enterprises issue bonds among the workers, while  others ask workers to buy shares. Still others pay high  interests to borrow money within one's own enterprise. An expert  points out that red IOU slips are attractive, but they are  extremely risky. Once the borrowers lost their investments, who  is going to pay for these valueless IOU's ?    It is reported by newspapers that many people have suffered  losses in investing their money in private fund-raising  campaigns launched by various enterprises. The main reason is  that the fund-raising companies make careless investments and  fail to retrieve their capital, let alone make profits. There  were scores of state organizations and journalist units raised  funds within its own organization or unit to make investments in  the so-called "Production Enterprises for New Products" and  "Bases for Farm and Sideline Products." As a result, they failed  to recover their capital. Many of them also used funds to  illegally buy and sell foreign exchange, real estate and stocks  and shares, and suffered losses.    China's largest financial fraud -- the "Great Wall"  fund-raising case -- was exposed in July this year. It was a  major case involving red IOU slips. More than 100,000 people  were hoodwinked, and over one billion yuan renminbi were  illegally seized and squandered. The kind of stupidity and  frenzy driven by money shocked many people. It was rumored in  Beijing that the "Great Wall" fraud was a major case involving  high-ranking leaders of the central authorities including  Premier Li Peng and his wife and some ministers.  <H5>  Yellow IOU Slips Owe Bank Customers Debts </H5>   4. Yellow IOU Slips. These are slips issued by the bank to  its customers, when it fails to make payments at their request.  Since the beginning of 1993, the amount of savings deposits in  rural and urban areas in the country fluctuated enormously under  the influence of the fund-raising campaigns, the flourishing  stock market and the high inflation rate. A sign of negative  growth which was rarely seen for many years has appeared,  causing "extracorporeal circulation" of funds and a tight money  situation.    As a result, it takes more than 20 days to normally transfer  funds from one bank to another in the same city. Under the  pressure of increasing demands for money and in order to  alleviate the situation in fund shortage, the bank does not  hesitate to sacrifice its own credit to procrastinate the check  clearance procedure. Meanwhile, it issues yellow IOU slips to  its customers who wish to draw money from the bank, trying to  shift its own difficulties to other banks. As a result, it  causes a chain reaction, forcing many banks to fail in meeting  their payments.    Right now, a "debt chain" has been formed among the banks  throughout the nation. Although banks use fines as a principal  measure to strictly restrict the issuance of yellow IOU slips,  some of the banks still cannot meet the payments, because they  cannot receive money they expect to receive on time. Thus it is  quite difficult to impose fines on banks under such  circumstances. Due to the fact that the bank is unable to  collect the large amount of money receivable, it has to extend  the number of days needed to deposit the money into its  customer's account. It has greatly lowered the rate of fund  utilization and economic efficiency. As a result, the credit of  the bank suffers a disastrous decline.    Thus, in order to ensure smooth production, some of the  enterprises, on the one hand, keep a large amount of cash on  hand for emergency use, while on the other hand, they try their  best not to settle accounts through the banks. They often pay  cash to do business among themselves, making the banks even more  difficult to operate.  <H5>  Black IOU Slips Owe Debtors of Underground Private Banks </H5>   5. Black IOU Slips -- Right now, the industrial and  commercial organizations, public security organs and banks have  different views on whether or not pawnshops, private banks and  private financing groups should be considered as members of the  financial sector. As a result, these "financial institutions"  have emerged with a legal status of people-to-people loaners.  They have become a fashion for a time. People call the deposit  slips of these highly risky and speculative "underground banks"  as "black IOU slips."    Let us take Shanxi Province as an example, pawnshop business  booms, and pawnshops mushroom in many counties and cities.  According to a rough estimate, there are more than 20 large  pawnshops in the province with their branches spreading over 70  percent of the villages and counties in Southern Shanxi.  Pawnshops not only attract a large of deposits by paying  interests higher than the banks, but also extend loans in  various forms. They directly collide with businesses of the  local banks. In fact, they have created a situation of "private  banks" monopolizing the financial sector.    For example, a private bank in Wafangdian, Liaoning  Province, has attracted more than 100 million yuan deposits  since 1991 in the legal form of people-to-people loans. "Bank  Director" Chen Shulan's financial strengths and capabilities to  make payments are far greater than the local banks. Even the  local state Bank of Agriculture is affected by this private  bank. Its customers withdraw as much as over 50 million yuan  from the bank. Trying their best to lure deposits with high  interests, this kind of private banks are becoming larger and  large in scale. However, they often make unhealthy investments,  and they have no regular income to pay the interests. Investors  often find their deposits irretrievable, causing disputes and  leading to murders. Tear down west wall to repair the east wall,  they love to play money games of a vicious cycle. Once the  dominoes fall, a large number of people with black IOU slips  will lose everything they have.</p>

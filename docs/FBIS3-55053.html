			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia and Belarus will merge their monetary  systems in the second half of January. The Russian ruble will  freely circulate on the territory of Belarus. This agreement  has been reached at the Russian-Belarusian negotiations  conducted by Boris Yeltsin and the government leaders of both  countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich. After  almost three hours of talks, the prime ministers signed an  agreement on the unification of monetary systems of the Russian  Federation and Belarus. The document says that monetary systems  of both countries will be merged after Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Vyacheslav Kebich sign in late January in Minsk more than 10  agreements regulating the mechanisms of this process. In an  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vyacheslav Kebich  said it was agreed that the one-to-one exchange rate for both  currencies during the unification be established. Vyacheslav  Kebich believes that Belarus' transition to the Russian ruble  will be a continued process lasting for three to six months.  This is caused by purely technical problems of Belarus [words  indistinct].</p>

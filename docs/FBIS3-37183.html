According to the Saeima press service, during the  meeting Anatolijs Gorbunovs pointed out that the two countries  in recent years had succeeded in forging close cooperation in  political and economic matters. He praised the role of the  German embassy, as well as that of the support group for Latvia  set up in German Bundestag, in stepping up the process.    The ambassador on his part stressed that Latvia was a part  of  Europe and the process of its integration into European  structures had to be continued. He said Latvian politicians had  yet to face two major problems, notably, withdrawal of Russian  troops and passing the law on citizenship.    Anatolijs Gorbunovs stated that Latvia should push forward  with its efforts to reach a concrete agreement on Russian troops  pull-out, which would include conditions set by Latvian  negotiators. The chairman of the Saeima also said he considered  it an urgent necessity to find the best formula for solving the  citizenship controversy, which would be acceptable for the  majority of people of this country. Asked to comment on the  recent remarks on the Latvian draft law on citizenship voiced by  the high commissioner with the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, Max Van der Stoel, Anatolijs Gorbunovs  noted that he personally still did not see arguments which would  ease anxiety about the future fate of their nation, felt by  majority of the Latvians.    Asked about his opinion on another controversy of the day,  namely, of including non-citizens into electorate eligible to  participate in the local elections, scheduled to be held in late  May, the speaker of the Saeima pointed out that the decision  which provided a vote for Latvian citizens only, proved to be  the right one at the last summer's parliamentary elections. He  added that the decision had ensured legitimacy of the sitting  legislature, as well as had endorsed it with rights to solve any  problem of national interest.    Latvia is threading the right path in resolving its  political  problems, the newly appointed German Ambassador to Latvia  Reinhard Holubek told reporters after his meeting with the  Chairman of the Saeima Anatolijs Gorbunovs.    The ambassador said he was certain this year was going to be  of great importance for Latvia, marked with significant events  both in adopting key legislations and in settling relations with  its neighbours, notably with Russia.    Holubek pledged his country would spare no efforts to seek  closer ties to be forged between Latvia and the European  Community.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The European Union [EU]  virtually finalized a decision to halt generalized system of  preference (GSP) treatment for South Korean fabric goods from  July 1 until Seoul withdraws its adjustment tariff on foreign  products, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Industry  officials predicted that South Korea stands to lose about 2.6  million dollars worth of exports to Europe due to the EU measure.    The decision, apparently in retaliation for Seoul's  introduction of an adjustment tariff, needs further approval by  the EU council before going into effect but this is almost  certain, the ministry said.    The EU commission said April 20 that GSP status had been  suspended for all South Korean products covered under the  multi-fiber arrangement (MFA).    In January, Seoul introduced a 19-percent adjustment tariff  on fabric imports for 1994 to minimize the impact on local firms  caused by an unexpected inflow of foreign products.</p>

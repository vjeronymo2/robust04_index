			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Venables keeps control of club Terry Venables retained control of his social club Scribes West yesterday when a deal to save the business from insolvency proceedings was finalised in the high court. By agreement the court dismissed a winding-up petition based on a debt of pounds 150,000 claimed by Mr Vincent Isaacs, chairman of insurance group general portfolio, who was a backer of the original Scribes Club near Fleet Street. At a two-minute hearing Mr Justice Knox was told a sum of money - undisclosed but believed to be about pounds 50,000 - had been paid 'in full and final satisfaction' of the petitioner's claim against Scribes West in Kensington, West London. The petition was supported by customs and excise, claiming a vat debt, but it did not apply to be substituted as petitioner or take any part in the proceedings. No order for costs was sought against the club company.</p>

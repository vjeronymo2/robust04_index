			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic </F> Party, PDC, presidential candidate, and Rene Orillac, PDC first  vice presidential candidate, by Lucy Molinar at the Atlapa  Convention Center in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Molinar] At this time, we are here with one of the  presidential candidates and his first vice president. Mr.  Eduardo Vallarino just arrived a few minutes ago at the Atlapa  Convention Center, and we would appreciate hearing his first  statements, as well as those of his first vice presidential  candidate Rene Orillac. Mr. Vallarino, it would seem that the  initial results will remain unchanged despite the optimism you  expressed earlier. What can you now say to the country?    [Vallarino] Well, at this time I can say that I would like  to  congratulate the country. I congratulate the country because  the elections have been a significant accomplishment for Panama.  It has been possible to present Panama's positive image to the  world, as I have said on several occasions. I would also like  to say that, according to the results disclosed by the Electoral  Tribunal and what we have been receiving throughout the country  from our own party, we are completely certain that Mr. Ernesto  Perez Balladares is the winner. He is the president-elect of  the Republic, and we publicly extend our congratulations.    [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, can we take a look backwards, or  would you just like to look to the future?    [Vallarino] As you wish, forward or backwards [words  indistinct].    [Molinar] Then let's do both. Some time ago there was talk  about the possibility of an alliance, because it was impossible  for you to proceed on your own. You have seen that you received  less than 5 percent of the votes. Why then maintain the  alliance? [as heard]    [Vallarino] This alliance did not come about because of our  doing. We tried everything to create an alliance to present a  better offer to the country, which meant an alliance. On two or  three occasions, I publicly said I was willing to give up my  candidacy, to decline my candidacy....    [Molinar, interrupting] Was that a genuine offer or just....    [Vallarino, interrupting] Of course it was a genuine offer,  we never aimed to mislead.... [pauses] I do not accept your  questioning my statements.    [Molinar] No, I am only asking, Mr. Vallarino.    [Vallarino] Okay, let's take it easy. Our offer was a real  offer. I am not lying. It is absolutely true. If the alliance  did not come about, is it simply because there was no similar  willingness from the others.    [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, on the other hand, thinking now of  what will take place in the future. Since I believe your party  will now become an opposition party, what type of political  position will the PDC adopt?    [Vallarino] That is a decision to be made by the party's  political committee. You are once again putting words in my  mouth.    [Molinar] I am not putting any words in your mouth, I am  simply asking what position your party will adopt.    [Vallarino] Please do no attempt to put words in my  mouth....    [Molinar, interrupting] I am simply asking what position the  PDC will adopt from here on.    [Vallarino] That is a decision that will be made by the PDC  Political Committee.    [Molinar] Mr. Orillac, how do you feel at this time?    [Orillac] I feel quite satisfied, having participated in an  election process that has demonstrated that we Panamanians are  also capable of doing positive things. This election process  has been positive for all. It has been crystal clear, and the  result is clear. The message to the world is that Panama can do  positive things.    [Vallarino] If the trend witnessed so far continues and the  PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] emerges as the winner, what  can you say about the possibility of some PDC members becoming  part of the government they plan to form?    [Orillac] Well, I believe that will be a decision to be made  by the party in due time. The party's political committee will  have to meet and evaluate the possibility. At this time, we do  not rule it out or acknowledge it.    [Molinar] Thank you very much, Mr. Orillac.</p>

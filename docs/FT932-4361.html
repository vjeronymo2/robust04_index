			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall further ahead of inflation data Wall Street US SHARE prices continued to lose ground yesterday as the stock markets traded nervously ahead of Friday's important inflation figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.59 at 3,510.54. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.98 lower at 444.71, while the Nasdaq composite fell 6.87 to 687.74. New York SE volume was 238m shares. Prices spent the entire session lower across the board for the second consecutive day as investors struggled to find incentives to buy stocks. The recent run-up in share prices has worried some observers, who believe that equity markets are vulnerable to a sharp downward correction if bad economic news jolts investor confidence. That bad news could come on Friday when the producer prices index for May is due to be released. Recently, monthly inflation reports have been surprisingly strong, heightening fears in both stock and bond markets that the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates to subdue inflationary pressures in the economy. Currently, analysts are forecasting that the May PPI will have risen by no more than 0.2 per cent. If the figure is anything bigger than that, then bond and equity prices could tumble. It was a fear of just such an outcome that kept stocks firmly anchored in negative territory yesterday. Among individual issues, some of the biggest bank stocks posted gains. After two days of heavy losses, inflicted by concern about rising interest rates and the effect that they might have on bank margins, most of the sector rebounded yesterday. Chemical rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Citicorp Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 26 5/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 96 3/8 . JP Morgan, however, stood still at Dollars 64 1/4 , and BankAmerica, under pressure from recent brokers' downgrades, slipped a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 in volume of 3.7m shares. Casino issues, strong recently in expectation of approval of new gambling legislation in Missouri, ran into heavy profit-taking. Circus Circus lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 , Promus dropped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 and Caesar's World fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 , although all three were off the day's lows. Anheuser-Busch dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after broking house Merrill Lynch cut its short-term rating on the brewery stock from 'above average' to 'neutral'. Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber declined Dollars  5/8 more to Dollars 24 1/2 in the wake of the company's profits warning. On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were hit by a series of brokerage downgrades. Apple retreated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 1/2 , Microsoft Dollars 1 to Dollars 92 1/4 and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 5/8 . Canada TORONTO weakened in busy trading, following the trend of Wall Street stocks. The TSE 300 index finished 29.5 down at 3,862.7 and declining issues outscored advances by 437 to 299 after volume of 71.5m shares valued at CDollars 678.4m. Twelve of the 14 sub-group indices closed lower, led by the golds group, off 2.1 per cent. The price of gold in New York declined just 15 cents to USDollars 374 an ounce, but many observers were disappointed that the precious metal did not rally as the US dollar fell to a new all-time low against the Japanese yen.</p>

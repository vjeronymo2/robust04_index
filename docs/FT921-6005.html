			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Wine: Bring your palate to the page - Well-written wine lists to help mail order buyers MORE than 60 per cent of the UK retail wine trade is said to be in the hands of grocery and supermarket chains. Although they sell much of their wine for immediate drinking they are thrusting into the margins of the fine-wine end of the market. Yet, it is the traditional, stock-holding merchants who still maintain the high reputation of the British retail wine trade throughout the growing and exporting world, especially for vintages that require keeping. Today, with the heavy cost of holding stock and cash-flow demands, this is a not a role easy to perpetuate. The trade does it largely through seasonal mailing lists, backed by special offers. Even specialist London firms such as Bibendum, NW1 (071-722-5577), Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark, SW6 (071-736-7878) and La Vigneronne, SW7 (071-589-6113) rely on the mail for a good deal of their trade: about 50 per cent at Bibendum and 30 per cent at La Vigneronne. Increasingly, some companies encourage personal visits by giving special tastings, often tutored, when their clients can see the bottles they propose buying. Customers of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd - who would be shocked to see even a shelf of bottles in its ancient premises at St James's, London SW1 - are directed to Berry Bros Wine Shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire (0256-23566). Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex (0206-764 446), has a laid-out market that accounts for half its total sales to individual customers. The Wine Society's comfortable cellar showroom at Stevenage, Hertfordshire (0438-740-222), attracts an increasing number of its members, although 75 per cent of orders come by post or telephone. It is not possible for many private merchants to offer such facilities, so it is worth looking at how some nationally-recognised companies meet supermarket competition through selling wines by post. The question is what to buy. First, the knowledge of even regular drinkers is often limited. Wine is a socially-sensitive subject; many feel they 'ought to know' about it. It is impossible to know everything, particularly as more wines from Europe and the New World become available. Yet look at the long, unannotated lists of clarets and burgundies found on wine lists. These may be sufficient for 'insiders'; but for the uninitiated, the only criterion is likely to be price. Compiling a price list is expensive and time-consuming. It involves photographs taken on buying trips, commissioned illustrations and decorations. Lay &amp; Wheeler spends Pounds 27,000 a year, the Wine Society Pounds 40,000, on the design and production of their lists. Significantly, both annotate every wine. Thomas Peatling of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk (0284-755 948), a subsidiary of brewer Greene King, provides a note on almost every wine. So does Philip Eyres of Coleshill, Amersham (0494-433-823). Other companies which go some way to help their customers in this way are Averys of Bristol (0272-214-141), Berry Bros &amp; Rudd (071-839-9033), Harveys of Bristol (0272-26882) and Laytons, London (071-388-5081). Two firms that take a different line are Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk (0502-724-222) and Yapp of Mere, Wiltshire (0747-860-423). Simon Loftus of Adnams writes so compellingly about his favourite growers and their wines that the long list, although left largely to speak for itself, surely is just as good; while Robin Yapp displays such an intimate acquaintance with his suppliers on the Rhone and Loire that his recommendations carry particular weight. Some merchants with long lists feel able to provide only brief notes on the districts and vintages from which wines are on offer. One of these is Tanners of Shrewsbury (0734-232 400) and another is the House of Townsend, Hull (0482-26891) with a crowded 58 pages. Bibendum gives fuller notes, but La Vigneronne concentrates on the vintages in a typewriter-style catalogue that is not easy to read. Winecellars of Wandsworth, London SW18 (081-871-3979), an Italian specialist, writes informatively about the growers and the grape varieties there, but little about the particular wines. Then there are the merchants, mostly distinguished, who clearly believe that their sophisticated customers need little or no guidance except for a succinct note or details of a particular growth. Such firms include Corney &amp; Barrow, London EC1 (071-251-4051); Justerini &amp; Brooks, London SW1, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan (071-493-8721); Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark; and OW Loeb, London SE1 (071-928-7750). A most uninformative list is that of Valvona and Crolla of Edinburgh (031-556-6066), an Italian wine expert, although an occasional comment slips through. Most merchants of any size produce two lists a year: one after the Budget, which might alter duties, and in the autumn. The Wine Society now issues a third immediately after Christmas, because it expects cash with orders, and the autumn list might be depleted by the New Year. Adnams, Averys, La Vigneronne and Yapp are among those which publish only post-Budget lists. This surely discourages ordering by the autumn and especially for Christmas presents; before then, the chosen wines may have sold out. Many lists are produced in the large A4 size, which offers greater opportunities for decoration and illustration: Adnams, Lay &amp; Wheeler and Winecellars are good examples. But for those who enjoy the sybaritic pleasure of browsing through lists in bed, the more compact A5 catalogues of Justerini &amp; Brooks, Tanners and the Wine Society have handling advantages shared by the even more discreetly-sized handbooks of Berry Bros, and of Corney &amp; Barrow.</p>

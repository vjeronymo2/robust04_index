			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Clash of wills over power for the people: The UK gas regulator has raised the stakes in his campaign for lower domestic prices Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, has come out of the trenches with his bayonet fixed, fighting for lower gas prices on behalf of UK households. He jolted the stock market, which immediately knocked 8p off the price of British Gas shares yesterday before they rallied to close 2 1/2 p down at 262 1/2 p. Stockbrokers reacted swiftly to Sir James's demands for British Gas to cut domestic gas prices by up to 2p a therm, calculating that this would slice at least Pounds 250m from the company's annual profits of more than Pounds 1bn. But the situation is more complex than the simple arithmetic implies. The public row is just the latest clash of wills between an aggressive regulator and a company that has yet to adjust to life under public surveillance. Relations between Sir James and British Gas have struck a discordant note since privatisation in 1986. Sir James sets the price British Gas can charge households for gas supply in a complicated formula which came into force last month. This limits gas price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, which means that if the annual inflation rate is below 5 per cent, prices must fall. Sir James forecasts inflation will hover around the 4 per cent mark this year; so prices must be reduced now. He is threatening legal action against British Gas if it fails to comply with his request. 'Customers need a cut in price as soon as possible. British Gas should not be using customers' money to smooth out price rises and falls,' he said yesterday. But a smooth price decline is what British Gas wants: the company says it must avoid the 'yo-yo' effect of cutting prices now and possibly having to raise them again if inflation increases later in the year. When British Gas made its decision to freeze domestic prices at the beginning of last month, the company said its projections of inflation were rather shaky because it did not know the outcome of the general election. 'The prices are reviewed monthly and so at any time an adjustment can be made,' an official said yesterday. Part of the argument centres on Sir James's refusal to meet British Gas officials to discuss a price cut. He said a meeting was unnecessary as the evidence pointing to the need for a reduction was 'blindingly obvious'. The lack of communication between Sir James and British Gas points to a somewhat tense and combative relationship. Sir James is careful to maintain a distance between himself and the company he regulates, but British Gas accuses him of being aloof. The contentious nature of the relationship meant that British Gas only accepted the April price formula after a long-running dispute on pricing and faced with the threat of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But the company has now indicated that it wants the formula to be reviewed in the wake of a separate agreement reached with the Office of Fair Trading in January. The agreement requires it to relinquish half of its share of the industrial gas market to rival suppliers in a bid to encourage more competition. British Gas says its deal with the OFT changes its operating conditions to such an extent that the tough price formula for the domestic part of its business needs to be eased. A gas industry observer suggests that British Gas could be sticking to a clever strategy of freezing prices now in the hope of seeing the formula revised later in the year, thereby allowing it to keep prices steady or even to raise them. Sir James, however, does not sympathise with the request by British Gas for a revision to the formula. He believes the company should keep its domestic and industrial businesses separate and that a drop in profit in one should not affect prices in the other. His comments yesterday on prices could be the opening salvo in a much more serious disagreement later in the year over the actual level of the pricing formula. British Gas must tread carefully if it wants to avoid becoming embroiled in another distracting dispute over pricing. Sir James has found sympathy for his views among some politicians, and his arguments have struck a chord among consumers who resent the idea that they are being overcharged. The British Gas case against an immediate price cut is technical and not so readily absorbed by consumers, because it relies on complicated calculations in the price formula. However, some industry observers believe the company is right to be cautious and that Sir James has got his arithmetic wrong. They point out that the current rate of inflation indicates the need for a price cut of just 0.3p a therm rather than Sir James's 2p. Sir James himself is rather vague as to how he arrived at the 2p a therm figure and admits that a 1p reduction in price would probably be sufficient. But if the battle goes to court Sir James will have to prove the accuracy of his figures or risk a dent in his credibility. A cut of only 0.3p a therm would translate into a very small reduction in most domestic bills, and British Gas says it could make a more significant cut if it waited until later in the year. Overall the price paid for gas by UK consumers compares favourably with that in other western European countries. According to many international studies, British households pay lower gas bills than their German or Italian counterparts. Lower UK gas prices are, however, more a historical accident than a regulatory triumph. In the past, the price paid by British Gas to North Sea gas producers fluctuated with the rate of inflation, while prices on the continent were more closely linked to oil prices. When oil prices soared in the early 1970s, British consumers were paying lower gas prices than continental users. In the 1980s, there was a move to link UK prices more closely to the price of oil, but since then oil prices have been low and again gas prices have remained relatively low in real terms. Nevertheless, consumers need to be convinced they are getting a fair deal or they may switch to another energy supply. Mr Ian Powe of the Gas Consumers' Council, a consumers' lobby, said yesterday that Sir James's initiative is good news for customers. If Sir James loses any future dispute over pricing, consumers could lose an aggressive champion. By threatening British Gas with legal action, Sir James is taking a gamble on the basis of his own calculations which some observers believe are flawed. It is not clear whether Sir James would win a court case. 'This is a battle of wills and it is hard to see how both parties can emerge unscathed,' said Mr Peter Spring, industry analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the broker. Both the regulator and the company have much at stake. For Sir James, his reputation as an effective industry regulator and his credibility are on the line. For British Gas, the loss of Pounds 250m in profit would be extremely hard to justify to shareholders.</p>

He  noted that Shakhray called a meeting of Duma members who were  elected in single-mandate districts from the republics  incorporated in Russia. Following Shakhray's speech, 15 deputies  of Tuva, Yakutia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, Mari-El, Dagestan,  Ingushetia, North Ossetia and other autonomies declared the  setting up of a group which would nominate Sergey Shakhray for  the position of the State Duma speaker. The deputies said that  the group will work for implementation of the Federative Treaty.  They want this group to be given the standing of a  parliamentary party to be able to contribute to the formation of  the State Duma bodies.</p>

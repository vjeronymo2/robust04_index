			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Fears grow over fresh conflict in Croatia FIGHTING flared between Serb and Croat forces around Serb controlled regions in Croatia yesterday, threatening to rekindle the war between the Croat government and rebel Serbs in the area. Serb forces in the Krajina enclave shelled Croat government positions, after Croat forces launched an offensive in the Gospic area and captured several villages. The Croat offensive, which began on Thursday, marked the first attack across the UN ceasefire lines for eight months. The latest conflict fuelled fears that any lull in the fighting in Bosnia could rapidly be replaced by renewed battles in Croatia. The six-month war which Croatia fought with the rebel Serbs around the enclave two years ago officially ended in January 1992, after the Serbs were given de facto control of the Krajina area, monitored by some 15,000 UN peacekeepers. This situation left the Croatian government hoping it would eventually regain the ter-ritory. But in recent weeks skirmishes along the border have intensified, as the Croat government has become increasingly concerned that the proposed partition of Bosnia could herald the partition of Croatia as well and the rebel Serbs grow optimistic that the peace plan would allow them to link Krajina with the Serbian republic. UN officials yesterday appealed to both sides to show restraint. General Jean Cot, commander of the UN protection forces in the former Yugoslavia, said: 'The past 24 hours have seen the most dramatic increase in tensions since January 22. Croat forces were now engaged in new offensives south of Gospic, the UN added. General Mile Novakovic, the Croatian Serb military commander, threatened to open fire on all military targets in Croatia if the Croats did not withdraw from the villages it had taken.</p>

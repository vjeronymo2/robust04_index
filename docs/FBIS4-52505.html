			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP), a  member of the ruling coalition, decided Wednesday [11 May] to  call for the disbanding of a joint parliamentary group in the  House of Representatives whose formation triggered the  withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the  coalition, party officials said. The party led by former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reached the agreement in a meeting of  executives, the officials said.    The SDP decided to walk out of the coalition on April 26  after Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist  Party [of Japan, SDPJ] and the Liberal Party, as well as the  JNP, abruptly formed the 130-legislator parliamentary group,  called Kaishin (Innovation), excluding the SDP, saying the move  was a breach of trust. The SDP's withdrawal forced new Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to launch a minority government.    As to whether Hosokawa should remain the party head, the  party was divided on the issue and postponed a decision, the  officials said. Hosokawa announced his resignation suddenly on  April 8 over financial improprieties.</p>

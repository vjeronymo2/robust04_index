			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: FIGHT FOR RESTROOM SPACE BECOMES THEATER OF  THE ABSURD  </P> <P> I've been getting mail from the La Jolla Playhouse.  </P> <P> I got an announcement that the first production of 1990 will be "The Cherry  Orchard" starring Lynn Redgrave. It begins May 13.  </P> <P> I got the theater's latest Stabilization Campaign Update. It says the financial  wolf has been temporarily chased from the door.  </P> <P> But nothing I've received addresses a more urgent issue: Does the playhouse  plan to continue its hideous practice of sometimes blocking the men's room so  it can be used by women?  </P> <P> I encountered this barbarity in November during an otherwise superb production  of "Macbeth." It was a fine evening of political intrigue and homicidal  power-grabbing.  </P> <P> I saw a member of the San Diego City Council in the audience, taking notes.  (Name available upon request).  </P> <P> As the Queen of Evil finished her speech, and the lights came up for  intermission, I rushed to the lobby. An usher halted me at the door to the  men's room.  </P> <P> "Sorry," he said, "we let the women use the men's room first to accommodate the  'overflow' from the women's room."  </P> <P> I grimaced. I hopped from foot to foot. I suffered until the men's room was  returned to its rightful users.  </P> <P> After I got the news about the new season, I decided to call the La Jolla  Playhouse.  </P> <P> I was informed that more women than men attend the theater. Plus, women are  slower at some tasks than men.  </P> <P> I learned that I was not the first male to complain. But until a financial  angel provides roomier restrooms, letting women use the men's room is seen as  the only way to eliminate queuing.  </P> <P> I discovered, however, that the usher who barred me had violated policy. Policy  says women can use the men's restroom only after the crush of early-arriving  men has cleared out.  </P> <P> Ushers will be instructed anew of this before "The Cherry Orchard" begins.  </P> <P> See, and you thought the press never does anything worthwhile.  </P> <P> </P> <P> That Sinking Feeling  </P> <P> Media moves.  </P> <P> * Bad news for two Assembly members from San Diego County.  </P> <P> In a poll by the California Journal, Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) placed 78th out  of 79 members in overall integrity, intelligence, energy and effectiveness.  Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) was 71st.  </P> <P> The Sacramento-based magazine surveyed 220 legislators, lobbyists, staffers and  reporters.  </P> <P> Critics dismiss the poll as unscientific. But the results are already being  used as a weapon by campaign opponents.  </P> <P> * Jim and Heidi O'Hern have opened a family business in their Fallbrook home:  Arm A Dec International.  </P> <P> For $35 an hour, they'll check news stories about firearms and munitions before  publication for accuracy. They're plugged in by fax and phone.  </P> <P> The O'Herns say too many stories about hot topics like assault rifles are  loaded with errors.  </P> <P> Jim is a Marine staff sergeant at Camp Pendleton. Heidi, a former Marine  sharpshooter, is an explosives handler at the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station.  </P> <P> * From an account in the (Escondido) Times-Advocate of gonzo journalist Hunter  S. Thompson's recent visit to the Belly Up Tavern:  </P> <P> "Thompson brushed some residual vomit off his camouflage trousers and ordered a  Heineken at the airport bar . . . During the 20-minute drive to Solana Beach,  Thompson . . . poured some Heineken into his cupped hand and inhaled it  vigorously through his nose.  </P> <P> " 'Asthma,' he said."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glossing Over a 'Defeat'  </P> <P> Short takes.  </P> <P> * Defense attorney having his shoes shined at Horton Plaza: "The D.A. won the  trial, but I won the sentencing."  </P> <P> * The Fieldstone Co. says it's reviewing its "VIP presale policy," which gives  preference to certain city and county officials in buying new homes.  </P> <P> The review panel will consist of a clergyman, an academic and a judge. As yet  unselected.  </P> <P> * More bureaucratese: Calendar as a verb. As in, "Let's calendar that."  </P> <P> Turn back the calendar, I say.  </P></p>

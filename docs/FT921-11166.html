			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Gourmands go on short rations: Andrew Bolger finds that when the City has to tighten its belt restaurateurs feel the pinch THE RECESSION is threatening one of the City of London's most hallowed traditions - the expensive expense-account lunch. A decline in demand for upmarket business lunches has forced the Pelican Group to change the format of its restaurant in Hays Galleria, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Pelican said: 'The days of spending Pounds 30 to Pounds 40 a head on lunch - or even Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 - may not have gone away forever, but they will certainly not return for some time. 'Our trade is dependent on the business climate on the south side of the river, and two or three large corporate clients in this area are experiencing difficulties. Pelican will convert the Hays Galleria restaurant into a brasserie, where customers can opt for just a coffee or a drink. Its other brasserie outlets in London are enjoying sales 17 per cent higher than last year, as customers trade down from more expensive restaurants. Things are less gloomy at the top end of the market. The Savoy Hotel said business remained brisk in its River Room and Grill Room restaurants - favoured venues for power lunches. Even there, the impact of recession has not gone un-noticed. The Savoy said: 'People are much less likely to have three glasses of armagnac after lunch, as they might have done two or three years ago. They are drinking less anyway, but customers are more inclined to order house wine than they used to be.' Trade is 'noticeably down on last year' at Sweetings, a privately owned City institution famous for its fish - and puddings like cook never used to make them at prep school. Sweetings said: 'We are surviving - a lot of people aren't. We are seeing both fewer people and regular customers less often. People we used to see twice a week now just come in once, or once a fortnight. 'Others who do come in are spending less. Expense accounts are being cut back. People are not drinking as much - a lot of people come in and just have a soft drink.' Direct marketing methods have been adopted by Corney &amp; Barrow, which owns a chain of restaurants and champagne bars across the City. Its Cannon Street branch (set menu Pounds 14.95 a head) has recently been emblazoned with a poster reading: 'Steak sandwich only Pounds 2.95 - for a limited period only.' Balls Brothers, which also owns a chain of City wine bars, eschews such tactics: 'We decided not go to down the Ratners route of trying to be the cheapest in the high street. We are very conscious of our prices, but we have not been trying 'happy hours' or special offers.' Mr Richard Balls, managing director, said: 'The luxury end of trade has died out. People are no longer drinking Krug champagne and eating salmon sandwiches, as they were two years ago.' The company was still seeing good, steady trade in its wine bars, with average spending of Pounds 8 to Pounds 12 a head. 'Customers are not trading right down to the most basic house wines, but are definitely tending to choose bottles from the bottom end of the list.' Fixed-price menus have proved a lifeline for some restaurants. The Cotillion in Walbrook started offering a three-course lunch for Pounds 19.95 last summer, and this month reduces that to Pounds 17.50 in an effort to increase trade. Mr Pierre le Fur, manager of the Cotillion, said: 'Most people choose the set-price menu. Even big brokers like BZW and Smith New Court do not like to be presented with a big bill.' Le Poulbot, the Roux brothers' establishment on Cheapside, has always offered a three-course set menu, which currently costs Pounds 31.50 a head. It is being kept 'fairly busy, apart from Mondays'. Le Poulbot said: 'On the whole we are filling up, but with parties of two or three, not fours and fives. People tend to limit themselves to one bottle of wine, whether there are two or four.' Novelty can also be a draw. Sir Terence Conran's restaurant at Butler's Wharf, Le Pont de la Tour, opened in September and is fully booked for lunch, with a set menu at Pounds 21.50 a head. Sandwiches are a cheaper alternative to eating out, but even here the recession has bitten deep. Mr Robin Birley, who runs a chain of six sandwich shops in the City, said trade was down 15 per cent to 20 per cent on last year. The amount spent remained about Pounds 3.50 a head but the number of customers was markedly down. 'Banks have moved from the area served by our Cannon Street shop into developments like Broadgate,' Mr Birley said. 'We have moved into Canary Wharf, which has been a big success.' The group's delivery service to companies is down by about 25 per cent and Mr Birley believes the City has suffered even more than the West End. He said: 'There was such a colossal boom that the scaling back will go on for some time. The City has sobered up. We will probably never see a return to the go-go days of a few years ago, when buildings were packed with incredibly well-paid traders and brokers.' The whole notion of belt-tightening in the City is relative, however. Sweetings, where lunch averages Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 a head, said: 'It's still pretty reasonable. We don't do vintage champagne - the dearest is Pounds 30 a bottle.'</p>

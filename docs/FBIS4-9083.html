			<p>BFN     [Text] The DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] wants  [Transportation] Minister Kiril Ermenkov, [Agriculture] Minister  Georgi Tanev, and Forestry Committee Chairman Khristo Todorov to  be replaced. Our reporter Mariya Tsankova obtained this  information from unofficial sources before the end of today's  session of the DPS Central Council.    According to information from within the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party], the Socialists are calling for the replacement  of Ministers Karabashev, Bikov, and Valentin Aleksandrov [of  trade, industry and defense]; the New Alliance for Democracy  reportedly wanted one of their number appointed foreign minister.    At today's Central Council meeting, Kadir Kadir proposed  Khristo Totev for deputy prime minister if there is a cabinet  reshuffle. The DPS maintained its view on the need for a major  government reshuffle, but declares that if the cabinet falls it  will join in the lottery for distributing candidates for cabinet  posts between the parliamentary political forces.    According to BTA, DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said after his  meeting with Lyuben Berov that the prime minister was in  excellent health. Professor Berov has still not reached a final  decision on possible cabinet changes. Everything is at the  stage of taking soundings in the parliamentary groups, but by  the end of the week he will probably have formed a clear idea on  structural changes, Dogan said.</p>

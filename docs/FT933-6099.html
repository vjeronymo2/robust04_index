			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Shopkeepers fall victim to crime - In A Nutshell The risks for small shopkeepers from violent crime in some parts of Britain have been highlighted by researchers at the University of Sheffield. A total of 92 shopkeepers in one part of London and 70 shopkeepers in part of a large Midlands city were interviewed, among them newsagents, off-licences, grocery stores and small supermarkets. In the London area a quarter of respondents had been the victim of a robbery or attempted robbery (with a knife or gun/imitation gun) in the past 12 months. In the Midlands area, the figure was 17 per cent. Some 24 per cent of London shopkeepers and 34 per cent of Midlands shopkeepers had suffered acts of deliberate vandalism to the shop or its property.</p>

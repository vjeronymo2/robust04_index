			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort in Pounds 85m issue KLEINWORT Benson is raising Pounds 85m of fixed rate debentures for four of the investment trusts within its stable. A specially created vehicle, Fintrust Debenture, is raising the money in an effort to benefit from the lower costs involved in a larger issue. The debentures will have a 30-year life and will bear an interest rate of 9.25 per cent per annum. The gross redemption yield will be fixed at a margin of 65 basis points (0.65 of a percentage point) over the yield of the Treasury 8.75 per cent 2017 stock. The four trusts involved are Kleinwort Overseas (raising Pounds 25m), Brunner (Pounds 15m), Kleinwort Charter (Pounds 15m) and Merchants (Pounds 30m). Investment trusts are allowed to borrow money (or gear up) with the aim of earning a higher return on their portfolios than they pay on the debt. The new debt will leave Brunner, Kleinwort Charter and Merchants with 20 per cent gearing, while the figure for Kleinwort Overseas will be 122.5 per cent. Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, said: 'We believe that the current level of interest rates - which is close to 25-year lows - presents an excellent opportunity to raise long-term finance on attractive terms.'</p>

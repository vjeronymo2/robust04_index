			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Drive for peace in Bosnia gains pace: Sarajevo siege eases as Major flies in to see chief of UN operations The first steps towards lifting the siege of Sarajevo took place yesterday after Serbs and Moslems agreed to allow movement in and out of the Bosnian capital on the day that Mr John Major, the prime minister, arrived in the republic on a surprise visit. A separate agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems is due to be signed today in Washington, highlighting the intensifying international moves towards an overall settlement for former Yugoslavia. Mr Major flew in last night and is due to meet General Sir Michael Rose, the British head of the UN operation in Bosnia, today. British officials said the purpose the prime minister's visit was to see the conditions in which British troops were operating and to discuss a joint initiative with the US to rebuild the infrastructure of Sarajevo. The Sarajevo agreement, signed yesterday by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly, and Mr Hasan Muratovic, a Bosnian official responsible for UN affairs, comes into effect on Wednesday. Although the deal falls short of allowing complete freedom of movement, it signals the gradual return of normality to a city besieged by Serb forces for over 23 months, and whose inhabitants were prevented by the Bosnian government from leaving for fear the capital's defences would collapse. However, commercial traffic will not be allowed into the city, people can be refused permission to leave and anyone wanting to cross the front lines on certain routes must apply for permission 24 hours in advance. 'The siege will not be over until all citizens can be transported freely,' Mr Muratovic told reporters in Sarajevo. The agreement is a result of the shuttle diplomacy led by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy, Mr Charles Redman, his US counterpart, and UN officials in their bid to maintain the peace momentum after Bosnian Serbs last month agreed to withdraw all heavy weapons from Sarajevo or risk Nato air strikes. This shuttle diplomacy has also produced the agreement expected to be sealed today in Washington when President Bill Clinton presides over the signing of a constitution which will bind Bosnian Croats and Moslems in a loose federation. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, are to sign the agreement, which is likely to pave the way for the establishment of a confederation between Croatia and the new Bosnian federation in a move which could end the fighting in the western part of Bosnia. Mr Churkin, who is in Washington, is due to hold talks with US and UN officials at which he is expected to spell out plans for an agreement between Serbia and Croatia as part of an overall settlement aimed at finally bringing peace to the region.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon grows 17% to Pounds 63m WILLIS CORROON, one of the UK's largest insurance brokers, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 17 per cent from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 63.1m in the six months ending June 30. Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 371.2m (Pounds 331.2m), including Pounds 367.8m from continuing operations. Mr Peter Stevens, head of corporate communications, said: 'This is a year when we were not going to do exciting things with the outside world but to consolidate. 'We have had a big merger and sorting out, and we have been able to take good underlying growth in revenues which we ought to be able to maintain.' Exchange rate movements added Pounds 4.6m to profits. Underlying brokerage and fee revenue grew by 2 per cent from the previous first half. Underlying expenses fell by 1 per cent. On continuing operations, operating expenses rose 12 per cent to Pounds 313.9m and underwriting claims rose to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 11.5m). Revenue from continuing broking activities rose 14 per cent to Pounds 365m and from underwriting activities by 14 per cent to Pounds 28.2m. The company said premiums remained low in the US, although there were signs of hardening rates for property risks. A Pounds 5.8m loss on Sovereign Marine and General, the UK underwriting business which was closed in 1991, was offset by Pounds 900,000 released from provisions made to cover run-off from the business over 20 years. That compared with a loss on Sovereign of Pounds 2.7m in the previous quarter and a profit of Pounds 100,000 for the six months to June last year. The dividend was halved to 3.3p in line with the board's decision to increase its cash position. The directors approved second and third quarter dividends of 1.65p, with the alternative of a scrip dividend. Mr Stevens said the company had a net cash inflow of Pounds 18m, compared with an outflow of Pounds 32m last year. 'We had quite a cash squeeze in 1992 and it was felt prudent to reduce the dividend,' he said. He added that while the lower dividend was easily covered at the time of the interim results, the bulk of the company's revenues came in the first half of the year. Interest and investment income fell by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 27.1m. The share of profits from associates rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.9m). Earnings per share for total operations increased by 1p to 9.3p and for continuing operations by 1.9p to 10.2p. See Lex</p>

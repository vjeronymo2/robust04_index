			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Fresno United Way Executive Director Tony Folcarelli will take over the top  staff job of the statewide volunteer organization, it has been disclosed. As  United Way of California executive director, the 54-year-old Folcarelli will  assist the state's 41 United Ways in management, training and other phases of  charity fund-raising. Folcarelli, who was associate regional manager of United  Way in the West Los Angeles area from 1971 to 1974, was credited with  revitalizing the Fresno operation by insisting that traditional agencies  document the effectiveness of their programs. This opened the door to some  community groups previously denied allocations. Folcarelli will assume the post  May 1.  </P></p>

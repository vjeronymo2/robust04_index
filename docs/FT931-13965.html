			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Italian bankers act on Efim debts THE Italian bankers association (ABI) is to set up a legal panel to consider ways of ensuring repayment of debts owed by Efim, the state industrial holding placed in liquidation last July. Italian and foreign banks are due L9,500bn (Pounds 4.51bn), the largest accumulation of debt owed to banks as a result of the collapse of any Italian group. Despite repeated government attempts to spell out the details of payment to creditors, both domestic and foreign bankers remain confused and are increasingly impatient. Yesterday's decision empowers Mr Tancredi Bianchi, president of the ABI, to nominate a panel of three to four lawyers headed by Mr Piero Schlesinger, a prominent jurist and president of Banca Popolare di Milano. Within a month the panel would be expected to be in a position to provide advice on the best approaches to recover credits. Mr Bianchi is also seeking a meeting with Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, to obtain reassurances. Italian banks are owed almost 60 per cent of Efim's debt. This week the government confirmed it had raised the ceiling from L4,000bn to L9,000bn for bonds to be issued to cover debt. Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, had earlier sought a L10,000bn ceiling. Mr Bianchi said yesterday it was essential to clarify the procedures for paying off the bank credits. He also voiced his concern over the lack of clarity in the government's recent decision to separate Efim's defence and aerospace activities and place them on a lease basis with Finmeccanica, the main industrial subsidiary of IRI, the state holding. He said the destination of the cash flow from these leased companies needed to clarified - would it be used by Finmeccanica, used to repay debts or accumulated to attract future purchasers?</p>

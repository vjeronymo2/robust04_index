			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BIG DAY AND NIGHT FOR DAVID LYNCH;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR'S 'WILD AT HEART' WINS THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL GOLD PALM.  AT THE SAME TIME, ABC-TV PICKS UP 'TWIN PEAKS' FOR THE FALL SEASON.  </P> <P> David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," an erotic and violent black comedy about a young  Southern couple's attempt to escape the woman's mother and an assortment of  hired killers, was named the best picture of the 43rd Cannes Film Festival on  Monday night.  </P> <P> It was a good day all around for the director. News of Lynch's Cannes win came  at about the same time that ABC-TV announced that his quirky prime-time soap  opera "Twin Peaks" will be returning in the fall.  </P> <P> As is usually the case with the demonstrative international crowd, the  announcement of "Wild at Heart" as the 1990 Gold Palm winner drew a mixture of  cheers and jeers.  </P> <P> Lynch's film, a twisted tale that blends flashbacks and fantasies with ironic  dialogue and often graphic sex and violence, would seem to defy translation.  And it was up against two very popular French films -- Bertrand Tavernier's  "Daddy Nostalgie," and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's "Cyrano de Bergerac."  </P> <P> It also marks the second year in a row that an American film has won here.  Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape" was the 1989 Gold Palm  recipient. This year's Gold Palm for best short film also went to an American  film, Columbia University student Adam Davidson's "The Lunch Date."  </P> <P> The Samuel Goldwyn Co. has picked up "Wild at Heart" and will open the film in  the U.S. on Aug. 17.  </P> <P> Unlike the Academy Awards, where directors are usually honored with their  films, Cannes invariably splits those awards and this year the jury -- headed  by Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci -- named Pavel Lounguine best director  for the Soviet-French co-production "Taxi Blues."  </P> <P> Gerard Depardieu, the popular French actor who has been many times a contender  but never before a winner, was named best actor for his performance in the  title role of "Cyrano de Bergerac." Poland's Krystyna Janda was named best  actress for her role in "The Interrogation," a story about a Polish singer  imprisoned as a suspected spy during the height of post-World War II Stalinist  paranoia.  </P> <P> "The Interrogation" was made eight years ago and banned in Poland until last  fall.  </P> <P> Special jury prizes, which are seen as runner-up awards, were presented to  Soviet director Gleb Panfilov for "Matz" ("The Mother"), adapted from a Maxim  Gorky story about a woman's anguish over her son's radicalization in czarist  Russia, and to British director Ken Loach for "Hidden Agenda," a controversial  political drama that depicts an act of terrorism by British secret agents in  Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Two other awards for originality went to Burkina Faso director Idrissa  Quedraogo's "Tilai" ("The Rule") and Japanese director Kohei Oguri's "Shi No  Toge" ("The Sting of Death").  </P> <P> Although Lynch's film was the highlight of the festival for the American press,  its winning of the Gold Palm caught many by surprise and obviously disappointed  the bulk of the non-English critics. By the estimation of three panels of  critics who were polled daily to rate the films in competition, the favorites  were Lounguine's "Taxi Blues," a story of class conflict told through the  love-hate relationship between a Moscow cab driver and a Jewish musician;  Tavernier's "Daddy Nostalgie," about a young woman's reunion with her dying  father; and Rappeneau's lavish production of "Cyrano de Bergerac."  </P> <P> Italian director Gieuseppe Tornatore's "Everything's Fine," the story of an  aging Italian widower (Marcello Mastroianni) who makes a painful round of  visits to his five grown children, was also a big favorite.  </P> <P> Commercially, Alan Parker's "Come See the Paradise" may prove to be the most  successful film to come out of Cannes. The film, a sentimental interracial love  story set against the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, was  one of the festival's biggest crowd pleasers (along with "Cyrano de Bergerac")  and has all the elements that make for Oscar contenders.  </P> <P> "Come See the Paradise" stars Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita and is scheduled  for release in December by Columbia-Tri-Star. "Wild at Heart," which co-stars  Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, is scheduled to open Aug. 17 in 100 theaters and  go wide Aug. 31.  </P> <P> There were three other American films in the Directors Fortnight, a side  competition whose entries often overshadow the Gold Palm program. The Directors  Fortnight is where Spike Lee ("She's Gotta Have It") and James Jarmusch  ("Stranger Than Paradise") were discovered.  </P> <P> Whit Stillman's "Metropolitan," a comedy about upscale young Manhattanites, was  clearly the most talked-about American film in the Fortnight, and there were  turn-away crowds at most screenings. Charles Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger," a  film about disrupted family life in South-Central Los Angeles, was  well-received here.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> OPERATION FOUND UNNECESSARY  </P> <P> Small, bulging weak spots in the main blood vessel in the abdomen do not need  to be routinely repaired in most patients, unlike large weak spots, which are  in danger of bursting, a study concludes.  </P> <P> Surgery for these common defects, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms, has  grown dramatically in recent decades and is now performed on about 40,000  people in the United States each year.  </P> <P> Experts agree that large aneurysms should be fixed, because they may burst,  causing catastrophic bleeding and death. But some doubt lingers over whether  smaller aneurysms must be immediately repaired.  </P> <P> The latest study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that most abdominal  aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones pose little risk of rupture.  </P> <P> "Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be routinely  repaired," said Dr. John W. Hallett Jr., senior author of the study, which was  published the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P></p>

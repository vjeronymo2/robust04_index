			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Bessarabov] </F>   [Text] Elista 5 April, TASS -- The constitutional assembly  of Kalmykia, a steppe republic in southern Russia, has abolished  its Constitution on Tuesday and adopted a new one called the  "Steppe Charter."    "Kalmykia has raised to a new level in its development. A  new historic step was made. Only unity can help us survive,"  President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov stated.    Ilyumzhinov had earlier announced his intention to abolish  the republican constitution, which caused a mixed reaction in  Moscow.    According to the Russian Constitution, republics within the  Federation have their own constitutions, while regions and  territories have their charters. The status of a subject of the  Russian Federation can be changed only upon agreement with the  Federation.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Lonrho makes Bock joint chief executive MR DIETER BOCK, the German financier with an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, was yesterday appointed as joint chief executive and managing director with Mr Tiny Rowland. Mr Rowland, who has effectively run the company for the past 31 years, said Mr Bock would have no separate duties or responsibilities. However, Mr Rowland said Mr Bock's appointment would allow him to spend more time in Africa while Mr Bock said his expertise would enable him to deal with 'questions relating to (Lonrho's) financing'. Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said: 'It should not be misunderstood, there is no division. There is no split, no potential for conflict. With a telephone call both will know what the other is doing.' While the joint chief executives stressed there would be no significant changes in the running of the company, Mr Bock revealed that the group had changed its mind over the appointment of non-executive directors. After discussing the implications of the Cadbury Report, which recommends that companies should appoint independent non-executive directors, Mr Bock said Lonrho's board was now looking for 'reputable non-executive directors'. Although Mr Rowland named Mr Bock as his successor he said he intended to continue as joint chief executive for at least three years. Mr Bock said the group's main aim was to continue to reduce borrowings - which recently rose to Pounds 947m - through minor disposals. With the exception of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation in Ghana, Lonrho's investments in companies it does not control are up for sale. By way of an example, Mr Rowland said Lonrho may dispose of its minority stakes in Anglo-American's Leeuwbosch and Eastern Gold mines in South Africa. Lonrho's core businesses, which Mr Rowland identified as mining, hotels, agriculture and trading, would not be sold. However, he explained that Lonrho did not have to own 100 per cent of a core business. 'The minimum holding level is 51 per cent.' Mr Rowland said he would consider allowing Gencor, South Africa's biggest mining house, to increase its 27 per cent stake in Lonrho's three platinum mines.</p>

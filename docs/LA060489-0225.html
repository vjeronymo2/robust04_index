The  other members of the entourage will ride in two chase planes.  </P> <P> IN TONY'S CESSNA  </P> <P> His father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a certified pilot who owns the plane.  Aliengena, a real estate investor and truck transportation broker, taught Tony  to fly and will be riding in the co-pilot's seat for the duration of the  flight. Aliengena is an avid hunter and fisherman who frequently flies his  family to its mountaintop retreat in southern Utah. He also helps coach Tony's  Little League baseball team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Susan Aliengena, 39, a homemaker, has been in charge of such details as  obtaining Soviet visas for all of the Americans going on the trip. She is  active in civic affairs in the family's hometown of San Juan Capistrano, where  she has served as co-chairman of the local PTA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> His 9-year-old sister, Alaina, who attends third grade at Prentice Day School  in Newport Beach. Alaina helped put together a 1,000-foot "friendship" scroll  that is to be presented to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tony's Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, 10, who flew to Orange County on  Saturday to meet the Aliengena family and is to accompany them for the duration  of the trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is going along as an  official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S. sanctioning body  for all world and national aviation records. Hagen, a longtime private pilot,  will be on hand to verify whether Tony remains in sole control of the aircraft  throughout the 17,500-mile flight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN CHASE PLANE  </P> <P> Riding in a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air, which will carry spare parts and  luggage, will be:  </P> <P> Lance Allyn, an orthopedic surgeon from Fresno who owns the King Air and will  be piloting it for all but one week of the journey. During the third week of  the trip, when the entourage enters the Soviet Union, Allyn has plans to fly  commercially back to the United States and attend his daughter's wedding in  Boston. He will relinquish control of the aircraft during that time to Garry  Zinger, a private pilot from Visalia. Allyn will rejoin the trip in Moscow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guy Murrel, 28, a public relations consultant from Costa Mesa who has been  serving as coordinator of Friendship Flight '89, the project under which Tony  is flying around the world. During the flight, Murrel will be coordinating  press conferences and public events involving the entourage. He will fly part  of the time in the chase plane and part of the time in a commercial jet to  prepare advance work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Soviet journalists. Maxin Chikin, of the newspaper Pravda, and Alexei  Grinevich, of a Soviet magazine, who will be filing dispatches along the way to  the Soviet Union, where there is already intense public curiosity about a boy  who would try to fly a plane around the world. The two journalists were due to  arrive in Orange County on Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jim Carlton, 33, of Laguna Beach, a reporter for The Times' Orange County  Edition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FILM CREW  </P> <P> Riding in a twin-engine Cessna 421 will be:  </P> <P> Pat Wiesner, 53, a magazine publisher from Denver, Colo., who owns the aircraft  and will be piloting it during the journey.

Wiesner said he has flown  extensively throughout the United States and South America.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four members of an independent film production crew from Los Angeles. The crew,  consisting of Shawn Hardin, 27, Julia Roberson, Susan Eisner, 28, and Joseph  Lee, 29, plans to produce a film documentary on Tony's flight.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTRAGE OVER BREAD SHORTAGES UNDERMINING SUPPORT FOR SOVIET REFORMS;  </P> <P> MOSCOW: FOR RUSSIANS, A MEAL WITHOUT THE TRADITIONAL SYMBOL OF WELL-BEING IS NO  MEAL AT ALL. SCARCE SUPPLIES HAVE CREATED A PUBLIC PANIC.  </P> <P> Into the tiny guardhouse of the Zotov Bread Factory rushed a worker in  shirt-sleeves despite the cold rain.  </P> <P> "Open the gate," he commanded, gesturing toward the truck waiting outside to  carry freshly baked loaves to the capital's stores. "People are left without  bread!"  </P> <P> People are left without bread. It is a terrifying sentence for a nation that  lives on bread, that has come to consider it the one dependable product in the  midst of an economy gone haywire, that sees it, as it has throughout history,  as the symbol of well-being, even of life itself.  </P> <P> For a Russian, a meal without bread is considered no meal at all, and that  quick stop in the neighborhood bread store for a couple of loaves to put on the  family table has been a central ritual of Soviet daily life for decades.  </P> <P> The steady supply of bread, in fact, was an unwritten but inviolable Communist  covenant with the people after decades of deprivation: No matter what happens,  the party told them, you will always have bread; you will never go hungry  again.  </P> <P> But for a week now, the lines at Moscow bread stores -- those that still have  anything to sell -- have snaked longer and longer, and the indignant panic has  grown.  </P> <P> "How can this be?" an outraged pensioner standing in line the other day at the  capital's premier bread store on Kalinin Prospekt demanded. "They bring in a  great harvest, and there's no bread in the stores.  </P> <P> "Soon the windows in all the bread stores will be shattered," he predicted.  "The people will rise up."  </P> <P> As President Mikhail S. Gorbachev prepares to launch a radical new economic  program and Moscow readies equally daring plans to turn the city into an island  of virtual capitalism, the bread shortage is costing the reformers in power  desperately needed public confidence.  </P> <P> "We curse Gorbachev and the Moscow Council," an old man in a cap said as he  packed away the two loaves of bread he had bought after a half-hour wait. "We  should have thought before electing them."  </P> <P> For Gorbachev's new reform program to succeed, he must have active support from  a populace that believes in the future enough to invest energy in it and to  tolerate the new hardships that it will bring at first.  </P> <P> Expected to be presented this week, the reform program moves the country away  from a state-owned, centrally planned economy by instituting a mass selloff of  government property to private citizens and a gradual shift to higher,  free-market prices.  </P> <P> The timing of the bread shortage is unfortunate, and "the psychological damage  is enormous," Yuri M. Luzhkov, chairman of the Moscow City Council's executive  committee and the head of the capital's new Anti-Crisis Committee, said. "We  should have avoided it."  </P> <P> City officials reported midweek that there had -- so far -- been no violent  incidents connected with the bread shortage, none of the street protests dubbed  "tobacco rebellions" that broke out nationwide over cigarette shortfalls this  summer.  </P> <P> The Soviet populace is famed for its stoic patience, but politicians learned  the lesson earlier this year that they must not tamper with bread.  </P> <P> When Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov proposed tripling the price of a loaf --  now cheap at about 30 cents for a loaf that weighs more than two pounds -- he  triggered such an outcry and rush of panic buying that the government had to  back off.  </P> <P> "Bread is the foundation of a person," said a man in a slow-moving line of  shoppers waiting to buy the hard bread rings that Russians dunk in their tea.  "We can be without anything -- without sugar -- but not without bread. A person  without bread is like cattle without hay."  </P> <P> Luzhkov said that 25% of the city's bread stores were empty or under-stocked;  other estimates put the shortfall at approximately the amount of bread consumed  daily by 300,000 Muscovites. Outside Moscow, shortages have been reported in a  number of provincial towns, but none appear to be as severe as that in the  capital.  </P> <P> Luzhkov pledged last week that the bread crisis would pass within the next few  days as all the baking industry's idle ovens are fired up. Those responsible  for the shortage will be punished, he added.  </P> <P> "This is our problem, and it's our fault," Luzhkov told reporters.  </P> <P> Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov has proposed that hundreds of soldiers be brought in  to help bake and transport bread.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, acting to ensure that the government's low grain supply does not  cause bread shortages in the future, ordered regional leaders to guarantee that  farmers deliver the grain they have promised to the state.  </P> <P> Moscow officials predicted that the head of the city's bread industry would be  fired, but otherwise, this shortage -- like so many others -- appeared to be  the fault of everybody and nobody, a natural phenomenon for an economy in the  process of falling apart.  </P> <P> The trouble began when hundreds of thousands of Muscovites swarmed back into  the city from their countryside vacations. The baking industry was prepared for  a jump in demand, but it exceeded expectations.  </P> <P> So many other foodstuffs are now in short supply, including vegetables and  meat, that people are eating more bread to compensate, Luzhkov said, explaining  the unanticipated demand.  </P> <P> As word of the new shortage spread, Muscovites began buying twice or three  times more bread than they normally do: storing it, drying it into toast so  that it has a long shelf life or freezing it.  </P> <P> All that has driven up demand, and the cycle of shortage, stockpiling and even  greater shortages was again under way.  </P> <P> Shoppers tend to have their own theories about the shortage's origins.  </P> <P> "It's the Mafia," said Yelena Yelkina, one of scores of people waiting in the  Kalinin Prospekt store for the next batch of loaves. Many of those waiting  nearby agreed, supporting the popular belief that shady figures purposely  create shortages, either to profit from the resulting black market or to bring  on the downfall of those in power and put in their own people.  </P> <P> Engineer Askold Tarusin blamed the Communist Party.  </P> <P> "With the principles it ruled by, it brought us here, and this is the result,"  he said.  </P> <P> Years of neglect that came with a system in which no one felt personally  responsible -- the Russians call it "lacking a master" -- have clearly taken  their toll on the bread-baking industry, as on other segments of the Soviet  economy.  </P> <P> When the shortage arose and officials asked why production could not be  increased immediately, it turned out that 21 bread production lines were  standing idle for want of modernization and repair, and that much of the city's  baking equipment was more than 50 years old.  </P> <P> The Zotov Bread Factory in central Moscow is one of the more sorry examples.  </P> <P> The giant "1931" drawn on its brick walls may have connoted progress 60 years  ago, but these days it means machinery so hopelessly antiquated that, according  to director Vasily Molodykh, the factory's biggest production line has been out  of order for four years.  </P> <P> As part of its emergency measures, the Moscow City Council has ordered the idle  line restarted within three days. "We have to do it," Molodykh said.  </P> <P> The city, which operates Moscow's bakeries, is also trying to attract more and  better workers to the manpower-starved industry by doubling their salaries from  about $320 a month to about $700.  </P> <P> The worsening shortage has also prompted proposals to ration bread or raise  prices, Moscow City Council member Yuri Khramov said, but he warned that price  increases "would bring exactly the blood on the streets that we don't want."  </P> <P> For all their grumbling and the dire predictions, Soviet consumers for the most  part still seem far from violence.  </P> <P> In the Kalinin Prospekt store, Tarusin said that if the bread shortage gets  worse, "We'll learn to suck our paws like a bear.  </P> <P> "We also have substitutes, like potatoes," Tarusin added.  </P> <P> Maybe.  </P> <P> Luzhkov announced earlier that the city was running about 120,000 tons short of  the stores of potatoes it needs for the winter.  </P></p>

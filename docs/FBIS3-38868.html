The Air Option Remains in the Air"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  American Support </H5>   The position of the United States is also something to  watch.  Washington was in favor of the use of force eight months ago.  Afterwards it changed its mind. And now it is once again in  favor: On Monday [7 February] President Bill Clinton supported  the request that NATO authorize air strikes against Serb  batteries around Sarajevo.    U.S. Secretary of State Christopher Warren was very shocked  by the carnage in Sarajevo. He seems to have won ground against  some leading figures in the Pentagon who favor prudence.    It seems that a turnaround in U.S. policies would rally the  United Kingdom to the air strike option. But account must be  taken of Russia, for whom this option risks causing "an  escalation in violence leading to the immediate withdrawal of UN  forces."</p>

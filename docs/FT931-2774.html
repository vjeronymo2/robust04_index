			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Initial optimism turns into caution AS THE dust began to settle yesterday on the changes to the advance corporation tax regime experts started assessing the implications for UK companies. While the initial response to the Budget speech was enthusiastic, closer investigation of the measures dampened the hopes raised. According to tax experts at Ernst &amp; Young, the Inland Revenue is likely to increase its tax take through ACT as a result of the changes. Companies have been lobbying hard for measures to address the problem of surplus ACT for many years. They were told before the Budget that any solutions would have to be neutral in revenue terms, and had not hoped for much. In his speech Mr Lamont appeared to have given more than anyone expected. And finance directors were yesterday still welcoming the changes he proposed. Companies stand to benefit in two ways. First, the rate of ACT is being reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent over two years. Then the idea of a 'foreign income dividend' scheme will be discussed. A consultation document was issued on Tuesday and responses invited by the end of May. The reduction in the rate appears good news for companies, although not for their tax-exempt investors or for higher-rate tax paying individuals. Companies will get a cashflow benefit as ACT is payable in advance but corporation tax is paid in arrears. The chancellor estimated that the net benefit to companies would be Pounds 2bn over two years. Mr Andrew Jones, the senior tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young pointed out, however, that a large number of companies will be worse off. Those which have suffered from surplus ACT in past years can set it off against UK corporation tax once their profits recover sufficiently to pay it. But, while they could offset Pounds 25 of ACT against Pounds 33 of corporation tax, soon the amount will be only Pounds 20. As a result their marginal tax rate will rise from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. Lobbyists had been pressing for 'pound-for-pound' offset but this is a move in the opposite direction. Mr Jones said companies with a mountain of surplus ACT would only be able to erode it at a much slower rate. He argued that the government should consider allowinga pound-for-pound offset or companies would see their marginal tax rates rise by 62 1/2 per cent. There is some unhappiness that, while the rate payable by companies is to come down in two stages to 20 per cent, shareholders' tax credits will undergo one simple cut, giving the government the 2 1/2 per cent difference for a year. The second positive ACT provision relating to foreign income dividends, is also not quite as helpful as it might seem. Companies will have the option of paying them out of profits remitted from overseas. They will have to pay ACT in the normal way but can then claim it back from the revenue. This is of no use to tax-exempt shareholders, who will not be able to claim a tax credit. In theory foreign income dividends will evade the problem faced by companies with a large proportion of overseas profits, but only a small amount of UK corporation tax against which to offset the associated ACT. In practice, aside from the likely complexity of claiming the tax back, companies can only pay the dividends out of actual cash received from their overseas subsidiaries. Often countries demand a withholding tax when cash is remitted, and some also impose foreign exchange controls limiting the remittances to a UK parent. Companies could find that there is another cost involved if they try to reduce their ACT bill. Even so, Mr Ian Muir, head of the Scottish Institute of Chartered Accountants tax committee, said yesterday that 'at least it is a step forward, at long last they have accepted that something needed to be done'. Overall the effects of the ACT changes will have widely varying effects for different companies. 'It depends on the mix of income and the mix of shareholders', Mr Muir said.</p>

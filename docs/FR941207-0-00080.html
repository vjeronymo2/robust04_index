Box 70977, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024, (202) 707&hyph;8380. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Pub. L 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304, eliminated the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) and replaced it with a system of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> ad hoc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs) administered by the Librarian of Congress (Librarian) and the Copyright Office (Office). The CARPs adjust royalty rates and distribute royalties collected under the various compulsory licenses and statutory obligations of the Copyright Act. The CRT Reform Act, which was effective immediately upon enactment, directed the Librarian and the Office to adopt the rules and regulations of the CRT found in chapter 3 of 37 CFR, 17 U.S.C. 802(d), and provided that the CRT's regulations were to remain in effect until the Librarian adopts ``supplemental or superseding regulations.'' The Office adopted the CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis on December 22, 1993, and notified the public that it intended to begin a rulemaking proceeding to revise and update those rules. 58 FR 67690 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office began the rulemaking proceeding with publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on January 18, 1994. 59 FR 2550 (1994). The NPRM contained substantial revisions required by the dual structure of the royalty rate adjustment and distribution system created by the CRT Reform Act. Since the CRT's rules were designed for a single administrative body, the Office proposed extensive changes to accommodate the division of authority between the Librarian and the Copyright Office on the one hand, and the CARPs on the other. In addition to inviting written public comment, the Copyright Office invited interested parties to a public meeting to discuss the proposed regulations. More than 50 individuals attended the February 1, 1994, meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Interim Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the concerns the parties expressed at the February public meeting, and thoroughly reviewing the written comments, the Copyright Office issued Interim Regulations on May 9, 1994. 59 FR 23964 (1994). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Interim Regulations substantially revised and updated the rules adopted in December of 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Office also published technical corrections to the Interim Regulations. 59 FR 33201 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The need for immediate adoption of a regulatory framework was underscored by the imminence of a royalty distribution of money collected under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 for digital audio recording technology (DART). Section 1007(b), 17 U.S.C., requires determination of a DART controversy and commencement of arbitration proceedings on March 30 of each year for the prior year's royalty collections. The 1992 DART distribution proceeding was begun by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal but was suspended when the Tribunal was abolished, and therefore needed to be started anew. The 1993 DART distribution was begun by the Copyright Office under the new authority conferred by the CRT Reform Act, and on March 1, 1994, the Office published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  asking the claimants to the 1992 and 1993 DART royalties to comment as to the existence of any controversies in the royalty funds. 59 FR 9773 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anticipating a consolidated DART distribution proceeding for the 1992 and 1993 calendar years, the Copyright Office postponed the date for determination of DART controversies from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, in order to permit adequate time for the adoption of regulations governing a CARP proceeding. On May 9, 1994, the Office adopted the Interim Regulations with the intention that they would govern any DART controversies and proceedings beginning June 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office created a new subdivision of the regulations devoted entirely to the operation and procedures of the CARPs. We removed parts 301 through 311 of chapter III of 37 CFR and created subchapters A and B of chapter II. Subchapter A comprises the Copyright Office rules and procedures, consisting of parts 201&hyph;211, and remains unchanged. New subchapter B, created by the Interim Regulations, comprises parts 251&hyph;259, and prescribes the rules and procedures of the CARPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 251, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Rules of Procedure, consists of regulations governing the organization of the CARPs, access to CARP meetings and records, rules governing the conduct and course of proceedings, and procedures applicable to rate adjustments and distributions. Part 251 also includes extensive rules of conduct for arbitrators, as well as appropriate ethical and financial standards. We did not propose any specific rules of conduct in the NPRM, but did reserve a subpart for such rules and solicited comment from the interested parties on the issue.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR at 2554 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 252 contains revised rules for the filing of claims to cable royalties, modeled after the system used by the CRT for the filing of DART royalty claims. Parts 253 to 256_Use of Certain Copyrighted Works in Connection With Noncommercial Educational Broadcasting; Adjustment of Royalty Rate for Coin-Operated Phonorecord Players; and Adjustment of Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords_is virtually identical to the former CRT's rules, with only some minor technical changes. Like part 252, part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite Carrier Royalty Fees_is modeled after the royalty claim procedures used by the CRT for DART. Finally, parts 258 and 259_Adjustment of Royalty Fee for Secondary Transmissions by Satellite Carriers and Filing of Claims to Digital Audio Recording Devices and Media Royalty Payments_contains only minor variations from the former CRT's rules. Since the CRT Reform Act eliminated the jukebox compulsory license and replaced it with a new provision for negotiated licenses (formerly section 116A of the Copyright Act, as amended by the CRT Reform Act), the Copyright Office dropped the regulations governing the filing of jukebox royalty claims (formerly 37 CFR part 305).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to soliciting general comments on the Interim Regulations, the Copyright Office also posed a number of questions to focus the commentators' attention on specific issues and to encourage the parties to offer their solutions. The questions ranged from whether certain types of DART proceedings were subject to CARP jurisdiction, 59 FR 23967 (1994), to asking for comment on ten hypothetical scenarios designed to test the parameters of the conduct rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 23980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments on the Interim Regulations were due June 15, 1994. Reply comments were due July 15, 1994. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Copyright Office received a total of 14 comments and replies. Many parties filed joint comments, and some of the joint commentators also filed separate comments. The commentator groups for comments and/or replies were as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Copyright Office met with representatives from ASCAP, BMI, the Canadian Claimants, the Devotional Claimants, the Joint Sports Claimants, NAB, NPR, PBS, and Program Suppliers on August 11th on matters pertaining to cable copyright royalty distribution. The minutes of that meeting are associated with the comment file and are available for public inspection and copying. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Canadian Claimants (Canadian Claimants);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electronic Industries Association (EIA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> James Cannings (Cannings);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Joint Sports Claimants, the National Association of Broadcasters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Broadcasting Service, the Devotional Claimants, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canadian Claimants, and National Public Radio (collectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain Copyright Owners); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

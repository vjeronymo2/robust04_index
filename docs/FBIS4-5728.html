			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>   [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his  way home after a three-nation tour of Asia. Mr. Keating's trip  took him to Laos, Thailand, and finally Vietnam, where he  invited the communist party leader, Do Muoi, to visit Australia.  It's an invitation the Vietnamese leader accepted and this is  sure to cause unhappiness among some of the Vietnamese who fled  their country after the communist's victory in 1975 and now live  in Australia. Christopher Kremmer reports from Hanoi that Mr. Do  Muoi will be seen as a more provocative figure than the  reformist prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, whose presence in  Australia last year led to demonstrations by Australian  Vietnamese.    [Begin Kremmer recording] It's the oldest rule of war --  both  sides on two-fronts -- and Mr. Keating has broken it. His  invitation to communist party chief Do Muoi proved alienating an  important lobby group, which so far has remained relatively  quiet about his visit to Vietnam. The invitation was issued  during what one official described as unusually long and  interesting talks between Mr. Keating and the 76-year-old party  leader in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday. The VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY  later reported that it has been accepted by Do Muoi with  pleasure. As the party chief has in recent months been visiting  neighboring ASEAN countries, an invitation to come to Australia  was unexpected. Even a reformist leader like Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet attracted the wrath of a small section of the  Vietnamese community when he visited Australia last year. But  Do Muoi, head of the party which maintains armed [word  indistinct] party-rule over Vietnam is an entirely different  matter. He represents to some Australian Vietnamese a painful  reminder of a war which did so much damage and deprecation to  their lives. And as Vietnam [word indistinct], that it was not  just the allies who were responsible for atrocities in the war.  Terror was a weapon used by both sides to polarize communities  and keep villagers on side. A communist party government is  still accused by Asia Watch and other human right and religious  groups of serious infringements of civil liberties and political  rights. Above all the right of the people to choose their  government at free election. As one commentator remarked  recently a great deal of history stands between Vietnam and  United States. The same could be said of Vietnam and Australia.  The commentator went on to observe that while communism may be  dead in Vietnam, authoritarianism is thriving. That affects the  relatives of Australian Vietnamese still living here. Do Muoi's  communist party is seen by some as bearing most responsibility.  Mr. Keating has observed that the wounds of war are still deep  in Vietnam, but the wounds are also deeply felt by Vietnamese  who fled their homeland for Australia and many of them are  unlikely to be impressed by the invitation.

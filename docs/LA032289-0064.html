			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HATFIELD SAYS HE SAW SHOOTING IN CAPITAL  </P> <P> Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) says he witnessed a shooting in the nation's  capital but sped away without notifying police.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying I shouldn't have reported it, but at that one time and place my  thought was to escape -- get out of there," he was quoted as saying in  Tuesday's Salem Statesman Journal.  </P> <P> Hatfield said he and his family were driving to their Washington home from a  restaurant last week when they saw a man shoot at another from across a street.  He said the shooting victim was able to get into a waiting car, which sped off.  </P></p>

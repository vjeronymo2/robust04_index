			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Asia Asian indices have plunged this year while economic growth in the region has at worst maintained the high levels that investors have learned to expect. This creates some interesting anomalies. In Thailand, for example, earnings per share are likely to grow at close to 30 per cent this year whereas the stock market has fallen 19 per cent. There are other positive signs. In 1980, 76 per cent of Asia's exports were shipped outside the region. Regional trade now accounts for over half of exports and is rising rapidly. Given levels of growth throughout Asia, economic success should feed upon itself. Secondly, US weightings in the region remain low and, given limited currency risk in a number of Asian markets (ie Thailand and Malaysia), exposure is expected to increase steadily in the coming years. One risk for the region is the large amount of capital-raising. India's stock market is expected to absorb new issues amounting to around Dollars 11.5bn in the year to March. This represents close to 10 per cent of market capitalisation and is one factor behind the 16 per cent fall in the Indian market since it reached its peak in September. Capital-raising has similarly held back Indonesian stocks. The spectre of an overheating Chinese economy and an ailing political figurehead, Deng Xiaoping, could hurt China's stock markets. Ripples would follow through to an already vulnerable Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the regional impact may not be great, and 1995 seems likely to be a year of recovery.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Exchanges fight for the future across Europe: Tracy Corrigan on moves behind the intensifying battle for derivatives business MR George Soros was not the only beneficiary of the unrest in Europe's financial markets. He is reputed to have made Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), but Europe's futures exchanges also benefited as volumes leapt by around 50 per cent last year. Traders faced with volatile market conditions channelled business away from cash markets, where prices were no longer being quoted, to more liquid futures markets. The surge of volume has exaggerated a steady shift of futures market share from the mature US market to Europe. The battle to win this business has created greater competition between Europe's futures and commodity exchanges, which now number more than 20. The latest stage in the evolution of Europe's futures markets came on Wednesday, when France's Matif and Germany's Deutsche Terminborse announced a co-operation pact which could threaten the dominance of Europe's largest exchange, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe). Although Liffe is in discussions over a link with the Chicago Board of Trade, it is not in a position to join with other European exchanges, because most of them are natural competitors. Yet links between other European exchanges are becoming increasingly common. Last year, four smaller European exchanges agreed to trade each other's products in order to extend their reach. Liffe already offers a broad range of international financial futures and options contracts, while other exchanges have concentrated mainly on domestic markets, often imitating existing products on Liffe. The wide selection of similarly structured contracts on Liffe is considered a source of strength: during the unrest in the autumn, for example, there was substantial arbitrage trading between different Liffe products. Liffe's largest contracts are traded using the traditional open-outcry system, while the link between the DTB and the Matif will be provided by the DTB's screen-based trading system. Many participants believe that, because of the current limitations of technology, the DTB system will not be able to offer the same level of liquidity as that available on Liffe. Certainly, none of the world's largest futures contracts is screen-based. 'I do not think anyone has found a computerised system which is user-friendly or simple enough to take the place of open outcry trading,' said Mr Mark Harding, who heads the financial markets group at Clifford Chance, the law firm. 'The technology just is not up there yet,' said Mr Alex Cooper, head of futures at Credit Lyonnais Rouse. 'It will probably be another two generations (of systems) but we are moving towards synthesised voice output and touch screen trading.' However, the trend towards screen-based trading is already gathering steam. For example, Amsterdam's European Options Exchange decided in December that it will switch from pit-trading to a combined system of pit and computerised trading. In particular, there is a trend for smaller contracts to be shifted to screen-based systems. 'Pits are not expensive when there is heavy volume, but they can be expensive for smaller products,' said Mr Gerard Pfaulwadel, who heads the Matif. Significantly, the Matif's Ecu contract, which will move to the DTB system, currently trades around 4,000 contracts a day, compared with a daily volume of around 150,000 in the French government bond contract. The French bond contract will continue to be traded in the pit. Last June, Globex, the international after-hours screen trading system, was finally launched after five years of development by the CME, CBOT and Reuter, at an estimated cost of Dollars 80m. Although the nightly volume on the system is disappointingly low - around 2,000 contracts - more European exchanges are expected to join the system. So far, only the Matif has signed up, but negotiations with Liffe and the DTB, among others, continue. The Matif's Globex agreement is not affected by the DTB link-up. Officials at Liffe insist they do not see the DTB/Matif move as a threat. 'It will not take volume away from Liffe, since it means that the size of the overall market will increase,' according to Mr Roger Barton, head of business development. However, the competition between Liffe and the DTB over the German government bond contract, already fierce, is set to increase. Later this month, Liffe launches a medium-term government bond future, which will compete with an existing DTB contract. Holding on to its 70 per cent market share in bund futures is very important to Liffe, since this is its largest contract. Liffe estimates that 8 to 12 per cent of bund futures trading is done by French institutions; this is potentially at risk if French house switch their business to the Matif. However, large, international fund managers still tend to channel their business through London, and Liffe has undoubtedly benefited from its position at the heart of Europe's financial markets. But in each market there are still substantial funds held by domestically-oriented institutions, which are more likely to be invested in a contract traded locally. 'If the potential user base was fully tapped, they would be fighting for the same people, but that is not the case,' according to Mr Harding. As long as London maintains its position as Europe's financial centre, Liffe's position at the heart of the futures market is not likely to be seriously threatened. It may lose out on a fruitful source of future growth, however, as other exchanges expand their own domestic investor bases and pool these investors through links with each other. Of these, the link between the Matif and the DTB is so far the most important. It is evidence of the determination with which French and German institutions are advancing their position in Europe's emerging financial structure.</p>

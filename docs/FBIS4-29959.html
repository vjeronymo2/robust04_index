			<p>CSO     [Text] The Research and Development Guidance Committee of  the Industrial Technology Council which is an advisory organ of  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] chaired  by Technology Information Center Director Hiroshi Inose compiled  a publication titled "Guide for Research and Development of  Industrial Science Technology," which provides a status report  on research and development projects undertaken by MITI. The  report recommends assignment of the highest priority to the  building of "research and development infrastructure" projects  such as data networks and data bases. It also lists as future  development issues nine sectors such as data communications and  energy and environmental technology.    The guide identifies as important construction of technical  infrastructure for MITI-sponsored national projects and  Industrial Technology Institute-sponsored research and  development project-related data networks and data bases and  standards. Additionally, it recommends priority implementation  of work in three sectors: 1) reinforcement of basic and creative  research; 2) response to global and international issues such as  the environment; and 3) research and development that aims at  the enhancement of the public living standards and welfare.    In the way of research and development organizations, the  report recommends that the 15 national research agencies  supervised by the Industrial Technology Institute be treated as  the core organizations for experimentation (COE). It also points  to the need to expand programs such as tax systems and fiscal  investment and loan programs to assist in research and  development work of the private sector.</p>

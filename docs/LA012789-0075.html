			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PRICING PLAN FROM OIL EXPORTERS  </P> <P> Experts from six OPEC nations and seven independent oil producers agreed  Thursday to recommend further steps for bolstering world oil prices, but  stopped short of making specific plans for cooperation.  </P> <P> Oil ministers from both sides will meet at a yet-undecided date for further  discussion on the issue, OPEC Secretary General Subroto told reporters after  the daylong closed meeting.  </P> <P> The non-OPEC countries also stated in a communique that they supported OPEC's  goal of achieving a target price of $18 a barrel "as soon as possible."  </P> <P> "They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance improvements already  achieved and to further strengthen the oil market, especially in the second  quarter of 1989," the communique read.  </P> <P> The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying to enlist the  support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreed at its November  ministerial meeting to curtail its own production in order to boost prices.  </P></p>

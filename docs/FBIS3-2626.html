In a recent interview with a reporter from BEIJING  REVIEW, Zhang Xianghai, deputy director general of the State  Administration of Taxation, answered questions concerning the  issue. Excerpts follow:    QUESTION: [Q] What modifications concerning the taxation of  foreign-funded enterprises are found in the current taxation  reform?    ANSWER: [A] Taxation reform concerning enterprises using  foreign investment and foreign enterprises includes the  following major aspects: According to the decision adopted by  the Fifth Session of the Standing People's Congress, effective  on January 1, 1994, foreign funded enterprises and foreign  enterprises became subject to national unified taxes such as  value-added tax, excise duty and business tax. Imposition of  the taxes was necessary to develop both the socialist market  economy and a fair taxation system, and was in line with the  demands of a majority of foreign-funded and foreign enterprises.  The reforms adopted the important principle of placing no undue  tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises in order to ensure the  consistency and stability of China's taxation policies. Simply  stated, the state established taxation rates based on avoiding  both increases or decreases in the general level of tax burden.  In general, the reform measures guarantee state revenue, while  at the same time avoiding placing an added tax burden on  enterprises. Nonetheless, changes in the taxation structure and  channels of taxation will inevitably result in minor increases  or decreases in taxes on certain products and enterprises. As  part of an effort to solve this particular problem, the state  will implement necessary policies and measures to ensure a  smooth transition from the old taxation system to the new.  According to a recent decision approved by the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress, foreign-funded  enterprises established before December 31, 1993, which face an  increased tax burden due to imposition of value-added tax,  excise duty and business tax, will with the approval of taxation  authorities, receive refunds for increased tax payments during  their term of business operations within five years.  Foreign-funded enterprises established after January 1, 1994,  are subject to the new tax law.    Q: Following the unification of income taxes on domestic  enterprises, domestic enterprises enjoy tax rates equivalent to  those of foreign-funded enterprises. However, the latter  previously enjoyed various other privileges. Are preferential  policies such as these still valid?    A: The taxation reform confirms that the Income Tax Law of  the People's Republic of China for Enterprises With Foreign  Investment and Foreign Enterprises, effective as of July 1,  1991, will remain in effect and the various privileges stated in  the law will remain unchanged. At present, however, domestic  enterprises enjoy tax rates equal to those of foreign-funded  enterprises. This is aimed at providing conditions and  opportunities for enterprises to compete on an equal footing.  Preferential policies granted to foreign funded enterprises  will remain unchanged. On the basis of unifying tax rates for  domestic enterprises, the state will, at an appropriate time and  after necessary preparations, use legal means to unify the  income system for both domestic and foreign enterprises through  the promulgation of The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the  People's Republic of China.    Q: Previously, various localities arbitrarily established  development zones and granted certain preferential taxation  policies without having first obtained the approval of the  central government. How do state taxation authorities plan to  approach this issue?    A: While it is necessary to provide preferential taxation  policies for foreign investors, such policies should be enacted  in strict accordance with the law. Preferential taxation  policies should be designated only by the central government,  which alone has the final say concerning the issue. China is a  large country with 30 provinces (excluding Taiwan),  municipalities and autonomous regions, hundreds of cities and  thousands of counties. Confusion would reign if local  governments were allowed to proceed as they wished. Allowing  them to do so would not only lessen the original function of  preferential taxation policies, but would also destroy the  country's overall taxation environment. Preferential taxation  policies are only part of the investment environment, and other  factors such as resources, infrastructure and labor conditions  are perhaps more important. In 1992, the State Council issued  the Circular on Strengthening Taxation Administration and  Strictly Controlling Tax Reductions and Exemptions. The  circular contains two articles concerning the taxation of  foreign-funded enterprises, reaffirming that all preferential  taxation policies arbitrarily designated by local governments  and departments which are contradictory to the state taxation  laws and regulations are invalid, and should immediately be  withdrawn or rectified. The circular also stated that all  economic development zones lacking the approval of the State  Council are prohibited from receiving various preferential  taxation policies granted to approved state level development  zones. The State Council's effort to rectify the situation is  designed to guarantee the correct implementation of taxation  laws and regulations in order to protect the legitimate  interests of investors.    Q: What is the situation concerning tax revenue received  from foreign-funded enterprises during the past 15 years of  reform and opening?    A: Since implementation of the reform and opening policies,  China has adopted a series of preferential taxation policies to  encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the country. The  preferential polices have played an active role in attracting  foreign investment and accelerating economic development.  Throughout the period, China's tax revenues from foreign funded  enterprises have increased substantially on an annual basis. In  1992, tax revenues from foreign-funded enterprises soared to  10.7 billion yuan, a dramatic 52 percent increase over the  previous year, and the figure hit 20 billion yuan in 1993.    In terms of reforms of the taxation system, China has  insisted on the following three principles -- the protection of  national interests, facilitating the opening effort, and  gradually instituting generally accepted international  practices. China will continue to abide by the three principles  in any future taxation reform.</p>

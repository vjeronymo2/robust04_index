			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Zhiyun (0491 1807 0061) "Carry out </F> Organizational Reform, Boost Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises,  Enhance the Organizational Construction"]    [Text] The provincial people's government held a meeting  with the participation of responsible comrades from various  departments and units under the provincial people's government  on 11 May to make arrangements for the three tasks of  implementing the "three definitiveness" plan for conducting  organizational reform among the subordinate departments of the  provincial people's government, of boosting the large and  medium-sized enterprises, and of enhancing the organizational  construction of the provincial people's government.    Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu presided over the meeting and  Executive Vice Governor Wen Shizhen delivered a speech at it.    Wen Shizhen said: We should vigorously grasp the  implementation of the appraised "three definitiveness" plan for  conducting organizational reform among 42 departments under the  provincial people's government. We should strive to put the  plan in place by the end of May and carry out the reform in line  with the demands set in the plan in June. For this, he put  forward the following demands in his speech:    First, various departments should break down the existing  functions of their own. Then, in line with the demands of  developing the socialist market economy, they should analyze and  distinguish the functions one by one so as to determine which  should be enhanced, which should be weakened, and which should  be transferred. Only by clarifying these issues can we define  the size of internal organs and staffers in line with the  principle of "assigning personnel according to the work".    Second, by proceeding from the whole situation, various  departments must adopt resolute measures to implement the staff  size approved for internal organs and the number of posts  approved for leading personnel. They must be determined to  fulfill the simplifying tasks of organizational reform. Based  on the existing number of sections and offices, we should  simplify them by cutting 30 percent of them and chiefly reduce  the organs that are conducting self-management and self-service.    Third, we should vigorously make proper arrangements for the  surplus personnel and be determined to broaden the channels of  personnel transfer. We should also encourage organs' cadres to  open economic entities, to rend an enterprise, and to find a job  in enterprises and establishments. Personnel whose age is near  to retirement will be allowed to retire from their post ahead of  time. Meanwhile, we should clear up the TDY personnel of organs.    Fourth, we should explore reforms for the managerial systems  of cadres and enforce personnel exchanges.    Fifth, we should vigorously promote the reform among  establishments and units. Through the reform we should  differentiate the leading system, organizational establishment,  staff size control, and the systems of personnel affairs and  distributions of these establishments and units from those of  the party and government organs. Efforts should be made to cut  the number of units and personnel who are living on "royal  grains".    While citing the issue of boosting the large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, Wen Shizhen said:  Currently, most large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  have not been enlivened. Particularly under the new situation  of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic  systems, the pace in enlivening these enterprises has been  difficult. It must be noted that through the reform and  construction conducted over the past many years, these  state-owned enterprises have possessed strong and actual  strength in the economy and laid a solid technical foundation.  They have also possessed a large number of talented personnel  outstanding in science, technology, and management. Under the  new situation, only by truly doing away with the fetter caused  by the out-dated systems; straightening out their ideas of  development; and concentrating their efforts on shifting the  mechanism, conducting reform and readjustment, opening markets,  and enhancing the management; can these enterprises bring their  tremendous potential into play and be fully brimming with vigor  and vitality.    In citing the issue of enhancing the organizational  construction of the provincial people's government, Wen Shizhen  said: The provincial people's government has decided, by  regarding the implementation of the "three definitiveness" plan  as a turning point, to carry out consolidation among its  subordinate organs and to further enhance the organizational  construction so as to enable the organs under the provincial  people's government to meet the demands of developing the  socialist market economy and to better perform their duties. He  urged these organs to regard their leading body as a focal point  in enhancing the organizational construction. Efforts should be  made to establish a system under which organs hold  responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in work.  He also urged them to unswervingly wage the struggle against  corruption and the campaign of encouraging administrative  honesty and to resolutely score new results in the struggle and  campaign. These organs should intensively formulate regulations  and rules in various fields and strictly enforce their work  discipline so as to meet the demands of their new functions.  They should also further emancipate minds, heighten their  spirit, and implement their work in various fields in a  down-to-earth manner.    At the meeting, Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu announced the  opinions of the provincial people's government with regard to  appraising again the staff size of working departments and the  number of the leading posts of internal organs. In his report,  the deputy secretary general of the provincial people's  government described the work plan of the guiding group in  charge of enlivening the large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises.    Attending the meeting were vice governors of the province,  including Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu, and Zhang Rongming; and  responsible comrades from various departments and units under  the provincial people's government--more than 200 persons in all.</p>

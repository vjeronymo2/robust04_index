			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- The Constitutional Court  made the right decision in complying with President Havel's  request to abolish part of Article 102 on the defamation of  parliament, the government or the Constitutional Court, Deputy  Chairman of Parliament Jan Kasal told CTK today.    By taking this step, he added, the court had showed that it  had its place in the republic's constitutional system. "That the  court decided differently from parliament I certainly do not see  as a wrong towards parliament." he said.    Kasal said he firmly believed that the defamation clause  should not have stayed in the criminal code "for all time."    Another deputy chairman of parliament, Pavel Tollner, said  that he personally welcomed the Constitutional Court's verdict.  However, he added, the provision had in practice remained  unused in the application of the criminal code.    Chairman of the Left Bloc deputies' group Jaroslav Ortman  said today's decision showed that the demands of Left Bloc  deputies during parliamentary debate of the amendment to the  criminal code were right. Left Bloc deputies had proposed that  the clauses on the defamation of the republic and its  representatives be left out.    Dalibor Matulka, formerly a Left Bloc deputy but now in the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), agreed with  Ortman, adding that he was surprised that President Vaclav Havel  had not proposed that the court abolished Article 103 as well,  which concerned the defamation of the president of the republic.    Pavel Kulicka (Liberal National and Social Party, LSNS) said  that his club welcomed the decision of the Constitutional Court,  and Rudolf Opatril, press spokesman for the Bohemian and  Moravian Centre Party (CMSS), said the same.    On November 10 last year parliament passed an amendment to  the criminal code, and voted to keep the provisions on the  defamation of the republic and its representatives in it. Havel  subsequently signed the code but proposed that the  Constitutional Court reconsider the defamation provisions.</p>

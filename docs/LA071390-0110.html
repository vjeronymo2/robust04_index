			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH DRAMA WORKSHOP IS IN JEOPARDY  </P> <P> The continuation of the Teen-Age Drama Workshop, now in its 34th summer season  at Cal State Northridge, has been placed in question by the new year-round  school policy.  </P> <P> The workshop -- which counts among its alumni performance artist Bill Irwin,  Tony Award-winning actor Michael Rupert and actress Mare Winningham -- is an  intensive eight-week program that gives students the chance to work on several  productions.  </P> <P> But next year, with traditional summer vacation greatly shortened for many  teen-agers at San Fernando Valley schools, the program may come to an end.  </P> <P> "There has been talk about quitting, but the major emphasis has been on trying  to fit in with the new schedule," said William Schlosser, who originated the  program in 1956 and although retired still acts an adviser to the 160-student  workshop.  </P> <P> "We may have to cut back the number of students we now take," he said.  </P> <P> CSUN officials said no decision has been made on the fate of the workshop.

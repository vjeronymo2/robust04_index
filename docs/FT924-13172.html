			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Observer: Base line America might be getting a new president, but in one sense its priorities remain unchanged. Candidate debates are taking a second place to this year's baseball play-offs. The first debate on Sunday was timed to be sandwiched between two games. As it happened, the first ran into an extra innings (overtime to the uninitiated), which meant that CBS never switched to the candidates at all. The vice presidential hand-to-hand combat was also broadcast early for the same reason. Last night's set-to was entirely dependent on the men in pinstriped pyjamas. If Oakland had beaten Toronto on Wednesday, forcing a deciding game last night, then the debate would have been early again. But as Toronto were the conquerors, it could go on in prime time. But here's the curiosity. Sunday's TV ratings for what was a very exciting baseball game were awful compared with the debates, not entirely explicable by the fact that one of the teams is from Canada. Maybe America really does prefer blood sports.</p>

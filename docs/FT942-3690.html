			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Major mauled by Labour surge - United Kingdom Mr John Major's government received a predictable mauling at the hands of an angry and disillusioned electorate. Britain's opposition Labour party, still choosing a new leader after the death last month of John Smith, did better than in any election for 30 years. The outcome of the poll for the European Parliament has left Britain's longer-term attitude to the European Union as uncertain as ever. Mainland Britain will send 62 Labour, 18 Conservative, two Liberal Democrat and two Scottish Nationalists MEPs to Strasbourg next month. Northern Ireland, the only part of UK to use a proportional voting system, will send two, representing the mainly-protestant Unionist community and one from the Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party. But it is the government - and the warring factions in the ruling Conservative party - which will continue to dictate the country's attitude to European integration in the run-up to the 1996 intergovernmental conference. And the Euro-sceptic tone which characterised the Conservative campaign seems to have won Mr Major votes. As in many other countries in the EU, the story of the elections in Britain was one of competing cross-currents and obvious contradictions. As the final votes were counted, Labour and the Liberal Democrats claimed the electorate had endorsed their, more positive, vision of Europe's future. But only around 35 per cent of those eligible chose to vote. Also, the opposition parties mounted campaigns against the government's domestic policies - against tax increases, public spending cuts and such like - rather than ones exalting the virtues of Europe. Mr Major focused on Europe: the central planks of his campaign were a vision of a multi-speed Union in which Britain might opt out of further integration, preservation of the national veto and scepticism about a single currency. The anecdotal evidence suggests that while the electorate was determined to punish the government, it preferred its message on Europe. So the immediate mood within the government was one of a curious sense of relief. The Conservatives recorded their worst performance on record  - the party has never before received less than 30 per cent of the vote in a national poll - but it was not quite as catastrophic as feared. Mr Major, who would have faced intense pressure to resign as prime minister had that number dropped into single figures, now looks secure at least until the autumn. He plans within a few weeks to reshape his government with a big reshuffle of cabinet portfolios. The long summer parliamentary recess will then offer him a respite from the constant carping about his leadership on the Tory backbenches. But the respite will be temporary. Labour, which won 45 per cent of the vote against the Conservatives 28 per cent, made the electoral breakthrough in affluent southern England which has so long eluded it. The next general election is at least two years off but the government is now more threatened than any time since the then Margaret Thatcher entered 10 Downing Street in 1979. Mr Major's party is still deeply divided also over Europe, Even before all the votes had been counted, the irreconciliable sceptics among Tory MPs at Westminster were calling for a still more nationalist stance. They want the prime minister to veto at the Corfu summit next week the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next president of the European Commission. But their demands were matched by equally strident calls from the mainstream centre-left of the party for the government to abandon its appeasement of the sceptics.  ------------------------------------------- Population: 58.0m Seats: 87  ------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 36.4%; 1989, 36.2%)  ------------------------------------------- Party*      Parliament    % vote      Seats               group     '94   '89  '94   '89  ------------------------------------------- Lab           PES      44.2   40.1  62    45 Con           EPP      27.8   34.1  18    32 LD            LDR      16.7      -   2     - SNP           RBW       3.2    2.7   2     1 SDLP          PES         -    0.9   1     1 OUP           EPP         -    0.8   1     1 DUP            NA         -    1.0   1     1  ------------------------------------------- Source: BBC  ------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: Con = Conservatives; DUP = Democratic Ulster Unionists; Lab = Labour; LD=Liberal Democrats; OUP = Official Ulster Unionist; SDLP = Social Democrat and Labour party; SNP = Scottish Nationalist party Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ------------------------------------------- First-past-post in GB; single transferable vote in N.

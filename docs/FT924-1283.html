			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD held above Dollars 338 a troy ounce on the London bullion market as option-writers battled to defend positions. 'A lot of Dollars 340 calls are written for the year's end. Therefore if we break above Dollars 340 a lot of people would be forced to cover their short positions on options,' one dealer said. Players defending their positions were selling to keep the price down. Two big US commission houses might be forced to cover large short positions if the price rises. A break above Dollars 340 was seen, taking gold to Dollars 342 and possibly Dollars 344 to Dollars 345. On the LME trading in base metals was mostly routine as the market wound down in interest ahead of the holiday season. Three-month COPPER was effectively stalled below Dollars 2,230 a tonne; three-month ALUMINIUM'S attempt to test overhead resistance above Dollars 1,250 a tonne ran out of steam; and ZINC failed to follow through Wednesday's gains. In Chicago WHEAT was mostly lower by midday on commercial house selling after Russia missed another payment. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting for OSM's approval the following proposed regulatory amendment to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever a corporate permittee violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 [statutory requirements addressing coal exploration] or any permit condition or rule or other regulation implemented thereunder, a director, officer or agent of the corporate permittee who knowingly causes such violation is subject to the criminal penalties imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(2). ``Knowingly'' is to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02. In addition, whenever a director, officer, or agent of a corporate permittee willfully or negligently violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 or any permit condition or rule or regulation implemented thereunder, civil penalties may be imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1). ``Willfully'' and ``negligently'' are to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota's proposed regulatory change addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. However, the proposed regulatory change does not address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> civil <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to the extent that it specifically addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. However, the Director is requiring North Dakota to further amend NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, because North Dakota's proposed statutory revisions do not address when a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 remains deficient. Therefore, the Director is not approving NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Nature of Violations That Subject Individuals to Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the November 12, 1993, letter, OSM notified North Dakota that NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1) would subject an individual to civil penalties for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  violation and would subject individuals to criminal penalties for any violation committed ``knowingly.'' In contrast, section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects a corporate director, officer, or agent to penalties only when that individual ``willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out'' the act or omission that constitutes the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, OSM noted that because proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 would subject individuals to civil and criminal penalties for a wider, more inclusive, range of actions or omissions than are covered by SMCRA 518(f), it would be more stringent than SMCRA. However, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding these provisions and reaffirm that these provisions did not conflict with other State law requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1) above, by letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting for OSM's approval proposed regulatory amendments to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05. Those proposed regulatory amendments provide for criminal penalties in connection with violations committed ``knowingly'' and civil penalties in connection with violations committed either ``willfully'' or ``negligently.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> North Dakota also attached a copy of the cross-referenced definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently'' at section 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 of the North Dakota Criminal Code. In accordance with that provision, a person engages in conduct: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. ``Intentionally'' if, when he engages in the conduct, it is his purpose to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. ``Knowingly'' if, when he engages in the conduct, he knows or has a firm belief, unaccompanied by substantial doubt, that he is doing so, whether or not it is his purpose to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

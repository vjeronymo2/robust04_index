			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai discussed enhancing  bilateral relations, promoting cooperation for Asia-Pacific  development and current affairs in the region, including the  nuclear dispute with North Korea, in a meeting at Chongwadae  [presidential offices] Friday morning.    Kim, stressing the need to settle the North Korean nuclear  row for Asia-Pacific peace and security, explained to Chuan the  projected inter-Korean summit on the nuclear and other issues.    He requested that Thailand make additional tariff cuts and  offer more cooperation in Korea's corporate investment in the  Thai construction and communications industries, as well as its  support for Seoul's bids to become a non-permanent U.N. Security  Council member and to elect a Korean as World Trade Organization  (WTO) secretary-general.    Chuan, supporting Kim's efforts to make the Korean peninsula  free of nuclear arms, expressed hope for increased economic  cooperation between the two countries.    He said he would positively consider creating an investment  climate that favors Korean companies advancing into his country.</p>

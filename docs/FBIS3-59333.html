			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Huang Rutong (7806 1172 2717): "Discussion on </F> Past and Current Private, Public Ownership in  China--Consultations With Comrade Yu Guangyuan"]    [Text] "A Very Big Subject, A Very Short Article--Past and  Current Private and Public Ownership in China," a written form  of speech by Comrade Yu Guangyuan (abbreviated hereafter as Yu's  article), was printed and circulated in early June 1993 at an  inaugural meeting for the Chinese Society of Private Economy.  After the meeting, it was published by ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO  in June, and JINGJI RIBAO in August. Proceeding from the  presupposition that the issue of public and private ownership is  the theoretical basis for the private economy of China, Yu's  article briefly analyzes the coexistent situation of public and  private property in the history of human society and brings up  some new views and ideas. I disagree with some of the viewpoints  in Yu's article due to our differences in viewing the history of  the founding of the Chinese socialist system and the current  situation of the socialist society, in understanding and  applying the tenets of Marxism and the theory of building  Chinese-style socialism, and in interpreting the party's  principles and policies. Pursuant to the "double hundred policy"  of the party, I will present some of my opinions on the  following issues and submit them to Comrade Yu Guangyuan for  discussions.  <H3>  I. Is Private Ownership an Intrinsic Quality of a Capitalist  Society? </H3>   Yu's article states: "Whether or not private ownership is an  intrinsic quality of a capitalist society, like whether or not  public ownership is an intrinsic quality of a socialist society,  is a question that needs to be studied." Then, Yu's article  quotes a paragraph from the "Critique of the Draft Program of  the Socialist Democratic Party in 1891," which was published by  Engels between 1901 and 1902: "As far as I know, capitalist  production is a form of society and a stage of the economy,  while capitalist private production is a phenomenon of one kind  or another within this stage. But what is exactly capitalist  private production? It is production managed by individual  entrepreneurs. This kind of production has become more and more  of an exception. Capitalist production managed by a corporation  is no longer private production. Instead, it is production aimed  to make profits for a group of people. If we look at the trust  which controls and monopolizes the entire industry from the  viewpoint of the corporation, we will know that not ony private  production has ceased but...." By quoting this paragraph, Yu's  article implies that after the emergence of social organizations  like corporation and trust, capitalist production ceased to be  private production. Because of this, private ownership is not  necessarily the intrinsic quality of capitalist society and  production.    If I have not misunderstood the original meaning of this  paragraph, then I cannot agree with the point of Yu's article  which doubts that private ownership is the intrinsic quality of  capitalist society. There are mainly two reasons:    1. Yu's article quotes the above paragraph of Engels out of  context. Regarding the fourth paragraph in the introduction to  the abovementioned draft program--"the lack of planning derived  from the intrinsic quality of capitalist private  production"--Engels' critique is that the word "private,' should  be deleted (Volume 22 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels,  page 270). Engels' reason is the same as the quote in Yu's  article. This shows that according to Engels' viewpoint,  capitalist production includes not only the capitalist  production of individual enterprises but also the production of  corporation and trust aimed to make profits for a group of  people. Undoubtedly, the statement of Engels, after deleting the  word "private,' is a more comprehensive and accurate depiction  of the intrinsic quality of capitalist production.    Therefore, is it okay to draw the conclusion that the  intrinsic quality of capitalist society is not necessarily  private ownership from the abovementioned Engels' statement on  the coexistence of individual enterprises and corporations? No,  it is not. This is because Engels also clearly points out, when  he critiques the sixth paragraph in the introduction of the  draft program: "Material and ideological conditions needed to  change capitalist production, which benefits individuals or  corporations, to socialist production, which benefits society as  a whole and is carried out according to advanced planning, are  created precisely by capitalist society itself. Only through  such a change can the working class, and still further, all  members of society without exception, be liberated" (Volume 22  of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels, page 279). This means  that neither individual capitalist enterprises, nor corporations  run by a group of capitalists, is engaged in socialist  production that benefits society as a whole. Instead, they are  engaged in capitalist production that benefits the bourgeoisie  and is based on the capitalist private ownership of capital  goods. What Engels stresses here is exactly the private quality  intrinsic in the production of contemporary capitalism.    According to Marxist theory on the forms of social economy,  capitalist society is the last society in human history where  man exploits man. It is a society where the form of capitalist  production occupies a dominant position, the capitalist private  ownership of capital goods is the basis, and the objective is  for the bourgeoisie to exploit the surplus value of hired labor.  Marx said that the production of surplus value "is the direct  objective and decisive motivation of capitalist production" and  that "it must not be depicted as something it is not. In other  words, we must never describe it as having the direct objective  of enjoyment or producing goods of enjoyment for capitalists. If  so, we will fail completely to see the salient feature in the  entire intrinsic quality of such production." (Volume 25 of the  Complete Works of Marx and Engels," page 272). This means that  the essence of capitalist production is production of surplus  value, whereas the precondition for the production of surplus  value is the capitalist private ownership of capital goods.  Because of this, we should say that private ownership is the  intrinsic quality of a capitalist society.  <H3>  II. In the History of Socialist Nations, Why Hasn't Private  Property Been Eliminated? </H3>   Yu's article states: "There has been only a vain hope of  eliminating as soon as possible private property, in the history  of socialist nations. There has been no evidence that private  property has been eliminated." What kind of private property or  ownership does the word, "private property," refer to here? This  has to be clarified first.    Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Manifesto of the  Communist Party": "The salient feature of communism is not to  abolish general ownership. it is to abolish the ownership system  of bourgeoisie"; communism "wants to eliminate the ownership  which is preconditioned by the fact that the overwhelming  majority of people in society do not own property"; and  "communism does not deprive anyone of the right to own social  products, it only takes away the right of using such ownership  to enslave other people's labor." (Volume 1 of the Complete  Works of Marx and Engels, pages 265 and 267). This means that  the private property or ownership that socialism wants to  eliminate is only the capitalist ownership system that uses the  ownership of capital goods to exploit the surplus value created  by hired laborers or the portion of bourgeois private property  that belongs to the category of capital goods, not consumer  goods owned and controlled by individuals in a capitalist  society.    According to the above theories of Marx and Engels, whether  or not the conclusion of Yu's article is correct should be  obvious. In light of China's history, under the leadership of  the Chinese Communist Party and through many years of struggle,  the people of all nationalities in China reaped victory in the  new democratic revolution, confiscated bureaucrat capital, and  eliminated the bureaucrat-capitalist class (which will never be  revived). Through the basic completion of socialist  transformation of capitalist industry and trade in 1956, they  further eliminated the capitalist exploitation system and the  bourgeoisie, established a socialist system, and entered into a  socialist society. Namely, China fulfilled the task of  eliminating the private property of the bourgeoisie that  exploits surplus value or the bourgeois system of private  ownership of capital goods, which was the demand of Marxism. The  reason that China had failed to fully develop socialist  superiority after it established a basic socialist system is  that the party committed "leftist" errors on the two major  issues of how to build socialism and how to handle class  struggle. It must not be blamed on the "so-called vain hope of  the party and the state to eliminate as soon as possible private  property," thus inadvertently playing down the great  significance of establishing the socialist system in China. Like  Comrade Deng Xiaopong pointed out: "Through many years of bloody  struggle, our party and people established the socialist system.  Although this socialist system is not yet complete and it has  been undermined, it is after all much better than the capitalist  system under which the weak are the prey of the strong and  people harm others to benefit themselves. Our system will  improve as each day goes by. It will absorb all progressive  factors which we absorb from other nations and become the best  system in the world." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping on  the Theory of Building Chinese-Style Socialism, page 142).    Perhaps someone will ask: If the socialist transformation of  capitalist industry and trade was basically completed in 1956  and the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie have  been eliminated, then why do we want to develop the private  economy that has the nature of capitalism? Doesn't this prove  that the conclusion of Yu's article is correct? My answer to  this question is as follows:    In 1956, around the time of the Eighth Party Congress, after  socialist transformation was basically completed and China's  socialist system was established, central leading comrades such  as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Chen Yun, in view of  the problems arising in the socialist transformation of  captialist industry and trade and of drawbacks of China's  economic system created by the joint management of public and  private industries, put forth a series of new theoretical  viewpoints and corresponding principles and policies, on the  basis of combining theory and practice. At the Eighth Party  Congress, Comrade Chen Yun brought up the principle and policy  of "three main bodies and three supplements." At the 52nd  Standing Committee Meeting of the National People's Congress on  29 December 1956, Comrade Liu Shaoqi introduced the new thinking  that "China is over 90 percent socialist. We should not be  afraid to have a small percentage of capitalism as supplement  and comparison." (See article by Hu Qiaomu 5170 0829 2606: "How  Did China Choose Socialism in the 1950's," 3 October 89, RENMIN  RIBAO) During his talks with responsible persons of the National  Industrial and Commercial Association on 5, 7, and 8 December  1956, Chairman Mao brought up the new idea of "practicing  capitalism after eliminating capitalism." He said: "The  underground factories of Shanghai and joint ventures are also  antithesis"; "To legalize them, we may hire workers"; "We may  run privately-owned large factories, sign contracts, and promise  that they will not be confiscated in the next 10 or 20 years.  Overseas investment should not be confiscated for 20 or 100  years." "We can practice state and private ownership." "We can  practice capitalism after eliminating it." (Bo Yibo 5631 0001  3134: "Review of Several Major Decisions and Events," Volume I,  pages 433 and 434) Of course, by saying "practicing capitalism  again," here Chairman Mao did not mean developing capitalism  extensively and reestablishing the social system of capitalism.  Instead, he meant that with regard to ownership structure, we  should appropriately preserve and develop some private and  individual economies and bring in overseas Chinese investment  under the prerequisite that state and collective economies  occupy the dominant position. By doing so, we can provide an  "antithesis" for state and collective economies and preserve a  certain amount of competitive mechanism. These new ideas of  Chairman Mao revealed, in the ownership structure, a valuable  spark of ideology concerning the socialist economy with Chinese  characteristics.    Unfortunately, these valuable special ideas and policies  regarding the building of Chinese-style socialism were not put  into effect. They were later interrupted by erroneous leftist  policies. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, after bringing order out of chaos, the party  and the state, under the guidance of the theory of building  Chinese-style socialism and the basic party line, implemented a  structure of ownership system under which socialist public  ownership is dominant, other economic factors are supplementary,  and multiple economic factors coexist. This is the carrying on  and development of the new ideas and policies put forth by  central leading comrades before and after the Eighth Party  Congress. In addition, the reform we are currently carrying out  is not to "change the nature of our socialist system. It is  self-improvement and development of a socialist system." Because  of this, I think that the victory of new democratic revolution  and the success of the 1956 socialist transformation enabled  China to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system and the  bourgeoisie. This is a historical fact proving that the  socialist nation has eliminated the private property of the  bourgeois class. Allowing and encouraging the development of the  private economy in the current stage is precisely using the  private economy to develop social productive forces after  "achieving success in the revolution," thereby creating  conditions for ultimately eliminating the exploitation  phenomenon and transferring to a higher level of socialism.  These two are not contradicting or opposed to each other. Yu's  article states: "There have been vain hopes, but no evidence of  eliminating as soon as possible private property." I think that  these are only lies of Yu's article, not historical facts."  <H5>  III. What Are the Characteristics of a Socialist Society? </H5>   Yu's article states: "General public property is not a  special feature of a socialist society. All societies in history  have public property." This is another issue that needs to be  clarified.    It is true that all societies in history have public  property. But in a slave, feudal, or capitalist society, public  property belongs to, serves, and benefits a few people of the  exploiting class. It does not belong to, serve, or benefit all  members of society. Take the state property of a bourgeois  nation for instance. It does not have the "capital property of  eliminating productive forces." The more "productive forces a  bourgeois nation occupies, the more likely that it will become a  general capitalist who will exploit even more of its citizens.  Workers will remain hired laborers and the proletariat. Instead  of eliminating capital relations, it will be pushed to the  extreme." (The Selected Works of Marx and Engels,  Volume III, page 436) Because of this, bourgeois national public  property which is used as a tool for the dictatorship of the  bourgeoisie does not deserve its name. It is in essence the  private property of a few people of the bourgeoisie. On the  contrary, in a socialist society, public property is owned by  all members of society and it serves and benefits all members of  society. Here, public property is public property both in name  and reality. This is the fundamental difference between a  socialist and capitalist society. Engels said: "The decisive  difference between the socialist system and the current existing  system is, of course, organizing production on the basis that  all capital goods are owned publicly (first in individual  nations)." (The Complete Works of Marx and Engels,  Volume 37, page 443). Because of this, eliminating the private  ownership and establishing the public ownership system of  capital goods, namely establishing genuine public property owned  by society as a whole, are the characteristics of a socialist  society.  <H5>  IV. Why Do We Need To Advocate "Sacred Private Property"? </H5>   Yu's article states: "Only by regarding both public and  private property as sacred can socialist society survive and  progress." This concept needs studying. We all know that the  Constitution of China stipulates: "The public property of  socialism is sacred and inviolable." This is completely correct  because China is a socialist country whose economic basis is a  socialist public ownership system. Therefore, is it necessary to  consider the private property of private economy with capitalist  nature in China as sacred? My answer is negative. The reasons  are as follows:    1. In Das Kapital and the Manifesto of the Communist Party,  Marx set forth the historical mission of "exploiting the  exploiter" and "eliminating the bourgeois ownership system." The  ultimate goal of communists is to eventually reach communist  society via socialist society. In China, a socialist society  where the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie  have been eliminated, it is very strange for someone to advocate  "private property being sacred," which is similar to that  advocated by the foreign bourgeoisie during the period of  bourgeois revolution, in order to exercise their control.    2. Although the ultimate goal of Marxism is to arrive at a  communist society via socialism, it has been clearly pointed out  at the same time that communists cannot abolish private  ownership overnight, that socialist countries can only gradually  transform existing society, and that only after producing the  large amount of capital goods needed to abolish the private  ownership system can the private ownership system be thoroughly  eliminated.    After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, our party, following the tenets of Marxism on  gradually eliminating private ownership, set forth the basic  line of "one center, two basic points" and the structure of an  ownership system under which the socialist public ownership  system dominates, non-public ownership economy supplements, and  multiple economic factors develop simultaneously for a long  period of time. Our party also put forward the policy of  allowing and encouraging the development of the private economy  to achieve the goal of developing the socialist economy,  increasing social productive forces, and creating material goods  needed to enter into a high level of socialist society. Then,  under this situation and condition, is it necessary to advocate  "private property being sacred" to raise the enthusiasm of  private entrepreneurs for investing in and managing the private  economy and for serving socialist modernization? I think it is  not necessary because the Constitution of China stipulates: "The  state protects the ownership of lawful income, savings, housing,  and other legal property of citizens"; and "the state protects  the right of inheritance of citizens according to law." The  temporary provisions of private enterprises further stipulates  in concrete terms: "The assets of private enterprises belong to  private individuals" and the "state protects the lawful rights  and interests of private enterprises." All these laws and  regulations are sufficient to protect the private property of a  private economy from harm. There is no need to use the  stipulation of "private property being sacred" used in foreign  bourgeois laws to replace the Constitution and law of our  socialist country. As for the concept that only by regarding  "private property as sacred can socialist society survive and  progress," it is even more impossible to find out what this  means.</p>

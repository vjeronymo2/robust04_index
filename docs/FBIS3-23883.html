			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov under the rubric "Political </F> Commentary": "The President Has Spoken. What Can Russian  Citizens Expect?"]    [Text] After that memorable Thursday when President Boris  Yeltsin spoke in the Federal Assembly, an awkward pause ensued  in the political life of Russian citizens. The press and the  public suddenly switched to comments on, or rather criticism of,  the State Duma decree on political amnesty for the prisoners of  "Sailor's Rest" and "Lefortovo" and the sudden removal of the  General Procurator of the Russian Federation from his post.  Hysteria again sounded over the impending civil war and a  repetition of the tragedy of 1 May 1993.    Seemingly overshadowed by these idle lamentations was a  sober  and detailed analysis of the President's Message and his "role  in the fate of the future Russia." The latter sounds somewhat  stilted, but it is customary to the philistine's ears. "For the  first time Russia has received a concrete program of  development." "The Message contains quite a powerful charge."  The authors of such assessments are as a rule people from the  president's circle who directly or indirectly participated in  preparing the February theses "On Strengthening the Russian  State" (A. Yakovlev, Yu. Baturin, and G. Satarov).    We who have already heard a considerable number of  perestroyka speeches in recent years are already familiar with  the "epoch-making syndrome." And for that reason we do not  immediately take everything on faith. But if we are talking  specifically about the Message, generally speaking I would treat  it in a somewhat more restrained manner. Roughly the same as  Academician L. Abalkin, chairman of the State Duma Committee on  International Affairs V. Lukin, and many others who called the  Message a "calculated political statement."    Perhaps the strongest thing in the Message is that "true  economic focuses weighing on the general political situation in  society" are finally put in place. The analysis is harsh and  merciless and contains criticism of the hard blows and lack of  careful thought and of the radical, monetarist methods of  becoming a market economy.    Self-criticism and frank admission of his own guilt are  lacking in this bitter presidential analysis, it seems to me. B.  N. Yeltsin's complaint regarding growing national poverty and  the "rapid social stratification of society," for example, left  a painful and at the same time discouraging impression on many  people I have talked with recently. The authorities in the  center and local ones, don't you see, seem not to notice this!  But was it really not clear before what this "all-economic  freedom of the market" and the creation of the free owner at any  cost and at a Stalinist pace would become?    Exactly the same methods were used during the destatization  of the economy ("Let us smash the monster!") and  decollectivization ("Give us 100,000 private farmers and we will  turn Russia around!"). They smashed it and they turned Russia  around... But what have they created? So far not much. As the  Message emphasizes, "There is more freedom in our country," and  more and more Russian citizens are alas suffering from it.    Although the president's address does not provide answers to  many fundamental questions, there are a considerable number of  new revelations and revealing statements in it: "The previous  variant of the reforms has exhausted itself," "Optimal methods  for the state to participate in economic processes are needed,"  "The `survival of the fittest' principle is destructive." Has  the ice begun to break? We shall see.    The points in the chapters "The Law-Governed State" and "The  Individual in a Democratic State" seem attractive and generally  do not arouse any objection. Or I should say their leitmotif  seems so: "Toward strengthening of statehood and civil peace and  accord, as well as rejection of the practice of senseless  confrontation in society."    True, just words. Unfortunately, they have frequently been  pronounced in recent times both from behind the Kremlin walls  and from the parliamentary rostrum. And heated political storms  have at times followed them. But all the same, the hope remains  that they will not become stale and lose their original meaning.</p>

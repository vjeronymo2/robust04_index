			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Rabar, economic expert of the </F> Christian Democratic People's Party and former finance minister,  by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The  Tax System Is a Tool of Income Policy -- Ferenc Rabar on  Handling the Budget Deficit"]    [Text] [Correspondent] The budget deficit started to  increase drastically after you left the Finance Ministry and  today this is one of the biggest problems of the economy. What  does the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] see as the  reasons for this?    [Rabar] There seems to be a general agreement that the  budget deficit is a result of lost revenue. Is this due to the  very little revenue-producing ability of the Hungarian economy  or the absence of taxes from the gray and black economy? The  recipes for remedying the problems are obvious: Incomes in the  economy must be increased, and in the other case, the collection  of taxes must be made stricter. The latter would only be useful  if the tax system were changed such a way that would make it  worthwhile for the entrepreneurs to come out into the open  economy.    [Correspondent] It seems that the KDNP, like the Federation  of Young Democrats [Fidesz], does not advocate the immediate  reduction of the budget deficit.    [Rabar] We must temporarily put up with the existence of a  budget deficit. The current level is obviously too high and  cannot be maintained in the long run. However, we have to get  out of the vicious circle that there is no income, which in turn  increases the budget deficit, so we increase taxes to finance  the deficit, and this further reduces the income of the actors  in the economy. This can only be broken if we put up with a  high budget deficit for a while. However, I would emphasize  that the economy can only bear this budget deficit temporarily  and to a certain degree.    [Correspondent] How would you resolve the financing of the  deficit?    [Rabar] The deficit can be financed either from domestic or  foreign sources. The latter results in upsetting the balance of  payments and the economy can also only tolerate this for a  limited period of time. However, the current level of foreign  currency reserves makes it possible to finance the external  deficit. This would give some breathing space to the Hungarian  economy and, in the meantime, measures can be used to boost the  market. To achieve this, it is vitally important to stimulate  savings and investment on the supply side, which can mainly be  done through high real interest rates. This has been the  practice up to now because the government has tried to keep  interest rates high. Savings have increased in recent years but  these resources did not reenter the economy. On the supply  side, we also need to have an aggressive policy to boost exports.    Tax reductions are the most effective way of encouraging  investment but this would again result in a temporary growth of  the budget deficit. However, when the economy begins to grow,  then the tax revenue will also increase. Some kind of interest  rate support could be another way of encouraging investment.  This means that all or part of the interest on loans taken on  for investment is paid by the state.    [Correspondent] On the demand side, what kind of measures  would you introduce to boost the economy?    [Rabar] We would try to increase the purchasing power of  those groups of society whose consumption habits do not create  too much inflation and do not increase imports. I am mainly  thinking of food consumption, which accounts for a large section  of spending among the lower income group. Increased food  purchases can certainly be satisfied from domestic production;  therefore, the increased income of pensioners and large families  can have positive effects on the economy.    [Correspondent] How, through what measures would you  increase the income of these groups in society?    [Rabar] It would mainly be worthwhile changing the tax  system. We would keep the two-tier value added tax system but we  would change the products in preferential categories. This way,  we would end up with a price structure that favors products  consumed by people on low incomes. It is also possible that  after the initial regrouping, parallel to the improved economic  situation, we would also reduce the tax level to a certain  extent.    [Correspondent] To what extent would you change the  structure of personal taxation?    [Rabar] Personal taxation should be made a direct tool of  income policy. The burden on people with lower incomes should  definitely be reduced, but I would not like to talk about  further changes because we will have to consider the  consequences of the changes very carefully.    [Correspondent] We have not yet mentioned entrepreneurs.  What does the KDNP promise them? I recall that the  entrepreneurs complain mainly about high wage costs.    [Rabar] We want mainly to lay emphasis on new small and  medium-sized enterprises and to encourage the inflow of foreign  capital. I agree that social security contributions are high.  The stimulation of enterprises is closely linked to the inflow  of capital. It is not so certain that the areas where wages are  low are more attractive for foreign capital. On the other hand,  the structure of incoming capital has to be closely examined.  This would show that most of the incoming capital is seeking  markets here, rather than investing to create markets or to  bring in technology. This means, that, in the long run, Western  capital is hoping for markets.</p>

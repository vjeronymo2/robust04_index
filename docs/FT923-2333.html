			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Probe into Iran-contra scandal over US SPECIAL prosecutor Lawrence Walsh announced yesterday the end of his long criminal investigation of the Iran-contra scandal, which rocked the Reagan presidency and is still causing political problems for President George Bush, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Walsh, in letters to the special court that appointed him nearly six years ago and to Attorney-General William Barr, said no more criminal charges were expected. Mr Walsh investigated the White House-run operation to sell arms to Iran in 1985-86, in an attempt to win the release of US hostages in Lebanon. The other part of the covert operation involved diverting profits from the Iran arms sales to provide weapons to the Nicaraguan contra rebels while US military aid to them was outlawed by Congress.</p>

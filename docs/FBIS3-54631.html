			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Condition for Future Pakistan-India Talks"] </F>   [Text] Pakistan has proposed to India that the next round  of bilateral talks should be held to fix the modalities for  holding a plebiscite in occupied Kashmir. Besides, India should  take definite steps in occupied Kashmir to create a conducive  atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute.  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Indian High  Commissioner S.K. Lambha to the Foreign Office and handed to him  the Pakistani proposals, which are aimed at focussing attention  on the vital issues concerning the Kashmir dispute and giving  the talks a meaningful and purposeful direction. Pakistan has  asked India to give a response to these proposals and said that  only after receiving its reply can arrangements be made for the  next round of bilateral talks on the peaceful resolution of the  dispute. If India stops its atrocities in occupied Kashmir and  gives its consent to providing an opportunity to the people for  an impartial plebiscite on the future of Kashmir, talks could be  resumed by the end of the year. According to the BBC, Foreign  Secretary Shaharyar Khan did not describe these proposals as a  condition for the talks. But, if India totally rejects them, it  will be proved that India does not want to remove the  differences. On finding out the views of the Kashmiri people,  India had said there might be some consensus on certain issues.  According to BBC, the political intricacies between the two  countries are quite delicate. But, even this small step [of  holding plebiscite in Kashmir] will also be in the right  direction. The peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue depends  upon the referendum of the Kashmiri people. If India comes  forward to fix modalities for this referendum and, along with  it, halt the atrocities in occupied Kashmir as a mark of  goodwill, it might create an atmosphere for the resumption of  meaningful talks.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Maladies at the heart of the body politic: Jurek Martin keeps a doctor's appointment A political doctor responds to a patient's questions. Q: Doctor, where are we now on the American presidential election? A: Where we are is that George Bush will be the Republican nominee, Bill Clinton the Democratic nominee and Ross Perot will probably run as an independent. That is the only safe clinical observation to make. Previous diagnoses suggesting an internal eruption of the Democratic party emanating from the capital of New York state or outer space may now be discarded. Does this competition imply health in the body politic? The body politic is not healthy. How could it be with trillions of dollars' debt, Dollars 400bn of deficits, the second-largest city in flames, and the great Red corpuscle threat now into convertible roubles? Is President Bush himself as healthy as he was after his operation in the desert last year? Obviously not; the domestic climate does not suit him and the global warming of the cold war takes him out of his element. His planned trip to Rio de Janeiro next month should carry a severe health warning and his cure in the economic waters of Munich in July offers no panacea. The president is suffering from a severe case of political dyslexia, unable to translate what he reads and thinks into action, or possibly vice versa. I am not saying it is terminal but the prognosis must be very guarded. I recommend external electric shock treatment, say an invasion of Peru, which would have the double dose of saving democracy and bashing a Japanese (President Fujimori) in one fell stroke. What do the White House physicians say? They speak with many tongues, which is part of the problem. Doctors Quayle and Fitzwater keep reminding him to stay with the course of conservative prescriptions which worked well for him in the 1980s. Dr Kemp wants a more radical approach and now has him visiting clinics in most cities in the country. Drs Baker and Cheney, experts in tropical medicine, seem to have been taken off the case. What about Governor Clinton? I thought his case was terminal. He is still not well. All the early spring maladies are still coursing around his system. He has a good mind and a strong constitution, which primary micro-surgery has improved, but he could easily catch another severe bout of the ague. Republican researchers, specialists in Horton's disease, are confident they can unearth further viral complications, but it is not clear if these will be fatal. Mr Perot seems pretty vigorous these days. Is this attributable to the Texas air? Possibly. His health owes much to not living in Washington which is notoriously claustrophobic (the politico-medical term is Beltway Bursitis which afflicts the body's moving parts when decisions have to be taken). Normally, phenomena like Mr Perot are ephemeral, particularly if, as in his case, close investigation, using the latest media probes, reveals skeletons (Nixon and North) rattling round inside. But his ability to buy the best medical care available, regardless of the cost, could bring a degree of longer-lasting immunity, as could his refusal to answer questions about the specific nature of his complaints. Is there a universal medicine which could help all of them? A very difficult question; what is needed is a cure for disaffectitis. Classically the best results can be achieved through an accommodating media, without which it is impossible to understand what the candidates are saying or complaining about. However, all diagnosis in this medium must last no longer than 10 seconds, unless it be about the Northern Spotted Owl, which is not running for anything except possibly from chainsaws. Picking up from that, would you say that politicians themselves are an endangered species? Well, they certainly must be very careful these days. The body of Congress is losing healthy members by the dozen - some to talk show programmes where they think they have more influence. What about amendments to the constitution? They have been useful in the past, haven't they? Sometimes; certainly it was thought prohibition would make the body politic less paralytic. Just last week the states ratified a 200-year-old amendment stopping Congress giving itself pay raises and Congress itself is about to pass an amendment prohibiting the federal government from spending more than it takes in. However, money, like alcohol, is a narcotic from which there is no easy withdrawal, which explains why I am charging you Dollars 500 an hour for this consultation, claimable, of course, on your medical insurance policy. I had better stop then. What is your prognosis for this election? A political doctor, when not spinning, can only stick to the facts. The only medical certainty this year is that all three presidential candidates will be left-handed. This is unprecedented. Can you wonder the country is disturbed?</p>

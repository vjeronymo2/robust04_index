It must solve the conflict in a comprehensive  manner rather than merely rescuing Sarajevo, which is only part  of the conflict. Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur today,  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the United Nations  must find a fair, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the  conflict. It must also lift the arms embargo against Bosnia to  enable Bosnian people to defend themselves.    The minister was commenting on an upcoming UN Security  Council meeting on Bosnia, scheduled for this week. He  described the NATO threat to launch air strikes against Serbian  positions as a positive step. Sarajevo is not the only target  of continued bombardments by Serbian terrorists; other cities  are also under similar attack. Bosnia-Herzegovina is no longer a  minor case for Europe, but an international issue involving  human rights, democracy, and the right to exist as a sovereign  state.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Small May Be Dispensed With"] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Manmohan Singh has kept his word!  He had promised to continue "the process of lowering (excise)  rates when they become unduly high"; it appears prominently on  the budget giveaways that had accounted for a respectable Rs.  2000 [rupees] crore. What was overlooked was the fine print that  the budget has reduced "the number of special exemption  notifications by about half." It now appears that most of the  383 notifications rescinding exemptions relate to small-scale  units. Manmohan Singh had stressed, at least twice that the  budget was going all out to fulfil "major" and "persistent"  demands of small-scale industry. This assurance seems to have  gone by the wayside. He has little time for the problems of the  unglamorous common man.    The duty payable by small units producing steel utensils,  rubber chappals [sandals], canvas shoes, or paper boards from  bagasse goes up from nil to 15 percent ad valorem. That the net  tax is covered by a special plan called Modavat is no  consolation. The small producers have to coax suppliers of  inputs to issue receipts, a difficult task in a climate of  rampant sales-tax evasion. Duty discounts will not be easy to  claim. In truth, often nonpayment of sales tax on inputs is what  becomes the survival margin of small producers. Maintaining  books of accounts to the satisfaction of excise inspectors with  itchy palms, can be costly, if not cumbersome. Under the  exemption regime, it is also superfluous.    There is a puzzling contrariness in the new excise strategy.  Excise has been raised from 15 percent in 1993-94 to a stiff 20  percent on small-scale registered production while the  unregistered units with a clearance value of up to Rs. 7,500,000  have been excused, thus encouraging benami [illegal] whales in  the business to acquire their ownership.</p>

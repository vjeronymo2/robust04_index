			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M.W.: "Rationales and Emotions; Poland and </F> Lithuania Intend To Initial a Treaty Friday"]    [Text] President of the Polish Republic Lech Walesa  had a telephone conversation yesterday with Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas, the Belweder's Press Office reported. Both  presidents confirmed their will to have the foreign ministers of  both countries initial a treaty on neighborly relations. This  signing ceremony is to take place on Friday [18 March], during a  visit to Poland by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas  Gylys.    President Brazauskas invited Lech Walesa to pay an official  visit to Lithuania, and the invitation was accepted.    Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister, said in  a statement to THE BALTIC OBSERVER, which is published in Riga,  that a condemnation of Polish history in the treaty would be  absolutely unacceptable to Poland, and that is why a compromise  had to be worked out. In Januska's view, Poland is one of  Lithuania's most important partners, as well as Lithuania's  "door" to Europe. The treaty between the two countries will  allow for a free-trade treaty to be signed. After the treaty  with Poland is finalized, Lithuania will be able to concentrate  its attention on negotiations with Belarus and Russia.    But a newly established Social Committee for the  Lithuanian-Polish Treaty, which was set up in Vilnius, organized  a picketing at the Foreign Affairs Ministry building there,  during which the committee demanded that the treaty's contents  be made public and that Polish occupation of the Vilnius area be  condemned. The committee announced another picketing shortly  thereafter in front of the Sejm building, which is at the same  time the president's headquarters.</p>

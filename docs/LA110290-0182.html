			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BRANDO DAUGHTER OUT OF COMA  </P> <P> Actor Marlon Brando's daughter was reported to be recovering from the  drug-induced coma that sent her to a Tahitian hospital Thursday. Cheyenne  Brando, 20, had overdosed on tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs, according  to a family source, and her father was to have left Los Angeles this morning to  join her.  </P> <P> Brando's son, Christian, goes on trial here Monday in the murder of Cheyenne's  Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet.  </P> <P> As a key witness in the case, Cheyenne has been the object of a legal  tug-of-war between prosecutors in California and in Tahiti, where she has been  charged with complicity in Drollet's death. Drollet's father, Jacques, said  today that he was told the young woman, who gave birth to Drollet's child in  June, was out of her coma. He said he believed her act was the suicide attempt  of a "perturbed" young woman.  </P></p>

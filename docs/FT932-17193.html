			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (21): Analysts urge more liberalisation - Paul Adams assesses progress and setbacks in the agricultural sector SINCE 1986 the structural adjustment programme (SAP) has started to provide practical help and better prices to the small-scale farmers who make up most of the rural population and account for 90 per cent of agricultural production. Devaluation of the naira has strengthened exports and reduced the competitiveness of certain imports, while progress has been made in the production of staple and cash crops. Parastatals no longer control the marketing of farm output. Nigeria remains, however, a large net importer of food, according to the latest official figures. Imports in 1990 cost nearly Dollars 436m while exports during 1990/91 season earned N2.28bn. More seriously for the farmer, SAP has not prevented costs overtaking revenues. A study by a Nigerian consultancy shows that agricultural input costs have risen faster than output prices. Devaluation has been a mixed blessing for local farmers, while inflation has pushed up interest rates. Most analysts warn that agricultural growth will fail to outpace population expansion unless the process of deregulation is completed, funding is improved and government policies plan for long-term development. The production gains of the past five years may have been achieved at the cost of nutrient depletion, soil erosion and deforestation. Concerns about agricultural policy focus on four main issues: Too many programmes. The main thrust of SAP has been to nurture small-scale traditional farming, based on low input costs and high employment. Yet Nigeria is also pursuing big projects to import machinery. It is also building large dams which damage the balance of payments, accelerate environmental problems and are, in any case, geared primarily to large-scale, sophisticated farming and food processing. The World Bank has devoted about Dollars 650m - a third of its lending in Nigeria - to the agricultural sector in order to promote gradual, small-scale improvements. The principal method has been to fund decentralised agricultural development programmes (ADPs), which are due to be established in every state. Cash has also been provided for interstate projects in fisheries, livestock, forestry, seeds, treecrops, research, and irrigation of the shallow valleys common in the north. The Bank has installed local senior management and funded institutions such as the federal agriculture co-ordination unit in Ibadan, which links the ADPs in each state, the agricultural projects monitoring and evaluation unit in Kaduna, as well as an agricultural data bank. Small-scale funding by the UNDP, the FAO and IFAD complements these aims. The EC has also invested around Ecu200m (Pounds 165m), partly on specific crops such as oil palm in the south-east and tea on the Mambilla plateau near Cameroon. The ADPs are part of a range of government agencies, such as Women in Agriculture, the directorate for food, roads, and rural infrastructure, and the national agricultural land development authority. These agencies do not always square with the aims of official aid. This applies especially to the land development authority which aims to clear 50,000ha of land in each state, to be allocated by state governors. Environmental concerns. Around 900,000 sq km - almost all the land in Nigeria not under forest cover - is affected by soil erosion. Soil quality is affected by the pressures of population growth, intensified grain production and shorter fallow periods. The estimated cost of deforestation, caused by the encroachment of farmers, is Dollars 750m annually, while inappropriate use of chemicals costs a further Dollars 600m. Both could be checked by stopping incentives to use mechanical equipment and chemicals, by strengthening farmers' land tenure to give them a stake in sustained growth, and by increasing to market levels the fees for forestry concessions. Water resources. In the past two decades, Nigeria has spent Dollars 2bn on large-scale irrigation projects. Out of an intended area of 338,000ha, only 59,000ha are receiving irrigation from these schemes. The public-sector river basin development authorities are pressing ahead with further construction of dams in spite of the greater success and lower cost of small-scale, private-sector irrigation schemes backed by the World Bank. Market distortions. The aim of SAP was deregulation, but state controls, subsidies and protectionism persist. Although farm gate prices have been freed, the government maintains food security stocks at the federal level, buffer stocks at state level and small storage facilities at local government level. The record suggests that the job could be done better by the private sector. Fertiliser subsidy costs the government about N2.9bn a year, over half the total agricultural budget. Fertilisers, whether produced locally by state-owned Nafcon or imported, are subsidised. About half of the official supply of 1.4m tonnes a year is unaccounted for because the corrupt system of state distribution has created a parallel market. Here, fertiliser sells for about three times the official price or is smuggled to neighbouring francophone countries. Mr Ernest Shonekan's promise in January 1993 to hand over distribution to the private sector has not been fulfilled. The cereals and rice import ban, which stopped large imports of wheat from the US, was suspended last year until June 1993. But flour mills have been unable to operate near capacity because of uncertainty over government policy. Most of Nigeria is not suited to wheat production, but other staple crops are in surplus. A ban on the export of cassava and sorghum has been circumvented by smuggling. Stop-go policies have also affected the cocoa sector, one of the main successes under SAP, as well as sugar, production of which has been distorted by import duties which have oscillated between 5 and 40 per cent. In the three decades since independence, Nigeria has been transformed from a large exporter of food to a large importer. SAP has arrested the sharp decline which began with the discovery of oil, but it has only gone part of the way towards liberalising the sector.</p>

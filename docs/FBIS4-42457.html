			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Bulent Ecevit, Democratic Left Party leader, said  that Turkey must close the Cyprus file and immediately start the  process of establishing autonous relations with the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC].    At a news conference in parliament, Ecevit charged that  instead of reconciling the two sides, the UN secretary general  is trying to prevent that from happening. In this way, Ecevit  said, the process of making the Greek Cypriot Republic a member  of the European Union will be started.    Ecevit pointed out that in this process, the Turkish Cypriot  sector will be considered a part of the Greek Cypriot Republic.  In the end, he warned, the Turkish Cypriots will be handed over  to the Greek Cypriots and Cyprus will be attached to Greece de  facto. This plot must be undone, he stressed.    [Begin Ecevit recording] On the condition that the Turkish  Cypriots agree, the TRNC must be an autonomous state completely  independent in its domestic affairs, and attached to Turkey only  in foreign security and international relations. There are two  island states that are attached to Britain with such autonomous  relations. [end recording]</p>

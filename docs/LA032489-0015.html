			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE GHOSTS OF KATYN FOREST'  </P> <P> I was glad to read ("The Ghosts of Katyn Forest," editorial, March 9) that the  Communist Polish government has finally acknowledged the Soviet Union's  responsibility for the massacre of more than 4,000 Polish officers in Katyn  Forest during World War II.  </P> <P> This has been official public knowledge in the U.S. for nearly 40 years, ever  since a congressional special committee investigated the atrocity. The  committee was established in September, 1951, and published its final report  Dec. 22, 1952.  </P> <P> Its published material included maps, photos of the stacked bodies in mass  graves, a list of missing Polish officers identified as these corpses, and  documents in both Russian and English. It also included testimony of  eyewitnesses, international medical experts, and top United States officials.  </P> <P> It established not only the Soviet Union's guilt, but also an Allied conspiracy  of silence at the Nuremberg trials and a massive U.S. cover-up at the very  highest levels of government.  </P> <P> KATHERINE WRIGHT  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: FT Managed Funds Service From today, the Financial Times will no longer be publishing the cancellation price on unit trusts - the minimum redemption price. This follows changes announced by the Securities and Investments Board in September, designed to liberalise the industry's pricing structure. Trusts no longer have to publish cancellation prices, though these will still be available from fund managers, and from today are allowed to impose exit charges. In place of the cancellation price, the FT will be publishing notes advising on exit and other fund charges.</p>

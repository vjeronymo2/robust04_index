			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMITTEE SEEKS HELP IN EXPLORING GENDER BIAS  </P> <P> In November, representatives from the county chapters of the National  Organization for Women met with the Ventura County family law mediation  department. The meeting was amiable and we are following up with some  recommendations. We are also looking forward to future meetings.  </P> <P> NOW contends that many of the problems that women encounter in the court system  are the result of living in a society that discriminates against women.  </P> <P> The Judicial Council Advisory Committee on Gender Bias in the Courts is  collecting data and facts on this. We encourage you, especially if you feel you  have been treated unfairly in the court system, to give input to this  committee. A public hearing will be held Jan. 30 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the  Mark Taper Hall of Economics, California Museum of Science and Industry, 700  State Drive, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> If you prefer to give written testimony, you can send your story to: Ms. Bobbi  Welling, Staff Attorney, Administrative Office of the Courts, Judicial Council  of California, 350 McAllister St., Room 3154, San Francisco, CA 94102.  </P> <P> You can change the way courts treat women. Contact Ventura-Oxnard NOW  (644-6352) or Simi-Conejo NOW (583-1213) if you would like help or additional  information.  </P> <P> DON CANNON  </P> <P> Ventura  </P> <P> The Ventura Edition welcomes letters. They should be as brief as possible and  are subject to condensation. They must include signature, valid mailing address  and a telephone number. Pseudonyms and initials will not be used.

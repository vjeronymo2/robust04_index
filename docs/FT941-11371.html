			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Transatlantic Holdings The flotation of 25 per cent of Capital Shopping Centres will come as a welcome addition to the quoted property sector. Prime shopping centres are currently the hottest property investment market and Capital boasts one of the biggest portfolios of such sites. The flotation will give Capital greater flexibility to restart a development programme or buy other prestigious retail sites. Its parent, Transatlantic, is hardly flush with cash itself. A recapitalisation of Capital is a simple way to gear up for the next cycle. Most other big property companies have tapped the institutions; it seems only fair that Capital should take its turn. The intriguing aspect is how ambitious Transatlantic will be with the pricing. Capital's properties have never knowingly been undervalued. Mr Donald Gordon, Transatlantic's chairman, has long complained of the conservative valuation techniques used by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, but Trans-atlantic clearly hopes for a considerable premium over its stated asset values. The flotation further raises suspicions that Transatlantic intends some bolder adventure in the insurance sector. Sun Alliance is the obvious target. But, by itself, Capital's flotation is likely to make little difference to any such ambitions in this field, with only about Pounds 150m of new finance being raised.</p>

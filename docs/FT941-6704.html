			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Major and Clinton mend their fences: The British premier's visit to Pittsburgh President Bill Clinton last night offered British Prime Minister John Major a lavish welcome to the US as the two leaders sought to reaffirm the strength of the transatlantic alliance. Greeting his guest in Pittsburgh, Mr Clinton deliberately put aside the countries' recent differences over Bosnia and Northern Ireland. Instead, he told a crowd of 3,000 that London and Washington were 'working in partnership' around the world. As Mr Major looked on with obvious satisfaction, the US president listed a joint approach to the ending of the cold war and reform in Russia, a common stance on the Gatt world trade talks and agreement now on the west's approach to Bosnia as examples of the strength of the relationship. Mr Clinton then went out of his way to praise the 'political courage and vision' shown by the prime minister in trying to end the violence in Northern Ireland. The president's remarks drew an equally warm response from Mr Major, who emphasised the 'huge array of personal and business contacts that bind the people of our nations'. The Pittsburgh encounter - chosen because Mr Major's grandfather and father had once lived there - followed intense talks between Mr Major and senior administration and congressional figures on Bosnia, Russia and British policy in Northern Ireland. US officials said the two leaders' informal talks in a Pittsburgh restaurant and during a visit to a new development on the site of an old industrial complex in which Mr Major's grandfather might once have worked were a clear signal that Washington still regarded Britain as a reliable ally. Mr Major's aides, clearly anxious to show the special relationship was alive and well, went to elaborate lengths to point up the generous amount of time Mr Clinton had allocated to the visiting prime minister. Mr Major was due to return to Washington late last night to stay with the Clintons at the White House. For his part Mr Major offered unequivocal support for the action of US aircraft in Bosnia which shot down Serbian aircraft violating the United Nations no-fly zone over the former Yugoslav province. Praising the US for its efforts to broker a deal between the Bosnian Moslems and Croatia, he said the search for a political settlement would go on in parallel with efforts to extend the US's recent success in lifting the siege of Sarajevo. Meanwhile, London and Washington would work jointly at the UN to return Sarejevo to civilian administration. Mr Major, who insisted that reports of a breach between the two governments had been 'wildly overdone', also made it clear that he expected no real dispute over Britain's approach to Northern Ireland. British officials said Mr Major had won the support of both Mr Christopher and Mr Gore for a policy of continuing to back Russian President Boris Yeltsin despite the threat to his position caused by the release of the leaders of last year's attempted coup.</p>

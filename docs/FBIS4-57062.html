			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecila Cayone from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Since early this morning, Tuesday [10 May -- as  heard], a large group of state white and blue collar workers  have been demonstrating outside Congress to express their  demands. There were some tense moments in Congress when the  demonstrators threatened to enter the Congress by force if  congressional authorities did not present themselves. The  situation, however, was solved when Congress President Senator  Eduardo Gomez Tamayo heard their demands and received the  document with their list of petitions. CTV [Confederation of  Venezuelan Workers] leader, Rito Alvarez explained their demands.    [Begin Alvarez recording] We are [words indistinct] the  national Congress leaders to expedite the payment of wage  increases contained in the decree former president Ramon J.  Velasquez signed. Second, employees of entities being  restructured, privatized, or liquidated should not be excluded,  because we believe the decree (?includes them) [words  indistinct], and it is not the public employees's fault that  enterprises are being privatized, reorganized, or liquidated.    We are also demanding the [words indistinct] of salaries for  pensioners and retirees who are living in poverty. It is  disgraceful that people who have worked all their lives should  face such extreme poverty after they are no longer productive.  [end recording]    Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo said lawmakers will  review the document with great care. He admitted the country's  situation has become somewhat difficult and he made an appeal to  the people.    [Begin Gomez recording] [Words indistinct] you, the  country's  situation has become difficult, and this is unfortunate. I  believe now is the time to show we are patriots, Venezuelans,  above all else. The situation requires a great effort, sacrifice  from all sectors, without exception, to have a successful  resolution. This is what we need to do, and I believe...[pauses]  and take advantage of this opportunity to call on different  segments of society to think of Venezuela first before adopting  any stance or attitude.

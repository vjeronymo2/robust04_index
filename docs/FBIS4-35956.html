			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, "deputy prime minister </F> and foreign minister in South Yemen," by Shadiyah Riyad; place  and date not given --recorded]    [Text] [Riyad] Egypt and the Gulf states continue to push  the UN Security Council resolution on a cease-fire in Yemen. Do  you think that the Council will actually succeed in bringing  about a cease-fire in Yemen?    [Al-Asnaj] The UN Security Council certainly has a  responsibility; it also has influence with which it can  guarantee states' compliance with its resolutions. This has  been made clear in more than one country: Iraq, Korea, and many  other tense areas. The UN Security Council has succeeded in  guaranteeing adherence to the UN Charter's provisions on crises  and tension. What is happening in Yemen is a war in all senses  of the word. The states that sponsored the draft resolution  that was unanimously adopted by the highest UN authority are  directly concerned with what is happening in Yemen, with its  pan-Arab and national security aspects and with the safety of  the region's people. They are interested in eliminating the  causes of tension that hamper the development of our Arab  societies.    [Riyad] The entire world community is awaiting the outcome  of  the mission of Lakhdar Ibrahim, who is heading the fact-finding  committee. Do you believe that his task will be easy?    [Al-Asnaj] The task is certainly not easy, but the UN  resolution makes it easier. One side has accepted the  provisions of the UN resolution and its unconditional  implementation with no reservations or delays. The other side  has announced that it accepts the resolution but has so far  raised obstacles and made excuses to avoid responding.    I believe that Sanaa will find the noose tightened around  it.  I think it has to declare its actual position and its real  intentions: Whether or not it will recognize the Yemeni people's  right to determine their own fate, live in peace and safety, and  scorn rulers who endanger their lives and public institutions.  Sanaa is fully responsible for its decision to stop or continue  this war. If it continues, the war will certainly not be in  Sanaa's interest, because the international community will have  taken a certain stance to deter the advocates of war in Yemen.    [Riyad] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal said during  the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign  ministers that a continuing state of war in Yemen would reflect  negatively on the Gulf states and that if it continues, the Gulf  states will take certain measures to deal with it. What  measures did he mean?    [Al-Asnaj] Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal was expressing the Saudi  Kingdom's and the GCC's stand and their actual vision of the  dimensions of this grim war and its serious repercussions on the  region to which we belong. No political analyst would be  surprised by al-Faysal's remarks, which express concern and a  desire to eliminate the causes of tension and war in Yemen.  Once again, it is Sanaa's responsibility either to continue to  be a source of tension for Yemen and the region or to live in  harmony with the region's people and respond to the Arab will.  Egypt, Syria, and all the GCC states have said that the war in  Yemen must stop and that everyone should return to the  negotiations and find a political solution, after first  unconditionally stopping the fighting.    [Riyad] You have accepted appointment as deputy prime  minister and foreign minister. What is the nature of the job  you have been entrusted with at this stage?    [Al-Asnaj] Whoever accepts responsibility at this stage must  sincerely seek joint action with all the good elements in the  Arab world--the shrewd leadership of which is embodied by the  Arab Republic of Egypt, President Husni Mubarak, and all our  brothers in the GCC--to end the state of war in Yemen and resume  talks on a political solution that avoids hegemony, control, and  military ambitions, for which there is no room in today's world.    [Riyad] There is talk about a federation between the north  and south. Is this matter contemplated?    [Al-Asnaj] All these matters will be considered once the  frenzied war stops. The political leadership in Sanaa insists  on this war. It lost its legitimacy the minute it declared that  war.    [Riyad] Thank you Mr. al-Asnaj.    [Al-Asnaj] Thank you.</p>

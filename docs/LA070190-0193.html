			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX ISSUE RAISED IN CHABAD DISPUTE  </P> <P> "Turf wars" going public (Times, June 10) reach more members of the Jewish  community than all the weekly Anglo-Jewish papers. It can prove to be an  effective means of involving the overwhelming majority who are not affiliated  with any Jewish organization or institution. (It's estimated there are 600,000  Jews in greater Los Angeles.) Unless they know what's happening in "private"  debates, they will remain passive when passion is needed to secure greater  commitments.  </P> <P> As to the Bayit-Chabad housing dispute, the legal question of ownership is  secondary to community interests, organization and values.  </P> <P> Bayit was created to serve the needs of college students who wanted to live on  campus in an orthodox housing situation. The Jewish community, through private  or its organizational instrumentalities, must help fund such programs.  </P> <P> What's disturbing about the Chabad move is that their prime purpose is to  secure commitments to their way of practicing and living Jewish life. Meeting  the needs of those on drugs or homeless is not a distinctive "Jewish" problem.  For those who look to Jewish sources for assistance, there is the Jewish Family  Service. It crosses "religious" differences and practices, and does what Chabad  and others must do if any public funding is involved, provide services to  whomever comes to their door(s) for help.  </P> <P> It's the latter (public funding from taxpayer dollars) that needs greater  "public airing."  </P> <P> Social welfare agencies must make their funding programs public; religious  institutions do not. The exception is where public funds are given for a  specific non-religious, social purpose.  </P> <P> What is disturbing and potentially dangerous in terms of protection of minority  interests and rights, is the growth of sectarian, religious agencies seeking  taxpayer dollars, often masking their private interests by claiming the service  provided is public. These nongovernmental expenses are a good part of our  budget deficits and prone to excesses as there is not enough staff to  adequately monitor these gifts and grants.  </P> <P> As to the issue revealed in the June 10 story, I would hope Chabad will step  aside and leave student housing with the campus authorities and the agencies  created to handle the physical and spiritual needs of students.  </P> <P> HYMAN H.

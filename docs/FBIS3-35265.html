He added: Strong relations have always existed between  Algeria and Libya, and contacts between the two fraternal  countries are necessary. The meeting between brother  al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi and President Zeroual has given us a  new opportunity to meet again in the near future to examine all  topics of mutual interest at the bilateral and Maghreban levels  as well as our Arab and Islamic nations, he said.    He added: There are a number of topics to be examined. They  require us to unite our efforts. And this is what we discussed  with Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi.    He stressed that there is no rift between Algerian and  Libyan  brothers that can be manipulated by opposition forces. And this  should be the main outcome of this visit. We are hoping that  the coming days will witness intensified contacts to examine our  affairs with clarity, resolve them, and lay down a joint plan of  action to resolve all related matters, he pointed out.</p>

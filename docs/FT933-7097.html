			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Companies still weighed down by burden of tax regulations Sir, According to your article on deregulation and the Department of Trade and Industry ('Heseltine's crusade progresses in silence', August 20), Tim Sainsbury, UK industry minister, believes the message of deregulation has been 'received and understood' and co-operation with other departments is 'getting better'. The members of the London Society of Chartered Accountants would beg to differ. From the perspective of our clients, while the government looks at a large number of petty regulations, it is failing miserably to tackle the largest burdens of them all - the tax and accounting regulations. The Manchester Business School in 1991 estimated that an average business spent 20 per cent of its pre-tax profits dealing with company and tax regulations. This percentage would have been higher for smaller businesses which make up the majority of British industry. Since then, of course, the recession has turned many profits into losses but the red tape has not stopped rolling. The recently approved Finance Act, for example, was the second longest ever at 300 pages. It introduced no fundamental changes but dealt with so many issues in such technicality that all but the largest companies will be forced to turn to their tax advisers for more help. Many companies will be required to change their accounting or tax software to cope, and almost all companies will find the time they spend on tax administration increasing still further. Pay-and-file, another recent piece of tax legislation, is also adding heavily to that administrative effort. Before we are convinced that the message of deregulation has been received, let us see some positive co-operation between the Treasury (with the various tax authorities) and the DTI. Let us see all legislation evaluated for its cost/benefits and a massive reduction in the tax and accounting trivia inflicted on us.

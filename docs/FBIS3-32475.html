Closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting,  which has been in session in Havana since Tuesday, the topmost  leader of the revolution recalled it was said in a great forum  held in Havana in 1985 that this debt could not be collected and  could not be paid off. He said: Our continent has lost the  better part of this great battle. We are being charged in ever  increasing amounts.    He recalled that when the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959  Latin America's debt was very small, and now it amounts to $500  billion. He said our countries' basic products had a certain  value in the world market at that time. The current great  technologies have gradually displaced them. To illustrate, he  said sugar has been substituted by substances like isoglucose  [isoglucosa], extracted from corn and whose sweetening power is  greater than that of beet and cane sugar.    Castro spoke at the plenum in the presence of more than  1,000  delegates from 32 countries.</p>

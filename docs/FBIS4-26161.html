			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today  that economic cooperation between China and India far exceeds  competition.    She made the remark at the luncheon hosted by the  Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in her honor when  answering a question from an Indian journalist.    China is trying to build a socialist market economy and  India's economy is a market one, she said, adding that the  nature of the market economy is competition.    The Chinese minister said that cooperation and competitions  are inter-dependent and there exists a certain competition  between the two countries in the international market.    "But that is a friendly competition and the cooperation  between China and India exceeds competition actually," she said.    In her speech, Wu Yi elaborated the Chinese Government  policies on foreign investment and joint ventures and answered  questions from Indian businessmen present at the luncheon.    Today, the Chinese minister also met Indian Minister of  State  for Coal A.K. Panja and Indian Minister of State for Petroleum  and Natural Gas S. Sharma.    Both sides discussed matters relating to the further  development of cooperation between the two countries in the  areas of coal, steel as well as petroleum and natural gas.    Wu Yi will be leaving here this evening for the next and  last  leg of her four-Asian-nation visit, Singapore.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors concerned as Samsung lifts stake KIA MOTORS officials expressed concern at the weekend that the company, South Korea's second-largest vehicle manufacturer, may become the target of the country's first takeover bid. Samsung, the big electronics conglomerate, has increased its shareholding in Kia by 40 per cent to 9.6 per cent during the past three months, according to a new report from the Securities Supervisory Board. This makes Samsung the second-largest corporate shareholder in Kia after Ford Motor of the US, which has 10 per cent. Mazda Motors of Japan has 8 per cent. Samsung has made little secret of its desire to add vehicles to its list of activities. It is already taking its first step into the motor industry by starting truck production next year in co-operation with Nissan Diesel of Japan. Samsung officials deny that the recent stock purchase represents the beginning of a takeover bid for Kia, explaining that it is part of a shift in the group's securities portfolio from banks to manufacturing companies. But analysts point out that it is highly unusual for such a large investment to be made in one company. Kia's ownership is fragmented for a Korean company, with 11.4 per cent held by employees and a 2.4 per cent interest belonging to the family of Mr Kim Ho-chul, its founder. If Samsung is preparing a bid for Kia, it would be the first big merger or acquisition to occur in Korea through the purchase of large blocks of shares on the stock exchange. Any such move would coincide with a proposed legal change next year that would eliminate rules that have prevented corporate raids via the stock market. Investors are presently barred from acquiring more than 10 per cent of a company if they held less than that amount when the concern was listed. There have been persistent reports on the Seoul bourse for the past year that Samsung is interested in acquiring control of Kia Motors, the flagship of the Kia group, Korea's eighth biggest conglomerate. Korea's other motor companies, which include Hyundai and Daewoo, have argued that Korea could not support a fourth car manufacturer if Samsung began independent production. The government cited overcapacity in blocking Samsung's proposed car joint venture with Chrysler in 1985.</p>

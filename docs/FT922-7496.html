			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Golden angle to northern triangle THE SUPER-RICH, inhabiting a little-known golden triangle of rural England, are helping to alter the traditional image of the down-at-heel north. Just six months after opening an office in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 'accountants-to-the-rich' firm of Saffery Champness, is earning fees of Pounds 1m a year, recruiting extra staff and taking on more office space. And this is at a time when accountants nationally have been cutting back and axing staff in the face of the recession. North Yorkshire's 'golden triangle', which straddles the A1 Great North Road between York, Wetherby and Harrogate, boasts more super-rich (minimum qualifications Pounds 20m of net worth) than any other part of the country outside Belgravia and Mayfair in London. The triangle's wider claim to fame is that Marston Moor is in its middle. It was here in 1644 that Cromwell's Ironsides defeated the dashing Prince Rupert's cavalry, giving parliament control of the north. In modern times, the rich have been waging a different kind of war against parliament, saving as much as they can of their wealth from the taxman. Mr Keith Weston, a Saffery Champness partner who has totally forsaken London for the north, now sees Yorkshire's golden triangle as far too limited. He has drawn a new triangle, with Newcastle, Liverpool and Grimsby at the corners. This takes in the rich pastures of Cheshire and the Derbyshire Peaks, as well as the rest of Yorkshire and Humberside.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> TEACHER WITHDRAWS FROM COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks school teacher who announced several weeks ago that she was  seeking a City Council seat in the November election has unexpectedly withdrawn  from the race.  </P> <P> In a written statement, Colleen Briner-Schmidt said she must postpone her plans  because of "unexpected personal health reasons."  </P> <P> She did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Briner-Schmidt, who was backed by former city Mayor Frances Prince, had billed  herself as a slow-growth, environmental candidate.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, four people -- including Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Larry  Horner -- have taken out papers to run for reelection in the fall, according to  the city clerk's office. Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Judith Lazar and  resident Michael Markey, a detective for the Compton Police Department, also  said they plan to join the race for council.  </P> <P> In the November election, three council seats are open, and candidates have  until Aug. 15 to file their candidacies with the city clerk. Councilman Tony  Lamb has announced that he will not seek reelection. TINA DAUNT  </P></p>

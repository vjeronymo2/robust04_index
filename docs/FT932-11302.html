			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Policymaking overhaul urged A RADICAL overhaul of Whitehall policymaking to clarify the responsibilities of civil servants and ministers is proposed in a paper today from the European Policy Forum, the cross-party think tank. Government departments should become policy agencies with titles describing what they are supposed to achieve - a Crime Reduction Agency at the Home Office, for example - suggests Professor Norman Lewis of the University of Sheffield, the report's author. Agencies should include ministers, external advisers and civil servants, he says. An independent body would also be created to review policy successes and failures, to help Commons' cross-party departmental committees. Prof Lewis adds: 'Ways would need to be found of associating civil servants with the success or failure of the policies so their career prospects were clearly affected.' He also proposes a Monetary Policy Agency at the Treasury and a Family Poverty Watch at the social security department. The government's Next Steps programme for Whitehall agencies and the Citizen's Charter go some way towards these goals, he argues. But he believes a greater role has to be given to the legal system and that the importance of policymaking - as opposed to service provision - is underplayed. Efforts to deliver public services centrally are misspent, he says. 'There is neither adequate information nor expertise; responding to consumer signals is sluggish and sometimes almost entirely absent. 'On the other hand, the need for clear-headed policies and strategies in the new circumstances of domestic change within a global economy is becoming increasingly obvious.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Defense Ministry is well aware of the fact  that the Partnership for Peace program is one of the concrete  demonstrations of NATO strategy aimed at the alliance's  adaptation towards the modern geopolitical realities, Russian  Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev declared during his  meeting with cultural figures on Friday.    Having qualified the geopolitical and military-strategic  situation as unfavorable for Russia, Grachev pointed out that if  the Russian Federation abstains from joining this program it  "will lose the initiative and will end up in self-isolation."    "Today Russia strives to receive a status which is adequate  to its weight and role including partnership with NATO and the  United States," said Grachev. At the same time he underlined  that the Russian Federation "would not restrict its activity  within the framework proposed to it but would focus its  attention on further development of bilateral relations with  NATO's leading members."    According to Grachev, "nobody questions Russia's integration  into NATO's military structures, we see the need in cooperation  and integration with NATO for the sake of peace in Europe and in  the whole world."    As Grachev indicated, under the present situation strategic  nuclear forces are the real guarantor of Russia's security. "We  give priority to the development of these forces given this  fact," said Grachev.    In his words, taking into consideration the country's  economic opportunities the Defense Ministry does its utmost to  make the troop reduction process go smoothly. "There is no need  to maintain a 4-5 Mn strong army but we cannot cut it down to  1.9 Mn people under any conditions either," noted Grachev.    The Defense Ministry has prepared proposals to make more  concrete and to develop new decrees. It primarily concerns  changes and supplements to the decrees on defense, military duty  and military service, on the status of the servicemen, and on  pensions. The ministry also intends to develop new decrees on  military state, military militia, and on military courts.    As Grachev declared, recently "we managed to lower the  sharpness of military discipline." Compared with 1992 the total  amount of crimes in 1993 reduced by one fourth, there were 17  percent less crimes related to arms and ammunitions robbery, the  number of crimes connected with unauthorized relations has  reduced by 22.3 percent. Nevertheless, the problem of  servicemen's death as a result of suicides still remains  pressing.</p>

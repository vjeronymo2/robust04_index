			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Proposals on sentence discounting welcomed THE 'sentence discounting' recommended by the royal commission would extend and clarify current arrangements to secure a guilty plea before a trial begins. At present, a judge can be approached by a defendant's lawyers for an indication only of whether or not he or she has a custodial sentence in mind. Judges cannot say how long a prison sentence they may be considering. Rough tariffs for offences are accepted and the standard discount for an early plea is a one third reduction in the size of a sentence. This discount applies for all kinds of criminal offences across the board. On some occasions - such as when co-operation is provided in investigations into organised crime - the discounts can be substantially higher. The sentence discounting proposed by the commission would extend this by allowing judges to indicate the length of prison sentences they were considering at that point in the proceedings. This is welcomed by some lawyers as avoiding problems when judges impose sentences that differ from those on the normally accepted tariff. It falls considerably short, however, of the US system of plea-bargaining where prosecutors are in effect able to offer sentence reductions in return for co-operation in their inquiries. Lord Runciman yesterday made clear that the commission rejected this scenario and stuck firmly to the view that sentencing remained a responsibility of the judiciary, not prosecutors. The commission proposed safeguards to prevent the innocent feeling under pressure to plead guilty to offences they have not committed. The discounting procedure would be instigated by the defendant only. The meeting with the judge would be heard in camera and formally noted to avoid later confusion. The commission's proposals have been welcomed by some lawyers as an improvement on present arrangements. Others are less convinced. Mr Michael Mansfield QC is among those who argue it is likely to lead to more wrongful convictions as pressure is inevitably applied on the innocent to plead guilty.</p>

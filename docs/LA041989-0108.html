			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UPHOLDS CHARGE AGAINST ASSEMBLYMAN  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge on Tuesday rejected a motion to dismiss a forgery  indictment against Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), who is accused of  forging former President Ronald Reagan's name on endorsement letters mailed to  thousands of voters in 1986.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys, relying on a nearly 100-year-old state Supreme Court  decision, maintained that Lewis could not be charged with forgery because he  did not intend to defraud anyone of money or property. They said phony  endorsements were at most an unfair ploy to influence the voters.  </P> <P> But Sacramento County Superior Court Judge James Morris ruled that the voters  could have been defrauded of their right to fair elections, and ordered Lewis  to appear for arraignment May 2.  </P> <P> The law, Morris said, "is not limited to issues of the defrauding of a property  right, but does include a defrauding of an intangible, non-property right."  Morris also referred to that right as the "voting franchise right."  </P> <P> As many as 480,000 of the letters were mailed to voters in six Assembly races  in 1986, even though the White House had denied permission for Reagan's name to  be used on the letters, according to a transcript of the grand jury proceeding  that resulted in Lewis' indictment.  </P> <P> Lewis, as chairman of the Assembly GOP elections committee, gave the order to  Republican staff members to send the campaign letters without White House  authorization, according to the transcript.  </P> <P> Clyde Blackmon, Lewis' attorney, said he intends to appeal Tuesday's decision.  Blackmon first will ask the state Court of Appeal to stay further proceedings  in the case, which could delay the matter for several months.  </P> <P> Blackmon based his argument on the California Supreme Court decision in People  vs. Wong Sam, an 1897 case involving a U.S. Customs official's action denying  landing rights to a Chinese immigrant who arrived in San Francisco aboard a  steamship.  </P> <P> The customs official acted after receiving a letter bearing the phony signature  of a Chinese interpreter for a Los Angeles court. The letter, actually written  by Wong Sam, argued that the immigrant should not be admitted to the country  because the man had run a house of prostitution and kept a "concubine" in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Sam was prosecuted for forgery, but the charges were dropped because the  letter, the Supreme Court ruled, "could not have the effect to defraud."  </P> <P> Similarly, Blackmon contends, the phony presidential endorsement letters  allegedly prepared by Lewis for the six Assembly candidates should not be  considered an attempt to defraud. Instead, he said, the letters should be seen  as an effort "to influence the voters in a certain way, presumably against the  Democratic candidates in those campaigns."  </P> <P> "In this indictment, the prosecution attempts to transform the ancient common  law offense of forgery into an 'anti-corruption' tool, requiring an unwarranted  expansion of traditional notions of fraud," Blackmon wrote in a brief submitted  to the court last week.  </P> <P> But W. Scott Thorpe, a supervising deputy attorney general who is prosecuting  the Lewis case, argued that fraud could occur even without the loss of money or  property.  </P> <P> He alleged that the voters were "defrauded of their right to exercise their  vote with full knowledge of whether in fact the President had signed these  letters." Obviously, when the President of the United States endorses someone  and sends a letter, that can have an impact on an election."  </P></p>

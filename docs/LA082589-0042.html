			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Sacramento-area Scoutmaster whose volunteer work earned him his community's  "Citizen of the Year" award in 1988 has been sentenced to 10 years in state  prison for molesting nine boys. Allen Lee Trueman, 42, had pleaded guilty to  nine molestation counts in a plea bargain that had called for a maximum  eight-year sentence. But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Jack Sapunor rejected  the agreement, noting that Trueman's acts had "horrendous" effects on his 8- to  14-year-old victims. Five of the boys are in counseling, one has been placed in  a residential mental facility for evaluation, and at least one of the victims  has withdrawn from men in general, including his own father, according to court  documents.  </P></p>

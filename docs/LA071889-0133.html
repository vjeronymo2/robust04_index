			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) joined a coalition of crime victims'  groups Monday to formally launch a petition drive to place a criminal-justice  initiative on the ballot next June. The initiative, derived from Royce's  unsuccessful attempts to change the court system through the Legislature, would  change trial procedures to speed criminal trials and would seek to ensure that  death sentences are carried out without unnecessary delays. Royce said that if  voters are given the chance, "I have no doubt that the will of the people for  judicial reform, tougher sentences, an effective death penalty and equal  treatment for the victims of crime will prevail." The measure is being  sponsored by the Crime Victims' California Justice Committee, which has until  Nov. 6 to gather the 600,000 signatures necessary to qualify the initiative on  the June, 1990, ballot.  </P></p>

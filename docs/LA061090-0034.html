			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT: A NEW KIND OF DEMAGOGUE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: FORMER KLANSMAN DAVID DUKE IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. THE PRESS  ISN'T ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS OR LOOKING INTO HIS PAST.  </P> <P> The South has a history of politicians who incite the masses by railing at  enemies, real and imagined. In Depression-era Louisiana, Gov. Huey P. Long  flailed the oil companies, symbols of wealth in a time of want. A generation  later, Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace blasted "big guv'ment" and federal  bureaucrats as political elitists allied with blacks.  </P> <P> Today in Louisiana, demagogy is resurgent in a U.S. Senate campaign. State Rep.  David Duke, 39, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who became a Republican in 1988,  is challenging three-term Democratic incumbent J. Bennett Johnston.  </P> <P> Duke, however, is unlike his demagogic predecessors. He grew up middle-class  rather than poor. Plastic surgery in the 1980s gave him a thinner nose and  crinkles around the eyes, the latter suggesting a ready smile. His appearance  probably facilitates his quest to erase his KKK and neo-Nazi ties. But his  message is the same old line in "new" Duke code.  </P> <P> His attacks on the underclass are transparently anti-black. His real enemies,  however, are journalists, though in his criticisms he initially sounds  redemptive: "I do have a past; I've certainly made mistakes." Then he blasts  the media for distorting "what I'm really about."  </P> <P> The most recent poll shows voters roughly 2-1 for Johnston -- 49% vs. 21%. The  official Republican nominee, state Sen. Ben Bagert, lags with 14%. The open  primary is Oct. 6; if no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will follow.  </P> <P> In discounting Duke's chances, pundits like to cite a Johnston poll that put  Duke's negative rating at 48%, a number that would scare most politicians into  retirement. Yet Duke's current standing in the polls is an indication of how  far he's come, despite his negatives, since he won election a year ago to the  state legislature by a mere 227 votes in a district that is 99% white. One  reason is that Duke's is a campaign in perpetuity.  </P> <P> Last year, a state GOP Central Committee member, Elizabeth Rickey, twice  offered a resolution censuring Duke because he was selling Nazi books and had  argued that the Holocaust was "a myth perpetrated on Christians by Jews." But  sensing Duke's blue-collar support, state GOP leaders rejected Rickey's  motions, thereby handing the former Klansman a mantle of legitimacy. The  Faustian pact backfired when two ex-Nazis and a former Klan activist showed up  as Duke delegates to the convention that nominated Bagert, who was a Democrat  until 1988.  </P> <P> Now Duke is outpacing his party's own candidate. He is seeking to expand the  old Wallace constituency with a nationwide mailing to neo-Nazi sympathizers and  white supremacists. He had raised $455,000 by April, according to federal  election records.  </P> <P> Duke also enjoys some support on Louisiana's campuses. At three universities,  white student unions promoting "Euro-American culture" have been formed. Lance  Hill, a doctoral student researching the Duke phenomenon at Tulane, which has  such a union, believes that most new recruits to the Nazi movement will come  from these unions.  </P> <P> Johnston, with $2.5 million in his campaign war chest, is having no trouble  raising money from outraged liberals around the country. But he seems strangely  detached. He recently proposed putting a uranium-enrichment plant in a state  with 40,000 oil-waste pits, high cancer rates and deepening popular fears about  pollution. Drawing crowds of 800 to 1,000, Duke routinely calls for -- and gets  -- a show of hands of those with a friend or relative afflicted with cancer.  </P> <P> As a state representative, Duke has yet to sponsor a bill that became a law.  But his anti-media strategy has helped to shift public attention from his long  record of promoting Nazi master-race theories. In nearly every speech, he  criticizes the state's largest newspaper, the New Orleans Times-Picayune, which  has opted for a "less is better" approach to covering the senatorial campaign.  Only its main events are reported, with the paper devoting no space to how Duke  built his National Assn. for the Advancement of White People.  </P> <P> The NAAWP News promotes genetic engineering modeled on the Nazi master-race  theory. It advocates sterilizing welfare mothers, which Duke translates as  "birth-control incentives" in his speeches. The Holocaust-as-myth theory is  another tenet of the NAAWP, which for years ran a mail-order service offering  such books as "The Hitler We Loved and Why" and "The Holy Book of Adolf  Hitler." There has been scant reporting of how these books and videotapes of  American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell are distributed.  </P> <P> Religious and civic leaders formed the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and  Nazism to pressure the media into being more aggressive in its political  coverage. To fill the Duke-fact gap, the coalition has become an informational  clearinghouse, with Rickey and Hill briefing media across the state.  </P> <P> Still, too many journalists do not question such Duke statements as: "I was  never involved in any illegal activity, and I don't condone illegal activity."  In truth, Duke was convicted, in 1979, of inciting a riot outside a hotel in  the district he now represents. In 1989, he was fined $55 for blocking a  highway during a black march in Forsyth County, Ga.  </P> <P> Nor has the media paid much attention to the NAAWP's call in 1982 for freeing  "white political prisoners," specifically John and Ed Gerhardt, who founded a  Nazi group in Ohio and went to prison for conspiring to blow up a Columbus  school where the daughter of a judge who issued a desegregation order was a  student.  </P> <P> Duke's anti-media campaign spares no adversary, no matter how small. In early  May, publisher Harrell Griffin of the St. Helena Echo, a rural weekly, refused  to run a Duke advertisement. According to Griffin, Duke aide Callie S. O'Pry  "called in a very pleasant voice, saying they were going to institute a boycott  against the Echo, write letters to all advertisers to stop advertising and do  the same with my subscribers. The next day I lost two news boxes. Someone  kicked 'em. When that didn't work, they ran into 'em with a truck."  </P> <P> That week, Duke spoke at a packed hall in Chalmette, a suburb of New Orleans. A  dozen skinheads stood at the main door. Older men drinking beer lined the rear  of the hall. When Duke scoffed at the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, one man  piped: "Kill another one!"  </P> <P> Duke appeals to the fears of people who see their living standards declining  amid rising crime and drug abuse. "Any sort of racism is absolutely morally  wrong," he piously intoned to his audience that night. "We do need more racial  harmony," a remark that drew curses from several men.  </P> <P> Duke spoke of his "employment working with the State Department" in Laos in  1970. "I volunteered to go behind enemy lines, and a couple of times I almost  didn't come back."  </P> <P> In fact, he was denied an Army commission after completing the ROTC program at  Louisiana State University. According to Retired Lt. Col. James May, who was  Duke's senior ROTC instructor: "His affiliation with Nazism precluded him from  getting a commission. . . . Hell, we couldn't tolerate such a thing."  </P> <P> The State Department has no record of Duke's employment. But David H. Duke, the  candidate's father, who worked as a civil engineer for the U.S. government in  Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, said in an interview last year that his  son visited Laos and "got himself a job" -- teaching English.  </P> <P> Like Jimmy Swaggart, another folk hero sprung from these latitudes, Duke is a  walking psychodrama, challenging reporters to separate fact from the many  fictions of his speech. Sadly, too many of them look the other way.  </P></p>

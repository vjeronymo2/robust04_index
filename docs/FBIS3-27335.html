He was the political commissar of the Chengdu military  region.    Zhang, 59, has been transferred to the Academy of Military  Sciences in what appears to be the only politically motivated  transfer in a large scale reshuffle of personnel in the military  regions and commands.    The other changes appear to be routine retirements based on  age, despite expectations of some analysts that this occasion  would be used to carry out a second purge of allies and  associates of Yang Baibing, who was removed from his post as  secretary general of the Central Military Commission in 1992.    The new wave of military personnel changes is the biggest  since the reorganisation of the main military leadership in  mid-1990.    In all, 80 military region and command positions have been  changed, analysts said. Zhang was reviled by many Chinese for  his role as political department director of the martial law  enforcement troops during the 1989 crackdown.    In a televised news conference widely broadcast in China  after June 4, Zhang claimed that no students had been killed in  Tiananmen Square. His claim may have been technically true.    No student demonstrators are known to have died on the  square  in the early morning of 4 June, though there were several  civilian casualties within a few metres of the square, and large  numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed as the martial law  forces pushed their way into the centre of the city from the  west. Zhang's appearance on television cemented his image as an  apologist for the crackdown. He is being replaced by Zhang  Zhijian, deputy commander of Beijing military region.    Meanwhile, Deng Xiaoping appears to be taking a less active  role in military affairs with the departure of his secretary,  Wang Ruilin, who also acted as his eyes and ears on the Central  Military Commission. Wang, secretary of the Commission for  Discipline Inspection of the Party's Central Military  Commission, is no longer active as Deng's secretary, having left  Deng's personal office some months ago, according to Beijing  sources. His importance at the military commission was enhanced  after Deng's relationship with Yang Shangkun deteriorated over  1991-92. At that time, Wang was responsible for arranging  Deng's meetings and appointments, but that job has been taken by  Deng's eldest daughter, Deng Rong.    The military reshuffle has not affected any seats on the  Central Military Commission (CMC), but the post of  secretary-general, which has been unfilled since Yang Baibing  was dismissed from the post in 1992, may have a new occupant  soon. General Chi Haotian and General Zhang Wannian are tipped  as possible candidates to fill the long-standing vacancy,  Beijing sources said.    The power base of the Chinese Communist Party general  secretary, Jiang Zemin, is still considerably weaker than that  of his predecessors, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Some analysts  believe that Chi's appointment as CMC secretary-general would  strengthen Jiang's position in the military.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Observer: MoD minefield Sounds like Mike Robinson, the 44-year-old chief executive of Bristol city council, has landed one of the best-paid jobs in British housing. The normally well-informed Housing Associations Weekly says Robinson is to head the non-profit-making body being set up to take charge of the Ministry of Defence's housing stock. As usual, the MoD remains tight-lipped, but Robinson is believed to have got the Pounds 100,000 plus job of looking after the 69,000 service homes. They are being transferred to a private housing trust which will be more than twice as big as the largest housing association, the North British. The attractions for the government are obvious. It raises over Pounds 500m and no longer has to worry about the increasing burden of making the rundown properties fit for our troops to live in. However, not all housing associations are going to welcome the arrival of such a big player at a time when they are already competing for a much smaller pot of public money. And even if the new trust is refused official hand-outs, it will be seeking a lot of money from the City - thus crowding out less well-connected housing bodies. Another government initiative which has backfired?</p>

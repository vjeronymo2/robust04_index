			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Turkish foreign minister quits Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, resigned yesterday after he had learned from newspapers of plans to dismiss him. Mr Cetin submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, who is also the leader of the Social Democrat Populist party (SHP), the junior partner in Turkey's coalition government. Mr Karayalcin was expected to name Mr Mumtaz Soysal as foreign minister in a reshuffle of all 11 SHP-held ministries. Mr Soysal believes Turkey should adopt a more independent foreign policy from Nato on issues such as Cyprus and Iraq, and opposes extending the mandate allowing western forces to patrol Kurdish-held northern Iraq from Turkish bases. He has said Ankara should not complete a planned customs union with the EU next year unless the union extends substantial financial aid to Turkey, currently blocked by Greece, and opposes Mrs Ciller's privatisation plans.</p>

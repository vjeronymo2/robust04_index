			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] The Australian Government has made a major  statement on employment and economic growth, calling for  Australia to cut its jobless rate by half by the year 2000. The  White Paper presented to Parliament by the prime minister, Paul  Keating, says Australia can bring its unemployment rate down to  five percent by the turn of the century.    To support the job strategy, Mr. Keating pledged to spend an  extra Australian $6.5 billion over four years. From Canberra,  Graeme Dobell reports:    [Begin Dobell recording] In its first White Paper on  employment in nearly 50 years, the Australian Government says it  will make sweeping changes to the social security system and  what it calls landmarking labor market programs.    Much of the analysis is couched in the language of economic  rationalism, arguing for jobs created by economic growth needing  no government subsidies. It calls for continued low inflation,  improved competitiveness, and productivity and further reforms  of the Australian economy. But the White Paper says economic  growth alone will not do enough for the long-term unemployed and  truly disadvantaged. These are the 400,000 of Australia's one  million unemployed who have been out of a job for more than 12  months.    The response is what is to be known as the job compact -- a  promise that anyone who has been drawing unemployment benefits  for 18 months or more will be given a job. The government says  it will provide training and support to give 6-12 months work,  primarily in the private sector. The job compact promises some  unemployed a training wage, so they can combine work with  training.    The government says that by the financial year starting in  the middle of next year, this employment and training promise  will cost an extra Australian $2 billion. But this will be  partly offset by savings of $800 million in unemployment  benefits. The government will be budgeting in next financial  year for extra $280 million to support the income of the  unemployed and low wage earners, $160 million for industry and  trade schemes, and $50 million to help develop remote Australian  regions where jobless rates are the highest.    The trade policy repeats Australia's commitment to link into  the dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific and enhance the  multilateral trading system to be based on the World Trade  Organization. The paper notes that by 1996, Australia's general  tariff rate will be a maximum of five percent -- the end point  of a tariff cutting regime starting in the late 1980's.    Recent Australian reports had suggested that tariff cuts  could continue down to a maximum of three percent by the year  2000, but the government has backed off from that idea.  Instead, it has announced that the general five percent rate  will continue beyond 1996. Canberra says this is one of the  lowest maximum tariff rates in the world and thus developing  country preferences will be phased out for all but the poorest  countries.    In answer to many criticisms from Southeast Asia, Canberra  has also pledged to amend its antidumping legislation, so it is  closer to GATT standards.    In conclusion, the White Paper says that Australia has the  chance to get the balance right to achieve a dynamic economy but  also offer every Australian the right to a job. The government  statement says Australia's aim is to enter the next century with  one of the world's most sophisticated and efficient economies  underpinning one of the world's most equitable and cohesive  societies.

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: DEPRECIATED VALUE;  </P> <P> IF SOMEONE SAYS: 'THANKS A MILLION,' YOU MAY BE FACING A GRATITUDE DEFICIT  </P> <P> THE WORD million has lost the near-magic, hyperbolic value that it once had  when we used it to define phenomena almost beyond calculating.  </P> <P> It was enough to say that Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller were millionaires,  though they may indeed have been billionaires.  </P> <P> Today there are probably a million millionaires in the United States. To call a  man a mere millionaire no longer identifies him as super-rich. Today's biggest  wheelers and dealers are billionaires -- at least.  </P> <P> The power a billionaire has is truly beyond our grasp. His money would buy him  almost anything he might want except, perhaps, a sovereign state, youth or  beauty.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it might buy him some sovereign states.  </P> <P> Today, baseball players make $2 million a year. Juries hand out  multi-million-dollar judgments as if they were confetti. Rock Hudson's lover is  granted $21.7 million from Hudson's estate because Hudson failed to tell him he  had AIDS. Clerks and beauty shop operators win $20 million in the lottery.  </P> <P> We seem to have lost sight of how much money $1 million is.  </P> <P> But Dan Frazier, a correspondent of mine, is determined to keep the true  meaning of the word million before our eyes.  </P> <P> Frazier has prepared a book, as yet unpublished, that graphically demonstrates  the true meaning of the casual phrase "Thanks a million."  </P> <P> The book consists of 125 pages on each of which the word Thanks is printed  8,000 times -- in 40 columns of 200 words each. The words are too tiny for me  to measure on my 12-inch ruler.  </P> <P> By riffling through those 125 pages and seeing the solid banks of Thanks flash  by, page after page, you get some idea of what a million is.  </P> <P> The only other enlightenment that the book offers is a few illustrations of  what a million means in concrete terms.  </P> <P> For example, a stack of a million $1 bills would be 667 feet high. You would  have to circumvent the world 40 times to travel a million miles. If a million  people lined up for a movie, that line would be more than 189 miles long. (That  figure, of course, would have to be an approximation, depending on how fat or  thin the people were.)  </P> <P> If you had a stack of a million records, it would be 10 times taller than the  Empire State Building.  </P> <P> If you could travel at a million miles per hour, you could travel from Los  Angeles to New York in nine seconds.  </P> <P> If you saved $15,000 a year, it would take you 67 years to save a million  dollars.  </P> <P> If a million cars were in a traffic jam on a three-lane freeway, traffic would  back up from New York to Miami.  </P> <P> (Let's not forget. We have at least 3 million cars in Los Angeles -- enough  potentially to cause a traffic jam from here to New York.)  </P> <P> Less fearsome, perhaps, is the fact that a sheet of a million postage stamps  would cover nearly three tennis courts.  </P> <P> A similar fact is that a million inch-thick novels would require 15.9 miles of  shelf space.  </P> <P> Frazier is still looking for a publisher (publishers evidently think no one  wants to read Thanks a million times). But if you want to say "Thanks a  million" to someone, you may buy a privately printed copy for $14, which can be  sent to Frazier at 5611 Carlton Way, No. 402, Hollywood 90028.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as we tread anxiously into a world where billion has replaced  million, and trillion has overtaken billion at least in terms of our national  debt, we may, with trepidation, try to calculate what those terms really mean.  </P> <P> A billion is a thousand times a million, and a trillion is a thousand times a  billion. To grasp the meaning of these numbers, take each of Frazier's  illustrations and multiply it a thousand times.  </P> <P> Thus, if you could save a million dollars by saving $15,000 every year for 67  years, it would take you 67,000 years to save a billion, and 67,000,000 years  to save a trillion.  </P> <P> And if you personally wanted to pay off the national debt, at about $15,000 a  year, it would take you about 134,000,000 years.  </P> <P> Those calculations are my own, and if they are off by $100 million or so,  excuse me.  </P> <P> I can't even remember what 9 times 6 is.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prop money courtesy of Mari Blackwell  </P></p>

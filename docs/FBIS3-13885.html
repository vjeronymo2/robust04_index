In as much as he is  familiar with the issue of Jerusalem, he could find no better  opportunity to affirm that a unified Jerusalem was Israel's  capital other than in these delicate circumstances through which  the talks are passing. Since 1967, on the basis of UN Security  Council resolutions, the U.S. position has continued to reject  the annexation of the Arab part of Jerusalem to Israel. In his  meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, Clinton said that the United  States refuses to refer to Arab Jerusalem as part of the  occupied territories. He did this in order to arouse the  emotions of the Jews and gain their trust at a time when he  finds himself involved in an investment bank scandal in his  state, Arkansas, of which he was governor before winning the  White House.    If the Oslo accord postponed discussion of the Jerusalem  issue until the final settlement stages, Clinton's remarks  dissipated hopes that the United States would remain committed  to international legitimacy and implementation of Security  Council resolutions relating to Jerusalem. Instead of adopting  a position that renews the desire by the Palestinians to return  to the talks and implement the Oslo accord, Clinton, "with his  wisdom" and long experience in foreign affairs, saw fit to pour  salt on the wound by raising the Jerusalem issue at this time  and place. The United States, instead of adopting the position  of a neutral partner and attempting to build confidence between  the Palestinians and the Israelis following the damage created  by the Hebron massacre, has now adopted a pro-Israeli position  that retreats from previous U.S. positions on Jerusalem.    What is a cause for ridicule is the contradiction in  President Clinton's stance. In the blessed night of the Koran's  revelation he addressed the Muslims and tried to display  feelings of friendship toward them. A few days later came  Clinton's position, hostile to Islam and the Muslims, who  consider Jerusalem to be the first Qiblah and the third holiest  site. On one hand he congratulates the Islamic nation on the  great night of the Koran's revelation, and on the other he  defies the feelings of this nation by insisting on a position  biased toward Israel with respect to the issue of Jerusalem, as  if he is not aware of the extent of this nation's link to  Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque and of the fact that more than  one billion world Muslims reject Arab Jerusalem remaining under  Israeli control. Moreover, a just and comprehensive settlement  in the region cannot be reached without finding a solution to  this sensitive issue that satisfies the three religions of  Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.    Although we are grateful to President Clinton for  congratulating us on the night of the Koran's revelation and the  blessed 'Id al- Fitr, his second message which he sent through  the American Jewish leaders, whom he met two days ago, is more  impressive and bitter. That requires the Islamic nation to  resist and confront this message because it represents a  challenge to the Islamic and Arab nations, regardless of whether  this was an intentional act or a failure to realize the danger  of this U.S. position on relations between our Islamic and Arab  worlds and his Western world as well as the fact that this  position could lead to derailing the talks and the entire peace  process. This pro-Israeli and biased U.S. stance on Jerusalem  increases Israeli intransigence on the issue of Jerusalem, on  Israel's plans to reduce the Arab presence in the city and  Judaize the remainder of the holy city, and diminishes the  chances of a peace whose crux is Jerusalem.    We say to President Clinton and the U.S. Administration that  this U.S. position increases the Palestinian people's  persistence to continue the political struggle until they  achieve their freedom and regain their rights.    This U.S. position will help to unite the Palestinian ranks  and to search for common denominators among the various groups  and factions. We add: If this was the U.S. response to the  Hebron massacre, in which the Palestinians were the victims, how  will the U.S. response be if the Israelis are the victims? What  a calamity it is when the United States turns falsehood into  truth.</p>

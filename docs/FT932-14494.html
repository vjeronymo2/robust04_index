			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Attali defends spending by bank MR JACQUES ATTALI, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday denied responsibility for the way in which Pounds 200m was spent by the bank on fitting out its London offices and meeting overheads since its launch two years ago. He said on the BBC TV Breakfast With Frost programme that it had not been his role to decide on the Pounds 750,000 spent on replacing and installing new marble at the entrance to the bank's headquarters in the City. 'My role was to decide on the budget and to get it agreed by the board of the bank and to be sure that the cost of the building would be at the lower range of a City average,' he said. Mr Attali, who is to be questioned this week by Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister who is chairman of the bank, over the allegations of excessive spending at the bank said he had nothing to apologise for. He said the bank had one-off start-up costs and that by investing to create its headquarters in the UK, the government would attract more business for the country. He said that many countries had competed to have the bank's headquarters in their capitals. 'I think it was a good decision for the British government to decide to invest a lot of money in the headquarters.' Mr Attali avoided the question of whether he should resign if that was the price of restoring the bank's credibility.</p>

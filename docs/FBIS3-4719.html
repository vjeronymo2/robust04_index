It was the first search of university campuses since the  inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" government a  year ago.    In the two-hour raids that began at 4:30 a.m., police failed  to arrest leaders of "Namchongnyon," an organization of students  in Cholla-namdo and Kwangju regions, but seized four-tons of  leaflets, iron pipes, clubs, fire bombs and other demonstration  items.    The student leaders are suspected of masterminding the raid  on the U.S. Cultural Center in Kwangju last November and other  protests.    Some 5,000 police troops were mobilized in the pre-dawn  operation during which no violence broke out.    "The search was inevitable to uproot violent protests and to  arrest students who led dozens of demonstrations even since the  inauguration of the civilian government," a police spokesman  said.    "We will put riot police into any campuses from the  dimension  of safeguarding law and order, if radical and violent protests  are to take place in the days to come," he stressed.    Campus protests had almost died out last year under the  influence of Kim's strong reform drive, but the government's  decision to allow rice imports rekindled the students action  against the agreement of the Uruguay Round talks.    Student leaders last month declared they would embark on a  nationwide struggle this spring to support farmers in blocking  rice imports.</p>

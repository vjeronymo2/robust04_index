			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Walpole, 'blowing its own trumpet' Jeremy Franks, group chief executive of Daks Simpson group, has been appointed the new chairman of the Walpole Committee, replacing Giles Shepard, who has stepped aside now he is no longer chief executive of the Savoy group, one of the committee's members. The committee was set up in June 1992 in order to promote British industry's reputation for quality and style in goods and services, along the lines of France's Comite Colbert. Among its eight founder members was the Financial Times. Its membership includes such well-known companies as British Airways, Land Rover and Mappin &amp; Webb. Each company pays a fee, based on turnover, but the amounts are not disclosed. There have been suggestions that in the two years since its inception the committee has little concrete to show for its work, an accusation Franks rebutted yesterday. 'We have been trying to build up our membership in what was a difficult time. To have reached 31 main and six associate members is commendable. The question is now how we go forward and exploit that.' Franks, 57, added that there has been 'tremendous interfacing' between the members and denied that the committee is one grand public relations exercise. 'The British tend to be laid back and modest. We are trying to blow our own trumpets, but trying to get an overall game plan is very difficult. One day in the near future I am sure that the Walpole Committee will be the spokesman for British excellence.' From the point of view of his own company, Franks said that one of the achievements of belonging to the committee has been the 'interfacing it has brought about with other companies, such as British Airways'. First item on his agenda is to 'get together personally with each of the members and then from that form a control basis of companies that relate to each other'.</p>

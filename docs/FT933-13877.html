			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producing and consuming nations close to new pact COCOA producing and consuming countries said yesterday they expected to conclude a new international cocoa pact today, at the end of a fifth and final round of talks. The pact's centrepiece will be a system of production management to bring supply and demand for cocoa into better long-term balance. With a contentious withholding scheme now abandoned, the accord will have no provisions for direct market intervention to stabilise prices. The two-week negotiations in Geneva, sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, have focused instead on the functioning of a production management committee to be set up under the new deal. The fine print was still being haggled over yesterday evening. Among other things, consuming countries have been arguing for a defined role on the committee, which will co-ordinate producers' supply plans in the light of expected market conditions. A separate committee will promote cocoa consumption. Cocoa prices are at historically low levels because of structural oversupply. Although production has been reined back in the past couple of years, stocks of an estimated 1.4m tonnes continue to overhang the market. Producer countries will have to agree among themselves how production cuts should be shared. Four earlier rounds of talks on a replacement for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement, which expires at the end of September, eventually floundered when countries failed to agree on financing and the target price range for a scheme to withhold cocoa from the market to bolster prices. In June the International Cocoa Council, which administers the present pact, recommended dropping the withholding scheme and liquidating the existing buffer stock of just under 231,000 tonnes. The gradual run-down of the buffer stock, due to be discussed by the ICCO in September, will enable producer countries now in arrears to pay off their debts. Some 45 nations comprising all the world's major cocoa producers and consumers are taking part in the talks. Forty of the countries are members of the present agreement, but Malaysia, the fourth biggest producer, and Indonesia, also an important supplier, are not members of the accord. On the consumer side the main absentee is the US, which accounts for a quarter of world cocoa imports.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Rabin win recalls Labour glory days AMID the excitement in the Israeli Labour party yesterday over Mr Yitzhak Rabin's dramatic unseating of Mr Shimon Peres as leader, no-one seemed bothered that Labour's 150,000 members seemed to be harking back 18 years into the past. In fact, the re-elevation of Mr Rabin to the position he first assumed on the retirement of the late Mrs Golda Meir in 1974 was what excited many Labour supporters. Mr Rabin, an unspectacular prime minister until 1977 when he gave way to Mr Peres under the cloud of a minor financial scandal, recalls the glory days of Labour when it was Israel's pre-eminent political force. He may be only 10 days short of his 70th birthday, but Mr Rabin's assertion that only he can reverse Labour's 15-year eclipse by the right-wing Likud party won over a party which still judges itself by the standards of its past strengths. But can he? Certainly opinion polls have consistently shown Mr Rabin to be the most popular leader in the eyes of the electorate, usually a few points ahead of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader and prime minister. Interestingly, he is popular among the young. There seems no doubt that Labour will present a more credible challenge under Mr Rabin than under Mr Peres. The former leader was a skilful and popular prime minister in the two years he held the post in the mid-1980s. But he failed to beat the Likud in four elections and in recent years was fatally associated with Labour's long decline. The Likud made no secret that it would rather face Mr Peres in the June election. Mr Rabin's main pitch to the electorate is that he combines toughness on security issues to match the Likud without the Likud's ideological commitment to the occupied territories and Jewish settlements which has brought Mr Shamir's government into conflict with the US, Israel's paramount ally and bankroller. As Chief of Staff during the 1967 Six Day War, and later as a tough defence minister during the Palestinian uprising of the late 1980s, Mr Rabin's credentials on the security issues are impeccable. But, unlike Likud, he is also committed to a pragmatic settlement with the Palestinians accepting that Israel will have to cede land in exchange for peace. Opinion polls show most Israelis are prepared to accept such a deal. Mr Rabin has said he would negotiate Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. None the less, the task facing him is immense. A man whose weary appearance often betrays his years, he has to rejuvenate a party which for years has lacked direction and trails the Likud by five points in the polls. Not least, he must resolve the conflicts within the party over economic policy. Immigration-induced unemployment is a prime election issue. A Labour victory in June still looks unlikely. But a strong Labour performance, perhaps enough to win a place in a coalition with Likud, is possible.</p>

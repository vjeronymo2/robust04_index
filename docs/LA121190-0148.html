			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRENETIC MAESTRO;  </P> <P> ENERGETIC CZECH, ZDENEK MACAL, TO LEAD PACIFIC SYMPHONY  </P> <P> To anyone who has seen and heard Zdenek Macal conduct, his speech cannot come  as much of a surprise. At 54, the man is absolutely bursting with energy. He  speaks quickly, backtracks, qualifies and generally exhibits a mind that seems  to work faster than he can form the words in his Czech-accented, ungrammatical  but highly expressive English.  </P> <P> His enthusiasm is the kind that catches, and he speaks with pride of a recent  appearance with the New York Philharmonic. "The players told me that they are  known as killers of conductors, and I said I don't care. I don't remember that  I had any problems. Mostly I get almost every orchestra on my side in some way.  </P> <P> "I simply try to do the best possible concert, not only because it is my job  but because it's a great thing, it is a great privilege to conduct any music. I  feel blessed to do Brahms or Beethoven or Barber or whatever I do."  </P> <P> He says that after the concert, "they put in the newspapers in New York that  the 'orchestra obviously likes him, they play for him, audiences go wild.' I  had almost every night one standing ovation at intermission, then after the  concert a second one. In New York! What more could you want?"  </P> <P> The music director of the Milwaukee Symphony, Macal -- who has a home here in  Laguna Niguel -- will guest-conduct the Pacific Symphony in Costa Mesa  Wednesday and Thursday nights. The main function of a conductor, Macal feels,  is to stir up an orchestra and, through it, the audience.  </P> <P> "Music is something which is very emotional; it's not mechanical, you can't  prepare it. Yesterday I conducted this part of the Dvorak this way, and  tomorrow probably at the same place I will do it a different way. Why? Because  it's a different day, or because it's not afternoon, it's evening. You must act  very sensitively to the moment. We shouldn't be in a corset.  </P> <P> "And that's the fascination! I did Beethoven's Seventh 70 or 80 times and  Strauss' 'Zarathustra' 50 times but it's always exciting for me. Even if I do  the same piece three or four times in a row, I always try to do some rubato  which I didn't rehearse, just to keep the orchestra on the alert. Because  otherwise they play mechanically, and that's wrong."  </P> <P> Business is half of our life, he says. "The other part is inside, what kind of  people we are. That's why the music and the arts are here, to simply remind the  people to live the emotional life, because for most people the inside is  sleeping, really sleeping."  </P> <P> Macal, who has performed with more than 150 orchestras around the world, holds  positions with the San Antonio Symphony and for the Grant Park concerts in  Chicago in addition to the directorship in Milwaukee. After this year, though,  he will drop the first two jobs. "I cannot do three orchestras," he says.  </P> <P> But his guest-conducting schedule remains full. It includes recent appearances  with major orchestras in Houston, Boston, Detroit and Washington, as well as in  New York. During this interview at his hilltop home in Laguna Niguel, he was  interrupted by a phone call from the Philadelphia Orchestra, which wants him  for two programs next summer.  </P> <P> He has made several recordings with the Milwaukee Symphony and plans to  continue with Berlioz's "Lelio" with Werner Klemperer as narrator, the two  Chopin concertos with Shura Cherkassky as soloist, and the rest of a full cycle  of the nine Dvorak symphonies, of which five already are completed.  </P> <P> The orchestra has had its share of financial troubles, but Macal is pleased  with its musical progress. "Oh, it was a provincial orchestra," he recalls.  "But in four years we have moved, and we are visible on the map."  </P> <P> His speech becomes somewhat more guarded when talk turns to the Sydney  Symphony, which he fled well before his contract expired, complaining of  difficult working conditions and the Australian tax rate. But he says all the  unpleasantness is behind him. "Just last week," he says, beaming, "they  contacted my manager here and asked if I would like to go back. They talk very  positively about me, and they said the orchestra had its best performances in  the time that I was there."  </P> <P> His program of Czech music with the Pacific Symphony this week includes  Smetana's Overture to "The Bartered Bride," Dvorak's Eighth Symphony and  Janacek's Sinfonietta. But he downplays the idea that he's any better than  anyone else at conducting music from his native land.  </P> <P> "Certainly, I am close to the Slavonic music, I am close to the Russian music,  that is my background. Maybe if I just say it is easier for me to interpret it  than some other kinds of music. I must work harder on some other things. Let's  put it this way: Maybe some German conductor has to work harder on Slavonic  music because his German spirit is maybe too heavy and hasn't enough color for  this Slavonic music."  </P> <P> Still, he's wary of returning to Czechoslovakia -- which he left during the  Russian invasion of 1968, with just two bags and his family -- despite recent  changes there. "I don't think that the Communists can change overnight by only  giving up their membership in the party. I'm still surprised that in the  election Havel got 37% and the Communists 17%. It's still a high number for me,  17%.  </P> <P> "Basically, my home is here." He will become a U.S. citizen in two years. "The  most important thing is that I feel I have a home. Because for almost 20 years  I had none. Living in Europe after 1968, I was not Swiss, not French, not  Czech, not Austrian. So please don't ask me to go through the whole process  again, that I must lose my feeling for my home."  </P></p>

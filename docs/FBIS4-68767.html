			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peteris Lakis: "Commentary"] </F>   [Text] As shown by the results of our public poll on the  municipal elections, citizens should show ample participation in  these elections. As could be expected in an early preelection  phase, over one-third of the respondents have not made up their  minds with respect to their voting ballot preferences at this  time. It should be noted that only general sympathies have been  polled, and every political power will have representatives in  each electoral district. It is obvious that the personalities  appearing on the ballots will play a major role.    The results of the study also confirm a degree of inertia  with respect to public opinion -- to a large extent, the  positions held by the various political powers are similar to  those in the Saeima election. It is true that the situation  could be fundamentally changed by the creation of new political  unions, and in particular -- on the basis of coalition  formation, and, of course, by increased campaign activities. In  any case, the results of this poll should only be considered as  a first survey of public opinion, and the prediction of the  possible election outcome on the basis of these is overly risky.  A truer indication of this or some other outcome with respect to  how the voters will express their sympathies can only come after  the lists of candidates are published.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jammu--Union Home Minister S.B. Chavan has said that  Pakistan, which has been supporting and instigating terrorism in  Kashmir, has no moral right to raise the issue of alleged human  rights abuses by security forces in the Kashmir valley.    Talking to newsmen at the Jammu airport before his departure  to Delhi after his three-day tour of Jammu and Doda region,  Chavan said that Pakistan has launched a massive disinformation  campaign against India at the international level, whereas  large-scale human rights violations are taking place in other  parts of Pakistan, he said.    The Union Home Minister admitted that India has not been  able  to effectively counter the false and motivated campaign by  Pakistan. He said that the government has taken a number of  steps to put across the Indian point of view on the Kashmir  issue at the international level.    "We even propose to send non-government organisations to  other countries to put across our case in the wake of "wild  allegations levelled against our country," he said.    Chavan further said that after the strike call given by the  Pakistan government on the Kashmir issue no further proof was  needed to show the complicity of Pakistan in fomenting trouble  in the Kashmir valley.    On the question of alleged use of excessive force at  Kupwara,  Chavan said that clear-cut instructions have been given to the  security forces to show utmost restraint in dealing with such  provocative situations. He said that an inquiry has been ordered  by army into the episode also.    Asked about the demand for appointing political advisors  Chavan categorically said, "We do not propose to appoint  political advisors." He said that Kashmir was a national issue  and he would expect co-operation from all political parties to  frame a common "strategy." No political party should try to  exploit it for its "political gains," he added.    About holding elections in the state, the Home Minister said  that he has never ruled out holding elections in Jammu and  Kashmir but no time limit could be given.    Chavan said that he did meet Farooq Abdullah in Delhi for  half-an-hour but refused to give further details about what  transpired.    He also announced that the monthly relief to the Kashmiri  migrants has been raised from Rs.1000 per month to Rs.1500 per  month. "The decision was taken after I had a talk with the Union  Finance Minister Manmohan Singh on telephone last evening," he  said.    He said that he would also take up with the Finance Ministry  the problems of overdraft, deficit and security related  expenditure incurred by the state government. He further said  that unless more aid was given to the J and K it would be  difficult for the state to meet its annual plan targets.    About his perception of the situation, he said that security  forces are handling it in a co-ordinated manner which has not  only given confidence to the government but also to the common  man."    Asked to comment upon the reported statement of Pakistan  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that Kashmir would soon be part of  Pakistan, he retored, "It is their wish only."  *</p>

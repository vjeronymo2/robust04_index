			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Exotic spots for the future - Sara Webb reviews a survey of emerging markets Sri Lanka, Iceland, Iran and Uruguay have been tipped as a few of the more exotic emerging markets of the future, according to a recent survey* on investor attitudes to equity and bond markets, and some of the more adventurous international fund managers plan to invest in these countries within the next two years. They would also consider investing in Colombia, India and Israel. However, better-known emerging markets such as Portugal, Greece and South Korea are expected to attract the most new investment over the same timescale. The response to the survey, conducted by Euromoney Publications, suggests that rather than looking en masse for the next emerging market in which they might double their money in a year, institutional investors plan to remain conservative with regard to geographical diversification. Respondents said they were exposed to 16 out of the survey's list of 42 'emerging and sub-emerging' markets. Mexico and Portugal jointly led the list of emerging markets in which participants already invest, followed by South Africa, which the survey also classified as an emerging market. They were followed by Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil and Turkey. Respondents said they also invested in Argentina, Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, the Philippines and Venezuela. The survey points out that growing investor interest in the emerging markets will increase the demand for specialist analysts, thus creating new opportunities for the broking community. The report says: 'Almost certainly within five years, those investment banks which are currently revered for their research on French, German or Dutch equities will be aggressively competing for the top-ranked Polish and Czech equity analysts; shortly afterwards, they will presumably be doing the same for Russian and Ukrainian gurus.' The survey was based on the responses of 136 international institutional investors, including large insurance companies, pension funds and other fund managers responsible for managing a total of Dollars 1,759bn. *European Brokers &amp; Analysts Survey 1992 is produced by Euromoney Publications.</p>

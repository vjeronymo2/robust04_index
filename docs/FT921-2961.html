			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Telebras offering heralds batch of Brazilian deals TELEBRAS, the Brazilian telecommunications company, yesterday launched a Dollars 90m deal which heralds a further batch of offerings by Brazilian issuers. Brazil returned to the international capital markets last year as the perception of its debt improved on expectations that a Brady plan for the rescheduling of its foreign debt was close to agreement. When no agreement was reached, prices on Brazil's commercial debt fell sharply, but demand for fresh bond issues does not appear to have weakened. The five-year Telebras deal, arranged by Salomon Brothers, has a put option after three years, priced to yield 450 basis points over the three-year US Treasury. The deal included a 144a option for distribution in the US private placement market, but dealers said demand for this small deal was concentrated in Europe. Telebras is also planning to issue equity later in the year. Merrill Lynch has won the mandate to act as global co-ordinator of Telebras' offering of ADRs, expected to raise between Dollars 600m to Dollars 1.2bn. The ADRs will be listed and registered in New York, but placement is expected to be split between the US and the international market. Meanwhile, a number of other Brazilian bond offerings are in the pipeline: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the Brazilian iron ore company, is preparing to launch its second offering in the international capital markets. The Dollars 150m Eurobond, with a 144a option for placement in the US market, is expected to have a maturity of three years. CVRD returned to the international markets last year with a Dollars 200m deal maturing in 1994 with a put option in 1993, which has performed well. The spread between the yield to put and the comparable US Treasury has tightened to 234 basis points, compared with a 300 basis point yield spread to maturity. The new deal, arranged by Chase Investment Bank, is expected to emerge next month, with a tighter spread than yesterday's Telebras deal. Banco do Brasil, Brazil's state-run bank, is preparing a Dollars 150m three-year Eurobond. Credit Suisse First Boston is believed to have won the mandate for that deal.</p>

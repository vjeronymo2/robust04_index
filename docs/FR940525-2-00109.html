			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the probability or consequences of an accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not altered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except for providing an option to utilize a reduced test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration. A conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to the optional short duration test thus maintaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability of the pneumatic seal system. The proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated accidents, therefore the consequences of previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated accidents are not increased. The probability of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident is also unaffected because the seals are not a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident initiator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi assigned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the optional 8 hour door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capability of the door pneumatic seal system to maintain 65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> psig to the airlock seals, for a minimum of 15 days upon a loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of instrument air, is assured. Loss of plant supply air is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report] section 3.8.2.1.2 and plant specification 2C269SS0006. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure the pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromised, a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be assigned to the 8 hour test. With the conservative acceptance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria, the proposed change does not involve a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the margin of safety previously evaluated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wharton County Junior College, J.

The editorial changes would delete certain items that are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer applicable, would remove inconsistencies involving the names of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems and equipment and NSARC function, composition, and use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternates, and would correct the value for the reactor coolant system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume. Other editorial changes would be made for document format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency. The proposed amendment would affect the following TS Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tables: 1.31, 3.3.3.6, 3.4.1.2, 4.6.3.2, 3.7.1.2, 3/4 10.6, 5.4.2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.3, and 6.4, and Table 4.3&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff's review is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50.92(c)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed redefinition of the composition of the SORC would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diminish the effectiveness of the SORC and would continue to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the SORC has the desired experience and expertise to advise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Station Manager on all matters related to nuclear safety. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed change would permit operational flexibility and eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for an amendment whenever organizational changes occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed SQRP would not reduce the level of procedure review,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the SORC continues to retain responsibility to review any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document requiring an evaluation pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The SQRP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be limited to reviewing procedures that do not affect nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deleting the requirement to periodically review procedures would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diminish the review process for procedures since other programmatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements would continue to assure procedures are reviewed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised when necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): The aphoristic Norman Augustine Few captains of industry, it is safe to say, go dog-sledding in the Arctic or travel the Oregon Trail in a covered wagon, and still find the time to pen a book of business aphorisms. But then Norman Augustine, the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta, the US defence group, has never been altogether the average boss, writes Richard Tomkins. Last week he was in the news when Martin Marietta and Lockheed, two of the three biggest US defence contractors, announced that they were merging. Characteristically, where other industry executives would have rambled on about the synergistic benefits flowing from a merger of complementary corporate cultures, Augustine chose a different approach. 'The arithmetic is simple,' he said. 'Three full factories are better than six half-full factories.' A Princeton graduate who joined Martin Marietta in 1977 after two years at the Pentagon, Augustine signalled his loathing of cant - and simultaneously gained wider public consciousness - by publishing a Murphy's Law type of book, called Augustine's Laws, in 1983. One example: 'If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on top of each other, it can be assumed that disaster is not left to chance.' More recently, he has been credited with leading the badly-needed consolidation of the US defence industry through takeovers of General Electric's aerospace operations and General Dynamics' space systems business. Yet he will be neither chairman nor chief executive of the newly-formed Lockheed Martin: both jobs are going to Daniel Tellep, 62-year-old chairman and chief of the larger Lockheed group, while Augustine will have to make do with the lesser title of president. Still, Tellep insists that the two of them will work together as a team. And if this looks suspiciously like superimposing an extra management layer, it has been agreed that when Tellep retires - in, say, a couple of years' time  -Augustine will become chairman and chief executive.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Black warns Daily News of job losses MR CONRAD BLACK, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group, yesterday informed trade union leaders at the New York Daily News that he would want to cut 700 jobs if he acquired the newspaper. Mr George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a coalition of nine unions, said representatives of Mr Black mentioned the prospective job cuts at a 'get-to-know-you meeting.' Mr John Campi, spokesman for the Daily News, said that Mr Black on Tuesday submitted a bid for the famous New York tabloid acquired last year by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The bid was believed to be for Dollars 75m (Pounds 42m). Mr McDonald seemed untroubled by the job cuts mentioned by Mr Black's representatives. 'It's just a proposal. They'll say it's negotiable, otherwise we can't do business. Black wants the paper and we want our jobs,' he said. The unions gave up about 800 jobs last year when Mr Maxwell acquired the paper. Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of US News and World Report, is another prospective buyer of the Daily News.</p>

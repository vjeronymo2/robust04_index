			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK TROUNCES HARBOR, 44-0  </P> <P> Everything that Moorpark College did worked well for them. Conversely, nothing  Harbor College attempted to execute on the football field seemed to work.  </P> <P> The proof was in the final score. With Moorpark holding back the offense, the  host Raiders rolled to a 44-0 Western State Conference, Northern Division  victory over Harbor on Saturday.  </P> <P> Said Harbor Coach Don Weems: "I don't have anything to say. Moorpark is a good  team, just take a look at the scoreboard."  </P> <P> The game statistics show the frustration of Harbor (2-4, 1-4 in conference  play). The Seahawks had 39 rushes for a net gain of only 56 yards, and this  season's leading rusher, running back Bill Harris, managed only one net yard in  12 carries against a torrid Moorpark defense.  </P> <P> Moorpark (5-1, 4-1 in conference play), however, rushed 42 times for 278 yards,  with running back Freddie Bradley gaining 126 yards in only eight carries,  including an 83-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and backfield mate  Marc Monestime adding another 100 yards in 19 carries.  </P> <P> Moorpark quarterback Jayson Merrill completed 11 of 20 passes for 165 yards and  two touchdowns, while seeing action in only the first half of play. Merrill  tossed scoring strikes of 49 and 11 yards to wide receiver Peter Marine in the  second quarter to give the Raiders a 30-0 halftime lead.  </P></p>

At voting precincts formed in military units and at  sanatoriums, vacation lodges, and hospitals and other inpatient  treatment institutions, as well as in places where citizens are  in remote and not easily accessible rayons, the precinct  election commission may declare the voting over at any time, if  all the voters included in the roll have voted.  <H8>  Article 36. The Start of Voting </H8>   On election day the polling place opens when at least  two-thirds of the members of the precinct election commission  are present. The chairman in the presence of the members of the  election commission seals the ballot box, distributes the  ballots among the members of the election commission, and  announces the start of voting. The total number of ballots is  officially registered in a separate document.  <H8>  Article 37. Establishing the Voter's Identity </H8>   When a voter comes to the polls to vote, he presents a  document certifying his identity to a member of the precinct  election commission and signs the voter roll. After that he is  issued a ballot.    The surnames of the voters who for some reason are not  included on the voter roll are included in appendices to the  voter roll on the basis of a document certifying his identity,  citizenship, and place of residence.  <H8>  Article 38. The Voting Procedure </H8>   The ballot is filled out by the person voting in the booth  or  room for secret balloting. The presence of persons other than  the person voting is prohibited when he is filling out the  ballot. A voter who is unable to fill out the ballot on his own  has a right to use his discretion and invite a person other than  a member of the election commission into the booth or room.    During elections, the voter crosses out the surnames of the  candidates on the ballot whom he is voting against.    The person voting drops the completed ballot into the ballot  box.    A damaged ballot may be replaced if the voter requests.  Damaged ballots are to be counted and canceled and stored  separately.    A voter who is unable to be at the place of his residence on  election day may request an absentee ballot from the precinct  election commission at the place of his residence, make the  decisions, and leave the completed absentee ballot in the sealed  envelope of the election commission. When the absentee ballot is  received, the voter is entered on the voter roll. The  corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission  determines the form of the absentee ballot.    In cases where certain voters cannot go to the polls to vote  for health or other reasons, if these voters wish, the precinct  election commission instructs members of the election commission  to organize balloting at the place where these voters are.  <H8>  Article 39. Counting Votes at the Voting Precinct </H8>   When the voting is over and before the ballot boxes are  opened, the sealed envelopes with the absentee ballots are  dropped in the ballot boxes in the presence of the members of  the precinct commission. All the unused ballots are counted and  canceled by the precinct election commission.    The ballot boxes are opened by the precinct election  commission after the chairman of the commission has declared the  voting over. Opening the ballot boxes before the voting is over  is prohibited.    The precinct election commission determines the total number  of voters at the precinct and the number of voters who received  ballots and absentee ballots.    The votes at the voting precinct are counted by the precinct  election commission separately for each election district and  each candidate for deputy in elections to the corresponding  council of people's deputies.    On the basis of the ballots and absentee ballots which are  in  the ballot boxes, the commission (for each election district  within the boundaries of the given voting precinct) determines  the following:    the total number of voters who took part in the voting;    the number of votes cast for and the number of votes cast  against each candidate for deputy;    the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared  invalid.    Votes for the names of citizens added by voters to ballots  and absentee ballots are not counted.    Ballots and absentee ballots of the wrong type as well as  ballots and absentee ballots in which the names of more than one  candidate were left when voting are declared invalid. When it is  questionable whether a ballot or absentee ballot is valid or  not, the question is resolved by the precinct election  commission through a vote.    The results of the vote count are reviewed at the meeting of  the precinct election commission and recorded in the protocol  compiled for each election district. The protocol is signed by  the chairman, the deputy chairman, the secretary, and the other  members of the commission and submitted to the appropriate  district election commission.  <H8>  Article 40. Determining the Results of the Elections in the </H8> District    On the basis of the protocols of the precinct election  commissions, the district election commission determines the  following:    the total number of voters for the district;    the number of voters who received ballots and absentee  ballots;    the number of voters who took part in the voting;    the number of votes cast for and the number of votes cast  against each candidate for deputy;    the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared  invalid.    The results of the elections for the district are determined  at the meeting of the election commission and recorded in a  protocol. The protocol is signed by the chairman, the deputy  chairman, the secretary, and the other members of the commission  and is submitted to the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city  election commission.  <H8>  Article 41. Determining the Results of the Elections of </H8> Deputies    The corresponding oblast, rayon, and city election  commission  determines the following on the basis of the protocols of  district election districts received:    the total number of voters by oblast, rayon, and city;    the number of voters who received ballots and absentee  ballots;    the number of voters who took part in the voting;    the number of votes cast for and votes cast against each  candidate for deputy;    the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared  invalid.    A candidate for deputy who in the elections received more  than half the votes of voters who took part in the voting is  considered elected.    Elections are declared not to have taken place if less than  half the voters recorded on the voter rolls took part in them.    Elections overall for the oblast, rayon, or city or for  individual districts or for individual voting precincts may be  declared invalid because of violations permitted during the  elections which influenced the results of the voting. The  decision to declare the elections invalid is made by the  appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission and may  be appealed in court within 10 days from the day the results of  the elections are published.    In the event elections for certain precincts are declared  invalid by decision of the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city  election commission, the results of the voting for these  precincts are excluded from the overall results of the  elections, under the condition that without them the elections  as a whole may be declared to have taken place.    The appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission  makes up a protocol on the results of the elections and makes  the decision.  <H8>  Article 42. The Runoff </H8>   If more than two candidates for deputy ran for an election  district and none of them was elected, the district election  commission makes the decision to hold a runoff in the district  for the two candidates for deputy who received the largest  numbers of votes and informs the corresponding oblast, rayon,  and city election commission and district voters of this  decision. The runoff is conducted within 2 weeks and the  requirements of this Law are observed.    The candidate for deputy considered elected is the one who  received the largest number of votes of voters who took part in  the voting during the runoff in relation to the other candidate,  given that more than half the voters recorded in the rolls took  part in the voting and that the number of votes cast for this  candidate exceeds the number of votes cast against him.  <H8>  Article 43. Repeat Elections </H8>   Repeat elections are conducted in the following cases:    a) if the elections for the election district are declared  not to have taken place or invalid;    b) if a runoff vote did not allow determination of the  elected deputy;    c) if no more than two candidates for deputy ran for the  election district and neither one of them was elected;    d) if the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election  commission refused to register deputies for the reason indicated  in the third part of Article 45 of this Law.    Repeat elections are conducted by the district election  commission at the instruction of the appropriate oblast, rayon,  or city election district. And the appropriate oblast, rayon, or  city election commission may make the decision that it is  necessary for district and precinct election commissions  consisting of new members to hold repeat elections. The voting  is done at the same voting precincts and based on the voter  rolls compiled for holding the main elections.    A person who was nominated and registered as a candidate for  deputy while the main elections were being held may not be  nominated as a candidate for deputy to that council of people's  deputies during repeat elections in this and other districts.    Repeat elections are held within no more than a month after  the main elections. The formation of election commissions, the  registration of candidates for deputy, and other measures are  conducted in the manner established by this Law.  <H8>  Article 44. Conducting Elections of Deputies To Replace </H8> Those Who Have Withdrawn    In the event a particular council of people's deputies  declares the authority of certain deputies invalid, or in the  event the deputy is recalled or deputy authority is terminated  early for other reasons, new elections are held in that election  district within 2 months from the moment the deputy withdraws.  The elections are set by that council of people's deputies no  later than a month before they are to be held and are organized  in compliance with the requirements of this Law. In this case a  corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission is not  formed. The district election commission performs its functions.  The district election commission is formed 25 days and precinct  election commissions are formed 15 days before the elections.  Registration of candidates for deputy ends 15 days before the  elections.    In the event a deputy withdraws less than 6 months before  the  term of office of the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city  council of people's deputies is over, elections of a new deputy  to replace the one who withdrew cannot be held.  <H5>  VIII. Registration of Deputies and Publication of the </H5> Results of Elections  <H8>  Article 45. Registration of Deputies </H8>   Based on the protocols of the district election commissions  which it has received, the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city  election commission registers the elected deputies and informs  them of this.    Persons indicated in the second part of Article 23 of this  Law who are elected deputies to a particular oblast, rayon, or  city council of people's deputies must inform the corresponding  oblast, rayon, or city election commission in writing that they  are surrendering their duties which are incompatible with the  status of deputy.    No candidates for deputy from a political party may be  registered as deputies of a particular oblast, rayon, or city  council of people's deputies if they received a total of less  than 5 percent of the votes of all the voters of the  corresponding oblast, rayon, or city which participated in the  voting.  <H8>  Article 46. Publication of the Results of the Elections of </H8> Deputies    The corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission  publishes a report on the results of the elections to the  oblast, rayon, or city council of people's deputies and a list  of deputies elected within 10 days after the elections; the list  is in alphabetical order and gives the surnames, names, and  patronymics, year of birth, party affiliation, post occupied  (type of job), place of work, place of residence, and the number  and name of the election district.  <H5>  IX.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR EXPANSION OF MAGNET SCHOOL PROGRAM OKD IN L.A.  </P> <P> Responding to pressure to provide more magnet schools, particularly in minority  neighborhoods, the Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday approved a major  expansion of the district's prized network of specialized learning centers that  many parents believe are superior to regular schools.  </P> <P> The board voted 6-0 to add 32 new magnet programs to the current 87 over the  next two years, beginning with eight this fall. The largest single expansion of  the magnet network since 1982, the new programs could provide space for an  estimated 6,500 students. Currently, about 27,000 of the district's 595,000  students attend magnet programs.  </P> <P> District officials said they recommended expanding the magnet programs because  of the huge demand from parents and because of criticism that not enough of the  specialized programs were located in predominantly minority neighborhoods.  Magnet schools are heavily concentrated in middle-class, largely Anglo areas of  the Westside, the West San Fernando Valley and the South Bay.  </P> <P> "The ethnic pattern of those seats (in magnet programs) tells a story of  institutional racism," said board member Leticia Quezada. If poor children  "wanted access to an enriched curriculum, they had to travel to other  neighborhoods, while other children were told that they could have that  enriched curriculum in their own neighborhood."  </P> <P> Magnet schools focus on specific academic areas -- such as science or the arts  -- or on special teaching methods. There are also magnet schools that are only  for gifted students. Students in most magnet programs score higher on state and  district standardized tests than students in regular schools, but there are  long waiting lists to get into the classes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Response to Desegregation Suit  </P> <P> The magnet programs originated as a response to a desegregation lawsuit against  the district, with the first schools established in the early 1970s to  encourage voluntary integration. Any district student may apply, but priority  for admission is determined on the basis of several factors, including  ethnicity and whether a student's neighborhood school is crowded or racially  unbalanced.  </P> <P> The programs have been controversial, however, with some critics contending  that they are elitist and deprive other schools of badly needed resources. In  addition, as an integration tool the programs have achieved only moderate  success, with most inner-city magnets enrolling 10% or less Anglo students.  </P> <P> Enrollment at most district magnet programs is based on a 60/40 ethnic ratio  guideline in which neither Anglos nor minorities should hold more than 60% of  the places. However, the ethnic ratio at the 32 new programs will allow  enrollment of up to 70% Anglos or minorities depending on the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The first phase of the expansion will provide spaces for 1,624 students this  fall and as many as 4,900 additional openings in 1990. But the demand for  magnet schools continues to exceed the supply, even with the expansion. The  waiting list this year alone has ranged between 10,000 and 19,000 students,  according to Richard Battaglia, an adviser in the district's magnet office.  </P> <P> It will cost $4.7 million to open the first eight new magnet schools, according  to district figures. About $3.4 million will be paid by the state under a  program to reimburse districts for voluntary integration efforts. District  funds will cover the remaining costs.  </P> <P> Among the eight new magnet programs scheduled to open this September are  programs for gifted students at Euclid Elementary in East Los Angeles, at North  Hollywood High School, and at Adams Junior High and Crenshaw High in  South-Central Los Angeles. Programs emphasizing math and science will be  established at Teresa Hughes Elementary in South-Central Los Angeles, South  Gate Elementary in South Gate and Windsor Hills Elementary in South Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> At Allesandro Elementary in Northeast Los Angeles, the district plans a program  based on a teaching method called cooperative learning, in which students work  in teams to solve problems and master basic concepts. An increasingly popular  teaching technique nationally, cooperative learning already is practiced by  many Los Angeles teachers, an official said. Proponents of the approach say it  helps build students' confidence and self-esteem and reduce conflicts because  it teaches students to work together.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW MAGNET SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday approved a two-stage expansion of  the district's magnet school program. Eight new magnets will open in September  and 24 others in September, 1990, according to the plan. Below are the schools  and their locations. Stage I programs include the school's specialized  curriculum. Areas of emphasis for Stage II programs will be determined later.  </P> <P> STAGE I  </P> <P> Allesandro Elementary -- Cooperative Learning -- Northeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Euclid Elementary -- Gifted/High Ability/Bilingual -- East Los Angeles  </P> <P> Teresa Hughes Elementary -- Math/Science -- South-Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> South Gate 1 Elementary -- Math/Science  </P> <P> Windsor Hills Elementary -- Math/Science/Aerospace -- South Los Angeles  </P> <P> Adams Junior High -- High Ability/Foreign Language -- South-Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> Crenshaw High -- Highly Gifted, Gifted/High Ability -- South Los Angeles  </P> <P> North Hollywood High -- Highly Gifted  </P> <P> STAGE II  </P> <P> Brainard Elementary -- East San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Buchanan Elementary -- Northeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Castelar Elementary -- Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> Graham Elementary -- Southeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Hillside Elementary -- Northeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Miramonte Elementary -- Southeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Plasencia Elementary -- Northeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Pio Pico Elementary -- Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> San Jose Elementary -- East San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> 24th Street Elementary -- South-Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> Utah Elementary -- East Los Angeles  </P> <P> Edison Junior High -- Southeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> LeConte Junior High -- Hollywood  </P> <P> Madison Junior High -- East San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Muir Junior High -- South-Central Los Angeles  </P> <P> Nightingale Junior High -- Northeast Los Angeles  </P> <P> Reed Junior High -- East San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Van Nuys Junior High -- East San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Gardena High  </P> <P> Lincoln Medical High -- East Los Angeles  </P> <P> Monroe High -- West San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Sylmar High  </P> <P> Westchester High  </P> <P> Wilson High -- East Los Angeles  </P></p>

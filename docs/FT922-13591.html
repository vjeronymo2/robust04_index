			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Blue Arrow judge steps down THE JUDGE in the first Blue Arrow trial, who joined calls for a fundamental review of the way complex fraud cases should be handled by the courts, is stepping down, the Lord Chancellor's Department confirmed yesterday. Mr Justice Brooke, another High Court judge, will take the place of Mr Justice McKinnon, who presided over the year-long trial. Mr Justice Brooke will preside over the two further Blue Arrow trials which are expected. The department yesterday said that after a year running the first trial, Mr Justice McKinnon deserved a break. When the first trial ended in February with four convicted financial advisers being given suspended sentences, Mr Justice McKinnon said the lengthy proceedings had placed an unacceptable burden on all concerned. Trial by jury in such cases would be threatened unless their presentation was improved, he warned. Mr Justice Brooke had a long record at the commercial Bar before being appointed a judge, and was an inspector for the Department of Trade and Industry during its investigation into House of Fraser, the stores group. He will take over Blue Arrow on April 29th when the Serious Fraud Office will ask him for proceedings against the remaining four defendants to be split into two trials.</p>

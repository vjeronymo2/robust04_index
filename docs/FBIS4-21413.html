			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "Feature": "Guangzhou in Green Deficit"] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou, one of  the Chinese cities with the most dynamic economy, is now in a  green deficit.    While roads are getting wider and skyscrapers are rising  higher, trees and lawns are becoming rare in this capital of  south Guangdong Province.    Even kapok, the city flower that once bloomed into a  beautiful vision of red all over Guangzhou, is taking a good  search to find.    Sources from the city bureau of parks and woods said the  number of kapoks totals a mere 1,200 in the old town. Most of  them are in streets and lanes too out-of-the-way to be seen by  visitors.    The expansion of Dongfeng Road is regarded as one of the  biggest and most successful projects in urban construction. It  now runs from the east to the west end of the city and makes  traffic much smoother.    However, walking, cycling or driving right under the  scorching summer sun seems to be as irritating as sitting in the  bygone traffic jams, and makes citizens long for the cool shadow  of the trees that had lined the road for more than 25 years.    The sources said that more than one-third of the trees in  the  old town have disappeared in road expansion works in the past  few years.    Experts from the bureau complained that the government and  city planners seem to regard trees and lawns as mere decorative  touches that can be easily obliterated whenever they come into  conflict with construction.    For nearly ten years, the city's annual spending on the  green  cause has stagnated between two to three million yuan, which  falls far short of a reasonable necessity, the experts claimed.    Considering that many Chinese cities are facing the same  problem, the experts urged that China's city planners and  officials should learn more from their foreign counterparts, and  give more space to green land in the concrete jungle.    The experts estimate that Guangzhou will need to invest over  500 million yuan before it can provide each citizen with five  square meters of green land, as it plans.    Understanding that the city government alone can hardly  supply all of the money, the experts called for all sectors of  society to take actions before the green deficit becomes a green  crisis.</p>

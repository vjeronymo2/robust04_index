			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Leyland may offer low-cost production base TRUCKMAKERS are accustomed to lurching from feast to famine, but as the industry heads into one of its leanest periods on record, any potential buyer for Leyland-Daf - or parts of it - will have to think hard before taking the plunge, in spite of the company's attractions. The company has a highly regarded pan-European distribution network with around 1,300 sales and service outlets. Access to such a distribution system would be highly valued by any truck producer seeking to enter the European market from outside the region. Leyland-Daf has a share of nearly 8 per cent of the west European truck market, putting it in sixth place, but it is in the UK that it has established a commanding presence since its takeover of Leyland Vehicles in 1987. At the same time Leyland-Daf has a relatively modern truck range and has made substantial investments in new products in the last two years. Last year it launched a new range of medium/heavy duty trucks, the 75/85 series, which was the result of a four-year investment programme worth more than Pounds 170m. Last autumn Leyland-Daf began a search for a 'strategic alliance' and began negotiations with Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany. Mercedes-Benz quickly insisted that it was not willing to take an equity stake in Leyland-Daf, but it has admitted that detailed negotiations have taken place over an exchange of components or products. Leyland-Daf's operations in the UK represent a mixed challenge for any buyer. The plant at Leyland, Lancashire, is relatively modern, produces a competitive range of light-duty trucks, and has a large potential capacity. It could offer an attractive low-cost production base in Europe, in particular for producers with a high cost base in Germany. By contrast, the van operation in Birmingham appears much more at risk. The plant, formerly British Leyland's Freight Rover van operation, is old and the product range is also rather out-of-date in spite of recent efforts to revamp it. The future of this plant is in question. Leyland-Daf entered a joint venture with Renault of France three years ago to develop a new van range for the mid 1990s. Around 50 Renault engineers are working in Birmingham, and the two companies have formed a joint venture, Van Technology, to develop the new product. Renault said yesterday it was studying the 'repercussions' on the van project of Leyland-Daf's problems. Privately Renault has been well aware of the growing financial crisis at Leyland-Daf and has been seeking to prepare contingency plans. The truck operations are most likely to be rescued from outside Europe. Paccar, the US producer, showed a strong interest in a possible deal with Leyland Vehicles when British Leyland was seeking to shed the truck and van operations in 1986-87, before the merger was finally agreed with Leyland-Daf. However, Paccar has only a minor presence in the European market through Foden, the specialist UK heavy truck maker. The pan-European distribution network with its particular expertise in heavy trucks could also provide the entry ticket to Europe for one of the leading Japanese producers, Hino (Toyota), Nissan Diesel, Mitsubishi or Isuzu. The Japanese presence in the European heavy truck industry is negligible and analysts have always argued that the lack of a pan-European service network would make such entry prohibitively expensive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nelson Mandela has dampened expectations  about South Africa's new role in Africa. Speaking on his  arrival in Tunis for the OAU summit meeting, Mr. Mandela said  South Africa's capabilities for meeting requests from other  African countries were limited. He pointed out that the new  government was still finding its feet.    Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is  expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in  Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be  dominated by the Rwandan question. Other issues expected to be  discussed by the leaders of the 53 member states are Africa's  enormous debt, ethnic conflict, religious tension, the rise of  Islamic fundamentalism, and the failure of economic institutions  in some regions.    President Mandela held talks with King Hassan of Morocco on  his way to Tunis. He first visited Tunisia in 1962 to ask for  MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  soldiers to be trained.    Earlier the OAU ministers conference decided to ask the UN  to  lift the sanctions imposed on Libya because of the Locherbie  bomb blast.    South Africa's foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, attended the  meeting for the first time.</p>

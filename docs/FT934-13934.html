			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (1): Russia is in the market - Amid continuing recession, the industry is trying to adjust to the deluge of metal exported by former Soviet producers notorious for low wages and high pollution levels. Prices have plummeted, thousands of employees have been laid off, and new capacity has been cancelled or mothballed THE WORLD aluminium industry is adjusting painfully to what Mr A Stephens Hutchcraft, president of Kaiser Aluminum of the US, describes as 'the new reality'. He says: 'The new reality is that Russia and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States are now part of the world supply/demand structure and will be an integral part of our industry. If we ignore that fact, we do so at our peril.' The industry is floundering because, in the words of Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Company of America, the world's biggest producer, governments have failed to find 'a mechanism to deal with the economic consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union'. Turmoil created by the collapse of the rusting iron curtain has helped to drive down aluminium prices to their lowest level in real terms so that virtually every smelter in the west is not even covering its cash costs of production. Smelters are being shut, thousands of employees laid off and virtually all plans for new smelters have been either abandoned or shelved. The stresses are most severe in Europe where production costs are highest. 'About 85 per cent of the world's smelters are losing money - that's terrible. And I fear the lights are going out in European smelters,' says Mr Karl Wobbe, management board member responsible for production at VAW of Germany. Yet at the end of the 1980s the aluminium industry in the west seemed to be striding confidently down a road to increasing prosperity. Demand for aluminium has been moving ahead by an average 3 per cent a year, with growth in all the main markets: construction, packaging, transportation (trains, aircraft and automobiles) and electricals. The greatest potential for immediate growth is in packaging - aluminium is easy to sterilise for food and medical applications, it is an excellent barrier against liquids, vapours and light, it is non-toxic and imparts no taste or odour. In the US nearly every fizzy drink and beer can is made of aluminium. Longer term there is potentially enormous growth to come from the use of much more aluminium in cars. The amount of the metal in the average car has doubled from 32kg (70 1/2 lbs) in the late 1970s to 68kg (150 lbs) and even the most conservative industry forecasts see it doubling again by 2010. In the US this trend is being driven by ever-tightening fuel economy targets set by the government. Aluminium's light weight enables car makers to meet these targets without reducing the size of their vehicles. In Europe the move to aluminium has much to do with recycling  - its relatively high value makes it the ideal recyclable material. Recession in much of the industrialised world has restricted demand since 1990, but even so last year aluminium consumption in the west still rose 2.9 per cent to 15.4m tonnes. Spurred into action by this gap between supply and demand, producers since 1991 have permanently closed 420,000 tonnes of capacity and temporarily shut down another 1.52m tonnes. Therefore the western market would have been in balance and ready to emerge from the recession from a strong base. But then came an unexpected surge in imports of metal from the CIS, from 200,000 tonnes before 1990 to about 1m. The availability of all this CIS metal testifies to the stark contrast in conditions in the former Soviet Union and western markets. About half the aluminium produced in the CIS was delivered to military and aerospace customers. The unfreezing of the cold war has seen that particular demand virtually disappear. Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing at VAW, suggests aluminium consumption in Russia alone dropped from 2.6m tonnes in 1998 and 1.8m tonnes last year. Shortages of aluminium developed in the republics because Russia and some other parts of the CIS can produce top-quality aluminium which is readily converted into dollars. Some western observers were convinced that chaotic conditions and raw materials shortages would cut CIS aluminium output substantially last year. But international traders stepped in with barter deals to keep the industry going. For example, Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals, says his company, which claims to be the biggest trader of CIS aluminium, helped 'kick-start' production at two smelters by providing cash to improve the flow of alumina, an essential raw material. Trans-World also invested in port facilities in the far east of Siberia to bring alumina into the CIS and get aluminium out. VAW's Mr Peters points out that the low technical standard at many CIS smelters - most of them use out-dated Soderberg technology - enables their own workshops to make spare parts to keep the equipment operating. Consequently, CIS aluminium production last year was fairly stable and, at 2.7m tonnes, only 10 per cent below the 2.9m tonnes achieved in 1988. What does this add up to if the east and west industries are combined? It is clear that another 1.5m tonnes of production capacity - equivalent to six modern smelters - needs to be shut if supply is to be brought back into balance with demand. The need for a structural change of this size was bound to create tension in the industry. This boiled over in August when the European Commission ruled that the very fast growth in aluminium imports from the CIS had caused 'serious damage' to EC producers and it imposed some restrictions on imports. This action was widely criticised because aluminium is a global commodity and CIS metal would simply be diverted from the EC to other markets, to be replaced in the EC with aluminium from other sources. But the Commission did not expect its restrictions to have much impact on the flow of aluminium round the world. Its move was a political gesture - one serious enough to bring the CIS producers to the negotiating table. Neither did the Commission believe Europe should act in isolation. It always wanted other big aluminium producing countries to take part in discussions about the problems caused by CIS metal. It achieved these initial objectives and a series of multilateral discussions, involving CIS producers and trade representatives from the EC, Canada and the US, are to take place this autumn. The EC has been emphasising at initial meetings with the CIS producers the two-way nature of its proposals. In exchange for some CIS export restraint, European producers would be willing to help modernise the CIS industry, to help launch new semi-fabricated and fabricated products to stimulate demand for aluminium in the republics and the Community might possibly find some cash to help this process. Part of the Commission's explanation for restricting CIS imports (to 60,000 tonnes between August and the end of November) was: 'Aluminium produced in the CIS enjoys the huge advantage of artificially low energy prices and environmental standards that are far less strict than those in western countries.' Nobody disputes that environmental standards in most CIS smelters are appalling. If Russia's own regulations were imposed all its smelters would close down. As for costs, the Russians claim they produce aluminium for about Dollars 500 a tonne. But energy costs have been heavily subsidised and labour rates range from one US cent to two cents a lb - less than those in most developing countries. Industry consultant Mr Anthony Bird estimated half-way through 1992 that, aided by these 'astonishly low' input prices, CIS smelters were producing aluminium for about 25 US cents a lb (about Dollars 550 a tonne) - well below the 53.6 cents average for smelters in the rest of the world. But the outlook for the CIS industry is changing. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund the Russian government is trying to lift energy prices to the international level in stages. And, according to VAW's Mr Peters, an energy price increase the government has recently been attempting to impose would raise the operating costs of the republic's smelters to an average of Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above the recently-prevailing international price. Smelters unable to cover their costs would quickly have to close because they could not pay for raw materials, he said. In any event,'cost pressures will force CIS smelters to modernise or to close'. Those cost pressures, particularly from rising energy prices, are also being felt in the west. It was only a matter of time before the high-cost smelters in central Europe shut permanently to leave the business to countries with low-cost and renewable hydro-electric power, such as Canada and Venezuela. The prolonged period of extremely low prices the industry is presently enduring is simply speeding up the process. Low prices and the turmoil caused by CIS imports are also holding back investment in new smelter projects in the west. Banks would want to see the aluminium price at between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 1,700 a tonne - nearly 50 per cent above recent depressed levels - before offering loans for new smelters, according to Mr Louis Vincinguerra, a general partner at Banque Rothschild in France. Only at that level would new smelters cover their full costs. He suggests that prices would return to the necessary levels if the industry - east and west - closed 1.5m tonnes of annual capacity. Eastern European producers should contribute to these cuts, he says. 'They must learn that it is better to sell less aluminium at significantly higher prices.'</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / EU's airlines face flying with less aid The long-awaited report by the 'committee of wise men' on the future of the European Union's airline industry due out tomorrow is expected to call for greater competition, heavy cost-cutting and tougher curbs on state aid. It is also believed to rule out creation of a special fund to prop up the region's ailing airline industry beyond what is already available under the European Union's social fund. The European Commission ordered the creation of a committee of wise men last summer to analyse and propose possible cures for the crisis in the industry, which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) in 1992. The group was headed by Mr Herman de Croo, former Belgian transport minister. It also included representatives of the travel and tourism industry, as well as trade unions. Its recommendations may draw fire from state-owned carriers such as Air France, Italy's Alitalia and Belgium's Sabena who remain worried about progress toward US-style deregulation. During hearings last autumn, this French-led coalition called for a freeze on air capacity to prevent the slump in air fares. They also argued that some financial aid was necessary to help them restructure and tackle low-cost US competition. On the other hand, a UK-led group of airlines is expected to use the report to press for an extension of the 'open skies' regime and a ban on government subsidies to national flag-carriers. The report itself does not rule out state aid, but suggests that it should be granted only in very limited circumstances. Last year the Commission authorised a IPounds 175m (Pounds 167m) equity injection by the Irish government into Aer Lingus, but attached strict conditions. The report's findings are non-binding and will be discussed at an informal meeting of EU transport ministers in Athens on February 7.</p>

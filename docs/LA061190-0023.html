			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG SURFERS  </P> <P> In response to Linda Blandford's column "Golden Boys, Princes of Darkness,"  Commentary, May 14:  </P> <P> On April 14, a deputy was called to Salt Creek Beach because of juveniles  throwing water balloons. The deputy contacted the proprietor of the concession  stand who had called about the incident.  </P> <P> The deputy was told a group of juveniles were involved with throwing water  balloons at beach-goers and yelling obscenities. The juveniles had dispersed  and could not be identified or located by the proprietor.  </P> <P> The deputy remained at the concession stand and contacted two juveniles and  questioned their possible involvement. Their information was documented for  further reference. The deputy handled the situation properly and  professionally.  </P> <P> Linda Blandford, a free-lance writer, was at the beach during the disturbance.  She confronted the deputy and wanted him to contact some additional juveniles  who were in the ocean surfing with numerous others. Blandford was not sure  these juveniles were involved in the incident, but she "thought" they might  have been.  </P> <P> The deputy had no reason, based on this reporter's information, to contact  these two young men, nor was such contact possible. Subsequently, in a frenzy  of literary misstatement of fact, Blandford's diatribe appeared in The Times.  </P> <P> It is unfortunate to have any disturbance of this type at our beaches. Linda  Blandford has documented her experience based on emotion, not merit and fact.  </P> <P> DENNIS W. LaDUCER  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff, Chief of Operations  </P> <P> Orange County  </P></p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Dish sales down on year and month: FT Satellite Monitor SATELLITE dish sales reached 71,000 last month compared with 96,000 in April last year, according to the latest FT Satellite Monitor. The figure was down from March - when the cricket world cup was shown - and 94,000 dishes were sold. April's installations bring the number of satellite dishes in the UK to 2.443m, which means they have been installed in 10.9 per cent of homes. According to Continental Research, which produces the Monitor, intentions to install have also dropped. That is attributed to the onset of spring weather, which leads people to think more of outdoor activities as a source of spending. In March 2.2m households without dishes said they intended to install them; the figure dropped to just over 2m in April. The Monitor estimates total market potential - those already with dishes and those intending to install - is now 4.5m, or one in five of all British households. That figure is up from 3.5m a year ago. The latest Broadcasters' Audience Research Board figures show that for the last week of April the fall in share of viewing taken by Sky Sports  - part of BSkyB in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake - has been taken up mainly by the BBC rather than other satellite channels.</p>

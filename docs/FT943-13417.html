			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Turkey-Russia debt deal Turkey and Russia agreed terms yesterday to settle a Dollars 480m (Pounds 308m) debt under which Ankara will be repaid in cash and barter over the next two years. The debt represents credit lines provided by Turkey's Export Import Bank to finance Russia's imports of Turkish goods and construction services, on the back of a 1984 natural gas protocol, under which Turkey takes delivery of Russian gas in exchange for supply of goods and services. The agreement envisages Turkey will be repaid Dollars 90m in cash by the end of September and a further Dollars 100m before the end of 1996. In addition, it will take goods worth Dollars 100m in 1994, and the balance of goods over the next two years.</p>

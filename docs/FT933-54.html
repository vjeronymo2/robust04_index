			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Lower futures and bonds restrain Dow Wall Street US STOCKS ended little changed across the board yesterday after declining stock index futures and bond prices kept a lid on investor enthusiasm, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.28 up at 3,566.30. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.41 down at 460.12, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.49 to 763.17. New York SE volume was 277.8m shares. Although prices got off to a positive start, with the Dow climbing 10 points in the first hour of trading, the markets were unable to sustain their early momentum. Two factors brought stocks back down from their highs: lower bond prices (by late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government issue was down three-quarters of a point and the yield up to 5.987 per cent) and falling stock index futures. Traders said the latter was caused by the failure of the S &amp; P 500 stock index contract to push through a technical resistance level. The day's only economic news - a small upward revision in the second-quarter gross domestic product figure from 1.8 per cent growth to 1.9 per cent - failed to lift sentiment. Investors will get a better idea of the state of the economy today and tomorrow when personal income and consumption figures and the September purchasing managers' report are released. Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 79 1/2 in busy trading after Blockbuster Entertainment announced it was investing Dollars 600m in Viacom, which is attempting to buy Paramount. The news left Blockbuster Dollars  1/4 easier at Dollars 29 and Viacom down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 59 1/2 . QVC, which has also made a bid for Paramount, firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 59 5/8 on the Nasdaq market. Leading technology stocks, some of which have been in demand lately, ran into concerted selling pressure. Motorola fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 101 5/8 , Digital Equipment gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 37 and IBM slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 . Rising crude oil prices lifted oil shares. Chevron moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 97, Mobil Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 , Exxon Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/2 . Phillips Petroleum advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 7/8 after the company announced a new oil find off the Louisiana shore. Anadarko Petroleum, up Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 47 1/8 , and Amoco, Dollars 2 1/2 stronger at Dollars 57 7/8 , are partners in the oil field. Among Nasdaq stocks, Braintree Savings Bank jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 16 1/2 after the company said it was in preliminary merger talks with an unnamed bank. Aames Financial plunged Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 8 3/8 after issuing a profits warning that surprised analysts. Canada TORONTO finished a sluggish trading session mildly higher as investors continued to hug the sidelines amid election and currency worries. The TSE 300 index added 4.3 at 3,983.2 and rises led declines by 379 to 324 after volume of 55.3m shares. Eight of the 14 stock groups lost ground, however, led by transportation, which fell 2.06 per cent. Mining, industrial products and golds declined, but the energy sector advanced 2.30 per cent.</p>

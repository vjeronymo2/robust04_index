			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Friday [10 June] reconfirmed the importance of seeking  China's influence in solving the North Korean nuclear issue,  Foreign Ministry officials said.    Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary of state for political  affairs, agreed with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need  to make efforts to seek China's agreement to solve the problem  diplomatically, the officials said.    Turning to bilateral trade relations, Kakizawa told Tarnoff  in a 15-minute meeting he has had close contact with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor and he wants to make the trade  "framework" talks successful based on mutual trust.    Tarnoff said he hopes progress will be made in the trade  talks, noting the importance of coordination between Japan and  the U.S. on a wide range of issues, including political and  security matters.    Tarnoff arrived for talks in Japan Thursday and is scheduled  to meet Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda later in the day  before leaving for Seoul.</p>

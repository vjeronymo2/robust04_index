			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Metal regains its shine: After a long period in the doldrums, aluminium prices are soaring Road signs are going missing. So are bridge rails. They could be aluminium, and sharp price rises in the past six months have made aluminium worth stealing. In a sharp turnaround, prompted by production cuts, rising demand and investment fund interest, aluminium prices have risen 54 per cent since last November. Less than a year ago prices were at an all-time low in real terms and the industry was suffering. Producers worldwide were experiencing heavy financial losses. More than half the west's aluminium smelters were not even covering their day-to-day operating costs. 'It seemed that, if the end of the world wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it would certainly come next week,' said Mr Lloyd O'Carroll, economist at Reynolds Metals of the US, the world's third largest aluminium group. The industry's woes were not caused by the recession. Demand for aluminium has reached record levels every year since 1984, on the back of rapid growth in the use of cans and foil and steady growth in demand from the construction industry and transport manufacturing. This continued in Asia when most of the industrialised world moved into recession. What took the industry by surprise was a massive rise in aluminium exports from Russia, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. Russian aluminium exports to the west tripled in 1991 to 1m tonnes, and rose to 2m tonnes in both 1992 and 1993. In less than two years the supply of aluminium in the west had risen by 13 per cent. Adjusting to the rise in Russian exports has taken three years. Producers delayed output cuts, initially because they lacked information on the volume of the new supply, and because they believed the Russian industry could not survive. As a result, global stocks increased rapidly - aluminium held in London Metal Exchange-authorised warehouses across the world climbed to a record 2.5m tonnes, compared with a former average of about 150,000 tonnes. This glut inevitably pushed prices down. Last November the LME aluminium price had dropped to Dollars 1,036 a tonne, from Dollars 2,204 in 1989 just before the Russian export surge. Since then, aluminium producers have announced plans to cut 1.25m tonnes of capacity, either permanently or temporarily. They have been prompted by an unprecedented trade agreement between the European Union and five of the largest aluminium producing countries, Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the US. The memorandum of understanding, signed in Brussels in February, identified a global oversupply of 1.5m-2m tonnes a year, and suggested cuts at that level for between 18 months and two years to restore the balance of supply and demand. Russia agreed that if cuts were made in the west, it would cut output, by 500,000 tonnes a year. Although Russia and western producers are unlikely to deliver all the cuts that were hoped for, the deal laid the groundwork for a recovery in the market. It attracted the attention of the investment funds, which saw it as the precursor to a recovery in prices. With bond prices falling and the stock markets weak, funds began buying aluminium and copper on the LME. 'The funds' intervention was unprecedented and incredible in its size and volume,' says Mr Roger Scott-Taggart, director of research at Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminium group. 'It was beautifully timed and their analysis that the aluminium market was due for a swift recovery spot on. 'People in the industry, peering over the rim of the trenches, didn't believe there would be a serious recovery this year. But the funds created that recovery on the back of a much better market balance.' In the past six months, the rate of growth in industrial demand for aluminium has risen sharply, led by soaring demand in the US and earlier-than-expected recoveries in Europe and Japan. During the recession, the growth in global demand slowed from 3 per cent a year to 1.5 per cent. Mr O'Carroll of Reynolds suggests that western world aluminium consumption is set to rise by 7 per cent in 1994 to 16.7m tonnes. Over the medium term, Mr O'Carroll forecasts that annual growth could reach 3-5 per cent, fuelled by the growing popularity of aluminium beverage cans, and the shift in the car industry from steel and cast iron to aluminium. A year ago, producers feared they were not going to survive. Today, they are a happy crowd. At today's price of more than Dollars 1,600 a tonne, nearly every smelter in the world can operate profitably.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marco Ventura: "Occhetto Wants Ciampi at the </F> Quirinale"]    [Text] Rome -- For the past few days the PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] has kept silent about Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.  This confirms that a bargain has been struck: The former Bank  of Italy governor can now start training to jog his way up to  the Quirinale [President's Palace]. On the other hand, Palazzo  Chigi [prime minister's office] would now open its doors to [IRI  (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) President] Romano  Prodi.    This changeover is expected to take place after the 27 March  elections -- Sisde [scandal allowing. It is the voters who will  indicate the timing and the way in which it is carried out. The  coupling of the two politicians is indissolubly linked to the  vote. In order for it to be possible, the progressives must win.  However, they must win with a percentage that forces them to  join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian  People's Party (PPI) secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Basically,  this you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours arrangement looks  set to be the ideal result of an agreement between left-wing  forces and Mino [Martinazzoli] and Mariotto [Segni's] centrists:  a left-wing Catholic -- Prodi -- for prime minister, and a  personality capable of vouching politically for the PDS for  seven long years -- Ciampi -- as head of state. Is this  political fiction?    In order to explain the maneuvering currently under way, we  must start with [PDS Secretary] Occhetto. Together with PDS  Deputy Secretary Massimo D'Alema, the PDS secretary has become a  TV globetrotter. Massimo paid a visit to [Fininvest talk show  host] Costanzo, and Achille [Occhetto] hurried off to be  [Fininvest talk show host] Funari's guest. D'Alema also payed  Funari a visit, and Occhetto evened the score by meeting [RAI  talk show host] Minoli. Fair enough, the tandem is faced with  the task of explaining, to millions of Italians, the difference  between "being under investigation" and "being reported."  However, it was precisely in the course of the political and  judiciary tour that Occhetto, in response to a question, said:  "For us, Ciampi is a reserve of democracy."    At first, everybody considered Carlo Azeglio a dignified  reserve player for the Palazzo Chigi, where he already occupies  a seat anyway. This hypothesis is becoming increasingly  improbable. Ciampi could continue to be prime minister if the  progressives were to win massive support in the elections.  Basically, the former governor would remain at the head of the  new government for a few months, long enough to make Italians  digest the victory of the former communists, in order to then  pass on command directly to Occhetto. However, judging from the  opinion polls, it is unlikely that the left forces will win more  than 40 percent of the vote. Assuming the coalition made up by  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [League leader] Bossi, and  [National Alliance Secretary] Fini does not achieve more than 50  percent, the PDS will be forced to seek the support of the  Center's survivors -- Martinazzoli and Mariotto -- in order to  be able to govern. This is, in fact, the objective of the plan  which many are engaged in putting together behind the scenes:  Prodi thrown in the bargain to keep the People's Party happy,  and ferry-man Ciampi providing the maximum guarantee for the  PDS. There is no lack of small and large signals pointing to  the resurrection of the accord between the Catholics and the  PDS. A case in point is the appointment of Mario Sarcinelli to  head the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which was welcomed by  Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] and even sponsored by the  PDS, just as Renato Riverso's upcoming nomination as chairman of  the national airline company Alitalia. Riverso is favored by  Ciampi and Prodi. The latter would also be getting ready to  wipe the slate clean at the STET [Turin Telephone Finance  Company] by replacing Chairman Biagio Agnes and Managing  Director Michele Tedeschi. Are these purely coincidental  occurrences, or rather a foretaste of what may happen after 27  March?    In order to steer to the Left, Occhetto has no alternative  but to establish a link between the Palazzo Chigi and the  Quirinale issues. The Sisde storm is not abating, and it is  becoming increasingly difficult for the progressives to defend  Scalfaro in an official capacity. But, if it wins, the PDS,  must not "scare off" moderate voters by choosing a head of state  -- such as Borrelli, the head of the Milan Public Prosecutor's  office or, even less, Rete member Capponnetto -- who might --  admittedly for very different reasons -- appear to be partisan,  just to mention two of the names currently being mentioned at  the Quirinale. Paradoxically, Ciampi would ensure innovation  within a framework of continuity, having already headed the  government and being very reliable, in the estimation of  Occhetto's party.    The rest of the Catholic-progressive team would include  [lower house Speaker] Giorgio Napolitano as foreign minister,  [Anti-Mafia Commission Chairman] Luciano Violante as interior  minister, Massimo D'Alema as defense minister, [Budget Minister]  Luigi Spaventa as budget minister, and [PDS financial affairs  spokesman] Vincenzo Visco to deal with the problems of the  economy. In order to show its democratic goodwill, the PDS  would also take [Labor Minister] Gino Giugni on board as labor  minister, [Civil Service Minister] Sabino Cassese as head of the  civil service, and [former judge] Giuseppe Ayala as justice  minister. That, more or less, is the Left's shadow cabinet,  which would obviously give Green Party Coordinator Carlo Ripa di  Meana the environment portfolio. Of course, at the height of  the electoral campaign none of those involved will be willing to  confirm that they are aiming for the various ministries, much  less for the Palazzo Chigi or the Quirinale. Ciampi was still  saying that he is to stay out of the fray. Quite, but only if  the moderate front carries the day.</p>

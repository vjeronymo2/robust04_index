			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Warning on Chinese inflation Peoples Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, yesterday warned that China's high inflation was 'not only harmful but also dangerous'. It called for efforts to bring price rises under control. The newspaper, commenting on a four-day 'economic work conference' held in Beijing this week, said China faced serious economic problems, including an income gap between urban and rural areas, problems with state enterprises and 'excessive price rises' which threatened social stability. Consumer prices in China's 35 big cities rose by 27 per cent in the 12 months to October. This compares with an inflation target for the year of 10 per cent. Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice premier in charge of the economy, told the conference that China's main economic tasks for the new year were to fight inflation, deepen state enterprise reform, improve agricultural production, and improve technological management.</p>

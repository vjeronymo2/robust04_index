			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> JUST WATCH THE SWISS GO -- AGAIN;  </P> <P> THE JAPANESE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN MET. BOTH INEXPENSIVE AND LUXURY TIMEPIECES  FUEL THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY.  </P> <P> For five centuries, the craft of watchmaking was what made life tick in the  valley towns and hillside hamlets in the Jura Mountains of western Switzerland.  </P> <P> In the 100-mile arc between Geneva and the Rhine River city of Basel,  watchmaking was the economic mainspring and one of life's noblest callings. The  whole wide world operated on Swiss time.  </P> <P> Then came the battery-powered quartz watch revolution.  </P> <P> Confronted by a dynamic, aggressive quartz industry in Japan, the Swiss  watchmakers -- inventors of the minute hand, the second hand, the self-winding  watch and the waterproof watch -- fell on hard times.  </P> <P> Between 1970 and 1985, nearly two-thirds of Switzerland's watchmaking firms  went out of business. In 1970, there were 1,620 companies employing 90,000  people; by 1985, fewer than 600 companies employed 32,000. Unemployment in some  of the high valleys above Lake Neuchatel exceeded 20%, an economic disaster in  the Swiss context.  </P> <P> In many other countries, this would have been the end of the story: rest in  peace for another tradition-bound Western industry overtaken by the Japanese.  </P> <P> But Switzerland, although much smaller than Japan -- 6 million people compared  with 120 million -- has its own commitment to national unity and collective  purpose. Its bankers, businessmen and engineers hunkered down under the  Japanese challenge. Independent companies consolidated their resources. Working  together, most of the Swiss companies converted to quartz.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the makers of traditional luxury watches came out with spectacular  new models that could do everything from anticipate leap year to predict a  solar eclipse -- all without batteries.  </P> <P> Design engineers at one of the new consolidated companies, SMH (Swiss Corp. for  Micro-Electronics and Watchmaking), were assigned the job of inventing a highly  accurate, waterproof wristwatch that would sell for less than $30. By reducing  the number of parts from more than 100 to 54, the engineers succeeded.  </P> <P> The result was the hugely successful brand name Swatch, which has been one of  the keys to the Swiss industry's remarkable recovery.  </P> <P> Figures just made public by the Assn. of Swiss Watchmakers in Biel show that in  1989 the Swiss industry reached an important milestone, accounting for more  than 50% of the revenue of watch sales worldwide.  </P> <P> Ironically, one of the greatest increases was in Japan, where sales of Swiss  watches surged by 70%, to $295 million.  </P> <P> The Swiss industry is not the dominant leader it was in the years after World  War II. "After the war we were practically the only watchmakers in the world,  and watchmaking was the biggest industry in Switzerland," Max Hool, general  secretary of the watchmakers' association, told a visitor.  </P> <P> But strong sales in the higher-price sector, combined with the counterattack  against the Japanese on the quartz front -- mainly with the popular low-price  Swatch -- have brought the Swiss back into the race.  </P> <P> Analysts say that the higher sales result in part from the Japanese  government's lowering of prohibitive import duties on foreign-made watches,  from 30% to 3%.  </P> <P> But Swatch executives also mounted an aggressive marketing campaign in the  heart of Japan. At one point they draped a 500-foot-long Swatch wristwatch over  the side of a Tokyo skyscraper.  </P> <P> "We wanted to do something spectacular on our enemy's home ground," Swatch  spokesman Marianne Egli said in an interview.  </P> <P> The Swatch is only six years old, but by the end of last year its total sales  had exceeded 65 million, company executives said. The Swatch, which now carries  an average price tag of about $40, accounted for a good part of the Swiss  comeback.  </P> <P> At first, the colorful plastic watches -- sometimes so boldly fashionable that  it was difficult to tell the time -- were not welcomed by some of the old guard  in the Swiss industry. An earlier experiment with inexpensive "pin-lever"  mechanical watches, in an effort to meet the Japanese challenge, had ended in  failure. Many felt that the Swiss reputation for accuracy and quality had been  damaged in the process.  </P> <P> "Initially, there were some who opposed the Swatch idea," Hool said. "But now  practically everyone credits it with rebuilding the Swiss industry and keeping  Switzerland in the game."  </P> <P> The luxury companies borrowed some ideas from the Swatch promoters and began to  advertise their watches as articles of fashion that also keep time.  </P> <P> Ornate, jewel-encrusted watches were introduced into the market, and they sold  well -- a direct reversal of the attitudes that had brought Switzerland into  the watchmaking business in the mid-16th Century.  </P> <P> At that time, Geneva and the surrounding region were under the austere  religious leadership of Protestant John Calvin. Calvin regarded jewelry as an  unnecessary vanity and encouraged jewelry makers to switch to watchmaking,  which had a practical, acceptable application.  </P> <P> Switzerland's overall watch sales for 1989, the association reported, were a  record-setting $4 billion-plus. In Japan, meanwhile, the Citizen watch company  reported only a modest increase of 1% in the Japanese industry, compared to 20%  for the Swiss.  </P> <P> The generally positive picture in the Swiss industry has put the watchmaking  craft back in demand, so much so that the Union Bank of Switzerland, in a  recent report on the industry, expressed concern about a shortage of skilled  craftsman.  </P> <P> "Although it has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since the beginning of the 1970s," the  report said, "the Swiss watch industry currently suffers from a shortage of  skilled labor."  </P> <P> The shortage has revived interest in Switzerland's five watchmaking schools,  among them the Ecole de Mechanique here in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a hillside town  where auto pioneer Louis Chevrolet and architect Le Corbusier once lived.  </P> <P> "The quartz watch revolution gave the false impression that there was no longer  a need for watchmakers," Ecole de Mechanique's director, Claude Laesser, said.  "People said that the watchmaking trade was obsolete. A total lack of  confidence set in."  </P> <P> In 1970, when the Swiss industry was at its peak, the school had 160 students.  They could look forward to a salary of about $50,000 a year after four years of  study and at least three years of apprenticeship.  </P> <P> But in the doldrums of the quartz revolution, interest among young people fell  off precipitously. In 1986, only two new students enrolled at the school. By  the time Carole Forestier, 21, began studying there three years ago, she said,  her friends ridiculed her.  </P> <P> "They told me I was a fool," she said, smiling shyly during a break in her  studies. "They told me it was a dead craft."  </P> <P> But now, with guaranteed jobs awaiting them in the revived industry, Forestier  and her colleagues are no longer objects of ridicule.  </P> <P> The shortage of skilled workers has become so acute that some of the famous  high-quality watch firms, like Patek Philippe in Geneva, have become concerned  about finding the artisans needed to hand-craft watch parts, engrave gold cases  and enamel watch faces.  </P> <P> Expensive, high-quality watches are still the base of the Swiss industry. While  taking in more than half the revenues in 1989 watch sales, Switzerland made  only 10% of the watches sold on the world market. The average price of a Swiss  watch was $60, contrasted with $9 for a Japanese watch and less than $4 for a  watch made in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Despite its prices, which range from $1,500 to $16,000, Patek Philippe has a  waiting list of five months to several years for its watches. It produces only  15,000 watches a year, contrasted with more than 400,000 Rolexes, which are  much larger and turned out with mostly automated equipment.  </P> <P> "We have had an especially difficult time finding painters and engravers,"  Patek Philippe spokesman Petra De Castro said.  </P> <P> This encourages Laesser in his hope of rebuilding the once-proud watchmaking  school in La Chaux-de-Fonds, where nine new students enrolled this year. Next  year he hopes for more.  </P> <P> "There is a gap," Laesser said. "We have no watchmakers between the ages of 40  and 25. There is a lost generation."  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Booklet on jobless figures attacked Mr Kevin Barron, shadow employment minister, yesterday attacked a Department of Employment booklet on how unemployment is measured as 'misleading and wasteful'. The pamphlet, which was sent to labour market statistics users last Friday, included descriptions of the two surveys used by the department, the monthly count of those claiming unemployment-related benefits (the claimant count) and the quarterly survey of households (the labour force survey). In the past year the Labour party has often criticised the government for its use of the claimant count as its headline figure. The Department of Employment said it issued the booklet to clarify its use of both forms of measure. But Mr Barron said the booklet was inaccurate because it said there had been nine changes to the rules and procedures of benefit payments since 1979 which warranted adjustments to the counts. The minister said Labour's employment team had gone through data from the House of Commons library and identified 29 changes to the rules and procedures resulting in a reduction to the headline unemployment figure of nearly 700,000. The Department of Employment rebutted Mr Barron's assertion about the 29 changes. It said all but nine of them were 'not significant enough to justify a recasting of the back-series' of figures.</p>

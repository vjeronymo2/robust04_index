			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Observer: Chasing a larger union? It was never going to be easy for IG Metall, Germany's mighty engineering workers' union, to find a replacement for Franz Steinkuhler, its charismatic former boss who resigned after allegations of insider dealing back in May. At an extraordinary congress in Mainz on Saturday, the carefully orchestrated process of passing the baton to Steinkuhler's former deputy, Klaus Zwickel, almost came unstuck when a member from Wuppertal stormed onto the platform, denounced the leadership, and suggested the previous chief should return. For a couple of minutes, the hall was in uproar, until Steinkuhler himself strode to the rostrum. 'You cannot turn back the pages of history,' he said, declining the nomination. 'We need to make a new start.' Steinkuhler himself has not been letting the grass grow under his feet, it would seem. Indeed, Observer can reveal that he is using part of his enforced leisure time to learn English, an intensive four hours every morning. Which lends a little extra credence to rumours that the ex-union leader might just be lining himself up as one of the German candidates for the new European Commission next year. Such a move would certainly be welcome in Brussels, where a strong and articulate German commissioner would represent something of a turn-up for the books. Steinkuhler has certainly always enjoyed surprisingly good relations with one rather crucial ally in the nomination process, namely Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself.</p>

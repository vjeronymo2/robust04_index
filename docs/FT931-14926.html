			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Uncertain success: Military objectives were achieved, but there is doubt over political goals Little went wrong. But the success of the swift return visit to Iraqi battlefields by the US and its British and French allies will be measured not by how well it was done but by what it achieved. Militarily it was impressively executed. Co-ordinating a bombing attack involving 110 aircraft and bringing them all back is no mean feat. In those terms, the US-led strike compared favourably with the operation most closely comparable - the punitive US bombing raid against Libya in April 1986. Then, despite the involvement of large numbers of ships and aircraft, military plans were only partly fulfilled and one aircraft was lost over target. This time, the allies had plenty of time to plan and study a whole range of 'target sets', and enjoyed the benefit of their weeks of rehearsal two years ago in the air campaign against Iraq. The sites were well known, and in most cases had been attacked before. But whereas the semi-botched bombing of Libya did apparently succeed - in retrospect - in placing a restraint on Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the outcome of the 'spanking' of President Saddam Hussein is far from certain. The damage caused in the precision-bombing attacks was yesterday still being evaluated. The Pentagon said Iraq's southern air defences had been 'seriously degraded'. But it is questionable how much President Saddam perceives this as a setback, since it was an attack that he deliberately provoked, and the outcome of which was never in doubt. Iraqi forces put up little opposition - possibly because, as in 1991, they knew they were unable to. Mr Saddam's ostensible purpose was to show that international action against Iraq was a US campaign founded on dubious legality, and to use that to obtain support from Islamic countries for easing sanctions. Expressions of concern yesterday by Syria and Pakistan indicated this argument may have struck some chords. The UN Security Council's Resolution 688 of April 1991 did not go beyond telling Iraq to stop repressing its minorities and to allow access to humanitarian organisations. The justification of the US and its allies is that they need to monitor what is happening in these regions, can only do so by air, and need to ensure that they can do so safely. The air strikes were limited to air-defence systems - missile sites and radar and command facilities - inside the no-fly zone which the US, Britain and France imposed in August south of the 32nd parallel. Air bases to the north of the line were not attacked, as many analysts had expected, even though they have been used for recent incursions by Iraqi fighters, including the MiG-25 shot down by a US F-16 on December 27. However, any further allied military action could well include targets further into Iraq. The bombing raids were the first concerted attack against Iraq since hostilities closed in February 1991, although the allies have repeatedly wielded the threat of military action: to force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces so that Kurds could move back into a haven, to obtain access for UN weapons inspectors, and to ensure the destruction of missile-making equipment. Allied officials stressed that the attacks were on military installations directly threatening their own aircraft. But the political objective behind the attack remains vague. In the Gulf war, the declared aim was to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This was extended to include the crippling of Iraq's offensive military capability, with a further aim - implicitly understood - of creating conditions in which President Saddam might fall. Only after the war did the allies face public criticism in the west for not going further and - as General Norman Schwarzkopf said his forces could have done when they thrust northwards into Iraq - turning left towards Baghdad instead of right. The message the allies now appear to be giving is that they will keep up sanctions and be ready to attack periodically until Iraq moderates its behaviour. But the political goal which military escalation - if it comes to that - would serve is still not explicit.</p>

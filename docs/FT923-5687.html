			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Struggle for control at Simpsons - Dissident shareholders accuse board of hijacking meeting A BITTER struggle broke out yesterday for control of Simpsons of Cornhill, owner of two of the City's most famous restaurants, following angry exchanges at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders. A group of dissident shareholders led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, announced plans to oust the Nottingham-based management team after the board decided a resolution calling for the appointment of two new directors was ineligible. Voting on a second resolution calling for the removal of Mr Alan Crompton-Batt, an existing director who supports the rebel group, was adjourned on a technicality. Mr Klapp, who claims to command the support of 40 per cent of the shareholders, said the meeting had been 'hijacked' and warned that a second EGM would be called to remove the board. The dispute centres on allegations that the management team led by Mr Roy Ackerman, former deputy chairman of the Kennedy Brookes restaurant chain, and Mr Paul Reece, former director of Midsummer Leisure, had embarked on an over-ambitious strategy which threatened the future of the group's leading assets - the Jamaica Inn and Simpsons. Mr Ackerman, however, dismissed the dissidents' claims and said the EGM had been properly conducted. An informal poll held at the meeting had shown more than 80 per cent of the shareholders taking part opposed Mr Klapp's resolution, he added. The company's Pounds 2m flotation last year provided the funds to buy Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn. It has since opened the Dell'Ugo bistro in Soho and the Palio restaurant in west London. Mr Reece, Simpsons managing director, said turnover had increased from Pounds 500,000 in the first half of last year to Pounds 80,000 a week during 1992. The rebel shareholders, meanwhile, claimed the company had spent excessively on its new restaurants. Mr Klapp also claimed the group was looking for a new acquisition to mask the full costs of refurbishing its West End sites when its next set of accounts are published. His allegations were rejected angrily by the Simpsons board. 'We are being prudent,' said Mr Ackerman. 'We know the restaurant trade better than Klapp, and we will buy new sites at the right price and the right time.' Both groups are confident of victory at a second EGM. Simpsons' shares, placed at 50p in last year's flotation, closed down 3p at 36p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Russian Ministry of Defense ``Slavyanka'' program] </F>   [Text] We have been told by the naval press service that  three rods used in nuclear reactors on submarines were stolen 27  November from a strategic depot of the Northern Fleet outside  Murmansk. These were spent nuclear fuel components which were  being stored in special containers. An inquiry is under way.  Unfortunately, neither the command nor naval experts have  commented on this.    The navy has failed to deal with the issue of building new  nuclear waste stores for decades, and the existng stores are  already more than full. Nobody in the navy conceals this  problem, but the navy is unable to deal with it successfully by  itself.    This is what our correspondent Vladimir Makarovich was told  by Rear-Admiral (Nikolay Irasov), admiral-inspector and head of  the nuclear safety inspectorate for nuclear installations of  Russia's Ministry of Defense:    [Begin recording] Irasov: The main  problem is the removal of spent nuclear fuel, because all the  spent nuclear fuel stores are virtually crammed full. Stores  for fresh nuclear fuel do not meet nuclear safety requirements  and there is the problem of ships taken out of combat service,  that is, the unloading of active areas.    Makarovich: What are the implications of not  resolving these matters, not only for the navy, but for the  ecological situation in this region?    Irasov: There are serious implications,  radio-ecological ones, because ships which are left for a long  time with radioactive areas not removed could sink. [end  recording]</p>

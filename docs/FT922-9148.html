			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADERS IN stock index futures spoke of a lacklustre session with dealers undecided about the direction of the market, although the general mood remained positive, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract experienced a squeeze early in the session which sent it up 8 to 2,750 by 10am. This proved to be the day's high. Caution set in and June retreated as independent traders went 'long', and it reached 2,730 by early afternoon. Reports from Paris of an indirect cut in French interest rates were taken as positive in London, and not only halted the downward trend of June but led to renewed buying interest. June closed at 2,739, a premium of 37 to cash and around 19 points above its estimated fair value premium of about 18. Turnover was 7,270 lots. The traded options market was particularly busy, and the day's turnover rose to 52,978 contracts. The volume in the FT-SE option was also high, at 17,042 lots. Also active were the individual stock options. Amstrad led the way, recording a total of 3,773 trades, with the June 90 puts the busiest series. This was followed by BP, which released disappointing figures and saw 3,014 lots traded.</p>

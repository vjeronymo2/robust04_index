			<p>BFN     [Text] Chiba, May 27 KYODO -- Former foreign minister  Michio Watanabe on Friday [27 May] demanded the resignation en  masse of the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata prior  to the summit in July of seven major industrial democracies in  Naples, Italy.    "We should not allow prime minister Hata to go and sign  agreements (at the summit)," the veteran politician of the no. 1  opposition Liberal Democratic Party said.    Watanabe appealed to non-LDP politicians with political  ideals similar to those of the LDP to form a "grand alliance"  with the LDP in order to oust the current ruling coalition from  power.    "Some forces in the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic  Socialist Party and Komeito have similar political ideas to  those of the conservative forces," he said.    The remark was a clear departure from his previous  statements, with which he warned the political community against  forming a coalition with SDP politicians.    Watanabe has repeatedly warned that the presence of SDP  forces in the ruling coalition would undercut Japan's national  interests by barring Japan from reforming its tax system or  taking a tough line in the face of the suspected North Korean  nuclear arms program.</p>

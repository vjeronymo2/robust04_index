			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rise no help to sterling The dollar surged on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, but this did little to ease the pressure on sterling, which remained pinned close to its floor within the European exchange rate mechanism, writes Simon London. The dollar retreated slightly overnight in the Far East following a substantial surge in New York on Thursday which took the US currency to a close of DM1.5605 and Y125.82. By the close in Tokyo the dollar stood slightly lower against the D-Mark at DM1.5593 and little changed against the yen. However, once European trading resumed, the US currency continued on an upward path. Further impetus was added by the release of unexpectedly strong US labour market statistics. The figures showed an increase in non-farm employment of 31,000 during December. Analysts had predicted a decline in employment of between 50,000 and 100,000. The data were interpreted as a sign that the US economy may not be entering a second recessionary phase and decreasing the chances of another early cut in US interest rates. Fear of lower interest rates has been overhanging the dollar this week. The US currency rose through the afternoon session to close at DM1.5825 and Y127.00, near its highs against both currencies, while sterling weakened to Dollars 1.7940. The US currency also benefitted from negative sentiment surrounding the German economy, which tended to drive funds out of the D-Mark. Analysts pointed to concern surrounding the outcome of wage negotiations between the employers and the large metal workers union, which has been pressing for a pay increase substantially ahead of inflation. The strength of the Spanish currency against the D-Mark raised sterling effective 'floor' within the European exchange rate mechanism to around DM2.8330 during the day, although by the close the lower permitted limit had fallen back to DM2.8310, similar to Thursday's level. The UK currency responded with a firmer tone in the morning session, for a time sustaining a position above DM2.84. However, during the afternoon sterling fell back, several times dropping to its lower limit against the D-Mark before a late rally once continental European markets had closed saw sterling rise to close at DM2.84. That a surge in the dollar did not help sterling surprised many analysts. However, some suggested that a poor US employment figure and a subsequent weakening in the dollar could have hurt sterling. The UK currency may be in the difficult position of being dollar-linked when the dollar is falling, but not when the US currency is rising. The Australian dollar continued to loose ground following Wednesday's 1-point cut in interest rates to 7.5 per cent. By the close in London, it stood at Dollars 0.7365, just off its low of Dollars 0.7340 and from Dollars 0.7345 on Thursday.</p>

The Argentine foreign and economy ministers, Guido Di Tella  and Domingo Cavallo; the Brazilian foreign and finance  ministers, Celso Amorim and Fernando Henrique Cardoso; the  Paraguayan foreign and finance ministers, Luis Maria Ramirez  Boettner and Crispiniano Sandoval; and the Uruguayan foreign and  economy ministers, Sergio Abreu and Ignacio de Posadas, today  met in Buenos Aires to discuss this goal.    In a joint communique, the Mercosur ministers agreed "to  discuss every available option to promote a comprehensive  regional economic integration on the basis of the Brazilian  proposal" to create the South American Free Trade Association  (ALCSA).    To this end, the ministers decided to meet again in Buenos  Aires on 25 March "to make headway toward making ALCSA  compatible." At that special meeting, "the continental  projection of Mercosur will be evaluated."    They agreed on stating that "bilateral or multilateral  agreements with other South American countries" with a view to  furthering free trade in the region "will be concluded despite  other integration agreements those countries may have entered  with other countries in Latin America or elsewhere in the  hemisphere."    They also agreed to "maintain close coordination regarding  ALCSA and other proposals" as a way of "promoting the  participation of Mercosur member countries in agreements  relating to them so that a common policy can be implemented."    The Mercosur ministers also expressed their "support for the  full deregulation of trade among all South American countries as  an ultimate objective and as a way to promote the incorporation  of the region into the world's and hemisphere's economy."    The ministers reaffirmed their support for "compliance" with  the Mercosur implementation timetable "as far as the  establishment of a common external tariff is concerned."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column article by Gu Ping (0657 </F> 1627): "Bumping Against the Wall and Not Turning Around"]    [Text] A popular Chinese saying goes, "one will never turn  around until one bumps against the wall." But now this saying  is no longer applicable to U.S. congresswoman Nancy Pelosi,  because she has already bumped against the wall but still will  not turn around.    Under the pretext of "human rights," Miss Pelosi has made  arbitrary attacks on China over the past few years, and kept  babbling about advocating so-called "trade sanctions."  Proceeding from U.S. basic interests, the Clinton  Administration has recently announced its decision to extend MFN  trade status to China and delink MFN trade status from the  human-rights issue to go along with the strong demand of U.S.  figures of various circles and the public. That was a wise  action. However, Pelosi would not admit defeat and attacked the  White House decision from nowhere; in addition, she set out in  the U.S. Congress the need to take sanction action against  China. She threatened: "We have grounds, and will get great  support in the Congress."    Does Pelosi really "have grounds"? No. Everyone knows that  China and the United States grant each other the MFN trade  status according to the bilateral agreement on trade and  economic relations; that is entirely an arrangement beneficial  to both sides on an equal footing, and the foundation for normal  trade between the two countries. Over the past few years, the  United States has jeopardized Sino-U.S. relations by setting out  some side issues on MFN trade status, that were likened to  weaving a cocoon and get imprisoned to it. The peoples of the  two countries were unhappy about it. That being the case, the  aforementioned decision of the Clinton Administration has not  only won China's welcome but also the admiration of various  circles in the United States and world public opinion. This has  precisely demonstrated the practice of Pelosi and her like is  totally groundless.    As for the "great support," Pelosi might not even believe it  herself. Long before the Clinton Administration made that  decision, a common understanding on delinking human rights from  trade issue and improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations had  taken shape in the U.S. Government and the public, from the top  to the grass roots on an extensive scale. Aside from U.S.  business and public opinion circles, there are an increasingly  greater number of people of insight inside the U.S. Congress who  once supported Pelosi, who are for improving and augmenting  Sino-U.S. relations, believing that this conforms to U.S.  strategic and economic interests, and is favorable to peace and  stability the Asia-Pacific Region and the world. Democrat  Senator Johnston indicated that U.S.-Chinese relations are "the  most important in all bilateral relations in the world,"  canceling the MFN trade status to China would seriously  jeopardize bilateral economic relations and trade and even  political relations. The majority of the Senate was for  changing the policy, and 106 House members from both political  parties had jointly written a letter to the White House urging  extension of MFN trade status to China. Could it be that Miss  Pelosi has turned a deaf ear to the words of her fellow  congressmen? People would like to see just what "great support"  Miss Pelosi will get!    Congresswoman Pelosi has never stopped talking about "human  rights." If she really cares for the human rights issue as she  claims herself, why should she have taken the trouble to find  such an issue in China or some other parts in the world? Miss  Pelosi has only to stand at the door of her own house and she  will find it. Several years back, racial turmoil on the largest  scale in U.S. history took place in Los Angeles, California, the  very state from which she has been elected a congresswoman. Was  that not plainly a human-rights issue? The LOS ANGELES TIMES  disclosed not long ago, some elderly American Chinese residing  on Vallejo Street in San Francisco, who were impoverished and  weak, suffered greatly from street crime, and dared not leave  their living quarters, "their human rights are violated every  day," and "there is no way to protect them" ... Has Miss Pelosi  ever exerted any efforts on that issue? If Miss Pelosi has any  shame about it, she should mind less about other countries'  matters, and say less about things that she is ignorant of. She  should instead exert some effort to improve the human rights  condition in California to live up to the expectations of her  California constituents.    Not long ago, President Clinton said: "Linking human rights  to the MFN trade status has taken us to the end of a path."  However, should a small handful of people like Pelosi insist on  moving on when they have arrived at the end of the path, what a  scenario that will be?!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA"-signed report: "In a Letter to </F> Government and the Parliament, Heritage Foundation Members  Demand Respect for the Rights of Slovaks"]    [Text] Bratislava -- The Slovak Heritage Foundation  District Committee in Komarno urgently draws attention to the  fact that the statements by politicians of ethnic Hungarian  parties and movements in Slovakia about tolerance are insincere.  In the course of the preceding years, they have repeatedly  demonstrated that their idea of coexistence are permanent  concessions by the Slovaks and the implementation of their own  escalating demands. This has found its expression in the  massive renaming of streets according to "personalities" from  the time of the Hungarian empire, in tough Magyarization, and in  incessant demands for the renaming of towns and villages.    Cases of job applicants being turned down because they are  Slovaks and do not speak Hungarian are multiplying. The  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement has not abandoned its  efforts to divide Catholics along ethnic lines by setting up a  bishopric in Komarno exclusively for Hungarian believers. The  Hungarian language is pushing Slovak out of schools. We  therefore appeal to the Government of the Slovak Republic and  deputies to the National Council of the Slovak Republic to  ensure that politicians of Hungarian parties and movements in  Slovakia meet the needs and requirements of the Slovak part of  the population.    We demand that all competent representatives of the demands  of the Slovak Heritage Foundation Committee [as published], as  well as demands formulated in the Memorandum of Slovaks from  Southern Slovakia be considered during the discussion of laws  dealing with the so-called problem of bilingual signs, the  problem of birth and marriage registers, and the problem of the  Slovak state language.    In conclusion, the Slovak Heritage Foundation District  Committee writes that many Slovaks see their prospects in  southern Slovakia endangered, also due to the disregard for the  demands of Slovaks by some contemporary highest representatives.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Giampiero Mughini: "The Volcanic Diplomat"] </F>   [Text] Because the cabinet is an administrative structure  that should have the balance and raw efficiency of a soccer  team, it is surprising that a post involving intrigue and high  diplomacy would be entrusted to a macho type whose specialty is  smashing the adversary's defenses, to wit: my dear friend  Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for relations with Parliament.    Things will be difficult this time for Big Giulio. The man  who likes to shake up political relationships will have the task  of managing and civilizing relations between parties and  factions. The man who likes to put down any sacrilegious  individual who opposes him will have to learn how to convince  that individual gently. The man who has preached the need for a  charismatic leader endowed with full powers will have to learn  the art of stroking one of the most tumultuous parliaments of  West Europe.    If Silvio Berlusconi did indeed place this kind of man in  the  wrong job, it was probably because he did not want to miss the  opportunity to have at his side a man trained in politics and  its techniques--training that is not possessed by many new  cabinet ministers.    Giuliano is accordingly returning in person to the front  line  of politics, which was the passion of his youth. It was also the  passion of his family, starting with his grandfather Mario--a  prominent Liberal of the 1920's--and followed by his father  Maurizio, who was one of the most volcanic and partisan  Communist journalists in the 1950's and 1960's before becoming a  Liberal and "rightist" Communist in the 1980's. And then there  is his uncle Giovanni (Maurizio's brother), a Republican, who is  certainly not the least factious member of the family. Factious,  in the sense of a total and disruptive passion for your side  once you have chosen that side. It is a kind of passion that  does not allow for halfway measures or modulated tones and  indeed demands that the scimitar mercilessly cut off hands and  heads. That is the way Giuliano is.    I remember Giuliano in 1981, just after he had resigned as  secretary of the PCI [Italian Communist Party] federation of  Turin because he was tired of communist politics in general and  the Piedmont PCI in particular. He had no job and no money. He  would stroll through Piazza Navona with his handsome German  shepherd and his close friend Giampaolo Pansa at his side. His  friendship with Pansa subsequently ended with threats of a punch  on the nose, just as his friendship with Saverio Vertone, one of  his two buddies in Turin (the other was Vittorio Sermonti),  ended in a bruising brawl. And just as I had been having  dinner with Giuliano and Carlo Ripa of Meana--a dinner among  friends--only a few days before the two were flaying each other  in public with lawsuits and countersuits. I love Giuliano like a  brother, but I know that if our views ever diverged, he would  let the scimitar fall upon my head mercilessly. This is partly  the product of the Communist modus operandi, one that is never  abandoned, and partly a manifestation of the curse of the  Ferraras.    Giuliano's intellectual bravado is something else again. It  is the pridefulness of someone who does not want to row with the  crew, and I was very pleased at the tenacity with which Giuliano  continued to defend Bettino Craxi after Craxi had fallen into  disgrace. As for Ferrara's independence, I recall the time when  he proclaimed openly on British radio his disagreement with  Craxi, who had just signed--together with Achille Occhetto--a  document deploring the American bombs that had killed civilians  in Iraq. To be sure, bombs are horrible and do kill innocent  people; but the person responsible for those deaths was Saddam  Hussayn, who had aimed his chemical missiles at Israel before  the UN decided to take action against him. What did the  complaint against the Americans have to do with this? And  Giuliano said just that, boldly, his big beard pointing to the  sky, indifferent to the curses of the pacifists. I phoned him  immediately to congratulate him.</p>

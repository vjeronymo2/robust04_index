			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Expenses charged to managed funds unclear Sir, The daily Managed Funds Service in the Financial Times contains four full pages of fund data. Ninety-three of the offshore-based fund management groups which are listed are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board. Most of these funds are marketed actively to UK retail and institutional investors. Investors might assume that the Securities and Investments Board applies the same strict control over the annual charges suffered by these funds as they do for their onshore counterparts. In reality, only the investment advisory fee must be disclosed by the management company in promotional literature. Administration, custodian and other expenses are detailed only in the published financial statements. It appears, in fact, that neither the SIB nor the local regulators enforce a limit on the total level of expenses which can be charged to the fund. My own research reveals that, while the highest disclosed annual fee is 2 per cent, the total annual charge is frequently above 5 per cent and can even reach double figures in the worst cases. Investors in these funds cannot be aware of the extent of these charges or of the resulting effects on their fund returns. Of course, the total annual charge for many funds is more reasonable, but comparative figures are only now being made available. There is a clear case for full disclosure by management groups marketing retail offshore funds in the UK and for more effective monitoring by the regulators.

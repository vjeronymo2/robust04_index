			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): David S Smith - Other companies The paper, packaging and office supplies group is expected to report a continued recovery in profits when it announces annual figures on Wednesday. Although first-half profits were down, analysts forecast the full-year pre-tax figure will have risen from Pounds 27.1m to between Pounds 33m and Pounds 35m, helped by improving demand and price increases. But earnings per share will show little change, reflecting the Pounds 90m issue last year to pay for office products wholesaler Spicers.</p>

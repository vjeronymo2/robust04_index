			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the Workers' Party of Korea received solidarity messages from  foreign parties and party leaders supporting the Korean people's  struggle for defending the dignity of their nation and the  sovereignty of their country.    The messages came from Jean Pierre Ngambi, general secretary  of the Communist Party of Cameroon, Eduardo Mora Valverde,  convenor of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Costa  Rica, Humberto Vargas Carbonel, secretary general of the Central  Committee of the People's Vanguard of Costa Rica, Stevan  Mirkovic, president of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia,  Otete Gaston Mboyo, national chairman of the National Movement  of the Genuine Lumumbist Combatants of Zaire, the National  Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the Congo and the  Central Committee of the Galicia People's Union of Spain.    The National Executive Committee of the Communist Party of  the Congo in its message expressed full support to the just  measure taken by the DPRK Government to defend the security and  sovereignty of the country. It contended that the nuclear issue  of Korea should be solved through DPRK-USA negotiations, not by  means of "sanctions" or pressure.    The message from Zaire urged that the United States should  immediately stop all its crafty moves to provoke another war on  the Korean peninsula and that the International Atomic Energy  Agency should act with discretion in accordance with its mission  as a genuine scientific organization.    The general secretary of the Communist Party of Cameroon in  his message demanded a prompt halt to all the attempts to lead  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war.</p>

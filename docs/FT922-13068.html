			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Brown outlines his terms for election support MR Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, yesterday denied he was ready to endorse the presidential candidacy of Mr Bill Clinton, the favourite for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. Over the weekend Mr Brown repeated what he said after last Tuesday's New York primary election - that he would offer his support to the nominee. This was interpreted as an implicit recognition that he could not catch Mr Clinton in the remaining primaries. However, he is now attaching terms to that support, specifically acceptance of strict limits on financial support - Mr Brown only takes sums of up to Dollars 100 from individual contributors - and agreement to work for the populist initiative limiting the terms of elected officials. He added he did not think the governor of Arkansas would win the nomination. 'The latest polls show him slipping precipitously behind President Bush,' he said. 'We're going to fight for a fair and open convention.' Mr Clinton returned to the campaign trail after taking a rest to relieve an overworked voice. He did so comforted by news that the executive board of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, had recommended endorsing his candidacy. Coming from a state with an anti-union tradition, Mr Clinton had not been the first choice of labour, which initially preferred Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and latterly has been heavily courted by Mr Brown. However, many individual unions, including the ladies' garment workers, the biggest in New York, and the public service employees, have come out for him. Mr Clinton was also encouraged by reports from the latest Virginia caucuses, which showed him winning more than half the state's delegates, compared to about a third for an uncommitted slate and only 15 per cent for Mr Brown. He also continued to pick up useful endorsements from, among others, Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who ran for the nomination in 1988, and Governor Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, considered a possible candidate this year. Both men are among those mentioned as possible alternatives to Mr Clinton in the event of a brokered convention in New York in July.</p>

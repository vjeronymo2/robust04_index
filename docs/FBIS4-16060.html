			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The CIS Coordinating and Consultative Committee and  the CIS Council of Foreign and Defense Ministers are holding  meetings in Moscow today. Traditionally, such events are held  on the eve of meetings of the CIS heads of state and government.  In addition to general issues, the delegations arriving at the  meeting intend to solve their own problems. For instance, the  Moldavian [Moldovan] delegation plans to sign a number of  agreements, except military ones. That country is very  interested in setting up a free economic zone, re-exporting  goods, and solving the issues of a payment union. Tajikistan  plans to discuss additional measures to stabilize the situation  on the Tajik-Afghan border. Kazakhstan's delegation is expected  in Moscow today, but without President Nazarbayev, to all  appearances. The agenda of the meeting includes a problem  raised by Kyrgyzstan. It deals with ensuring the rights of  those belonging to national, ethnic, language, and religious  minorities. In addition, President Askar Akayev is to speak  about the natural disasters in the republic. Russia has given  the largest amount of aid to the areas hit by landslides.</p>

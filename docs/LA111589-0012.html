			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMAN PARTY SEEKS COALITION;  </P> <P> EUROPE: WEST GERMANY RENEWS ITS OFFER OF AID KEYED TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL  REFORMS.  </P> <P> The newly elected East German prime minister, Hans Modrow, opened talks with  non-Communist Party leaders Tuesday in an effort to form what he called a  "genuine coalition government."  </P> <P> He and Communist leader Egon Krenz conferred with the heads of four small  parties that have suddenly displayed independence after years of serving as  Communist Party satellites.  </P> <P> In Bonn, West German officials again offered massive financial aid to East  Germany -- providing that the government introduces stringent economic and  political reforms.  </P> <P> The East German regime is also considering opening up the Berlin Wall near the  Brandenburg Gate, East Berlin's best-known monument and symbol, according to  the official news agency ADN.  </P> <P> But Modrow was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the West German newspaper Bild  as saying that while the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, it must remain  standing.  </P> <P> "In our country, there is little criminal activity . . . cases of AIDS  (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and drugs are virtually unknown. Our  people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is," Bild  quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> The number of people crossing the Berlin Wall on Tuesday was estimated at  180,000.  </P> <P> At the same time, West German Red Cross officials reported that the number of  East German refugees approaching them about returning home has reached 10,000.  Counseling services for potential returnees have been set up at West German  relocation camps to advise East Germans whether they will be penalized if they  go back.  </P> <P> In trying to form a coalition regime, Modrow sought out the leaders of the four  small parties: the Democratic Farmers' Party, the Christian Democratic Union,  the Liberal Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party.  </P> <P> These smaller parties, which in the past rubber-stamped Communist orders, have  seats in the Parliament and have been increasingly critical of government  policies and the Communists.  </P> <P> Communists occupy 39 of the 43 Cabinet posts, and Modrow is expected to reduce  the size of the Cabinet as well as make it more of a coalition. ADN gave no  details of the meeting, and Modrow did not say whether the opposition would  join his conception of a coalition government.  </P> <P> Guenter Schabowski, a prominent member of the Politburo, resigned as party  chief for East Berlin, ADN reported. Political analysts say Schabowski,  considered to be a leading reform-minded politician, may receive an important  post in Modrow's Cabinet.  </P> <P> He earlier had indicated he might surrender the city post because of a heavy  workload. He remains in the Politburo and as the party's propaganda chief. He  was replaced as party chief for the capital by Hans Albrecht.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the new, non-Communist Speaker of the East German Parliament said he  will seek to change the first article of the country's constitution, which  defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. The party has used the  provision to justify its monopoly on power.  </P> <P> Guenther Maleuda told a meeting of his Democratic Farmers' Party faction in  Parliament that the Communist Party is to blame for East Germany's economic,  social and political problems.  </P> <P> The West German pledge of massive financial aid to help rebuild East Germany's  economy had been made before and was conditional on political and economic  reforms that the Communists have so far rejected.  </P> <P> But West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was more specific, offering  a six-point plan that would include investments and joint ventures, as well as  revamping the nation's dilapidated communications and transport systems.  </P> <P> Haussmann did not specify a figure for the aid and said the plan would be  useless if East Germany fails to carry out a "thorough change" in its centrally  directed economy. East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a  complete free-market system.  </P> <P> Haussmann compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan, brainchild of U.S.  Secretary of State George C. Marshall, which sent more than $12 billion in U.S  aid from 1948-51 to help war-devastated Europe return to prosperity.  </P> <P> In West Berlin, the rumors that a new border crossing would be punched through  the Berlin Wall near the historic Brandenburg Gate drew about 200 West  Berliners to a chilly vigil Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Police chiefs from both sides of the wall conferred by phone, and it was  understood afterward that "nothing will happen tonight," a West Berlin police  spokesman said.  </P> <P> "We don't know if and when it will go down," he added.  </P> <P> Ten East German guards stood almost casually atop the wall, gazing down at the  throngs of West Berliners and reporters, some of whom had staked out their  spots with pup tents. Television lights cast a bright glow on the  graffiti-covered western face of the wall.  </P> <P> Behind the barricade, floodlights illuminated the gate itself, which came to  separate the city into Allied and Soviet zones after World War II, also  severing Berlin's busiest boulevard -- Unter Den Linden. West German police  kept the crowd about 20 feet back from the wall, which some Berliners danced  atop last week.  </P> <P> People waited in line to climb the two viewing platforms erected by the West  years ago to allow tourists a peak over the forbidden wall and the gate behind  it.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tamara Jones contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The Brandenburg Gate, the site where East Germany is considering creating a new  opening in the Berlin Wall, has for decades served as a mocking reminder of  Germany's defeat in World War II. Lying in East Berlin just beyond the wall in  the heart of the divided city, the monument, topped with a bronze statue of the  Goddess of Victory in a chariot, was erected in 1788-91 to celebrate military  victories and was named after the German state that later became Prussia.  Modeled on the Propylaea, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens, it was  severely damaged in World War II and has been completely rebuilt.  </P></p>

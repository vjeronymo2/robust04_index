			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation (NATO) is ready to launch new air strikes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina if United Nations forces are endangered in  attacks there, a NATO spokesman said here Wednesday [13 April].    Speaking after a meeting of ambassadors from NATO countries,  he said they had expressed "general satisfaction" at two attacks  by U.S. warplanes on Serb positions around the Bosnian Moslem  enclave of Gorazde on Sunday and Monday.    "General satisfaction was expressed at the two missions  conducted under the authority of Resolution 836 of the UN  Security Council according to permanent procedures fixed with  the UN Protection Force in Bosnia last year," he said.    Resolution 836 provides for the protection of "safe areas,"  including Sarajevo, Gorazde and four more towns, which have  predominantly Moslem populations.    "NATO remains ready to provide close air support in case of  new attacks against UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) in the  accomplishment of its global mandate," the spokesman said.</p>

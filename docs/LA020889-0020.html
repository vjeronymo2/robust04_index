			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> There's slow biz for "Les Miz," so come July 2, "Les Miserables" is folding its  barricade at the Shubert Theatre and heading for San Francisco. Lagging  attendance -- particularly in the balcony seats and on weeknights -- is the  official explanation. However, the show is not scheduled to open in San  Francisco until fall, and reports have circulated that the producers are  closing here early to avoid paying the actors a per diem during a two- or  three-month hiatus. But a spokeswoman for the show insists that's not so.  "Equity rules allow for them not to be paid, so the producers really don't have  to, and they haven't decided yet whether they will or not." Venues and dates  aren't firm for the Bay Area staging, but a late-September or early-October  opening is expected. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

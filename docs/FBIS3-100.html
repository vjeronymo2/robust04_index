Mr. Chesoni said that the constituency had no past history  of  violence and blamed outsiders, some of whom he said are members  of Parliament, for introducing insecurity in the area. He at  the same time reminded voters in the constituency to exercise  their democratic rights of choosing their member of parliament  without fear or intimidation.    Mr. Chesoni, who was addressing a press conference in his  office today, appealed to all the political parties and their  supporters to restrain themselves from any acts of violence for  the remaining electioneering period. He said that voting takes  place as scheduled, on 3 March 1994 from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM and  said that time will only be extended in polling stations which  opened late. He told all the election officials taking part in  the by-election to be fair and impartial and warned that anybody  found interfering with the election process will be prosecuted.  He assured the voters that the commission will liaise with the  police commissioner to ensure that adequate security is provided  during and after the by-election. To avoid cheating, Mr. Chesoni  said that only original national identity cards will be used and  told those who might have lost their identity cards to keep off  the polling stations.    Asked whether there will be any foreign observers during the  by election, Mr. Chesoni said that the British and American  embassies have indicated their willingness to send their  political counselors as observers on the voting day. He took  issue with a local daily for criticizing the commission's  decision to increase polling stations in the constituency and  explained that the decision was only made to encourage more  voters to turn up. He was accompanied by commissioners Samuel  Kivutu and the deputy chairman, Mr. Mwathani Mbaka.    [Nairobi DAILY NATION in English on 28 February on page 1  adds the following: "Heavily armed police clashed with Forum  for the Restoration of Democracy [FORD]-Kenya supporters  yesterday at Malava, Kakamega District, when a district officer  tried to stop acting FORD-Kenya Chairman Kijana Wamalwa from  opening a local party office. The paper said no-one was injured  in the `pushing and brawling', during which it said the crowd  shouted anti-government slogans."]</p>

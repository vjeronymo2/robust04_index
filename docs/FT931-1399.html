			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price provides catalyst for platinum cuts - Philip Gawith reports on the market pressures being felt by South African producers TUESDAY'S announcement by Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, that it is cutting production by closing the Boschfontein shaft contained a predictable message in a surprise wrapping. Predictable was the distress signal it conveyed on the part of South African platinum producers, who account for about 70 per cent of world annual supply. Declining profits forced both both Rustenburg and Impala, the second largest producer, to cut their dividends recently and platinum group metal prices have since trended even lower. It was perhaps surprising, however, that Rustenburg, the most financially sound and cost-competitive of the main producers, should have moved first. If Rustenburg is feeling the strain, then the pressure must be more severe at Impala and Lonhro, the other large producers. Whereas Rustenburg has cash reserves of about R550m (Pounds 80m), Impala and Lonhro (in the form of Western Platinum and Eastern Platinum) have debts respectively of about R320m and R800m. Rustenburg's announcement was the second piece of bullish news the market had received this week. Earlier Almaz-juvelirexport, the Russian export agency for platinum group metals, had said it would be reducing shipments this year. Impala is not planning, at this stage, to follow Rustenburg's lead. Mr Michael McMahon, executive chairman, said yesterday that 'while current prices are a matter of serious concern, Impala is not about to follow the Rustenburg example'. His company 'sympathised entirely' with the pressures that had caused Rustenburg to act, noting that Impala had already faced tough decisions in the past with the closure of Messina and Barplats. Lonrho is not thought to be contemplating a production cut. Rustenburg's cut can be assessed on several levels. Most obviously, as Mr Barry Davison, managing director, has made clear, it will benefit shareholders because a loss-making shaft will be closed and cheaper metal purchased in the market to cover supply commitments. Also, the closure of Boschfontein fulfils the strategic aim of the JCI group - which also controls the Lebowa and PPRust platinum mines - to move further down the cost curve as expensive production at Rustenburg will be replaced with much cheaper production at PPRust when it comes on stream later this year. Most important, however, is the message sent to the market. Although Mr Davison describes the production cut as a 'statement of fact' rather than an attempt to move the price, he will clearly be hoping that it helps to restore equilibrium to a market he has described as being gripped by a 'recessionary psychosis'. Certainly the message from the market leader that it is cheaper to buy metal in the market than to produce it is a powerful one. Both Rustenburg and Impala agree that a significant improvement in platinum group prices depends not so much on any actions they take as on a recovery in confidence in the metal. This, in turn, awaits the upturn in demand that should accompany a world economic recovery. Neither is sanguine about the short term outlook. Mr McMahon comments: 'I think the glory days for platinum are some time away'. That said, both producers are keen to stress that the underlying supply/demand fundamentals for platinum group metals are quite sound. 'I really have no problem in selling every ounce we can produce,' says Mr Davison. Both companies have sold all their production and the trend, if anything, is for customers to ask for more metal, not to seek to reduce contractual commitments. Although optimistic about the medium and long term outlook for the metal, both Rustenburg and Impala are quick to refute suggestions that, like South Africa's gold industry of yesteryear, they are incorrigible bulls, unwilling to take hard decisions and close unviable shafts. Mr McMahon comments: 'Our view on current prices is that we will not just 'vasbyt' (hold tight), plough on regardless because better days lie ahead. We will manage our operations so that they survive at current prices'. He says that Impala does not have any shafts that are not covering cash costs, though some 'aren't contributing the full whack to replacement capital'. Rustenburg's announcement makes clear that it is not willing to produce metal at a loss. While the industry's current difficulties should not be underestimated they need to be kept in perspective. It is 12 years since weak markets last forced a cut in production by Rustenburg. But evidence of tough times in the industry has been around for some time already. This has been most obvious from action taken in the Impala stable where expansion plans have been drastically curtailed over the past two years, and the labour force has been cut by 17 per cent while maintaining existing production levels. On the other hand, the platinum producers are still a far cry from the position facing marginal gold producers. Using rough figures Mr Dave Russell, analyst at stockbrokers Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg, says a typical platinum producer on Merensky reef is enjoying revenues of about R200 a tonne at present prices, compared with cash costs of R110 to R120 a tonne - still a comfortable margin. Mr Russell does not expect a similar round of cuts to those in the early 1980s, when production fell by 15-20 per cent. He supports the producers in their view that though the price may be weak, the market is not. A further factor, stressed by Mr McMahon, is that there is no point in tinkering: if cuts do not extend to fixed costs, they are not worth making as revenue will decline without a commensurate fall in costs, leaving the financial situation worse than before. Having already cut deeply, Impala is clearly confident it has achieved the optimum fighting weight for prevailing market conditions.</p>

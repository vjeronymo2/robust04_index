			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): UK's overheated fields yield a crop of problems - Early ripening is reducing harvests and hitting the quality of autumn-sown barley Correction (published 20th July 1994) appended to this article. For those farmers with a tendency towards hay fever and asthma the high pollen count was not the only frustration to result from the recent heatwave. The long hot days also brought forward the grain harvest with some crops of autumn-sown barley having ripeness forced upon them rather than acquiring it gently in the dull conditions we usually seem to get in July. It is not so much the earliness itself that frustrates - in many ways it is a good thing to get some of the demanding harvest work out of the way. It is the fact that because of premature ripening most of the crops so far gathered are of mediocre quality and weight and therefore of low value. Admittedly the number of samples submitted to merchants is relatively low at this stage and come from the light, sandy land that is most susceptible to this kind of problem. But reports suggest that grain size is generally small  -'like needles' one merchant said the other day as he admitted that from one exceptionally poor lorry load he had had to remove 38 per cent of screenings, the small grains that fall through a screen designed to remove non-viable material. Clearly this also implies low yields; few of the fields so far combined have apparently produced above 2.5 tonnes an acre (6.25 tonnes a hectare). Production at this level is unlikely to leave a profit, even on farms with the lowest costs. Those of us with rather heavier, more moisture-retentive land, can only hope that our crops, when they are ready for cutting in a few days, will produce better results. But it would be unrealistic to suppose that the early fields had not set at least an approximate pattern for the rest. There are two main types of barley, grown for distinctly different markets. One is for animal feed and here the farmers objective is to produce the maximum yield and a high protein or nitrogen content. Such barley attracts a low price but can be profitable provided production per acre is high enough. The variety is chosen accordingly. The second type is for malting into beer, for which specific varieties have also been developed. Here the objective is for a much lower nitrogen content and since this implies smaller applications of fertiliser it normally means accepting a lighter yield. The price paid to the farmer should, in theory and usually in practice, compensate him for the lower yield. Ever-increasing emphasis on the need for better marketing of farm commodities together with the urge to add value, persuaded rather more farmers than usual to plant malting barley last autumn. Many took advantage of merchants offers to sell it forward on contract at a fixed premium above the price of feed barley. One estimate suggests that up 40 per cent of the malting barley grown for harvesting this year has been sold in this way. Last year the figure was between 25 and 30 per cent. There are this year, however, two potential difficulties arising from this otherwise healthy move. The first is that because of the weather-related problems with quality, referred to above, a substantial proportion of the barley sold on contract may be of too low a quality to qualify for the full premium prices written into the contracts. Premiums over feed barley are usually between Pounds 20 and Pounds 30 a tonne, depending on variety, but for that the merchants specify a range of quality standards. They are entitled to cut the price or even reject the grain if those standards are not achieved. The second problem is that the price of feed barley, at Pounds 95 to Pounds 98 a tonne, is Pounds 10 to Pounds 13 per tonne higher at present than was expected when those contracts were agreed. Given that malting contracts are based on feed prices the merchants will have little choice but to pay the extra and to pass it on to the breweries. Cynical malting barley growers, as they deliver their crops over the next few weeks, will be watching very carefully to ensure any deductions for lack of quality are genuine and do not reflect the buoyancy of the feed market. The rise in the feed barley price and indeed for forward wheat sales (for the wheat harvest will not begin in earnest for another month) can be attributed to two main factors. Planting conditions across northern Europe last Autumn were appallingly wet and the early spring was not much better. It had long been anticipated that yields would be down this harvest and the probability of this has stimulated the price. In addition the weakness of sterling against other European Union currencies has triggered two small devaluations of the green pound since the beginning of July. These have resulted in compensatory increases in UK guaranteed prices amounting to about 3 per cent. And although open market prices for grain are well above support levels where they apply it all helps to create a firm tone in the market. Currency movements within the EU have been mainly favourable to UK arable farmers for the past two years, but they can, of course, go the other way. In order to 'lock in' an apparently attractive currency position a few large farmers have taken out currency options against forward changes in values. In most changes, so far, these have turned out to be expensive and in the event unnecessary insurance against events that have not happened. Nevertheless the big banks continue to offer such services and the Morgan Grenfell subsidiary, Record Treasury Management, now offers a hedging facility for EU green rates. A few major players in the food industry may well use them, but, unlike their American cousins, few UK farmers are ready for the culture change such deals involve. As this year appears to have proved to them, once again, the weather is the final arbiter. CORRECTION Record Treasury Management is an independent company and not a subsidiary of Morgan Grenfell, as stated on this page yesterday. The two companies are co-operating in a joint venture to offer facilities for hedging the European Community 'green' rates at which guaranteed farm prices are translated into national currencies.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: On the shelf It is true that a bookish egg-head is about the last thing Pentos needs in its new chief executive - but does Bill McGrath, currently in DIY and timber, have any affinity with reading material at all? McGrath himself was yesterday making sure his own literary habits remained a closed book for the time being. Enquiries elsewhere, though, did establish that for seven years from the late 1960s he had been the buying controller at GJ Keddie &amp; Sons, a department store in Southend, which, according to a spokeswoman for Pentos, 'sells rather a lot of books'. He then moved to Asda, where one of his jobs was to introduce 'browser bars for books', whatever they may be. Lovers of the grand old Hatchard's premises in Piccadilly are permitted a quiet shudder.</p>

In the near future, the department for the control and  analysis of the actions of political and social organizations  registered with the Ministry of Justice will begin to function  within the ministry. If actions are uncovered that contradict  the program and charter of the organization and also, first and  foremost, Republic of Georgia legislation, materials will be  handed over to the Procurator's Office and the Supreme Court,  which have the powers to halt the activities of the organization  in question.    Political parties and organizations that carry out and  provoke sabotage, hinder the normal functioning of bodies of  state power, incite or contribute to the violation of the  territorial integrity of Georgia, fan national strife,  propagandize military actions, or create armed formations and  military associations, will also be liable to be banned.</p>

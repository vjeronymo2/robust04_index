The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMO) filed applications for four projects: the E.J. West Project, FERC No. 2318, located in Saratoga County on the Sacandaga River; the Hudson River Project, FERC No. 2482, consisting of the Spier Falls and Sherman Island developments in Warren and Saratoga counties on the Hudson River; the Hoosic River Project, FERC No. 2616, consisting of the Johnsonville and Schaghticoke developments in Rensselaer and Washington counties on the Hoosic River, and the School Street Project, FERC No. 2539, located Albany and Saratoga counties on the Mohawk River.

Moreau Manufacturing Corporation filed an application for the Feeder Dam Project, FERC No. 2554, located in Warren and Saratoga counties on the Hudson River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon review of the applications, supplemental filings, and intervenor submittals, the Commission staff has concluded that relicensing these six projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, given the location and interaction of the projects, staff is considering preparing one multi-project Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that describes and evaluates the probable impacts of the applicants' proposed and alternative operating procedures, new generating facilities, environmental enhancement measures, and associated facilities for the eight developments that comprise the six hydropower projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staffs EIS will consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of relicensing the six projects, and will include economic and financial analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will by analyzed by the Commission staff and considered in a final EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One element of the EIS process is scoping and site visits. These activities are initiated early to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify reasonable alternative operational procedures and environmental enhancement measures that should be evaluated in the EIS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify significant environmental issues related to the operation of the existing projects;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determine the depth of the analysis for issues that will be discussed in the EIS; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify resource issues that are of lesser importance and, consequently, do not require detailed analysis in the EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Site Visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Site visits to the eight developments that comprise the six projects will be held during the three-day period, December 12, 13, and 14, 1994. The purpose of these visits is for interested persons to observe existing area resources and site conditions, learn the locations of proposed new facilities, and discuss project operational procedures with representatives of NiMO, Finch, Pruyn and Company, Inc., Moreau Manufacturing Corporation, and the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For details concerning the site visits, please contact Jerry Sabattis of NiMO in Syracuse, New York at (315) 428&hyph;5582, David Manny of Finch, Pruyn and Company, Inc. in Glens Falls, New York at (518) 793&hyph;2541, and Kenneth Oriole of Moreau Manufacturing Corporation in Syracuse, New York at (315) 471&hyph;2881.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission staff will conduct two scoping meetings: the evening meeting will be designed to obtain input from the general public, while the morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns.

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts keep their appeal - But how should you buy them? / A look at the options Back to basics is a slogan more suited to private investors than politicians. Now that the base rate, currently 5.25 per cent, appears to be approaching its lowest point, investors may need to re-examine the fixed income element of their portfolios. UK government bonds, known as gilts, have provided investors with the chance to earn a higher yield or income available from bank or building society accounts in the past couple of years. Interest rates have been declining since the end of 1990, but those investors hungry for income can still get a higher yield from long-dated gilts than from a standard deposit account. At the top end of the range, bank and building society accounts offer between 5-6 per cent gross. Redemption yields on longer-dated gilts were hovering at just below 7 per cent last week, giving a real return of just over 4 per cent. However, those investors hoping to see a continuation of the gilt market rally and the prospect of further capital gains may need to reconsider their strategy. Economists and bond analysts are wondering if the bull run in gilts has much further to go. Providing inflation stays firmly under control, some economists think the base rate could come down further, perhaps to 4 per cent. But many big institutional investors, with a more international portfolio, regard the gilt market as overvalued. There are three main ways to buy or sell gilts. The National Savings Stock Register (NSSR) This method has the advantage of being cheap in terms of commission and convenient in that you receive your dividend income gross (although taxpayers, of course, are obliged to declare the income), but the disadvantage is that you buy and sell 'blind.' The NSSR offers the complete range of gilts. You simply fill in a purchase or sale application form, available from most post offices, and send it off with your cheque. You can either invest a specified sum of money (in which case, you simply make the cheque out for the sum invested plus the appropriate commission), or you can buy a specified nominal amount of stock (which means you leave the cheque blank so that the cost can be calculated once the price at which the stock is purchased is known). The NSSR is probably the best way of buying small amounts of stock because the commissions are low - Pounds 1 for amounts up to Pounds 250. Above Pounds 250, there is an extra 50p for each multiple of Pounds 125 purchased. Selling commissions are 10p for every Pounds 10 (or part) on sums under Pounds 100, and Pounds 1 on sums of Pounds 100-Pounds 250. Above Pounds 250, the cost is Pounds 1, with a further 50p for every additional Pounds 125. The main disadvantage of the NSSR is that you have no say in the price you pay for the individual stock. The NSSR aims to process applications the morning they arrive but, like many financial markets, the gilts market can be volatile. Good news, such as the release of an unexpectedly low inflation figure, can send prices much higher, whereas bad news, such as a high government borrowing forecast, can depress them. Your bank or stockbroker Commissions charged by banks and stockbrokers vary but tend to be higher than those charged by the NSSR. Sharelink, an execution-only broker, charges 1.5 per cent on the first Pounds 2,500, 0.75 per cent for the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on amounts over Pounds 5,000. Stockbroker Killik &amp; Co charges 1 per cent on the first Pounds 10,000, 0.4 per cent on the next Pounds 10,000, and 0.125 per cent on additional sums. The big banks also have dealing services for small investors. For example, NatWest has gilt buying and selling services for customers and non-customers. If you are a customer, you can go into a branch and place your order over the counter. There is a minimum commission of Pounds 25. For sums up to Pounds 5,000, you pay 1 per cent commission; for the next Pounds 15,000, 0.5 per cent. There is also a Pounds 1 administration charge. Alternatively, customers and non-customers can use NatWest's 'brokerline' telephone dealing service. Again, the minimum charge is Pounds 25. Commission is 0.75 per cent on deals of up to Pounds 5,000 and 0.25 per cent on the next Pounds 15,000, with an administration charge of Pounds 1. Although the bank or broker route is more expensive, you do have more flexibility when it comes to choosing when to buy or sell. Your broker should also be able to advise you about which particular issue to buy, and whether it is ex-dividend or approaching the dividend payment date. Given the strong rally in the gilt market over the last three years, investors going into the market now are likely to find stocks are trading above par (in other words, above a price of 100). Gilts are redeemed at par, so you will make a capital loss if you hold onto such an issue until maturity. A broker should be able to advise you when to switch into a new, more attractive issue. Income from gilts is taxable but capital gains are tax-exempt. However, capital losses on the gilts cannot be used to offset other capital gains. If you buy gilts through a broker, you are buying them from the Bank of England register and your income will be paid net. Non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax, but if you want to receive your income gross, you can transfer Pounds 5,000 nominal of any one stock in any given calendar year from the Bank of England register to the NSSR. The unit trust route If you prefer to leave the management of your gilt portfolio to someone else, but have a relatively small amount of money to invest, probably the most efficient route is through a unit trust. But be warned: there are plenty of gilt unit trusts which have underperformed the FTA British Government All-Stocks index in the past 12 months. As a unit trust investor, you are liable to both income and capital gains tax (but you have a Pounds 5,800 capital allowance). Most unit trusts also charge: apart from a front-end fee (between 0-4 per cent), there is the annual fee (of 0.75-1.25 per cent). Finally, remember that investing in gilts is more risky than putting your money on deposit in a bank or building society, since gilt prices can rise or fall.</p>

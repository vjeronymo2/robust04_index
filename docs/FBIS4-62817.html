			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today" newscast: Announcer-read report over </F> video of the Northern Fleet's nuclear waste dump at Guba  Andreyeva]    [Text] [Tatyana Mitkova over buildings, submarines in  snowy bay] This is the Northern Fleet's temporary storage  facility for radioactive waste at Guba Andreyeva. TV  journalists from Moscow were not admitted. The explanation:  "It is just an ordinary nuclear waste dump of which there are  quite a few in Russia." Yet its main danger lies precisely in  its ordinariness. Especially since people here avoid even  mentioning the "Andreyevka." But all secrets come out  eventually, and so....    Instead of the statutory 300 people supposed to ensure the  burial of spent nuclear fuel rods, only 100 work here. They are  all military men, but they include a lot of unskilled people.  Elementary protective clothing is in short supply. Officers are  letting sailors have their suits. There is not even a  suggestion of safety equipment. Heroic feats are accomplished  here if not daily, then once every three months. This is the  interval at which the freight -- spent fuel rods from reactors  of nuclear submarines -- is delivered.    According to an officer who works at "Andreyevka" the method  of unloading them corresponds to the pre-revolutionary level of  metal processing. An officer lies on his back to monitor the  position of the reactor roof [kryshka reactora]. If it shifts  even by a millimeter, he shouts "Stop!" Should he make a  mistake, a thermal explosion would occur, i.e. a situation  similar to Chernobyl.</p>

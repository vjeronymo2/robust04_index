			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Trade deficit eases to Pounds 1.06bn BRITAIN'S visible trade gap narrowed slightly last month with a fall in both exports and imports, official figures showed yesterday. The value of imported goods was 2.7 per cent lower last month compared with August, while the value of exports fell by 2 per cent. That left a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.06bn, compared with Pounds 1.15bn in August. The current-account deficit, which includes a projected Pounds 0.1bn surplus on invisible items such as financial services, government transfers and dividends, narrowed to Pounds 0.96bn against Pounds 1.05bn in August. The Central Statistical Office, which published the figures, said sterling's recent devaluation had yet to make an impact on the current account. The only indication came from a 1 per cent increase in import prices, the biggest rise for almost two years. City commentators warned that Britain's trade position was likely to deteriorate over the months ahead as more expensive imports pushed the deficit on the current account wider than Pounds 1bn a month, about the level at which it has been running since the beginning of the year. Export growth is also likely to remain subdued as Britain's main markets in Europe contract. The Treasury said last month's 2 per cent fall in exports was 'not surprising, given the slowdown in world economies'. The underlying trade deficit, which excludes earnings from oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones, also narrowed in September to stand at Pounds 1.3bn compared with Pounds 1.65bn in the previous month. The CSO pointed out that in the latest three months, the trade picture had barely changed. In the latest quarter, the visible trade deficit was Pounds 3.3bn compared with Pounds 3.2bn in the second quarter. The value of imports was Pounds 0.2bn lower than in the previous quarter while the value of exported goods was Pounds 0.34bn lower. Measured by volume, exports excluding oil and erratics rose 2.5 per cent last month compared with August, but remained well below the peak reached in May this year. Import volumes fell by 2 per cent from August's record high. In the latest three months, export volumes fell 1 per cent compared with the previous quarter, while imports rose 1.5 per cent. Mr Gwyn Hacche, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'There is still this puzzle of why imports are so strong, given the weakness of the economy, and why the underlying trade deficit is so wide at the very bottom of a recession.' The strongest-performing export sectors in the third quarter were food, drink and tobacco, fuels, cars and certain consumer goods. Exports of basic materials and intermediate and capital goods fell. There were big increases in import volumes of fuels, chemical and consumer goods over the latest quarter. The surplus on oil fell from Pounds 251m in August to Pounds 77m last month. Exports to all areas other than to east Europe and north America, including Canada, fell over the three months to September. Exports to oil-exporting countries dropped 14 per cent compared with the second quarter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT (Pounds bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          -------Visible Trade Balance-------                Current          Less oil,                    Invisibles                Balance   Total   erratics   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990             -17.0   -18.8      -21.1     101.7     120.5      +1.8 1991              -6.3   -10.3      -13.6     103.4     113.7      +4.0   Qtr 4           -1.7    -2.6       -3.5      26.2      28.8      +0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992   Qtr 1           -2.8    -3.0       -3.5      26.1      29.1      +0.1   Qtr 2           -2.8    -3.2       -3.8      26.7      29.8      +0.3   Qtr 3           -3.0    -3.3       -4.3      26.3      29.7      +0.3 Jan               -1.1    -1.1       -1.3       8.2       9.4     +0.05 Feb               -0.9    -1.0       -1.1       8.9       9.9     +0.05 Mar               -0.8    -0.9       -1.1       8.9       9.8     +0.05 Apr               -1.2    -1.4       -1.5       8.7      10.2      +0.1 May               -0.7    -0.8       -1.2       9.1      10.0      +0.1 June              -0.8    -0.9       -1.2       8.7       9.7      +0.1 July              -1.0    -1.1       -1.3       8.8       9.9      +0.1 August            -1.0    -1.1       -1.6       8.8      10.0      +0.1 September         -0.9    -1.0       -1.3 8.7 9.7+0.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for July to September 1992 are projections.

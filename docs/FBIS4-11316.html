			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president  of the Council of State, described today as useful and  beneficial the authorities' three-day meeting with more than 200  members of Cuban communities from 29 countries.    In brief statements to reporters, Lage commented on the  current state of the economy and its outlook and then added that  the meetings with the emigrants were held in an atmosphere of  mutual respect.    The meeting began last Friday with the primary objective of  normalizing ties between the country and Cuban nationals living  abroad.    Lage pointed out that the main obstacle to achieving that  objective is the hostile policy that the United States has had  toward the island for the past 35 years.    He added that the blockade imposed by Washington is also an  obstacle to the emigrants' aspirations to participate in the  official plan to increase foreign investment on the island.    He pointed out that the blockade, which has lasted for more  than three decades, is a serious violation of the human rights  of 11 million Cubans. That is why anything done to eliminate it  is the fairest and most just course of action.    Lage said the emigrants could help the country by increasing  their awareness of the damage inflicted on their nation of  origin by U.S. policy and of the need to fight against the  blockade.</p>

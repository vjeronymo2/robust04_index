During the meeting, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed to  regional issues, as well as falling world oil prices, as among  the most basic issues that warrant cooperation among all Muslim  countries, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian  president also stressed the need for greater unity and  cooperation between Islamic countries.    The meeting between the Saudi minister and the Iranian  president has attracted the attention of many political  observers. Though Iran-Saudi Arabian ties have undergone  several ups and downs during recent years, the trend of events  of recent months reveal that the two countries' officials, in  view of the significance of Iran-Saudi unity and the need for  expanding bilateral cooperation, have opened a new phase of  bilateral ties with the intention of reinforcing unity among  Islamic countries and overcoming the problems of the Muslim  world.    Iran-Saudi ties basically have wide dimensions, since they  are the major oil-producing countries among OPEC members. In  connection with oil production, analysts believe cooperation  between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the largest oil and gas  reserves in the world, can play a significant role in  stabilizing oil prices; so much so that economic experts say the  two countries can have a great impact on checking the falling  price of oil, stabilizing it on the world market.    Besides, the two countries' membership in the Organization  of  Islamic Conference, the OIC, further reveals the significance of  bilateral relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This is so  because, if the two countries reach a ground for bilateral  understanding, their key and effective role in improving the  situation of the Muslim ummah [community] will become  undeniable. Therefore, under the present conditions, when bloody  fighting in some Islamic countries has created a difficult  situation, the (?power) of Muslim ummah coordination among the  OIC member states, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia, can be of  special significance in following up the problems of Muslim  nations. It is worth noting that during the meeting, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed the deepening of ties in the areas  of mutual interest, stressing the need for the exchange of  economic and political delegations between the two countries to  bring the viewpoints of Iran and Saudi Arabia closer. The  president said he would send a special envoy to Saudi Arabia  soon to hold talks on issues of mutual interest and to present a  message to King Fahd in response to the one sent by the Saudi  king.</p>

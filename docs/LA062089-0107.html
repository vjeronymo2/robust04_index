			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iran's presidential election will be held July 28, three weeks earlier than  planned, and the new president will begin his four-year term before the  official October starting date, the Interior Ministry announced. It gave no  reason, but the move appeared aimed at speeding the transition of power after  the June 3 death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It would consolidate  control under his successor as spiritual leader, President Ali Khamenei, and  Khamenei's likely successor as head of state, Parliament Speaker Hashemi  Rafsanjani.  </P></p>

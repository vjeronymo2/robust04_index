The media of informal science education include but are not limited to: Interactive exhibits, hands-on activities, and film/video productions. Examples of energy-related areas within the fundamental energy sciences include high energy and nuclear physics, nuclear science and technologies, global warming, waste management, energy efficiency, new materials development, fossil energy resources, renewable energy, health effects research including the human genome, emerging energy technologies, risk assessment, energy/environment, space exploration initiative, public science literacy, and other timely topics. The purpose of the program is to fund the development, use, and/or replication of creative informal science education media which focus on energy-related science and technology. Replication of informal science education funded under this program or other DOE supported programs will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of this notice, ``museum'' means: An established nonprofit institution serving the public on a year-round basis, providing interactive exhibits, demonstrations, and informal educational programs designed to further public understanding of science and technology. The term also includes organizations referred to as science centers, science-technology centers and youth museums. Thus, museums, as defined in this document, are eligible to submit Financial Assistance applications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Preapplications are to include an original and one copy and must be received by February 14, 1995.

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Altron advances 8% in difficult environment ALTRON, the diversified South African electronics, information technology and power electrical group, overcame a difficult operating environment to record an 8 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of August. Although turnover remained steady at R1.3bn (Dollars 461m), pressure on margins caused operating income to fall to R130.4m from R141.5m a year earlier. But significantly higher interest income, at R12.8m compared with R7m, coupled with lower outside shareholders' interest and a higher contribution from non-consolidated subsidiaries, saw attributable earnings rise to R48.8m from R45.1m. Earnings per share rose by 8 per cent to 257 cents from 238 cents. A single annual dividend is declared at the end of the financial year. Mr Bill Venter, chairman, said the main three operating divisions - Altech, Fintech and Powertech - had performed soundly, despite the depressed economy and extensive labour and political unrest. Earnings rose slightly at Altech, fell by 9 per cent at Powertech and were 30 per cent ahead at Fintech. Mr Venter said Altron's export focus was producing benefits and order books were up.</p>

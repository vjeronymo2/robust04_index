			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: News round-up HONG KONG It has been an interesting time for Hong Kong watchers over the past few days: Morgan Stanley's Barton Biggs cut his weighting in the equity market, Nomura's Nick Knight increased his and Goldman Sachs downgraded Hong Kong Telecom, one of the key stocks. This week could be just as uneasy - the Hang Seng index dropped back 4.5 per cent last week - as investors wait to see if US money continues flowing. Some analysts suggest that, in any case, the market may consolidate before a traditional rally prior to the Chinese new year. BANGKOK TelecomAsia has fixed the offer price of its sale of 223m shares at Bt55 a share, making it Thailand's biggest public offering, valued at Bt12.3bn. The offer period for the telecommunications group will take place this week with the shares due to be listed by mid-December. Half the shares will be offered to Thai investors and half to overseas institutions. The company will have the market's second biggest capitalisation, following Bangkok Bank. MOSCOW Russia's biggest single oil producer is being offered for sale to domestic investors via a public auction. Surgutneftegaz, a Siberian company, is offering 12.05 per cent of its shares, but foreigners are not permitted to subscribe. They will, however, be able to invest up to 15 per cent in parent group Yukos when that is floated in due course although no date for that has been set. BRATISLAVA Daily trading and weekly auctions in the country's over-the-counter market are expected to be introduced from January. RMS Slovakia AS, which manages trading on the OTC, commented that this would replace the current monthly auctions and hoped to attract both retail and institutional investors. TURKEY Foreign investment trusts and mutual funds purchasing shares in Turkey are to be exempted from corporate and witholding tax. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders said the decision clarified what had been a grey area. Overseas investors have been very active in the Istanbul market this year, while declining short-term interest rates have prompted domestic investors to switch into equities. VENEZUELA The government has suspended the privatisation programme two weeks ahead of general elections. President Ramon Velasquez said a decision on how to proceed with the programme would be taken by the new administration when it takes office on February 2. The proposed flotation of Aeropostal, the state airline, is among the casualties. ZIMBABWE Zimbabwe, added to the IFC's emerging market's index last week along with China, is beginning to attract a limited amount of foreign interest, although it still remains very illiquid. The industrial index of some 50 stocks has been recovering this year after a steep fall in 1992 because of a severe drought. PNG Another new addition to the list of the world's emerging markets could come about later next year after the government here said that if there was enough interest from brokers and dealers a stock exchange could become operational.</p>

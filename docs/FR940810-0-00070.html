			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(3) of the construction standard states the enforcement rule that regardless of who created a hazard, the employer of exposed employees is required to comply with applicable protective provisions to protect his employees. An example recited in the regulatory text presents the situation of employees working immediately adjacent to a Class I regulated area. If there is a breach of the enclosure or the critical barriers surrounding the asbestos work, employees working immediately adjacent to the work may be exposed to asbestos. The employer responsible for erecting the enclosure is required to insure its integrity. However, in the event that such repair is delayed or not made, the employer of the exposed ``bystander employees'' must designate a ``competent person'' to evaluate the exposure potential, conduct initial monitoring or an ``exposure assessment,'' and supervise other required protective actions. The evaluation may include the amount of time and frequency adjacent workers are exposed. For example, although passing through a contaminated area on the way to perform non-asbestos related activities is technically work which exposes employees to asbestos, the competent person's evaluation properly may conclude that no appreciable exposure is possible because of the brevity of the ``work'' in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Regulated Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (e) General Industry, Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards. Regulated areas are a traditional component of OSHA health standards. They segregate both the work and the worker so as to better regulate the work, and to protect uninvolved employees from exposure. The 1986 standards required regulated areas for work above the PELs and in construction, for demolition, renovation and removal activities. The final standards require that regulated areas be established where the PELS are likely to be exceeded, and under the construction and shipyard employment standards, where Class I, II and III asbestos work is performed. These requirements are substantively similar to those proposed in 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic requirements of the regulated areas are the same for all three standards, They are changed from the current standard to more coherently reflect the rest of the standard's provisions. For example, paragraph (e)(2) which requires the regulated area to be ``demarcated to minimize the number of persons within the area, and to protect persons outside the area from exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos'' has been changed in two ways. The phrase ``in any manner,'' has been deleted. Since, paragraph (g) requires critical barriers for Class I and II work, and paragraph (k) requires warning signs outside regulated areas, demarcation must incorporate barriers and signs where otherwise required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has also deleted the phrase ``in excess of the TWA and/or excursion limit'' in the construction and shipyard employment standards to describe the level of protection intended to be offered persons outside the regulated area. Since OSHA has determined that a still significant risk remains below the PELS, intended protection should not be limited to protecting down to these levels. OSHA noted in its 1990 proposal that in the construction standard, ``the regulated area controls are proposed to apply even when exposures may be less than the newly proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc'' (55 FR at 29716), however, no change was proposed for the ``demarcation'' provision. Paragraph (e)(3) is unchanged and continues to limit access to regulated areas to ``authorized persons.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulated area requirements for construction and shipyard industry delete former and proposed (e)(6), which dictated when negative pressure enclosures (NPEs) must be erected, and various duties required of the ``competent persons'' to ensure integrity of the regulated area and enclosure. Under OSHA's former approach, negative pressure enclosures were, in many cases, how construction employers should have demarcated their regulated areas. OSHA focussed on the role of such enclosures in providing ``bystander protection.'' In these final standards, OSHA is repositioning the NPE provisions to paragraph (g), ``methods of compliance.'' There, these systems are required to reduce exposures of the employees who are disturbing the asbestos who are inside the enclosures, as well as employees outside the enclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Exposure Assessment and Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d) General Industry. There are no changes to the exposure monitoring provisions of the General Industry Standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standard. To conform with the newly revised approach to categorization of asbestos work, and to reflect the difficulties of reliably estimating asbestos exposures based on limited past or current exposure monitoring, the requirements for exposure monitoring in the 1986 standard have been changed. First, there is a general requirement that all employers who have a workplace covered by this standard conduct an ``initial exposure assessment'' at the beginning of each asbestos job [(paragraph (f)(2)]. Exceptions to this requirement exist only for most Class IV work. The ``assessment'' must be conducted by the ``competent person.'' The purposes of these ``assessments'' are to predict whether exposure levels during the planned asbestos work can be expected to exceed the PELs, and thus whether additional monitoring, and other precautions are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

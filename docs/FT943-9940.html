			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Few Frankfurt observers doubt that the Bundesbank still has room to resume easing the discount rate, but many are beginning to question whether action will come before the federal elections in October. As encouraging economic indicators accumulate - filling order books and falling unemployment came last week - the less reason the German central bank has to think of cuts in the near future, at least as an aid to recovery. Latest retail sales figures, due this week, are expected to embellish the (for the bank) heartening recent pattern. Preliminary indications, including a poor summer sales season, are that private consumption is still slowing. In the coming weeks most attention inside and outside the Bundesbank will focus on money supply data. Further welcome deceleration is expected as the year progresses. Whether and when the bank accepts the trend as established and as a reason to reduce the discount rate might well depend on political judgment as much as monetary know-how. On balance, the view is that its president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, would prefer not to lay himself open to accusations of offering pre-election help to his friend Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the coalition led by his Christian Democrat party, although recent polls suggest he is doing quite well unaided.</p>

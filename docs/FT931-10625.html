			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Economics: Markets will study UK data to see whether inflation is under control THIS WEEK'S UK data, including the producer prices index tomorrow and the retail prices index on Friday, will give some indication as to whether the government's apparent confidence on inflation is justified. The recent one point cut in base rates to 6 per cent led some commentators to suggest the government was acting too hastily and that it now faces the uncomfortable prospect of rising inflation. The inflationary impact of the devalued pound and monetary easing has yet to show up in the headline rate of inflation. Cuts in mortgage interest payments drove the retail prices index lower to an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in December, and are expected to have pushed it down even further last month. However, the index excluding mortgage interest payments has already shown some hesitant upwards movement. In December it rose to within 0.3 percentage points of the upper limit of the Treasury's target range (1-4 per cent), and is forecast to have risen to 3.9 per cent last month. Seasonal food prices usually rise in January, and price rises for alcoholic drinks as Christmas offers ended may also have pushed the underlying rate upwards. The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the week. Figures in brackets are the consensus of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

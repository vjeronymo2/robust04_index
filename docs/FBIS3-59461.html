			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Rasim Delic, commander of the </F> General Staff of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of  Bosnia-Herzegovina; place and date not given: "Expecting  Turnabout"]    [Text] Former commander Safer Halilovic, who allowed  the formation of irregular units and who did not prevent the  formation of private armies that looted throughout Sarajevo, was  replaced by Rasim Delic. Delic was born in Celic near Brcko in  northeastern Bosnia. After his elementary school education he  enrolled in a military school. He is one of the few officers in  the Bosnian Army who has graduated from the Staff Command  College [komandno-stabna skola]. Anyone in the Yugoslav  People's Army who wanted to reach the rank of general had to  complete his studies at this school. He left the Yugoslav  People's Army with the rank of colonel. On 12 April 1992 he  deserted and joined improvised units of the Territorial Defense.  Before he became commander, he was the head of a logistics base  in charge of arms procurement. The import and transportation of  the bulk of the arms with which the Bosnians have been supplied  have passed through his former base in Visoko, near Zenica. One  of his first actions at the helm of the Bosnian Army was not  carried out on the front lines, but in Sarajevo itself.    [NEDELJNA BORBA] Local bosses were dispensing justice in the  town and the surrounding hills as recently as February.    [Delic] They are called bullies.    [NEDELJNA BORBA] Where have they disappeared to?    [Delic] In Sarajevo there were several smaller and larger  groups, above all in the old part of the town. These groups  operated outside the system of command and did not recognize the  military hierarchy, nor were they obeying orders. Members of  these groups also took part in the fighting, but in their own  way. We had a mountain of problems with them. They were  involved in criminal activities, they were abducting people,  forcing them to dig trenches, and stealing money. They also did  even worse things. We know about several murders that were  committed by them. This had nothing to do with the nationality  of these people and their units. They only wanted to profit from  the war. The thrust of that action solved the problem of two  main disobedient groups, which began to obstruct the work of the  legal authorities, thus damaging the reputation of the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. After that we took care of the lower  ranking people involved in war profiteering and criminal  activities who were using the uniforms of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to disguise their activities. First, we had  to make sure that this would not cause or lead to any retreat  from the front lines, that it would not lead to internal  clashes, and that the entire thing was carried out  professionally, as appropriate for a state.    [NEDELJNA BORBA] How do you think you will win this war?    [Delic] I do not know whether the world will let anyone win.  They have introduced an arms embargo only on us. Despite this,  we are the only military force on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina that is gaining in strength every day and has  the possibilities for further military consolidation. Croatian  units, without direct support from Croatia, are not an army at  all. Serbian paramilitary formations without arms and without  direct support from the Yugoslav Army would not be a special  force either. From the organizational and staffing point of  view, we have the best prospects. If we had the suitable  technical capability for operations, if we were at least  technically nearly as strong as the aggressor's forces, there  could be a turnabout in the war. This would be important  because after that the negotiating position of our country would  be considerably more favorable and the chances of a sensible  political solution much greater.    [NEDELJNA BORBA] Who is fighting on your side?    [Delic] The brunt of every army is borne by the lower and  middle ranks. We have people of every profession in the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, ranging from university professors to  workers and farmers. This is a war for survival and all those  who know that fighting is the only way to survive and to win  freedom and peace are taking part in it. Of course, not all of  them bear the same burden. People who used to be in political  and administrative services are perhaps hit the hardest, but  they are also taking part in other spheres. The final victory  will not only be won by military action. All those who stayed on  our territory are involved in the fighting. If nothing else,  they suffer because of the war.    [NEDELJNA BORBA] What is your attitude toward those capable  of fighting but have fled the country?    [Delic] Wars produce heroes, deserters, cowards, war  profiteers, and completely normal people. The brunt of the war  is being borne by normal people, by ordinary men who do not  stand out from the the crowd. Those who become media stars have  become that because of the war. Many people taking part in the  fighting remain anonymous. They are in the trenches, and they  are the only heroes of this war. This is why we can condemn  those who left. But also, just because of that, we can show  understanding. People are either afraid or have their own views  on it. Nevertheless, peace will be established one day and the  state will have to confront them. My view differs from that  held by others that they should be banned from coming back.  There are not enough people in Bosnia for us to allow ourselves  to prohibit them from coming back. The only thing that we  should do is prevent those who left before the war to make a  profit out of it. I personally would not want to see them come  back as investors of capital or to take up important posts. One  must know that there is a difference between those who fought  and those who did not.</p>

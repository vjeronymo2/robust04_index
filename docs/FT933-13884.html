			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sanyo falls and warns of 'severe' environment SANYO Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics group, says parent profits for the six months ended May tumbled 77 per cent to Y2.2bn (Dollars 20m) while at the consolidated level the group has made a net loss of Y2.7bn. The company blamed the disappointing outcome on continuing weak demand for capital investment in Japan, the strength of the yen and sluggish sales in Europe. It warned of a 'severe' business environment ahead. Consumer electronics products such as colour TVs and VCRs were still in the doldrums while sales of high-price home appliances such as air conditioners and office equipment also declined. Sales for the parent company declined 8.4 per cent to Y500.7bn. In the domestic market, they were down 12 per cent at Y334bn due in large part to declines in audio goods and other electrical products. Sales fell to Y732.2bn from Y737.9bn. In overseas markets, however, sales rose 4.9 per cent to Y303.3bn. With personal consumption likely to remain weak in the current six months, Sanyo is forecasting annual parent sales of Y1,035bn and net income of Y4bn, and consolidated sales of Y1,530bn and a consolidated net loss of Y1bn. The company is undergoing a restructuring aimed at decentralising management and improving operating efficiency.</p>

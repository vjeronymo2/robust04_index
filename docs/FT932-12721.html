			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Boots reveals death risk of heart drug THE Boots Company, the UK retailer and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday revealed that Manoplax, its heart drug, can lead to significantly higher mortality. The revelation is a severe blow for the company's pharmaceuticals division, whose executives have described the medicine as one of the last hopes for the drugs operation. Mr Terry Richardson, international and marketing director said last year: 'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of reshaping the whole business.' Manoplax was predicted as potentially eventually generating sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year. Boots said sales of the drug, launched in the UK last September and in the US this March, had been far above expectations. The company said preliminary results from a clinical trial involving 3,500 patients in the US, Canada and Sweden, had suggested that patients with severe congestive heart failure taking 100mg of Manoplax a day had a 'significantly increased risk of death compared with those not receiving the drug'. Boots would not say how large the increase in mortality had been, nor would it state when the results of the trial, called the Profile study, would be published. It said the full analysis of the data, which might show if the increased mortality had been among a sub-set of patients, would be known in two to three weeks. 'We have had a very difficult couple of days with the US and British regulatory authorities which have different views about the significance of the trial,' said Mr Alastair Eperon, director of corporate affairs at Boots. The company said the data did not suggest there was an increased risk of death at a dose of 75mg. It said the company had every confidence in the future prospects of Manoplax. Boots has been forced to write to all US, Canadian, Scandinavian and British physicians who might prescribe the drug, warning them not to use the 100mg dose. Manoplax has been dogged by controversy. Delays before it was licensed were so long that the medicine was dubbed by analysts 'Mananaplax'. Lex, Page 20</p>

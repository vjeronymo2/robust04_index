In  mid-November, Middle Eastern sources told CORRIERE DELLA SERA  that two important figures from the Greek "17 November"  terrorist group went to Tehran for secret talks with Pasdaran  officers and cadres of the Iranian intelligence services.  During their stay in the Iranian capital, the Greek extremists  met with Mohsen Rezai, the powerful and influential leader of  the "Guardians of the Revolution," and with officers charged  with exporting the Shi'ite revolution. The "17 November"  leaders went to assess the possibility of cooperating with  Tehran and asked their interlocutors to provide arms and funds.  According to leaks, the visit to Iran was the first step toward  a new offensive by the Greek extremists, not only against local  targets but also against Western offices, personalities, and  institutions.    Tehran, therefore, apparently has been successful in  bringing  into its fold one of Europe's most dangerous and mysterious  subversive groups. The formation takes its name from the fierce  repressive action implemented on 17 November 1973 by the Greek  military junta. Consisting of no more than 20 to 30 members,  the "17 November" group has played a major role in a spectacular  series of attacks. The assault groups have killed judges,  politicians, and even the CIA's "mission chief" in Greece.    The extremist group always has been shrouded in mystery.  Indeed, the police have failed to capture even one of them, a  situation that has fueled the strangest speculation. Some  people even have gone as far as to suspect the secret services,  while others have accused Papandreou's PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] of complicity. In the past, evidence has  surfaced linking the "17 November" group to Arab or Palestinian  007's.    In recent weeks the ayatollahs once more have loosened their  purse strings to fund Middle Eastern extremist formations. In  fact, during a recent meeting in Damascus, the Iranians promised  Hamas $10 million.</p>

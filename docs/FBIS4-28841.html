			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea was certainly  caught by surprise but the situation looked better than first  imagined Tuesday after a night of fumbling over North Korea's  announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    "We always worked with a situation in mind where North Korea  would go ahead and pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT)," said one Foreign Ministry official on condition  of anonymity. "This is weaker than that, although it is  apparently a prior warning."    Even when North Korea does formally quit the IAEA, its NPT  membership still requires it to accept nuclear inspections by  the agency.    North Korea was apparently well aware of this. In a Foreign  Ministry statement Monday night announcing its IAEA withdrawal,  Pyongyang said it would not comply with IAEA safeguards measures.    For a South Korean Government that stood ready to counter  the  North's NPT withdrawal, Monday's announcement was, as another  ministry official put it, "the mildest action North Korea could  take."    Predictable changes will first occur at the UN Security  Council. The United States still hasn't tabled its draft  resolution and is now expected to harden the tone of the  resolution to show firmness toward North Korea.    "But the draft, if it is to change in tone, will not veer  away from the original strategy," said the Foreign Ministry  official. The original strategy is to seek step-by-step  sanctions starting, for example, with a cultural and  technological embargo.    Seoul's immediate concern is former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter's visit to Pyongyang, which begins Wednesday.    North Korea has used the repeated ploy of sending a double  signal -- hard-line and conciliatory -- at the same time to sow  confusion.    If the IAEA withdrawal is a hard-line message, then North  Korean leader Kim Il-song may use Carter's visit to deliver a  conciliatory message to the United States that Washington will  find hard to either ignore or accept officially.    What North Korea suggests now can change the momentum at the  UN Security Council, especially regarding China, which may  insist on more diplomatic dialogue.    For now, Pyongyang is using the IAEA withdrawal card as a  double-edged sword, waving it as a threat and trying to force  the United States to the negotiating table.    Interpretations by officials here, in essence, focused on  North Korea's need to show its threats were not merely words,  especially before the UN Security Council resolution comes down.  By showing that it can quit the NPT and actually leaving [as  received] the IAEA, North Korea tried to hit a weak spot in  Washington, which champions the NPT regime as a major element of  foreign policy.    At the same time, North Korea strategically minimized the  impact of its action by leaving its ties with the NPT intact to  save this card for later in countering UN sanctions.    There is little that Seoul can do now, officials say, except  to make sure that Carter understands South Korea's position on  the current crisis and to ensure that its stance is reflected in  the upcoming Security Council resolution.</p>

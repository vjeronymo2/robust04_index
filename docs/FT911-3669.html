			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Bulgarian PM promises a law on privatisation and property BULGARIA will have a law on privatisation and property rights in place by the autumn as part of the coalition government's timetable for implementing a second package of reforms aimed at creating a market economy, Mr Dimiter Popov, the prime minister, said yesterday. The measures, which are expected to allow Bulgarians to own and buy property, are also designed to open up the country to foreign investment. Little in the way of foreign investment has flowed into Bulgaria in recent months, largely because the current legislation is either too vague on taxes, or too restrictive on the repatriation of profits. Moreover, investors have shied away from Bulgaria because until recently the country was too unstable; western commercial bank creditors have not yet agreed to reschedule the Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5bn) debt owed to the London Club. However, Mr Popov, who was elected prime minister last December following the resignation of the socialist government, stressed Bulgaria's new stability. 'It is definitely stable. The parliament is working hard to draft and pass new legislation. The political climate is much better,' he said. Since January, when a coalition government consisting of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose grouping of 19 political groupings, and the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), was set up, Bulgaria has embarked on a tight monetary policy. In February, prices were increased four-fold, a squeeze on credit and consumer spending has been successfully implemented, and the first phase of land reform - the return of a maximum of 30 hectares to its original owners before 1946 - has been passed. At the same time, industrial production has plummeted by 20 per cent because of the collapse of the Soviet market and a moratorium on western credits. But the success of these reforms has been overshadowed by bitter infighting between the UDF and the BSP about who should control the political and economic agenda. Mr Popov, 63, politically independent, and a lawyer by profession, denies that purges in the administration have taken place. 'We will not start any revenge. No such thing has taken place in Bulgaria. Those with talent will be promoted, irrespective of their political background. But we will not accept those who abused their position in the former regime.' The former regime, led by Mr Todor Zhivkov, who is now standing trial for corruption charges, was toppled from power in a bloodless palace coup in November, 1989. The BSP (former communist party) won a comfortable majority in last June's free elections. However, BSP sympathisers and UDF officials admit that the UDF leadership remains determined to purge former communists. Mr Popov says his aim to to create 'a new civil service based on competence and competition.'</p>

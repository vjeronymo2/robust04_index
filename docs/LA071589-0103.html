			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIVING OUT LEAFLETS IN SHOPPING MALL OKD  </P> <P> A West Los Angeles anti-nuclear group has won a court order allowing it to  distribute information to patrons of shopping malls.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California called Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin's ruling "a victory for freedom of speech."  </P> <P> Lewin granted a preliminary injunction that bars mall owners from preventing  individuals or groups from entering a mall "simply to hand out information or  talk to patrons," ACLU officials said. The ACLU had sued Culver City's Fox  Hills Mall on the anti-nuclear group's behalf.  </P> <P> Members of Westside SANE/FREEZE were prevented from distributing information  decrying nuclear testing by a policy that prohibited advocating political  issues in the mall -- with the exception of voter registration or circulation  of ballot petitions, ACLU officials said.  </P> <P> Lewin reaffirmed on Wednesday a 1979 decision "which recognized that today's  shopping malls are yesterday's town squares," said ACLU attorney Robin Toma.  </P></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Quebec independence push clouded Fresh uncertainty has entered the debate on Quebec independence with the serious illness of Mr Lucien Bouchard, the separatist side's most popular and, arguably, most canny leader. Mr Bouchard, who heads the Bloc Quebecois, the party which represents the sovereignty cause in the federal parliament in Ottawa, is likely to be out of the political arena for several months. His left leg was amputated late last week in a bid to stop the spread of deadly necrotising myositis, also known as 'flesh-eating disease'. The francophone province's newly-elected separatist government has indicated however, that Mr Bouchard's absence will not interfere with plans for an independence referendum during 1995. The government is due to unveil part of its referendum strategy in Quebec's national assembly later today. It is expected to set up a public commission, which will ostensibly examine the benefits and costs of independence, but in reality will give the separatists a high-profile platform in the run-up to the referendum. Doctors at St Luc Hospital in Montreal said Mr Bouchard entered hospital a week ago for treatment of phlebitis when the attack by the muscle-consuming bacteria was discovered. He remains in intensive care and will require several months of convalescence, they said. Political analysts are unsure whether Mr Bouchard's brush with death will help or hinder the separatist cause. Some commentators predict his popularity will soar, much as President Ronald Reagan's did after an assassination attempt in 1981. Separatists have seized on the political nuances of a note which Mr Bouchard scribbled to his doctors: 'Que l'on continue' (let us continue). Others suggest, however, that Mr Bouchard's absence from the political scene for a prolonged period could harm the separatists' campaign. In particular, it is likely to blunt the Bloc Quebecois' offensive in the House of Commons. Mr Bouchard has generally been a voice of moderation in separatist ranks. His absence could thus bolster the influence of the more headstrong Mr Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and leader of the provincial Parti Quebecois. Mr Parizeau pledged in last summer's election campaign that a separatist government would immediately declare Quebec's wish to begin talks on a split from the rest of Canada. But Mr Bouchard's calming influence appears to have persuaded the new government to hold off.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Management: How stress can make you tick at work - Why some people can cope well with pressure while others crack up Stress was once thought to affect only top executives, who had important jobs and stomach ulcers to prove it. But then psychologists discovered that people further down the occupational ladder were even more stressed than those at the top. The floodgates opened and researchers started describing stress in taxi-drivers, stockbrokers, policemen, doctors and even in vicars. Far from being ashamed that they felt under pressure, people began boasting about the stress in their professions. Academic research has now gone a step further: increasingly it shows that although some jobs are stressful, certain types of people survive, while others have problems. The idea is that factors within the individual are as important as ones related to the job. Some researchers put it down to personality, others to early experience, and some are even looking for the job satisfaction gene. This new line of research emerged in the 1980s, striking a chord with the general emphasis placed during the decade on the individual. Most of the studies have followed people over a long period of time to see how they feel about their jobs, to assess their symptoms, and see what effect life events like marriage and relocation have had. One US study using 10 years of survey data on almost 5,000 men and women looked at the effects of major life changes on well-being. It found that individuals' scores were fairly constant over time, even when they had been through stressful events, like changing jobs or partners or moving house. The research does not doubt that most of us feel bad as a reaction to things going wrong or to being under severe pressure. Instead, its message is that the majority find it relatively easy to adapt to these changes, but the rest will react with symptoms of stress. A review by two American stress researchers looking at a number of studies of life stress - occupational or otherwise - concluded that around 25 per cent of the population was chronically stressed. Another long-term American study found that teenagers' dissatisfaction with their jobs correlated closely with how the same people saw their jobs when they were in their fifties. An employer's natural response to this new body of research might be to page the in-house psychologist to identify the stressed workers with a view to firing them. Once that small, dissatisfied group had been removed, the boss could then make the job as difficult as possible, knowing the rest could take it. It is not as easy as that. While some people are more susceptible to stress than others, stressful aspects of the environment do lead to poorer performance and mistakes, whoever is doing the job. A recent study of banks in the US found that the attitudes of the counter staff in any particular branch were closely reflected by the attitudes of the customers. So if the bank clerks were unhappy with the personnel policy of their branch, this was reflected in the customers' attitudes about service. Moreover, stressed people sometimes have other attributes that the organisation needs: a recent study of junior doctors showed that those who were chronically stressed over a couple of years had more empathy with patients than the cheerful lot. There is plenty of evidence that providing psychological help within the workplace, as the Post Office and some commercial organisations have done, reduces the symptoms, improves job satisfaction and discourages absence. A recent study by Professor Cary Cooper and his team from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology found that absence fell by 50 per cent on average for those who had attended the Post Office counselling service. There is also evidence that introducing a more general stress management course - one that reaches cheerful employees as well as those who might be more in need - reduces mistakes. For example, an American study looked at 67 hospitals and found that the number of litigation suits for malpractice was related to levels of stress in the employees. When they introduced an organisation-wide stress management programme, drug prescription errors were halved and litigation suits fell from 31 in one year to nine the next. In a recent study that I conducted with a colleague looking at change in attitudes after therapy, we found that not only did people's symptoms fall after therapy but they also liked their jobs more. They enjoyed being with their colleagues more, felt much more competent and felt their workload was less demanding. They were even more satisfied with their pay. Not everyone reacts to their job in a way which makes them stressed. What matters is that difficult jobs continue to be be improved, and that the people who find themselves affected are given the help they need, wherever it's possible.

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Singapore's Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong has urged the United States to be  pragmatic on the question of China's most-favored-nation status,  according to a report by LONDON FINANCIAL TIMES today.    In an interview with the newspaper, Goh Chok Tong, who was  on  a three-day visit in Britain, warned that a break in Sino-U.S.  relations over the question would have severe long-term  consequences for the world, because China would interpret the  U.S. action as an attempt to limit its growth and would  remember it for a long time.    But he emphasized that he did not foresee a fracture in  relations between the two countries because he did not expect  President Clinton to revoke China's most-favored-nation status  when it comes up for annual renewal in June.    "The U.S. at the end of the day will be rather pragmatic,"  he said. "China is a huge export market for the U.S.. U.S.  business people are putting pressure on the administration that  you can only make a point on human rights thus far and beyond  that the Chinese are not going to move."    If there were a break between China and the U.S., the prime  minister said, Singapore would continue to invest in China. "The  market would be open to those who trade with China," he added.    And China will continue to grow because in China, he said,  "the resources are generated internally, not like the former  Soviet Union which depends on (other countries) for resources."    Goh Chok Tong was in London to spearhead a marketing effort  for Singapore's "External Wing" policy, under which it is  building industrial parks in other Asian countries and wants  foreign companies to set up plants in them while also basing  part of the operation in Singapore.</p>

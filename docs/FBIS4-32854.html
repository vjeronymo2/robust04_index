			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama, 26 May (AFP) -- The U.S. proposal concerning  uniform legislation to eliminate banking secrecy in Latin  America "does not favor Panama's interests" because the country  has enough laws to investigate money laundering activities,  Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Mulino said today.    The United States issued the proposal during a meeting with  representatives of the Andean Pact countries (Bolivia, Colombia,  Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), held on Tuesday and Wednesday in  Bolivia to analyze the struggle against drug trafficking.    The U.S. Department of State representative, Paul Valky,  said  in Bolivia his country considers it essential to eliminate  banking secrecy to fight against drug trafficking.    According to Mulino, "Panama is a sovereign country which  can  decide whether it accepts making its legislation uniform with  that of the United States and other countries, but we have more  than enough laws to fight drug trafficking activities without  endangering banking confidentiality."    The powerful international banking center in Panama is  considered by the U.S. authorities to be an important center for  laundering money resulting from drug trafficking activities.    Mulino asserted: "It is not true that banks in Panama are  impenetrable concerning legal issues or that banking  confidentiality is an absolute regime." Banking confidentiality  "is penetrable" upon request from the legal authorities, when  legal processes are properly carried out, he added. Mulino said  Panama has signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to  fight drug trafficking with the United States, Colombia,  England, and the Central American countries.    Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress has yet to ratify the MLAT  signed in 1992 with Panama, even though the Panamanian  Legislative Assembly ratified the agreement, which allows  authorities in different countries to exchange information about  money laundering activities.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: Ibsen at its best - Theatre This A Doll's House is an exemplary Ibsen production. The Wild Iris Theatre Company could not have introduced themselves better when they staged it last year at the tiny DOC, in Kentish Town - before taking it to the Ibsen Festival in Norway. Now, the larger Bridge Lane Theatre will let many more theatre-lovers savour it. It is the best Ibsen I've seen since the Young Vic's Enemy of the People: far above the latter's current Rosmersholm (over-slick, though well-intentioned), better than the National's uneven Peer Gynt or their recent Hedda (strong but flashy). This Doll's House is played quite straight, in fine, humane detail and faultlessly paced. The result is that we can't patronise the play as 'period-bound', just an Ur-feminist exhibit; on the contrary, we are seized by the story and the characters, amused, moved and even enlightened. All praise to the director Polly Irvin: her directorial hand never obtrudes, but the quality of the ensemble-acting must owe a sizeable debt to her unwinkingly thoughtful care. The designs by Gabrielle Sabran and Colin Hill are no less apt and self-effacing, and thanks to the choreographer Sue Glasser the heroine Nora's Christmas-party tarantella - potentially an embarrassment - boasts a free spirit's flair. Famously, Nora is the first theatrical Wife who Walks Out. Clever Sophie Thursfield makes her disarmingly transparent, provincial and slightly ditzy, where modern fashion expects cruelly downtrodden nobility of soul. That gives her smug husband Torvald (Timothy Bentinck) a decent excuse, however insufficient, for treating her as a dim pet. Which is dramatically all to the good; and it also means that when the time comes for the worm to turn, she can execute the turn-around with scathing simplicity. Their final face-off represents both sides fairly, and is genuinely wrenching. Though Miss Thursfield is admirable, Nora is a treat of a role. Bentinck achieves a greater miracle with his Torvald: neither crudely domineering nor a sentimental twit (the usual readings), but a subtle, vividly detailed study of a young-middle-aged Victorian husband whose paternalism is a matter of unreflective inheritance. We can't but feel for him too, when Bentinck reveals him in such sympathetic depth. On a shorter lead (with only two really dense scenes to explore), Thane Bettany matches him as the doomed medic Dr Rank, dry-eyed, eloquently gentle and uncomplaining. Those three performances are already decisive reasons for seeing the Iris Doll's House. Christopher McHallem's Krogstad, the unhappy 'villain' of the piece, and Julia Lloyd Barrie's destitute, widowed Christine - his lost sweetheart, Nora's stiff-upper-lipped old friend - supply two more. If each of them is a degree nearer caricature than need be (a bit of surplus cringing from McHallem, an excess of spinsterly grit from Barrie), they contrive nonetheless to reunite with tremulous spontaneity. That is beautifully calibrated, well beyond the schematic lines that Ibsen gave them; it makes more of the under-written subplot than ever seemed likely. But don't take my word for it: just go] It may be several years before Ibsen is so well played again in London. A Doll's House, Bridge Lane Theatre, Battersea, SW11, until 24 October</p>

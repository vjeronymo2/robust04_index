			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Kyrgyzstan will have to remain outside the big  economy for many years, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said last  weekend during the conference `Kyrgyzstan is our single house'  in Bishkek.    He believes that Kyrgyzstan was in an unfavorable  geo-political situation since it had no access to the sea or  other "trade communications." Akayev underlined that in the  near future the Republic would depend on the neighboring  countries, especially on Russia since Kyrgyzstan along with the  whole Central Asian region was not in the sphere of interests of  the economically developed countries.    Akayev suggested that no serious foreign investments were  likely to be attracted by the industrial potential of Kyrgyzstan  since the Republic was failing to maintain the industrial  infrastructure. "Since Kyrgyzstan has no other choice, the  government has to suspend activities of many enterprises,"  Akayev said.    Akayev emphasized that foreign investors were not eager to  place their money to the Kyrgyz economy since they were lacking  political stability in Kyrgyzstan and guarantees. "That is why  it is hard to believe that the rating of Kyrgyzstan as a  developing country will go up in the near ten or fifteen years,"  Akayev regretted.    He was sure that the economic and social problems  experienced  by Kyrgyzstan could be overcome only through cooperation with  Russia. The main point here is to enhance the economic relations  and mutually beneficial industrial cooperation with Russia.  However, he had to stress that the trade and economic relations  between the two countries were decreasing and coming to a  critical point. (INTERFFAX Note: Before 1992 the trade turnover  between Kyrgyzstan and Russia was 70 pct of the whole volume of  that for Kyrgyzstan. In the first quarter of 1994 it  significantly went down. Russia found itself in the third place  after Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.)    Akayev suggested that a joint Kyrgyz-Russian holding company  must be created with the authorized capital of 30 billion or 50  billion Russian rubles. The company would focus on restoration  of the bilateral trade and economic and industrial relations.    Akayev thought that the company must be accumulating money  resources and ensure participation of Russian citizens in  privatization in Kyrgyzstan. The company must also be carrying  out trust operations with the real estate of the population  leaving the Republic and contributing to development of the  small and average business by Russian-speaking citizens. The  company could also be organizing mass travel tours to Kyrgyzstan  by Russian tourists.    Akayev regretted that Russia had not as yet responded to his  proposals stated in 1993.    The Kyrgyz president also pointed out that since industrial  relations with Russia were being broken the number of Russians  migrating was increasing, especially of Russians working at  industrial enterprises.    Akayev said that the emigration of Russia-speaking  population  was a catastrophe not only for Kyrgyzstan but also for Russia  since it was difficult to receive hundreds of thousands of  Russians coming from Kyrgyzstan. (INTERFAX Note: In 1990 there  were about 918,000 Russians in Kyrgyzstan (21.2 pct of the  Kyrgyz population). On 1 April 1994, there were about 750,000  Russians living in Kyrgyzstan (17 pct). For the first time in  the Soviet and post-Soviet time in Kyrgyzstan the total number  of the Kyrgyz population has decreased due to the migration by  Russians. Currently, there are about 4.4299 million people  living in Kyrgyzstan (the number fixed on 1 January 1994). This  is 40,000 people fewer that it was on 1 January 1993.)    Akayev pointed out that the departure of Russian specialists  was doing a significant harm to the Kyrgyz economy.    Kyrgyz experts consider the deteriorating economic situation  in Kyrgyzstan as the main reason for migration. Russian experts  see social and political reasons as essential, Akayev said. For  instance, Russian experts believe that the transition to the  Kyrgyz language as the official one was forcing Russians out of  many spheres. There were certain cases of discrimination in the  sphere of entrepreneurship and of nationalism in everyday life  which were not neither encouraged nor condemned by the official  authorities. Akayev stressed he would listen to such conclusions  by Russian experts.    However, Akayev categorically disagreed that Russians in  Kyrgyzstan had no future. He said such suggestions had no  ground and must not be admitted.    Commenting on the problem with the migration, Akayev said  that its settlement would also depend on participation of Russia  since Kyrgyzstan could not resolve all the problems on its own.    Akayev regretted that the proposal to adopt a declaration on  the rights of ethnic minorities stated at the recent CIS summit  had been put aside.    Akayev was certain that all ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan  must have a quota in the parliament and in the local bodies. He  thought that the Russian language must be made the official one  in the regions mostly populated by Russians. Akayev spoke in  favor of dual citizenship for Russians.    The Kyrgyz president suggested that the issue on dual  citizenship could be solved following the example of the  European Union after the Maastricht treaty.    Akayev refuted the allegations that he could not make an  independent decision on this issue as a president. He just  stressed that in accordance with the Constitution the issues on  dual citizenship and state languages must be decided upon by the  parliament.    Akayev said he could not confront the parliament which  mostly  was not in favor of adopting such decisions. The president  believes that it is necessary to work with the public opinion  before these problems be settled.    During a meeting with the heads of the local administration  on Monday Akayev emphasized his intention to strengthen the  state power.    He made it clear that the point was not to alter the general  policy but to review the former concepts which had proved  themselves illusory and inadequate. The new realities make  change the guidelines.    Akayev stressed that he remain a faithful supporter of  democracy. However, he believes that life has shown democratic  means as inefficient and hindering implementation of the reforms.    There is no alternative to a strong state power in the  Republic since the people were not ready for democratic  self-rule, Akayev said.    The Kyrgyz president stated that he would remove everybody  who would hamper implementation of state decisions and the  program of the structural reorganization of the economy planned  for the next three years.    Akayev said many people wanted a tough authoritarian regime  to be established in the Republic similar to that in other CIS  states. However, in his opinion, this would bring no results.    Akayev suggested that the parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan  had made the Supreme Soviet get involved with political and  criminal investigations rather than perform its legislative  functions. The parliament had become a substitute for the state  committee on security, the Interior Ministry and the courts  which was frightening potential investors.    "Many people in Kyrgyzstan have regarded the parliament as  an  apotheoses of democracy. However, the activities of the present  parliament are braking the reforms and create such a reputation  to Kyrgyzstan, which makes it look as a scandalous country,"  Akayev said.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: A bright baton - BBC Symphony Friday's BBC Symphony concert was exciting to hear on Radio 3 - even more, no doubt, in the Festival Hall. That was not only because the peerless Hakan Hardenberger played Peter Maxwell Davies' recent trumpet concerto, but because the conductor Eduardo Mata had bright, unexpected ideas about his otherwise hyper-familiar programme. At the start, his crisp, punchy reading of Mozart's 'Haffner' Symphony gave notice that this was not to be a run-of-the-mill concert. Mata is Mexican, and like most musicians from the Hispanic world he prefers rhythms to be extremely taut: not rigid, for (as we were to hear in his Ravel) he likes bold rubato nuances too, but precise and snappy. It was delightful, for once in a way, to hear Mozart's Andante sped along with such unhesitating energy. The Davies concerto, a sort of mini-opera with the trumpet in the role of Saint Francis, was an experience in itself. Hardenberger's virtuosity is of the gleaming, well-honed kind, where the dedicatee of the work, John Wallace, cultivates a greater variety of quasi-vocal sounds and shadings; but as the piece proceeded toward its visionary close, Hardenberger's fantastic security (the part is taxing to the nth degree) established its own spell. Mata drew marvellous colours from the orchestra. The long passage in which a dark brass chorale evolves over a darker bass pedal, while marimbas and glockenspiel twinkle above like sunlight on Orcadian waves and the trumpet soars in high, slow phrases, was memorably beautiful. Easy to understand why only Hardenberger and Wallace, so far, have dared to perform this work; but it must surely have an assured future. The concert belonged to the BBC's 'French Connection' series, with the excuse of two Ravel pieces in the second half. But that proved to be more than just an excuse; Mata had points to make. La Valse followed directly upon the Valses nobles et sentimentales, with no applause permitted between. Where the Valses are generally treated as delicate parlour-inventions - the original piano-writing is notably spare - Mata aimed to show just how closely akin they are to the grander, wilder La Valse. The first of the VNS was a full-scale explosion, the seventh an expansively dramatic study in sweeping and swooning. In all the slighter waltzes, Mata reminded us forcefully that though the piano score may be spare, Ravel's orchestral version is sumptuously tricked out. Innumerable details that usually whisper past the ear became vivid and significant. The nightmare of La Valse came as a natural culmination (or inevitable disaster) - just as Mata intended, obviously. Fascinating. BBC Symphony Orchestra Royal Festival Hall, London</p>

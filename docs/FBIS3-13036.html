Because we have now learned our  lesson, we know their tricks, the way they operate. We receive  our military training in the United States, our radio sets are  tuned to those of the police, we now know how to hide, we have  learned the rules of underground operations. Just think that  almost every night one of our armed units manages to penetrate  into Hebron's old town without ever being detected by the army,  which nevertheless has orders not to let us through."    Kakh spokesperson Noam Federman' words (Kakh is the Israeli  extremist movement to which Baruch Goldstein -- the author of  the Hebron massacre -- belonged) sounded almost prophetic. They  were uttered in the course of an interview held with our  newspaper just over two months ago in Beit Hadassah, one of the  eight small Israeli settlements in the Arab heartland of Hebron.    "A war to the last drop of blood is being fought between us  and the Arabs. There is no other alternative: It is either us  or them. However, we are very much concerned that Rabin's  government is apparently prepared to sell out our country's  heartland in exchange for a mock peace. He is hoping that we  will abandon Hebron, and therefore he is not providing us with  adequate protection against Arab terrorism. This is why we  decided that it was high time that we acted for ourselves. We  will defend ourselves by all means available. We will attack  the Arabs and terrorize them. We will force them to leave."  Federman asserted this fearlessly, without trying to hide his  intentions behind words.    Reading again those notes is almost like reading the  announcement of a future massacre. Today Federman is in hiding.  In fact, since 28 February the police have been looking for  him, as well as three other activists, all of whom are accused  of belonging to a movement which, with the massacre nine days  ago, has now proved that it is ready to implement the racist  theory of "great Israel's ethnic purity" by means of armed  terrorism.    One of them, 33-year old Baruch Marzel, who, following the  assassination of the organization's founder, Rabbi Meir Kahane,  four years ago in New York, is now considered Kakh's senior  leader, has given rise to a spate of polemics after the national  TV network broadcast an interview in which he appeared disguised  in a motorcyclist's helmet and a large black coat.    Many are asking: "Why is it that reporters are allowed to  speak to people wanted by the police, but the police are unable  to arrest wanted people?" [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Okinawa Prefectural Assembly's Special  Committee on U.S. Military Bases (chaired by Seichu Kikuyama)  held a session on 5 April to discuss ways to deal with the crash  of an F-15 fighter. The special committee decided the Okinawa  Prefectural Assembly will hold an extraordinary session on 8  April to adopt a statement calling for a halt to landing and  takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the crash  is fully investigated, and to adopt a resolution protesting the  crash of the F-15 fighter. During a question-answer session,  Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office in the  Okinawa Prefectural Government, made clear that he will fly to  Tokyo on 6 April to ask the Foreign Ministry, the Defense  Facilities Administration Agency, the commander of U.S. Forces  in Japan, and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to prevent a recurrence  of the crash.    Draft statements and resolutions to be adopted by the  Okinawa  Prefectural Assembly strongly protest the crash of the F-15  fighter, claiming: "The crash site is near Kadena Air Base's  ammunition dump as well as tourist areas; it could have resulted  in a terrible disaster." They also demanded a thorough  investigation into the cause of the crash and a halt to landing  and takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the  crash is determined.    During the session, members of the special committee agreed  that "the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly, the Okinawa Prefectural  Government, and Okinawans should take concerted actions to  protest the accident." The special committee decided that the  Okinawa Prefectural Assembly should send a delegation led by  Speaker Mitsuo Gima to Tokyo on 13 April to protest the crash.    During the question-answer session, members from the ruling  and opposition parties asked the Okinawa Prefectural Government  to strongly demand an investigation into the cause of the crash,  while asking U.S. forces in Okinawa to explain a briefing given  by a pilot involved. In response, Matayoshi stated: "We have  yet to receive any report on the cause of the crash from U.S.  forces in Okinawa." He added: "During my stay in Tokyo I will  strongly ask for a report on the cause of the crash, including  reports on past crashes."    During the session, Matayoshi added that when he protested  to  U.S. forces in Okinawa over the crash, they replied: "The  investigation will take six months at the longest."    The crash inflicted damage to crops in tacitly approved  fields near the crash site. As for the question of U.S. Forces  compensating for the damage, Matayoshi said: "My understanding  is there are rules providing for such compensation, but I will  inquire with the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau  about it."</p>

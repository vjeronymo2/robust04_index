			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: </F> ``Growth, Value Increase, and the Challenge of the Environment'']    [Text] Growth is still necessary to meet new,  important social challenges. Growth might even be necessary to  meet environmental challenges. It is not true that the slower  the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase in  consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the  kind of growth that is important, Prime Minister Gro Harlem  Brundtland writes.    In the last few years there has been a renewed debate on the  relationship between the pattern of production and consumer  demand, on the one hand, and the consideration of future  generations, on the other, and on how we can achieve a fairer  distribution between rich and poor countries. It is an important  debate--and it has caught the attention of many. When working  with the World Commission report, ``Our common future,'' this  was an important question which has now become a focal point in  the international debate following, among other things, the Rio  conference.    Growing production and demand is not in itself a measure of  the increasing wealth of a society. Growth has been necessary to  develop our welfare society, and growth is still necessary to  meet new, important social challenges. Growth can even be  necessary to meet environmental challenges. It is not true that  the slower the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase  in consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the  kind of growth that is important. Much of the economic growth  during the last decades, as it is measured, is related to an  increased percentage of people being employed, especially among  women. An important precondition for this was the expansion of  public services, not least in the areas of health, education and  day care.    In the government's long term plan the prognosis for the  Norwegian economy for the next 40 years has been presented. The  economic growth as outlined in this plan is much lower than what  we have become used to during most of the time period since  World War II. However, many people still think it is  unreasonable that we want to increase our prosperity from the  already high level of today. In this case it is important to  realize that one-half to two-thirds of the estimated economic  growth up through the year 2000 is caused by an increased level  of knowledge and improved organization in production. With such  a development, in which there is a considerable increase in the  level of knowledge and in which we utilize the technological  capability that is being developed both nationally and  internationally, it will be increasingly possible to combine an  increase in the creation of wealth with an improved environment.  It has been estimated that many of the environmentally harmful  emissions will decrease in the coming 40-year period, in spite  of increased growth.    Norwegian industrial concerns are now producing more than  ever before, using less energy and raw materials per produced  unit, and the production pattern has changed. In a market that  just 20 to 30 years ago was dominated by industrial output like  iron, metals, fertilizer, and cellulose that was not highly  processed, we have today a broader and more modern industry  that, among other things, is able to build and equip large and  complicated oil installations in the Norwegian territorial  section.    Just before the war almost 65 percent of labor was spent on  the production of goods and materials. Today almost 70 percent  of employees work in the service industry. These changes involve  a change also in the use of energy, in the use of natural  resources, and in the stress caused by both production and  demand on the environment. Growth of services means less stress  on the environment than does growth in the demand of goods and  materials.    From 1980 to today private demand for services has grown by  40 percent, while demand for manufactured goods has increased by  only 7 percent. This shows how the pattern of demand has  changed. With the kind of policy we have prepared we will see a  continued shift in consumer demand. There will be more growth in  the service sector and less in the production of goods.  Increasingly more people will work in the fields of health and  welfare; in schools, education, and research; and in cultural  areas. Even though we, compared to most countries, invest a  considerable amount of resources in these areas, there is no  doubt in my mind but that we should increase our efforts even  more in coming years.    Such a development will also be seen in the way we measure  growth in our economy. Growth by itself is not a goal, but a  means to meeting important and urgent challenges in the future.  According to the estimate of the Long Term Plan both private and  public demand will increase in coming years. Growth of private  demand will be caused by more people being employed than today,  by employees being more productive and by retirees having larger  pensions. We might be able to increase the production of goods  without a corresponding increase in the number of jobs or in the  number of working hours. However, to improve the range of  services offered and to meet the increased need in this area, we  must plan on an increased need for more labor. An increasing  number of people will be working in the field of health, with  the elderly and in education. Some people are still maintaining  that we should reduce the number of hours worked and lower the  retirement age. Should we do this, it would result in lower  economic growth and fewer of the problems we see ahead would be  solved.    It is very important that we engage in becoming involved in  reducing the disparity between the economic and social  development in our part of the world and the poverty and the  need in developing countries. But--it is not the case that  reduced growth in Norway simply will result in an increased  capacity to alleviate need and poverty in developing countries.  On the other hand, it is important that we can turn growth in an  environmentally sound direction. Indeed, Norway does not have an  especially high private demand compared to other industrialized  countries, but we give the most aid per capita to developing  countries.    In dealing with the environment there are limits to how far  each individual country can go alone without running the risk of  jobs being eliminated or moved out of the country. Norway is a  pioneering country when it comes to, among other things, using  fees and taxes to steer production and demand in a productive  direction. To make further progress it is first and foremost  necessary to coordinate this effort with other countries. Making  it increasingly costly for business to pollute will reduce the  stress on the environment, while at the same time encourage  developing better and more environmentally friendly work-sharing  practices among countries and improve the pattern of production  within each individual country. However, we must realize that  the one-sided use of measures in Norway only will not have the  desired effect, either in the effort to improve the environment  or in the effort to even out the differences between rich and  poor countries. Are we to succeed, we will need obligatory  commitments to working together among the various countries.</p>

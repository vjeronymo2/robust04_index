			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev under "Position" </F> rubric: "Foreign Policy and the Russian Parliament"]    [Text] P.A. Stolypin is responsible for an idea which  reflects the essence of the problem of Russia's foreign policy  today surprisingly accurately: "If the state has healthy and  strong roots, then believe me, the words of the Russian  Government will sound completely different to Europe and the  whole world."    Our diplomacy needs a strong home front now as never before.  A major step has been taken toward this -- the adoption of the  Constitution. The election of the parliament may also create  preconditions for strengthening Russian statehood, and  consequently for putting foreign policy opportunities and the  work of the past two years into practice, and for completing the  arsenal of the Russian state's diplomacy.   <H5>    Continuation of Partnership or "Imperial" Impasse? </H5>   The main result of the implementation of the president's  foreign policy is the fact that at a turning point in its  history, in the face of the collapse of the communist system and  the disintegration of the USSR, Russia has not found itself in  the position of a social outcast on the international arena, as  was the case in 1917.    The fact that we managed to avoid the worst -- a repetition  of the Yugoslav tragedy on the territory of a nuclear superpower  -- happened because we did not take the "imperial" path, we did  not start trying to restore a union state by force or redraw the  borders. We also rejected appeals of the opposite sort -- to  distance ourselves from the problems of the former Union  altogether and withdraw into isolation. A difficult path, but  ultimately the only sensible one, was chosen -- to consistently  develop the post-Soviet area by developing the CIS. Today,  despite all the difficulties of the formation of the  Commonwealth, it is proving possible to move gradually toward  closer cooperation in politics and resolve old and new problems  in a civilized way within its framework.    Are there ways of more effectively protecting our interests  in nearby foreign parts? In any case, our diplomacy is  constantly seeking them out. But only within the framework of a  principled choice in favor of advancing national interests via  partnership rather than confrontation, and via direct observance  of international law. To betray this choice for the sake of  attempts to realize the myth of "reviving the empire" by force,  not to mention delirious ideas about a "dash toward the warm  seas," would mean once again setting yourself in confrontation  with the whole world, and returning to the "besieged fortress"  policy. This would mean transforming foreign policy from an  important source of help in implementing reforms into a  superfluous load aggravating the country's already serious  internal problems, and indeed capable of sinking the country  altogether.    Clearly, such adventurism would immediately and acutely  complicate the situation of Russians in the former Union  republics, and a new wave of refugees would inundate Russia.  Maybe that is what supporters of the "imperial" policy need in  order to obtain a pretext for "restoring order" in Russia itself?    Meanwhile, the interests of our compatriots in the former  republics can only be ensured if internationally recognized  standards in the sphere of human rights and the rights of ethnic  minorities are observed throughout the area of the former USSR.  With this aim in mind we have already concluded dozens of  bilateral and multilateral agreements with our CIS partners. It  was on our initiative that the Declaration on International  Commitments in the Sphere of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms was  adopted in the CIS, and the Commission for Human Rights set up.  We take a tough line on any violations of the lawful interests  of our fellow countrymen, and we invite international  organizations and partners in other foreign countries to  participate in the work of defending them.    However, it must be admitted that at the political level  our understanding of the acuteness of the problems of the  Russian-speaking population is being transformed too slowly and  with too much difficulty into the creation of effective  mechanisms for solving them.    Which direction we will move in -- toward fascism or,  conversely, toward stability and democracy in our society --  will depend largely on how responsible and farsighted our  parliamentarians are with regard to the problem of the  Russian-speaking population. We have to start with ourselves.  And obviously not with irresponsible statements insulting the  honor of entire nations and provoking discrimination against the  Russian-speaking minority, but with setting an example of a  consistent battle against chauvinism and ethnic hatred. For  example, the Federal Assembly could express itself in one form  or another in support of the Declaration on Aggressive  Nationalism, Racism, Chauvinism, Xenophobia, and  Anti-Semitism, adopted on Russia's initiative by the  foreign ministers of CSCE member states in December of last  year. This would be a good signal both internally and  externally.    For the first time in Russia's history it has neither  immediate nor even potential military adversaries. This creates  the preconditions for a significant reduction in the burden of  defense expenditure, which is particularly important at the  initial, most complex phase of economic reforms.    However, threats of a new type have appeared which demand  the  strengthening of democratic statehood, the creation of economic,  effective, and mobile armed forces. I refer to local conflicts,  particularly in the CIS, the danger of the proliferation of  nuclear weapons, and international terrorism.    We are already resolving many tasks concerning the  prevention  and settlement of armed conflicts near our borders with the help  of the United Nations and the CSCE. We are seeking the  expansion of aid to the Russian peacekeeping effort on the part  of the world community on the basis of the reality of Russia's  special interests and responsibility. Neither we nor our  partners in the CIS can accept the "residual principle" which  the United Nations still espouses in allocating the  organization's resources for peacekeeping aims in the  Commonwealth.    But these efforts of ours can be effective only if they  given  society's firm support. Extremist appeals to either abandon  everything and pull out of the conflict zones in the CIS, or  else "establish order" by force do damage to both Russia's  actual peacekeeping mission and also to the world community's  perception of our aims in the nearby foreign countries.    Russia is reaching the level of mature partnership with the  leading democratic states of the world. This is directly  enshrined in very important documents concluded with the FRG,  France, Britain, the United States, Sweden, Denmark, and a  number of other states.    Thanks to partnership relations with the West, we have  entered key world economic organizations. Although the rate of  cooperation falls short of what we would desire, we have  nevertheless recently received soft loans to the tune of $2.5  billion from the IMF alone, and preferential credits to the tune  of $0.6 billion from the World Bank. It is time to proceed  further without artificial delays.    Russian foreign policy has saved the country from falling  into the abyss of international financial bankruptcy, on the  brink of which the former Soviet Union stood. We have received  a 10-year deferment from the Paris Club on payments due for  1992-1993 on the former USSR's foreign debt totaling $15  billion. The London Club has granted us a five-year deferment  on the sum of $3 billion.    It is specifically the new nature of relations with the West  that permits us to defend Russia's lawful interests in the  sphere of security, the economy, trade, and so on, increasingly  actively. Amid political tension, this would be even more  difficult.    We are striving for Russia's political interests to be taken  into account as well. A typical example is the recent adoption  by NATO countries of the "Partnership for Peace" concept instead  of the immediate extension of NATO membership to the borders of  the CIS. Cooperation between Russia and the United States  helped to achieve the trilateral agreement on the full  elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.    The mechanism of new ties with the West is still far from  being perfect. So far no "consultation reflex" has yet been  developed, which would ensure timely consideration of mutual  interests in an uninterrupted fashion. In a number of  situations -- Tajikistan, Georgia, and Yugoslavia -- we have had  to exert a lot of effort to ensure Russia's position and the  understanding and assistance of the United Nations and the CSCE.  We are proposing to the "Big Seven" and other leading powers  that a strategy of mature partnership of a long-term nature be  coordinated.    It is equally ridiculous to set the rapprochement with the  West against the development of Russia's relations with Eastern  states, and with the development of its relations with CIS  countries. On the contrary, a serious positive potential in  mutual relations with the great Asian powers -- China, India,  and Japan -- is being created. Diplomacy has "discovered" new  partners for Russian business, including in the sphere of  military-technical cooperation -- South Korea, ASEAN, and the  states of the Persian Gulf.    Obviously Russia's attractiveness both for the West and for  the East depends in many respects on the stability and  predictability of our internal situation. No one will invest in  a country where there is great uncertainty. The sooner we adopt  laws which meet the needs of the market economy, the faster will  be the rate and volume of the trade and economic cooperation  with foreign countries that is so vital to us today.   <H5>    Diplomacy Needs Support From the Legislators </H5>   In foreign policy matters, the stance that the Federal  Assembly occupies will to a great extent determine the face that  Russia shows to the world -- the face of the unpredictable "sick  man" of Europe and Asia, or that of a great Eurasian power and a  responsible and reliable partner.    The Foreign Ministry sees the Federal Assembly as a state  institution capable of ensuring, within the limits of its  competence, a reliable legal base for our foreign policy, and  assisting the government in implementing laws affecting Russia's  interests and in complying with international treaties. We are  also hoping for constructive dialogue on the best paths our  activities should take.    The Supreme Soviet also had the chance to become a serious  state institution, but, unfortunately, it was not taken up. The  Foreign Ministry unfailingly strove for cooperation. During the  initial phase of the Supreme Soviet's work, this was to some  paid off. However, as its confrontation with the executive grew,  the discussion of foreign policy questions increasingly turned  into a settling of ideological scores. Unfortunately, even  today, side by side with the pseudopatriotic extremism, it not  been possible to eliminate the lingering bombast, personal  arrogance, and unprincipled compromises which are being passed  off as centrism. Both as a State Duma deputy and as a minister  I will not make concessions to those who want to push Russian  diplomacy onto the track of imperial "anti-Western" or  aggressively nationalist policy which would inevitably lead the  country to a catastrophe. At the same time, I am prepared to  cooperate with any critics or political trends in the interests  of patriotic, open, and professional foreign policy.    What could constitute a responsible foreign policy agenda  for  the new parliament?    First of all, the ratification of around 60 treaties that  the  Supreme Soviet did not examine. These include major ones such  as the START II Treaty, and agreements on legal aid and military  and economic cooperation with CIS countries.    Second, the adoption of laws providing for the efficient  work  of Russia's foreign policy mechanism. This means a law on the  Russian Federation's international treaties, a law on the  diplomatic service, and the Consular Regulations. We are also  counting on constructive consultations during the preparation of  the president's decisions on appointing Russian ambassadors and  representatives at international organizations (in accordance  with Article 83 of the Russian Federation Constitution).    Third, the adoption of laws providing backup for Russia's  foreign economic ties, such as a law on the continental shelf  and the economic zone, and a law on the export of weapons and  military hardware.    Fourth, the elaboration of new laws or the amendment of  existing ones in the humanitarian sphere. The section on dual  citizenship in the Law on Citizenship must be brought into line  with the new Constitution.    The creation of a statewide program of support for the  Russian-speaking population in CIS countries is particularly  urgent. Our compatriots' rights will only be reliably ensured  when their economic future is guaranteed and the conditions for  maintaining their native language and culture are created.    The scale of this problem means that the efforts of the  Foreign Ministry or the immigration service alone are  insufficient. A special department is needed which would  shoulder the entire set of questions concerning the protection  of the rights and interests of our compatriots in nearby and  more distant foreign countries.    Fifth, the creation of legislation ensuring Russia's  participation in peacekeeping activity, including at UN, CSCE,  and CIS level. It is time to define the legal basis for the  presence of Russia's troops abroad, on a treaty basis, of  course, and in line with the principle of [military] bases.    Sixth, the parliament could, in accordance with the  Constitution, support the desire of the Russian regions to make  use of the advantages of cooperation with other states.  Institutions for regional cooperation in the Black Sea, Baltic,  and Barents-Euro-Arctic regions have been created with Russia's  active participation. It is high time for there to be analogous  structures in the Far East for ties with the PRC and Japan.    At the same time, legal frameworks for regional foreign  activity are needed, as well as a clear-cut division of  prerogatives and functions with federal organs in the interests  of the state's unity. After all, the more powerful Russia is as  an international partner, the more profitable it will be for its  regions to conduct business abroad too.    Seventh, parliamentary ties. Regular day-to-day, rather than  ostentatious, work with the parliamentarians, particularly with  our neighbors, can supplement the foreign policy work of the  president and the government, first and foremost in protecting  the rights of millions of our compatriots in former Soviet  republics. The status of foreigners in Russia should also be  brought into line with international standards, by adopting a  relevant law for this purpose.    Today we are investing the prestige of the president's  foreign policy in the present and future of Russia as a great  power. The entire gamut of the new opportunities for  cooperation which have been accumulated at political level must  be placed at the service of resolving our internal problems,  primarily economic ones. This is a statewide task. National  interests, rather than narrow party interests, should serve as  the guideline here. In resolving this task, parliamentarians  will have a reliable ally in diplomacy.</p>

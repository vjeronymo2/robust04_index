			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Tomas Borge Martinez, president of the </F> Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, Special Congress, at  the congress in the Olof Palme Convention Center in Managua --  live]    [Text] Someone has already noted that this is a very  important section in our program. It is entitled "FSLN Position  With Regard to Relations With the U.S. Government." It does not  say with the U.S. people but, rather, with the U.S. Government.  The language used in the Program Commission's proposal is very  selective. However, I believe that, in general terms, it  essentially explains the positions we must assume in this new  international situation and in this new era that people are now  experiencing.    Nicaraguans, not to mention Latin Americans, must be clear  about the reasons for assuming an anti-imperialist position. It  was not a coincidence that when the FSLN was founded, Carlos  Fonseca proposed that it only be called the Sandinist National  Liberation Front in the face of other proposals to call it the  National Liberation Front and other names.    When our founder and leader was asked why he wanted it to be  called the Sandinist National Liberation Front, he explained  that it was not only named after Sandino, who was a hero to the  world, Latin America, and Nicaragua, but that it was also named  after the anti-imperialist content of Sandino's struggle. In  this way, we were recording, and recording forever, the  anti-imperialist content of the Nicaraguan people's struggle.    Years passed, and time and time again we relived a history  of  aggression from U.S. administrations. Nicaraguan history is  basically a history of U.S. intervention. It is a history that  produced Zeledon and Sandino and, to a great extent, produced  the FSLN. The United States imposed Anastasio Somoza and his  criminal dictatorship which lasted several decades, and, in  turn, the Nicaraguans' revolutionary and popular struggle  resulted from this imposition.    We must ask ourselves: What kind of relations do we want  with the United States? Do we want a relationship of enmity and  confrontation? On the contrary, we want a friendly and  harmonious relationship with the United States.    Nevertheless, this friendly and harmonious relationship does  not depend on us. It is important to remember that we are not  ones who caused harm. Instead, we were the victims. It is  important to remember that we never attacked the United States;  it attacked us. It is not true that we can forget our history.  He who forgets his history forgets himself. The essence of a  people lies in their history. If we want to substantially  improve our relations with the United States, we cannot forget  the history of U.S. aggression against Nicaragua. [applause]</p>

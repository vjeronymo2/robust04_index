			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Italy's unions may drop strike Italian trades unions said they might abandon a planned general strike after the defeat of a government plan to trim pension costs. Opposition forces on Thursday joined forces with the Northern League - a member of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's coalition - to defeat the government's pensions measure in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house). The defeated measure would have cut the cumulative entitlement to pensions to 1.75 per cent for each year of a worker's salary from 2 per cent starting in 1996. Next year's austerity budget, designed to reduce the budget deficit by L48,000bn (Pounds 19bn), has brought relations between unions and government to their lowest point for a decade. Unions called a general strike for December 2 to protest against the government's plans to trim the budget by reducing pensions spending. But on Friday, Sergio D'Antoni, head of the CISL union grouping, hinted the unions could call off the strike if the government accepted their proposals to modify stringent pension reform proposals.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Blair hints at detention changes Mr Tony Blair, the favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour leader, yesterday used a statement to the party's Irish Society to explain how he thought Labour should overhaul the prevention of terrorism and emergency provisions Acts. Mr Blair listed three provisions the party was particularly concerned about: The power to exclude individuals from Great Britain. The 'possibility' of internment. The power to extend detention without judicial review. In October, the government used Prevention of Terrorism Act powers to ban Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, from entering Britain. Mr Blair said there should be no transfer of sovereignty without the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland, but argued that London and Dublin must 'share the responsibility to develop an institutional framework for a political settlement'. Labour's 1992 general election manifesto committed the party to replacing the 'counter-productive' Prevention of Terrorism Act with a 'more effective' measure.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Soft heart of our problem: The chancellor's dilemma - an inside view Social security is at the heart of our budget difficulties. That is not merely be-cause it is the largest single public spending programme, nor even because it is growing so fast. It is because it is demand-driven. There is a commitment to pay benefits to all who meet the qualifying conditions. The public spending plans are based on official estimates of the number of claimants. If the number proves greater than estimated, we have (in Treasury jargon) an irresistible bid, and spending threatens to rise above target. However, total public spending is subject to cash limits. So in theory, when social security spending rises, other elements in the budget must be cut back. This actually happened last autumn when, in order to stick to its spending plans in the face of a near Pounds 3bn increase in the social security budget, the government had to cut other programmes. That was why last year's spending settlement was genuinely tough even though total spending was not reined back. The inexorable growth of social security is a prime reason why the government has continually to choose between making swingeing cuts in important programmes and failing to control spending. Loss of control tends to happen before elections, with cuts coming afterwards. But for much of the time, whatever they choose to do, governments are accused by the right of loss of control and by the left of excessive cuts. During the recession just ended, which coincided unusually with an election, irresistible social security bids helped to drive public spending above target and upwards as a share of GDP. There is nothing unusual about public spending taking an increasing share of GDP during recessions. That has always been a consequence of rising unemployment (hence rising social security payments) and falling output. Over the cycle, the public spending share should rise in the recession and fall in the boom. The problem is that, in our political economy, spending never falls by enough in the boom. So when the irresistible bids push it up in the next recession, the share of GDP taken by total public spending reaches a higher level than at the same point in the previous cycle. The deterioration of the public finances is most evident in recessions, but much of the damage is done in booms. That certainly happened in the boom of the late 1980s, when unemployment and the associated social security payments fell. There are always strong claims on the public purse, and they ensured that total spending continued to rise, in nominal terms, as fast as before. This fact was, however, obscured by the sharp real squeeze on public spending in 1988, when inflation came in 3 per cent higher than expected. So what we have is a classic ratchet effect. When public spending on social security falls, as it does in boom times, other spending rushes in to take its place. But when spending on social security rises, as it does in recessions, the effect of this 'irresistible' new spending is to swell the total. The combination of a target for total public spending and special status for the 'irresistible' social security bids is lethal. That is why the 1992 Autumn Statement separated out so-called 'cyclical social security'. In future booms, the fall in unemployment pay and related benefits will be scored 'below the line' and will not create space for an expansion of other public spending programmes. Unfortunately, there is another and potentially more dangerous ratchet effect at work in the social security arena. At times when unemployment has risen most rapidly there has also been a sharp increase in the take-up of other benefits such as invalidity benefit. A new group of clients becomes aware of the wide range of benefits available to them. When unemployment falls in the subsequent recovery, there is no comparable fall in the numbers receiving other benefits. So the take-up of a wide range of benefits increases steadily over time. If we compare the numbers expected to receive benefits this year with the numbers in 1978-79, just before Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher took office, the increases are startling. The numbers claiming invalidity benefit have gone up by nearly 1m, nearly tripling the case load. The numbers claiming mobility allowance have also risen by nearly 1m, increasing the case load by a factor of 10. The numbers claiming attendance allowance and one-parent benefit have also tripled and are approaching 1m in each case. It would be wrong to conclude from these figures that the 1980s saw a threefold increase in the numbers of invalids, single parents and those 'requiring frequent attention . . . in connection with their bodily functions' (the qualifying condition for attendance allowance), or a 10-fold increase in the numbers unable to walk. Obviously what is going on is that an increasing proportion of those eligible for these benefits have been taking them up and/or the criteria for eligibility are being less strictly applied. Which brings us to a key feature of the social security budget: not all those entitled to benefits take them up, but take-up rates are steadily increasing over time. For some benefits, take-up rates are as low as 65 per cent. These simple facts have profound implications. In a sense the government is committed to a level of support for benefit recipients that it could not possibly afford if all who were entitled to benefits claimed them. As time goes by and take-up rates rise, that becomes increasingly apparent. The increase in take-up rates is now the main factor driving up social security spending. Take-up rates increase especially rapidly in recessions as new clients learn their way round the benefit system. Once on they stay on. Recessions thus accelerate the upward trend in take-up, but booms do not reverse it. The government will never get the public finances properly under control until they find a way of curbing the irresistible upward march of social security spending. That is why the long-term public spending exercise put in place by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is vitally important. Radical solutions are needed. I shall look at some of the options next week.

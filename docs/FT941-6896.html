			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Hosokawa tries to manage coalition as left and right split: William Dawkins on a coming Tokyo cabinet reshuffle Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, will this week consult his coalition partners over plans for the first reshuffle of his six-month-old cabinet, expected shortly. Mr Hosokawa wants to bring coherence to the fragmented alliance to improve its chances in a general election due in the next year or so. But he is being pulled in opposite directions by growing rivalry between the seven-party coalition's left and right wings. One victim of the reshuffle is likely to be Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, formerly one of Mr Hosokawa's closest colleagues and now a critic. Mr Takemura, the government's chief spokesman and Mr Hosokawa's chief of staff, has been unhappy with his boss's handling of a controversial plan for increasing indirect taxes. He also disagrees with the prime minister's strategy of forming a single grand alliance to fight the opposition Liberal Democratic party, dismissed last week by Mr Takemura as 'imperialistic' and 'expansionist'. The reshuffle will also show how Mr Hosokawa plans to respond to the split between the coalition's numerically strong left wing, of which Mr Takemura is a leading figure, and the influential right wing, represented by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist. Mr Takemura and his supporters in the Social Democratic party, the biggest member of the coalition, oppose a reshuffle. In the opposite camp in the coalition, Mr Ozawa's Japan Renewal party and its ally, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government party, favour an early cabinet reorganisation, to strengthen the alliance on their terms. Mr Ozawa and his allies are aware that the coalition is unlikely to beat the LDP in the next election, under a new electoral system, unless it fields single joint candidates. Mr Ozawa precipitated the LDP's election defeat last year by leading a defection from it and is dedicated to completing his old party's downfall. Underlying their tactical rivalry, the coalition's two camps have different ideologies, in contrast to the days of LDP rule when influence, rather than policies, dictated the balance of power. Mr Ozawa's conservatives favour an internationally active Japan; the left wing believes in a discreetly low profile in international affairs. They also differ on economic, fiscal and industrial policy. However, Mr Hosokawa cannot afford to alienate the Socialists, who hold six of the 21 cabinet seats. The left wing's power will be further increased by a recent accord between a rising young Socialist politician and a powerful trade union leader to form a new party. The governor of the northern region of Hokkaido, Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, and Mr Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo, the trade union confederation - with 8m members - are planning to merge the Socialists, an offshoot of the Socialists and Mr Takemura's NHP, to form a New Liberal party. So far, Mr Hosokawa has been able to avoid committing himself to either side of the power struggle, partly because his JNP is small enough to place it on the edge of the battle. It is only the fourth largest in the coalition and he is its only cabinet member. On top of this, coalition members have, until the past few weeks, been too consumed by the struggle for parliamentary agreement on political reform to indulge in an internal power struggle. But with reform and other urgent business such as the 1994 budget out of the way, coalition leaders now have the time to get on with reshaping Japan's political battle-lines. Mr Hosokawa, did, however, lean towards the coalition's right last week, when he came out in favour of Mr Ozawa's idea for a two-party scheme of a grand alliance against the LDP, modelled on the US system, a change from the prime minister's earlier preference for the multi-party Japan favoured by the coalition's left wing. He also acted in line with Mr Ozawa's views in proposing a rise in indirect taxation early this month, though the Socialists quickly forced him to retract this. Some observers believe Mr Hosokawa's best strategy would be to stay in the middle and produce a cabinet reshuffle designed to appease both sides. That would enable him to cultivate an image as honest broker between the coalition's scheming rivals.</p>

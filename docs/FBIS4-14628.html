			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- Belarus will act as a  mediator in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict at a meeting  of Azeri and Armenian parliamentarians scheduled in Bishkek in  May. The meeting will be attended by chairman of the Belarusian  Parliament, Mechyslaw Hryb. This was declared at a meeting of  the Belarusian parliament chairman with a peace-keeping group of  the CIS intreparliamentary assembly which arrived in Minsk from  Yerevan on Sunday morning, following trips to Baku and  Nagorno-Karabakh.    "The arrival of the peace-keeping group in Minsk and a  meeting with the head of the Belarusian parliament was not  spontaneous," Medetkan Sherimkulov, head of the CIS  intreparlaimentary delegation and chairman of the Kyrgyz  Parliament, told ITAR-TASS on Sunday night after the delegation  returned from Minsk to Moscow. "Belarus is one of active  participants of the CIS interparliamentary assembly." He said,  according to Sherimkulov, in order to establish peace in the  Karabakh region, all CIS countries should be interested in the  mediatory mission.    In Sherimkulov's opinion, Belarus has concrete proposals  which will be discussed in Bishkek early in May. Commenting on  the results of the visit by the CIS interparliamentary  peace-keeping delegation to the Caucasus, Sherimkulov said that  heads of the Azeri and Armenian Parliaments agreed to take part  in the Bishkek meeting. Sherimkulov did not rule out the  possibility of Karabakh officials taking part in the meeting.    Shermkulov said that the main condition for the settlement  of  the Karabakh crisis is "a total ceasefire in the zone of the  conflict." Sherimklov said that CIS parliamentarians are  interested in the solution of the problem of the political  status of Nagorno-Karabakh, removal of blockade, restoration of  Karabakh infrastructure, including a gas pipe-line, railways and  highways and the return of refugees to their homes.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about prospects for the participation of  CIS peace-keeping forces in the disengagement of warring sides,  Sherimkulov pointed out that "we cannot put the responsibility  for peace-keeping efforts on Russia alone." "The number of  peace-keepers and a degree of participation of CIS peace-keeping  units has not been discussed yet," Sherimkulov said. "What is  important at the present stage is that all CIS member-states  express readiness to promote the establishment of peace in  Nagorno-Karabakh," he added.</p>

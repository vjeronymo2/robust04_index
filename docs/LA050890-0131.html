			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE TO BE SOUGHT IN CRASH;  </P> <P> COURTS: FORMER RAM LINEMAN DOUG FRANCE IS ACCUSED OF BEING DRUNK BEFORE FATAL  ACCIDENT.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said Monday it will seek a vehicular manslaughter  charge against Doug France, a former Ram offensive lineman who was involved in  a two-car accident Saturday that left a Laguna Hills woman dead.  </P> <P> Investigators suspect that France was drunk when his 1987 BMW rammed head-on  into a car driven by Maria Conception Contreras, 53, in south Orange County,  CHP Officer Patrick Barnard said.  </P> <P> Contreras was pronounced dead at the scene.  </P> <P> The victim was France's neighbor in a townhouse complex.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 4:35 p.m., shortly after France, 37, left his  Laguna Hills home and drove north along Aliso Hills Drive.  </P> <P> Traveling at speeds estimated by police at 80 m.p.h., France apparently lost  control of his car on a curve near La Cienega Street and collided with  Contreras' Mazda, Barnard said.  </P> <P> CHP officers arrested France at the scene, but released him to Mission Hospital  Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Police said results of a  blood-alcohol test will be available in about two weeks.  </P> <P> A hospital spokeswoman said France was in serious condition with a concussion  and broken pelvis.  </P> <P> France, a former star at Ohio State, played for the Rams from 1975-81. He was  selected as an all-pro in 1978 and 1980. DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

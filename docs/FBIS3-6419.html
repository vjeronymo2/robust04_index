In the course of the session the Mongolian parliament  members are to discuss a package of draft laws concerning urgent  issues of the country's socioeconomic life.    At the opening of the session the chairman of the State  Great  Hural N. Bagabandi made a speech. The parliament leader pointed  out, in particular, the importance of the draft laws to be  discussed and adopted at the present session of the State Great  Hural for deepening of processes of reforms, development of  market relations, formation and consolidation of judicial power  and realization of the tasks of renewal of the Mongolian society.    Further strengthening of political stability in the country  is a vital issue affecting the present and future interests of  Mongolia.    In this cause great is the role of all political forces,  including the political parties, members of which are working in  the parliament, noted N. Bagabandi.    Bilateral and multilateral relations and cooperation with  the  two neighbours Russia and China, donor countries and all states  are effectively developing and strengthening at different levels.    An example to this was the recent official visit of the  president of Mongolia to four countries of Asia. The  negotiations and talks held at the high level and the joint  documents signed during this visits are of great importance not  only for development and deepening of relations and cooperation  of our country with these four countries of Asia on the basis of  new principles and new ideas under present international  conditions, but also for strengthening of peace and stability in  the Asian and the Pacific region, noted the Mongolian parliament  leader.    Then president of Mongolia, P. Ochirbat, made a speech at  the  session. In his speech the president criticized the parliament,  mentioned about its bad tradition, when the issues, on  discussion of which great efforts were exerted and attention was  paid, have been ending without any result. As the president  said, only a part of questions raised by him at the opening of  the parliament autumn session has been considered and solved by  the law-makers, and the fate of the rest of the issues still  remains obscure.    The president gave a short information about his official  visits to four Asian countries, valuing their outcome as  important and successful.    Then the president spoke about process of legal reform in  the  country, criticized the law-making activity, which in his view,  is still being carried out without any definite conception and  without any strategic line. In connection with this he made 4  proposals to speed up measures on carrying out legislation in  accordance with the Constitution, create a system of legal  information, raise to a qualitatively new level the law-making  activity and double the parliament control over realization of  laws, provide for a higher level training of specialists.    As, addressing the law-makers, the president of Mongolia  noted, withdrawal of their party representatives in the State  Great Hural by the Mongolian National Democratic and the  Mongolian Social Democratic Parties does not meet the national  interests of Mongolia.    On the basis of his consultations on this issue with leaders  of political parties, chairman of the parliament, prime  minister, the State Great Hural members from the opposition, and  also on the basis of agreements between leaders of parties, P.  Ochirbat made a number of proposals, in particular, on making  amendments and additions in the law on elections, on  introduction of clarity into the status of the parliament  majority and minority, their powers and rights in the law on  State Great Hural. Besides that, the president suggested to  elaborate principles of covering of activity of the parliament,  including rights of the minority, by the state mass media, make  amendments and additions in the law on elections in the current  year.    Then Prime Minister P. Jasray, the representative of the  parliament opposition T. Elbegdorj made speeches. After that  the law-makers set to consideration of the draft law on  statistics. But six representatives of the parliament  opposition walked out at this moment, protesting against the  decision of the State Great Hural chairman to postpone  consideration of the president's proposal on making amendments  and additions in the law on parliament.</p>

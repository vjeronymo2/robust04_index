			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Benefits Guaranteed to </F> Servicemen by Law are Not a Subject for Speculation"]    [Text] "The Russian Government has no intention of  abolishing servicemen's benefits," Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin felt compelled to state recently. As far as I  recall this is not the first time in the past 18 months that  someone at the very highest level has assured the Army:  Attempts to economize at the expense of servicemen's social  protection will be prevented.    On this occasion it was the Finance Ministry which had  proposed scrapping free medical services for reservists and  retired servicemen, the compulsory insurance of officers'  property, interest-free loans for military college graduates to  help them settle in and for officers to build houses and  cottages, and the one-off grant equivalent to 20 times the  [monthly] salary for those discharged into the reserve (a figure  of five times the salary was proposed instead). Prior to this,  in the days of Boris Fedorov, the finance department was  hatching a plan to tax servicemen. A month or two earlier, the  Finance Ministry, in league with the Ministry of Transport and  the Ministry of Communications, tried to amend the list of  benefits contained in the Russian Federation Law "On the status  of servicemen." In other words, instead of making the benefit  mechanism really effective (and at the moment it is just  muddling along) the men from the ministries decided to abolish  it entirely.    No matter what you say, some civilian departments still  suffer from an irresistible urge to "raid" the military for  funds. That urge is so irresistible that you get the definite  impression that the Finance Ministry's specialists are pinning  all their hopes of curbing inflation on the Armed Forces alone.  Clearly the minds of the financiers refuse to work in any other  direction. Meanwhile the talk about the taxation of  superprofits remains to this day mere talk. Of course, the  functionaries have no intention of economizing at their own  expense: The state apparatus is burgeoning, as the president  has already said a number of times.    Meanwhile, as usual, the press and television are already  hinting to the slow-witted where they might find the source of  all our woes: It is planned to spend ten times more on defense  than on medicine and education, they say.... In journalists'  commentaries virtually all the items of budget spending were  slightly overshadowed by the sum of spending on defense.  However, if you read the budget carefully it is not difficult  to see that in comparison with 1993 it has not increased at all.  But the tasks with which life is constantly confronting the  Russian Army cost the Defense Ministry a pretty penny. Perhaps  the subject of the debate itself -- benefits -- will become  immeasurably small because there will be nothing with which to  finance the Armed Forces' combat readiness.    No one is disputing that costs in the Army can and must be  cut. For example, they can be cut by introducing new, more  efficient but less energy-intensive systems of armaments and  hardware. Doubtless the scientists could make a contribution  here without this having an adverse effect on the Army's combat  readiness. By not stinting on the automation and  computerization of the Armed Forces today we would surely  achieve a substantial saving tomorrow. The investment of the  necessary resources in scientific and technical research for the  needs of defense would, in the very near future, undoubtedly  result in the reduction of the numerical strength of the Army  and positive structural changes. Paradoxical as it may seem,  economizing is a costly exercise. And that is particularly true  when applied to the defense of the state.    For some reason it is constantly suggested that we should  cut costs in the Army at the expense of the serviceman's family  budget. Let us leave aside the immorality of the very approach  of giving benefits with one hand, taking them away with the  other. Such "reformist" methods will hardly enhance within the  Army the prestige of contract relations with the state. It is a  good thing, of course, that this is understood by the top  officials in the government but it is strange that it is not  understood by statesmen of ministerial rank.    Yes, military men do not sow or reap and it is not  immediately obvious where the revenue section in the defense  budget actually is. Nevertheless, there is a revenue section if  you recall the Russian soldiers' peacemaking missions in  Tajikistan, Georgia, the North Caucasus, the Dniester region,  and finally in the former Yugoslavia. Such is the reality: In  our troubled world the state's ability to protect itself and its  interests still counts for a lot. The Army is ensuring peace in  Russia today without firing a shot or engaging in a cheap  display of muscle flexing and is doing all it can to establish  peace outside its borders. Surely even the most convinced  pro-marketeer must recognize that stability in the country,  without which the normal course of the reforms is inconceivable,  has been ensured to no small extent by the very existence of  combat-capable Armed Forces which enjoy prestige in the world.  Admittedly one feels embarrassed about having to state such  banal truths.    I do not believe that the financiers were pursuing any  political interests when they put their anti-army initiative to  the government. But even on their own the rumors unquestionably  produce a political effect. It is no coincidence that Viktor  Chernomyrdin let slip a phrase about forces trying to bring the  Army into conflict with the president and the government.    The very fact that such proposals have appeared from the  Finance Ministry is alarming. They did not succeed today but  what about tomorrow? Surely people are right when they talk  about the need for the adoption of a law on criminal liability  for non-implementation of the articles of the defense budget and  for any delays in financial operations affecting the combat  readiness of the troops. The Army's life and well-being must be  defined by the Law and by the Law alone, least of all by the  will of individual officials even those of the very highest  rank. As for the "package of military laws," I should like to  hope that if ministers or parliamentarians recall them again it  will only be to improve them and make them more efficient and  effective and able to operate in full and without exception. In  that respect there is much work to be done.    At the moment, however, when the military man joins his  detail, takes up combat positions, or goes on alert duty at sea  he must be confident that when he returns he will not be worse  off than when he started. Just as the young man contemplating  the future from the threshold of military college today must  know exactly how and in what form the state will evaluate his  decades of impeccable service.    When speaking about the situation to which the Finance  Ministry has brought us today, people in the Army say: "They're  just sending smoke up the chimney, they're making themselves  busy by pulling apart dumplings!" There is nothing wrong with  the soldiers' sense of humor; the important thing is that there  should be nothing wrong with the sense of responsibility of the  departmental arbiters of people's fate.</p>

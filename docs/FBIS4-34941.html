			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican  Foreign Relations Secretariat announced that the government has  presented the candidacy of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  to assume the post of director general of the World Trade  Organization [WTO].    The Foreign Secretariat announced in a communique that the  candidacy of Salinas, whose presidential mandate ends in  December, is being presented because the chiefs of state who  participated in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit supported the  Mexican president's aspiration to that post. The summit among  the chiefs of state of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal took  place last week in the Colombian port city of Cartagena de  Indias.    Spain and Portugal withheld their support because of  commitments in other international forums, but the rest of the  heads of state who are members of the Ibero-American forum  agreed that Salinas would properly represent the interests of  the Latin American nations.    The WTO will replace GATT as of 1 January 1995 as part of  the  agreements reached at the 15 April meeting in Marrakesh.    Jacques Delors, president of the European Union; Brazilian  Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero; and former Italian Commerce  Minister Renato Ruggiero have also been named as possible  candidates for the post of WTO director general.</p>

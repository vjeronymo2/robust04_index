Dubey, T.V. Lyapina, D.M. Fedoryak, </F> Bioorganic Chemistry and Petrochemistry Institute at the  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 577.113.6:542.95]    [Abstract] The urgency of selecting an effective polymer  carrier for solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis and the high  cost of Porasil, Fractosil, etc., HPLC silica gels prompted  attempts to synthesize a highly effective carrier for solid  phase oligonucleotide synthesis on the basis of the easily  accessible domestic microspherical aerosilica gel--Silochrome-2  with a synthetic spacer group. The particle size, specific  surface, and mean pore diameter of silicate carriers for solid  phase oligonucleotide synthesis are summarized, and the factors  which determine their effectiveness are outlined. The carrier  has sufficient mechanical strength and can be successfully used  in automatic synthesizers. The specific requirements imposed on  the spacers are discussed, and it is noted that spacer groups  containing longer aliphatic fragments bend more easily and  ``stick'' to the polymer's hydrophobic surface, thus shortening  the distance between the oligonucleotide and the carrier and  decreasing its effectiveness. Consequently, a spacer group with  a shorter fragment--ehtylenediamine--and a carrier synthesis  method are developed, and the aerosilica gel amination procedure  is outlined. The resulting carriers have a close-to-optimum  25-35 mole/g capacity resulting in a condensation reaction  yield of 97.5-99%. The performance of the proposed carrier  fully corresponds to best known carriers on the basis of the CPG  porous glass, yet the new material is much cheaper and more  easily available. The proposed spacer design also ensures high  yields and purity. The authors are grateful to G. Panasenko for  proving a Silochrome-2 sample.

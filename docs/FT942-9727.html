			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Turkey under fire as UN confirms refugee claims The Turkish government was yesterday criticised by Kurdish MPs, after the United Nations confirmed reports that several thousand Kurdish villagers had crossed the border into Iraq, in the wake of a heavy government onslaught against the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK). Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier that a bomb had been dropped by accident. The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year. The UN, contacted in Baghdad yesterday, confirmed that around 800 families were being given temporary shelter and food near the border town of Zakho, complaining of harassment by Turkish troops. The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy. Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces. The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in Istanbul. This, more than any other recent incident, has inflamed public opinion against the Kurds. The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, in a German magazine last week, said the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should convene a conference on the Kurdish problem. Scandinavian countries have more than once called for CSCE monitors to go to the south-east. For the first time, the US is calling on Turkey, its Nato ally, to find a political solution to the problem of the 10m-strong Kurdish minority. However, in the wake of recent escalations in the violence, Mrs Tansu Ciller's government has hardened its view, abandoning the political initiative to win over moderate Kurds by democratic reforms.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Young &amp; Co's Brewery advances to Pounds 5.59m YOUNG &amp; Co's Brewery, the south-London based independent brewer, increased profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 5.59m pre-tax in the year to March 28. Trading profits rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 8.03m on turnover 16.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 68.14m. Earnings declined from 28.38p to 27.51p but a final dividend of 7.5p (7p) lifts the total to 14.5p - a rise of 11.5 per cent. Trading profits were helped by the Pounds 12m acquisition last August of the HH Finch chain of 22 pubs and six wine bars and restaurants. These outlets contributed profits of Pounds 541,722 on turnover of Pounds 5.39m. Additional borrowings increased interest charges from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 2.68m. Revaluation of the com-pany's property assets at the year end resulted in a surplus of Pounds 18m over book value. Sales of assets during the year realised gains of Pounds 244,000.</p>

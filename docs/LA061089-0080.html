			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: PLUNGE IN RATES ADDS TO INVESTORS' QUANDARY  </P> <P> Will interest rates continue to go down? What should I do about it?  </P> <P> These are questions you and many other investors may be asking in the wake of  sharp interest rate declines during the past three months. The plunge has been  fueled in part by expectations of lower inflation and was augmented this past  week by signs that the Federal Reserve was easing credit conditions.  </P> <P> Even the release on Friday of the government's producer price report, showing a  higher-than-expected inflation rate of 9.4% so far this year, failed to stem  the falling interest rate tide.  </P> <P> Many investors consequently have bet on lower rates, locking in longer-term  certificates of deposit or longer-term bonds, or jumping into stocks. But not  all analysts are convinced that rates can fall much further, pointing to the  Fed's continuing concern about the threat of inflation.  </P> <P> So should you join the crowd and bet on falling rates?  </P> <P> The answer depends on how much risk you can take. The investment choices are  many, but here are some relatively straightforward ones, depending on your risk  profile:  </P> <P> * "Safe and Secure" Investors.  </P> <P> You're in this group if you're an ultraconservative investor who can't afford  to lose a dime. Thus, you should stay away from long-term bonds or stocks,  which could fall in value if interest rates rise. Stick with certificates of  deposit, money market mutual funds or Treasury bills. All carry virtually no  risk of loss of principal.  </P> <P> Yields on six-month CDs and money market funds nationwide are averaging 9.06%  and 9.08%, respectively, down considerably from their peaks in March and April.  But several still carry annualized yields of 10% or more.  </P> <P> According to 100 Highest Yields, a newsletter in North Palm Beach, Fla.,  California institutions offering six-month CDs with annual compound yields  above 10% include Guardian Savings of Huntington Beach at 10.24% and Columbia  Savings &amp; Loan at 10.02%.  </P> <P> If you think interest rates will fall, it is still not too late to lock in a  decent yield on a longer-term CD, says Robert Heady, editor of 100 Highest  Yields. Institutions with the highest average annual yields on 2 1/2-year  certificates are Sun State Savings in Phoenix at 11.2%, and Dominion Federal  Savings in McLean, Va., and John Hanson Savings in Beltsville, Md., both at  10.59%.  </P> <P> As for money funds, consistently strong performers through the years include  Vanguard Money Market Reserves-Prime (800-662-7447), currently paying a 10.1%  annual compounded yield, and Flex-Fund Money Market Fund (800-325-3539) at 10%.  The latter adjusts its management fee to keep the yield high.  </P> <P> Also above 10% are two funds, Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar (800-645-6561) and  Fidelity Spartan (800-544-6666), that are absorbing all management fees and  expenses. Complete listings of all major money fund yields can be found every  Thursday in The Times.  </P> <P> Six-month Treasury bills now yield 8.44%. But they have the advantage of being  exempt from state and local taxes.  </P> <P> If you're in the top 33% federal tax bracket, consider tax-exempt money market  funds. They are free of federal taxes and currently yield an average of 6.02%,  according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report. (That's equivalent to a 8.99%  taxable yield if you're in the 33% federal bracket). Listings can be found  every Wednesday in The Times.  </P> <P> Consistently strong funds in this group include Vanguard Municipal Bond Money  Market at 6.6%, USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund (800-531-8000) at 6.6% and  Calvert Tax-Free Reserves Money Market (800-368-2748) at 6.8%.  </P> <P> Also consider money funds that invest only in tax-exempt California bonds. For  California residents, they are exempt from state taxes as well as federal.  Interestingly, Vanguard's version, Vanguard California Tax-Free Money Market  Fund, currently boasts a higher compounded annual yield (6.7%) than almost all  tax-free money funds that are exempt only from federal tax.  </P> <P> * "Easy Does It" Investors.  </P> <P> You're in this group if you can try for somewhat higher returns, in exchange  for the modest risk of possibly losing a small portion of your capital.  </P> <P> One option is intermediate-term bond mutual funds. They invest in bonds of  maturities usually between two and 10 years that will earn slightly higher  yields than money market funds and earn modest capital gains if interest rates  fall. If interest rates rise, their yields should offset any capital losses so  you won't have a net loss.  </P> <P> Often recommended no-load funds in this group include Dreyfus U.S. Government  Intermediate, Fidelity Government Securities and Vanguard Short-Term Bond.  </P> <P> If you're in a high tax bracket, consider intermediate-term tax-exempt funds.  Often recommended funds in this group include Vanguard Muni Bond Intermediate  and Fidelity Limited-Term Munis.  </P> <P> Moderate-risk investors also can buy mutual funds that invest in stocks  stressing high dividends. Those payouts cushion against falling stock prices,  making these funds less volatile than the market as a whole.  </P> <P> Often recommended no-load funds with income-oriented stocks include T. Rowe  Price Equity Income (800-638-5660), Lindner Dividend (314-727-5305) and  Vanguard Windsor II.  </P> <P> * "No Pain, No Gain" Investors.  </P> <P> You're in this group if you are willing to accept high risks in exchange for  high potential returns.  </P> <P> If you think interest rates are still heading lower, consider mutual funds  investing in zero-coupon Treasury bonds. These bonds are sold at a discount,  and you accrue interest by getting the full face value at maturity.  </P> <P> That process makes zeroes one of the most lucrative and riskiest ways to profit  from falling interest rates.  </P> <P> One of the best ways to play zeros is through a group of no-load mutual funds  managed by Benham Group (800-982-6150 in California). Each fund in the group  has a different target year when zeros in the portfolio mature. The further out  the maturity, the higher the potential return. Benham Target Maturities 2015  has the highest potential, Benham Target Maturities 1990 the lowest.  </P> <P> If long-term rates went down 1 point in a year from current levels, you could  gain as much as 40% with the Benham 2015 fund, according to Donoghue's  Moneyletter of Holliston, Mass. If long-term rates sank 3 points in that year,  you could more than double your money, the newsletter says. But you can lose if  long-term rates rise and you must sell before maturity.  </P> <P> If you think stocks will keep rising, buy growth or aggressive growth stock  funds. They have the potential to score the biggest gains in a bull market but  the biggest losses in a bear market. Often recommended no-load funds in these  groups include Janus Fund (800-525-3713), Neuberger &amp; Berman Manhattan Fund  (800-367-0770), Scudder Capital Growth (800-225-2470), Twentieth Century Ultra  (800-345-2021), Nicholas Fund (414-272-6133) and Fidelity Capital Appreciation.  </P> <P> What if you think interest rates and inflation are headed higher? Consider gold  or gold mutual funds. Gold prices have sunk for much of the past year, closing  Friday at $358.10 an ounce at the Commodity Exchange, down $15.40 on a day  inflation was reported to be higher.  </P> <P> But some analysts think the metal has dropped so far that it can't go much  lower. Some argue that the price has fallen so low that major mining firms may  start curtailing production. Abundant supplies have been a major depressor of  gold prices.  </P> <P> The riskiest and potentially most lucrative way to play gold is through gold  mutual funds. They invest in gold mining company stocks, whose prices are more  volatile than the metal itself. Gold funds are up only 0.51% so far this year,  the second worst among fund groups tracked by Lipper Analytical Services after  world income funds. History shows that gold funds are often most attractive  after they've been performing poorly.  </P> <P> Often recommended no-load gold funds include Lexington Goldfund (800-526-0056),  United Services Gold Shares (800-873-8637) and USAA Gold.  </P> <P> Of course, you may be among many investors whose risk preference doesn't fall  entirely into any of these three categories. Accordingly, build a diversified  portfolio with some money in each.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond individually to letters.

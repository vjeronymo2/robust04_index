			<p>BFN     [Text] The CIS peace-keeping forces, mostly composed of the  Russian military contingent, are to be introduced into the zone  of the Abkhazian conflict before June 10. The latest date for  their deployment is June 15. The operation will be supervised  by Deputy Commander of the Russian infantry troops,  Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Sokolov. Interfax learned this  from sources in one of the delegations currently negotiating in  Moscow on deployment of the peace-keeping forces. The  negotiations are expected to end today.    The Abkhazian delegation is headed by Abkhazian Defense  Minister Sultan Sosnaliyev. Georgian Defense Minister Varden  Nadibaidze leads the Georgian delegation. Russia acts as a  mediator and is represented by high-ranking military officers.    In accordance with the agreements reached on May 14, the  peace- keeping forces will be deployed in the security zone  which will lay on the Inguri River after the Georgian and  Abkhazian troops are withdrawn twelve kilometers from it. The  size of the peace forces is expected to be about 2,500-3,000  servicemen.    Interfax learned that a group of Russian officers may leave  for Abkhazia on Thursday in order to define specific regions for  deployment of the peace-keeping forces.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Amato overruled on public works THE Italian parliament has rejected the government's efforts to find a solution to the problem of public works contracts blocked because of companies' alleged involvement in corruption scandals. First the Senate and then the Chamber of Deputies yesterday refused to accept a decree intended to restart work on projects, especially road schemes, frozen because the companies involved are under investigation for having paid bribes to political parties to secure the work. The break in the ranks of the four-party coalition majority over the corruption issue underscores the loosening grip of party discipline and the contrary mood of parliament towards the future of the Amato government. The failure to break the impasse also has severe economic repercussions. Mr Francesco Merloni, the public works minister, warned yesterday that 40 projects in 11 regions could be closed. For Anas, the roads authority, he estimated that 30,000 jobs could be at risk. The main point of controversy in the decree were measures to get round existing tight rules removing companies from the list of those authorised to carry out public works. This was strongly opposed by critics of the decree who regarded it as letting the companies off too lightly. But parliament, having made itself highly unpopular with the construction industry by this move, courted it with another. Yesterday, approval was granted in principle for the L36,400bn (Pounds 16.6bn) project to introduce a high speed train network to connect Milan through Bologna, Florence and Rome with Naples on a north-south axis, and Venice through Milan with Turin on an east-west axis. The high-speed network is to be funded 40 per cent by the state and 60 per cent by private investors. Different consortiums will construct and operate different sections of track. The approval is only the beginning of a long bureaucratic path before work starts and not the least of the problems is that many of the construction companies intending to be involved in the project are caught up in corruption scandals. In addition the project itself, involving such large sums of money, is likely to be subjected to special scrutiny.</p>

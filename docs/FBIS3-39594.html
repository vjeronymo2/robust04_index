			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F> autonomous government, by Jose Luis Barberia; place and date not  given: "Jose Antonio Ardanza"]    [Text] San Sebastian--The question whether the PNV [Basque  Nationalist Party] has substantially modified its "line" has  reemerged in conjunction with all the furor stirred up in recent  weeks by combative public statements from party spokespersons.    [Barberia] What's happened to make your party, the PNV,  harden its line lately?    [Ardanza] My party has not changed its line, but after seven  years in which not a single statutory transfer [to the regional  autonomous government] was implemented, we are really tired of  waiting, and we find it intolerable that the socialist party  continues tinkering endlessly with obligatory, mandated  legislation such as the Statute of Guernica, which was endorsed  in a referendum.    [Barberia] Isn't it true that the underlying basis of all  the  polemics is the breakdown of negotiations on the general budget  bill and PNV's participation in the Madrid government?    [Ardanza] After seven years it seemed only reasonable that  the PNV should get rapid progress on autonomy, at a time when it  was being asked to make larger commitments and was even offered  the possibility of participation in a hypothetical coalition  government. But the socialists' response was to say there would  be no movement on autonomy legislation until the PNV promises  this will be the last demand. In other words, they want us to  renounce our nationalist ideology, to yield to their cynical  attempts at blackmail.    [Barberia] More than the issue of suspended transfers per  se,  what the central government and the PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] seem to reject is the PNV's interpretation of  some of these reforms.    [Ardanza] During those seven years, we told the socialists  again and again that we were prepared, on these pending matters,  to accept the interpretations they themselves made back in 1979,  when they asked the Basque people to vote for the law. The  response, equally cynical, has been that that interpretation is  obsolete. Under the circumstances, it seems to me the PNV has  shown ample restraint and moderation.    [Barberia] As the highest official in the [Basque]  autonomous  community, do you think it proper and politically prudent to  say, as spokesmen for your party have been quoted recently, that  the king should not rely on bayonets alone, that the monarch  gave a "humorous" talk, that the army is an obstacle to  self-determination, and that the Civil Guard is a loathsome  apparatus?    [Ardanza] Look, I'm not going to get into making specific  judgments about what people have said or not said. What  surprises me is the scandal people are trying to make of it.  What is scandalous in my own opinion is that the Civil Guard  have set up humiliating roadblocks everywhere, that they  mistreat a mayor in full view of his own townspeople, throw him  down on the ground, kick him and hold him with his arms crossed  for two full hours. There comes a time when you have to say:  "This has got to stop." I'm not going to deny that some people,  myself included, may have spoken too harshly on occasion; what  surprises me, though, is that they should spend an hour in a  press conference denouncing what after all was only a single  sentence.    [Barberia] And what do you have to say about the debate on  self-determination, all the references to the Ulster accord?    [Ardanza] We weren't the ones to raise that issue. We have  other priorities, other urgent issues, such as progress on  autonomy and above all recession and unemployment. But what  happens? Well, we are constantly raked over the coals and  besieged with demands to take a position on that issue. And we  are Basque nationalists! For us, self-determination is a  legitimate right, recognized by international bodies. So why is  it so scandalous? Why is it that this and other subjects are  considered taboo here in Spain? Is it because Spain's democracy  is not fully established and normalized? Truly, one begins to  have doubts, when all it takes to stir up an immediate scandal  is to say something about the army.    [Barberia] Do you think these polemics are artificial--in  other words, that there's an element of hypocrisy here?    [Ardanza] What I believe is this: There are lots of  conjuring  tricks going on here, since at the same time both of Spain's  largest political parties have lost their ideological moorings,  or so it seems. In the last analysis, one has the impression  that the socialist party is just a machine that exists to  perpetuate itself in government and parcel out power. The crisis  in the PSOE today--and it is one of the state's biggest  problems--has nothing to do with ideology: It's all about the  allocation and control of power.    [Barberia] As the description of a political party, that's a  fairly harsh judgment....    [Ardanza] They vacillate between frontal opposition and  compromise, depending--as far as I can tell--on changes in the  opinion polls. I'm not saying it's not legitimate, but I think  that's how it is.    [Barberia] Is there any justification for the comparisons  being made between the "Irish case" and the so-called Basque  problem?    [Ardanza] All I can say is, it's worth reflecting on the  method chosen by the governments of two democratic countries,  the United Kingdom and Ireland, to deal with a political  conflict that has lasted more than 70 years. They signed a  document in which they acknowledged that the road to peace is  based on the right of the inhabitants of Ulster to  self-determination. And this I know: No one there was  scandalized by the proposal that the Ulsterites decide,  democratically, whether they want to continue as a province of  the United Kingdom or become a part of the Republic of Ireland.  Ulster is not in Africa, neither is it a colony; it's in Europe,  quite close to us.    [Barberia] Leaders of your party have alluded to possible  Civil Guard opposition to deployment of the Ertzaintza [Basque  Autonomous Police] in Guipuzcoa, while spokesmen for the  government have said the presence of Ertzaintza will not mean  reduced deployments of other security forces. Do we have here  the germ of a new conflict?    [Ardanza] No. We continue to rely on the parliamentary  accords and the agreements signed between the [Interior]  Ministry and the Basque department of interior.    [Barberia] What is your opinion of the personnel shake-ups  in  Interior and the changes Asuncion seems to want to introduce in  the struggle against terrorism?    [Ardanza] Asuncion has assured us categorically that nothing  is changed. We'll just have to wait and see.    [Barberia] Not even respecting the PNV's erstwhile contacts  with ETA-HB [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group/Herri Batasuna]?    [Ardanza] I rely on the minister's own words, when he  attested to the necessity of our collaboration. But the mistake  was to formulate a political proposal. The state cannot avoid  the obligation it has to democratic nationalists to fully  implement the requisite legislation, which, I repeat, is  mandatory and was offered to violent extremists in exchange for  a truce. That is a violation of the Ajuria Enea pact.    [Barberia] Do you think the hopes once vested in the  so-called Azkoiti track have come to naught? Are we sure they  don't know who's now in charge of the ETA?    [Ardanza] I share the impression that ETA no longer has a  nucleus capable of getting the entire organization to move in a  particular direction. As to the first question, I cannot speak  of failures or successes in absolute terms. These are processes  whose effectiveness can only be determined after the problem is  overcome.    [Barberia] The last elections substantially altered the  Basque political landscape. Do you view the advances made by  nonnationalist Basque parties as temporary, or are they  indicative of a putative withering away of nationalist supremacy?    [Ardanza] It's not very scientific to build whole theories  on  the results of a handful of electoral races.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Isosceles Isosceles's proposed financial restructuring represents the best outcome the company can expect in its dire predicament. Almost certainly, though, it will not be enough to save its owners further blushes. The plan assumes the ring-fenced Gateway grocery chain will be left supporting Pounds 464m of debt on operating profits of perhaps Pounds 70m this year. Out of that, Gateway must pay interest of some Pounds 45m and may have to pay dividends to Isosceles. That will leave little scope to upgrade its outdated store portfolio, despite an additional Pounds 80m of working capital facilities. Gateway will concentrate on reinvigorating its 500 core stores. But it will be tough work simply staunching its sales decline, which has been running at an 8 per cent annual rate. The remainder of Isosceles's Pounds 1.4bn of debt will be carried in restructured form by the parent company. Holders of the Pounds 256m of senior debt and Pounds 400m of discount bonds will still hope for some salvage from a flotation or sale of Gateway. Barring a transformation in Gateway's trading, owners of the preference and ordinary shares will get no return at all. Isosceles's 38 banks seem disposed to swallow their losses with surprising equanimity. Maybe they have simply grown blase at writing down problem loans. But the alternatives are scarcely tempting. Either they inject yet more capital and risk going for growth or they put Isosceles into receivership and try to squeeze value from Gateway's notional Pounds 800m of assets.</p>

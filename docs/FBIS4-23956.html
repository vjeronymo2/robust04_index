			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In line with their regular consultations, the  president of the Republic and the prime minister held talks  yesterday in Lome II. The topics discussed at this meeting  notably centered on measures taken to ensure security in our  country, rigor in the management of public funds and ensuring  regular payment of workers' salaries, negotiations with  international financial institutions, and the outcome of the  30th OAU summit attended by the president of the Republic from  13 to 15 June. On this specific point, the president of the  Republic and the prime minister reviewed developments in the  Rwandan situation and the reconciliation in Tunis on 14 June  between the leaders of Nigeria and Cameroon. [passage omitted]    On the situation in Rwanda, the president of the Republic  and  the prime minister regretted the nonobservance of the cease-fire  reached between the warring sides which has unfortunately led to  the continuation and intensification of the deadly war in the  past few days. They also deplored this situation, which does no  honor to the African continent, and expressed their support for  the French proposal for a humanitarian assistance to bring  relief to the suffering people of Rwanda.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Euston main line upgrade studied The Pounds 500m modernisation of British Rail's west coast main line moved a stage closer yesterday with the announcement of the award of a Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m feasibility study to a consortium of four companies. Railtrack, which will run BR's track and signalling, said the seven-year project to upgrade the 480-mile link between London and Glasgow would set the pattern for the private-sector management and financing of large contracts. It would also be an important test of Railtrack's ability to manage a project of this scale. The nine-month study will be carried out by West Coast Main Line Development, comprising Brown and Root, a project management company; Sir Alexander Gibbs, a civil engineering consultancy; Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, an international consultancy; and Babcock and Brown, a specialist in transport finance. The consortium will consider how to improve the track, power supply and signalling and how to raise private finance in a way which is acceptable to the Treasury. It will also prepare tender documents to select a contracting consortium in 1995. The west coast line was the first BR main line to be electrified in the mid 1960s. People, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAN HURT BY RODEO BULL IN BATHROOM MUST BE COMPENSATED, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> A rodeo group must compensate a woman injured when a bull jumped three fences  and charged into a bathroom where she was waiting out the competition, a judge  has ruled.  </P> <P> The indoor rodeo arena's 5 1/2-foot-high restraining fences should have been  higher to contain the bull, even though he "performed a routine that even an  Olympic steeplechase horse" would have trouble duplicating, said District Judge  Jon Kerian.  </P> <P> The incident occurred in July 1985. The bull, after throwing its rider and  chasing a rodeo clown out of the ring, went over the fences and down a hall  before bursting into the bathroom, according to testimony.  </P> <P> The animal pinned Barbara Deck against a wall, injuring her left shoulder and  arm, and kicked out a bathroom sink before the woman was rescued by cowboys,  said her attorney, David Hogue.  </P> <P> Deck, who did not want to watch because she once had seen a bull break the legs  of its rider, was waiting while her husband watched the bull-riding event,  Hogue said.  </P> <P> The North Dakota Rodeo Assn. must pay the woman $15,000 plus more than $3,000  in medical expenses, Kerian ruled after a one-day trial. Kerian also awarded  Daniel Deck $3,000 for the loss of his wife's services in farm chores.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOXICS DRIVE YIELDS BIG BILL FOR BURBANK  </P> <P> The disposal cost of household hazardous waste collected in Burbank over the  weekend is about $46,000 over budget, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief M.W. Johnson of the Burbank Fire Department said he learned  Tuesday that the bill for disposing of the materials collected during the  city's first toxic roundup is $126,409. The City Council had allocated $80,000  for the project.  </P> <P> Johnson said that more hazardous materials than expected were deposited at the  Burbank Public Service Yard during Saturday's daylong collection.  </P> <P> "We had a fixed cost on the service, but it was based on the amount of gallons  and pounds that were collected," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Members of 616 households deposited toxic substances at the site, Johnson said,  and some brought multiple loads. In addition, toxics were picked up at the  homes of 159 elderly and handicapped people.  </P> <P> The city amassed 186 55-gallon drums of corrosive liquids and solids, paint  products, flammable solids and poisons; 13 55-gallon drums of oil-related  products; 600 pounds of oxidizers; 13 bags of asbestos; 4,872 gallons of paint,  and 59 car batteries, he said.  </P> <P> "It was a lot more than we anticipated, but we are very glad to see it,"  Johnson said. "We were obviously overwhelmed by the amounts.  </P> <P> "A lot of old pesticides and things had been in people's garages for 20 or 30  years," he said. "We had problems identifying some of the stuff and had to use  chemical analysis to decide what it was so we could package it properly."  </P> <P> The identifying, packaging and transporting of the waste was handled by  Disposal Control Services, whose employees worked overnight to clear the  collection site of the toxic materials by Sunday morning.  </P> <P> The substances were shipped to five sites, including an incinerator facility in  Louisiana, special landfills in Santa Barbara County and Palo Alto and a lab in  Chula Vista, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey said he expects the City Council to approve  the additional money to pay for the cleanup.  </P> <P> "That's what city governments are for -- to provide these kinds of services to  the residents," Helvey said.  </P> <P> State law prohibits disposing of household toxics through normal public trash  collection, so many citizens -- uncertain how to get rid of the materials --  store them in their garages, Johnson said. Such storage is hazardous, he said.  </P></p>

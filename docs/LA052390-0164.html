			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES 52-48 TO BAN 9 ASSAULT WEAPONS IN SETBACK FOR BUSH, NRA  </P> <P> The Senate voted today to prohibit the importation and manufacture of nine  military-style assault weapons in a surprise defeat for the Administration,  Senate Republicans and the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> The Senate voted 52 to 48 to retain in its anti-crime package a provision that  would ban for three years five foreign- and four U.S.-made semiautomatic  weapons -- called the "weapons of choice" for criminals and drug traffickers.  </P> <P> Opponents of the restrictions immediately called for reconsideration of the  decision. But the Senate voted 50-49 not to reconsider.  </P> <P> The Administration and Senate Republicans active on the bill opposed the ban  and the National Rifle Assn. campaigned for its defeat.  </P> <P> Supporters of the assault weapon ban had said over the weekend they held little  hope of winning. They said they expected to face opposition on the campaign  trail this fall because of the legislation.  </P> <P> California's senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson, voted  in favor of the firearms restrictions.  </P> <P> Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), leading the fight against the ban, said that it  would hurt only the "decent, honest people" who collect these weapons or use  them for target practice, or sometimes for hunting.  </P> <P> Hatch said "deranged psychopaths" and the "crooks and violent people will be  able to get them."  </P> <P> But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said "assault weapons put awesome killing  in the hands of drug runners, hate groups and other criminals."  </P> <P> "The ease with which these weapons can be obtained is fueling the arms race on  the streets of every community in America," Kennedy added. "This is literally a  matter of life and death for law enforcement."  </P> <P> Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the chief sponsor of the restrictions, said,  "Assault weapons are rapidly becoming the weapon of choice for drug dealers.  Our law enforcement officials are literally fed up."  </P> <P> Five of the weapons included in the Metzenbaum and DeConcini proposals have  already been banned from coming into the United States under an executive order  signed by President Bush.  </P> <P> The Senate bill under consideration today initially was part of the Bush  Administration's anti-crime package, but has long since been reshaped by  majority Democrats led by Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr.  (D-Del.). The Administration now opposes the measure.  </P> <P> In addition to the question of cracking down on firearms, the key provisions of  the anti-crime package are an expansion of the death penalty, a curb on  petitions for court review of sentences and relaxed standards for search and  seizure by police.  </P> <P> The two parties differed sharply on details of those issues, as shown by the  controversy over the assault weapons.  </P> <P> The Democrats proposed bans on assault weapons, but Republicans proposed only  increased penalties to 10 years in prison for criminals who use them in the  commission of violent or drug-related crimes.  </P> <P> Tuesday, the Senate voted 82 to 17 to kill a ban on 21 types of semiautomatic  assault weapons proposed by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). The amendment  would have also banned bullet magazines with more than 15 rounds.  </P></p>

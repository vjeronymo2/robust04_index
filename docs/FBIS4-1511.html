			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Taiwan topped the world  in per capita gold consumption last year, according to  statistics compiled by the World Gold Council.    "Each Taiwan resident consumed an average of eight grams of  gold in 1993, the highest among all countries around the world,"  a spokesman for the world council's representative office in  Taipei said Saturday [26 March].    Hong Kong trailed behind, with each resident consuming six  grams of gold on average, the spokesman said.    Mainland China, however, took the lead in total gold  consumption at 223 metric tons, the spokesman noted. Per capita  gold consumption on the mainland stood at 0.2 grams last year.    According to the council's tallies, Taiwan consumed 160.6  tons of gold in 1993, while Hong Kong's consumption totaled 36.4  tons.    Altogether, the spokesman said, the three Chinese societies  consumed 420 tons of gold in 1993 alone, accounting for 65  percent of Asia's total consumption.    A recent survey conducted by the World Gold Trade Promotion  Council found that more than 80 percent of Taiwan, Hong Kong and  mainland consumers like pure gold jewelry, particularly those  fashionably designed and reasonably priced. It also found that  women between 16 and 34 were the mainstay of the clientele.    The spokesman said he believes the burgeoning "greater China  economic sphere" will be the world's most important gold market  in the years ahead.    A seminar on the latest gold jewelry design trends and a  gold  jewelry design contest are being held in Taipei under the  auspices of the gold council. "The events are aimed at helping  Taiwan goldsmiths and designers expand their market shares," the  spokesman noted.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Emess to sell Tenby for Pounds 22m EMESS, the lighting and electrical accessories company, is to sell Tenby, the electrical manufacturer and distributor, to Legrand, the French electrical group, for Pounds 22m. The divestment, which has to be ratified by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on December 23, will reduce borrowings from Pounds 38m to Pounds 16m, giving gearing of 23 per cent. Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said the sale would allow the company to focus on its core businesses of consumer and commercial lighting. The disposal has enabled Emess to introduce an employee share ownership plan that will be used to buy back preference shares. When an employee option is due, instead of issuing new shares, the company's Esop will buy preference shares and convert them into ordinary shares. Emess is intending to lend up to Pounds 3m to the Esop. Profits before tax and extraordinary items at Tenby for the 1991 year amounted to Pounds 2.1m. The consideration is based on 1992 trading profits which are expected to be about Pounds 2.7m.</p>

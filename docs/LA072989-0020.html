			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> PAUL LINKE DRAMA ON BIRTH AND DEATH MOVES TO HBO  </P> <P> Home birth. Home death. Home Box Office.  </P> <P> "Time Flies When You're Alive," Paul Linke's moving monologue about the home  births of his children and the home death of his wife, arrives on Home Box  Office Sunday at 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Stock up on handkerchiefs.  </P> <P> The piece was nurtured at the Powerhouse and Tiffany theaters, in Santa Monica  and West Hollywood, and the staged version, directed by Mark C. Travis, was  indeed a little powerhouse. But it's even more of one now, in Roger  Spottiswoode's screen version.  </P> <P> The show celebrates the idea of marking life's most important passages,  surrounded by your loved ones in your own environment. So it's perfectly  appropriate that people should watch it in their living rooms, surrounded by  family.  </P> <P> But it's not a trendy tribute to the cocooning of couples and families. Its  fundamental subjects are elemental. And Linke's presentation is spellbinding.  </P> <P> The screen version opens with an exterior shot of Linke's Mar Vista house. The  same image is later used as a framed background during the studio-shot  monologue. But before we see Linke himself, John Bailey's camera (Bailey also  shot the Spalding Gray monologue "Swimming to Cambodia") moves slowly through  Linke's house. We see objets d'art and signs of children, but no people.  Ravel's "Pavane Pour Une Infante Defunte" plays in the background.  </P> <P> Leaving the house, we enter a stage on which Linke stands before an audience.  He welcomes us "to an evening with me," which may strike those who haven't seen  his show as self-indulgent. Who is this Paul Linke?  </P> <P> As he begins talking, however, it quickly becomes apparent that Linke's story  is a human interest story in the best possible meaning of the term -- if you're  human, you'll be interested.  </P> <P> From the beginning, Linke announces that the story ends with the death of his  wife, Francesca, in 1986. She realized, too late, that the lump in her breast  was not related to breast-feeding.  </P> <P> But it's also the story of a couple trying to support each other through a  crisis and occasionally failing, of a woman's aversion to conventional medicine  and her search for alternative treatments, of children's attempts to comprehend  the incomprehensible.  </P> <P> It even includes an amusing side trip back to the  </P> <P> day when Linke bought himself a colonic for his birthday. Throughout, Linke is  never far from self-deprecating humor. Nor is he ever far from gut-wrenching  passion.  </P> <P> Although Linke's words never sound arty, his performance is definitely artful.  He is an actor. This is not a rambling therapy session. Yet the authenticity is  unmistakable. It helps that the sight of the studio audience disappears after  the first few minutes, never to return. Although it's only an illusion that  Linke is speaking to each of us personally, it's an illusion that becomes  harder to avoid, as the show goes on.  </P> <P> His performance has been expertly choreographed, lit and shot. Sometimes Linke  speaks quickly, literally commanding "jump cut" as he switches scenes.  Sometimes he pauses to allow the impact of his words to sink in. When he utters  the doctor's initial verdict, he is flooded with harsh, intimidating light; the  birth of his child brings on another kind of glow.  </P> <P> The visual virtuosity (and some trimming of the text) imparts an urgency to the  performance that surpasses the stage version.  </P> <P> Time flies when you're watching "Time Flies."  </P></p>

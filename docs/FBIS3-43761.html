			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "The lies that are broadcast by Jamba's Voice </F> of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, radio station"  on the "Dotting the I's, Crossing the T's" section of the "Voice  of Resistance of the Black Cockerel" program]    [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] radical wing's Voice of the Resistance of the  Black Cockerel, Vorgan, radio station has its studios in Jamba,  in the jungle. Recently it opened its 2000 news service with  the announcement -- as though it were true -- that General Kundi  Paiama was dead. General Kundi Paiama is an adviser to General  Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] chief of General  Staff. In that broadcast, the UNITA radical wing's official  radio station proceeded to make defamatory remarks about General  Paiama, even blaming him for many of the reverses that the UNITA  warmongering wing has suffered in its terrorist operations.    All those who listened to that news item will have noticed  that the announcer read it with joy in his voice, noting that  General Paiama had been one of the key figures in the Ministry  of State Security, Minse, and the Directorate of Intelligence  and Security of Angola, DISA. That lie, along with many others  we have grown used to hearing from Vorgan, clearly shows that  the propaganda personnel in the UNITA militarist wing are  becoming desperate. The jungle-based Vorgan radio station  newsmen are so worried about projecting a negative image of the  working of state organs in government-controlled areas in  general and in the Angolan capital in particular, that they do  not care how they fill their radio programs. The proof is that  they are always lying about incidents that have never taken take  place. Furthermore, they seldom quote sources, thereby  providing undeniable evidence that Jamba's Vorgan radio station  can only survive on lies. This, in turn, has been reducing the  number of its listeners, because only the truth can ennoble a  radio station and make it more widely heard.    The UNITA warmongering wing's radio station would have given  the public much better service if it tried to report on the real  tragedy facing hundreds of Angolans being held captive in  UNITA-controlled areas in general, and in the Jamba base in  particular. Today, more than ever before, we are hearing those  false correspondents' reports to which we grew accustomed when  we were in Jamba. The so-called correspondent would be sent  into a room, where he was issued with a poorly tuned recorder,  and then he had to shout into it a text cooked up in a hurry by  people such as [UNITA Information Secretary] Jorge Valentim and  company, at the end of which he would say: this was such and  such, reporting from Huambo. First, that such and such was not  in Huambo and, second, that is not his right name. Those are  ploys to which Vorgan resorts to give the impression that it is  on top of the situation. The reality, though, is that it is  not. We are only too well aware of its tricks. We were there  and we even participated in some of that trickery. We will not  be fooled by anybody.    We saw poor Amos, who is also known as Bob, and whose duty  is  to listen to other radio stations, doing the job of  correspondent in the room next to where he works. We saw the  wretched Carlos, a white man who uses the pseudonym of  (Catjabala), trying to pass as the station's correspondent in  Bie. The truth is that the poor man -- who could not be treated  with more contempt for the simple reason that he was white --  used to run a small storehouse with corn, grain, and dry fish  and never imagined he would one day become a radio  correspondent. We also met (Lolo), that unfortunate soul who  comes from central Angola and reports under the name of  (Cassembo). He is used to working with generators and sometimes  with cameras, but there he was trying to be the Moxico Province  correspondent in a cubicle in the Jamba Vorgan radio station's  premises. We got to know quite well all those so-called  correspondents. They are forced to read whatever is put in  front of them. Woe betide if they fail to do so.    What is quite certain is that the Angolan people are not  very  patient. Yesterday, it was Savimbi who claimed he was hitting  the enemy in the face. Now it is he who is getting the blows --  and how! Yesterday, it was Savimbi who filled up his lungs to  shout: [words indistinct] becoming ugly! Now, his chest quite  deflated, it is he who is beginning to see things become ugly  for him. The Vorgan radio station should be carrying reports  from Savimbi- controlled areas where many people are held  captive. Above all, they should go around interviewing the  inhabitants of those areas, but without resorting to any sort of  coercion. Jonas Savimbi's radio station should also be  encouraging debate and it should call on the UNITA militarist  wing to follow the path of democracy and to demilitarize its  army.    It is easy to see that there is much that the Jamba Vorgan  radio station could be doing instead of spreading lies. General  Kundi Paiama is alive, well, and kicking. He is healthy enough  to give his contribution to peace in Angola.    One cannot report on the basis of lies. One must report on  the basis of concrete facts.</p>

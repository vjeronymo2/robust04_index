			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Spens sues Bank of England governor LORD Spens, the merchant banker who was acquitted of fraud charges after his involvement in the Guinness affair, yesterday confirmed that he is suing Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, for damages. Writs against Mr Leigh-Pemberton and Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank  - Lord Spens' former employer - were obtained by Lord Spens on December 31. They will be served once his solicitors have prepared a statement of claims, which must be done within four months. Lord Spens is suing Mr Leigh-Pemberton and Ansbacher over the loss of his job as head of corporate finance at the merchant bank. 'The Bank of England forced me to resign by threatening Henry Ansbacher with the loss of their licence,' Lord Spens said yesterday. He is claiming aggravated damages from the Bank of England for inducing breach of contract and damages for breach of contract from Ansbacher. Lord Spens received a Pounds 75,000 payoff when he was dismissed by Ansbacher in 1987. He says he hopes that the litigation will result in an examination of the methods by which the Bank of England reaches its decisions. 'The Bank's own minutes showed that they threatened Ansbacher. They forced me to resign without bothering to inquire into the facts,' Lord Spens said. Many other people had been pushed out of jobs as a result of similar actions by the Bank, he added. 'The power and patronage that the Bank of England has is frightening. It is sufficient to note that Mr Leigh Pemberton is still there after BCCI.' Mr Richard Fenhalls, chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, said yesterday that he knew about the action only from newspaper reports. He said he could not comment until he saw a writ. The Bank of England said yesterday it had not received a writ and could not recall any occasion in which it had been sued over its powers to remove individuals. The Bank has statutory powers under the 1987 Banking Act to force banks to remove managers deemed not to be 'fit and proper'. Lord Spens left Ansbacher before the 1987 Banking Act took effect. The Bank used its powers under the 1979 Banking Act, which said that all banks must be prudently managed. Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank, has been made a short-odds favourite to replace Mr Leigh-Pemberton in July. Ladbrokes has offered odds of 5-4, ahead of Sir David Walker (2-1), former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board and deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank.</p>

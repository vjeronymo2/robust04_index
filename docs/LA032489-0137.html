			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI'S HOSPITAL HURT BY FUND 'CRISIS,' OFFICIAL WARNS  </P> <P> There are no diplomas, no paintings, no mementos or miscellaneous clutter to  testify to Dr. Walter Henry's distinguished career in his new office at the UC  Irvine College of Medicine.  </P> <P> There hasn't been time.  </P> <P> "I've just finished what I hope will be the most difficult week and a half of  this job," Henry said, only a little bit facetiously.  </P> <P> Henry, 48, stepped into a storm last week when in his first days as vice  chancellor of health services and dean of medicine he told the governing UC  Board of Regents that UCI Medical Center in Orange is on the brink of financial  collapse. To revive the 493-bed hospital, he said, the medical center might be  forced to cancel its Medi-Cal contract and halt treatment of the poor except in  emergencies.  </P> <P> In his first interview since taking the helm, Henry on Thursday stressed "a  sense of urgency and a sense of crisis" at the medical center and called on the  state and county governments to increase reimbursement rates to hospitals that  treat the poor, the homeless and the chronically ill. To reverse a  $13.1-million deficit, he said, UCI must dramatically reduce its burden of  "public" patients, who now make up 65% of all those treated.  </P> <P> "We need to get our indigent percentage probably in the 20% range, which is  where UCLA (Medical Center) is, it's where UC San Francisco is," Henry said.  "We need to get to that point in order to have the kind of research and  teaching hospital which is fundamental to our mission as a medical school."  </P> <P> Henry, a member of the UCI faculty since 1978, was president of the medical  center's staff when Chancellor Jack Peltason asked him to take over after Dr.  Edward J. Quilligan, former vice chancellor, suddenly resigned last month.  Henry is regarded as a top heart researcher and an astute administrator, but  his first and most difficult problem is the one primarily responsible for  Quilligan's downfall: the ballooning medical center deficit.  </P> <P> UCI officials estimate the hospital will lose $24.3 million in unreimbursed  care for Medi-Cal clients this year and $11.4 million in expenses for patients  covered by the county's Indigent Medical Services program. With 6% of the  county's hospital beds, the university hospital treats 50% of the county's  poor.  </P> <P> The problem is growing -- two of five major hospitals that have contracted to  provide care for the needy in Orange County terminated their Medi-Cal contracts  earlier this year, and a third announced plans to drop out of the state program  in July. The resulting flood of poor patients to UCI is squeezing out privately  insured patients and is so overloading the hospital that it is forced to  curtail emergency room admissions and send ambulances elsewhere several times  each month.  </P> <P> "We must resolve the problems of the UCI Med Center as our first priority,"  Henry said. "I think just for financial reasons we must resolve this problem  within the next 2 to 3 years. If we do not make changes, the kind of projected  operating losses that the medical center faces will in the very near future  become intolerable. . . . It is not the mission of the University of California  to underwrite indigent care in Orange County."  </P> <P> He acknowledged that "the alarm could have been sounded sooner" and said the  unraveling of the network of medical care for the poor affects even the  affluent.  </P> <P> "When hospitals close emergency rooms and go on paramedic bypass, if you happen  to have an accident on the freeway and are seriously injured, it makes no  difference whether you can afford to pay or not. You are affected if the  ambulance that you are in cannot find a nearby emergency room that's open."  </P> <P> UCI officials will bring specific proposals to reduce the medical center's  indigent load to state and county executives in the next few months, Henry  said. In the meantime, UCI has requested a 17% increase in its Medi-Cal  contract. Henry also called on Orange County supervisors to "re-examine their  priorities and reconsider" the level of county support that he described as one  of the lowest in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cutbacks in Care  </P> <P> If no accommodation is reached, he said, "indigent patients will be treated on  an emergency basis, and (indigent) patients who do not constitute an emergency  will not be admitted."  </P> <P> Daunting as the medical center problems are, Henry said he accepted the vice  chancellor's post because he believes the university's land, faculty and  community assets give its medical program potential to become one of the best  in the nation.  </P> <P> "The prospect of helping to implement a vision is something that I find very  exciting," he said. "I believe I can help guide the faculty through what is  admittedly a difficult period and I am doing that because I have considerable  optimism that we can solve these problems and get on with the much more  exciting aspect of this job, to develop this outstanding health science  complex."  </P> <P> Henry said he has begun work on a strategic -- and certainly controversial --  plan that will chart the course of the medical school for the next 5 to 10  years.  </P> <P> Under consideration, he said, is resurrection of plans to build a campus  hospital, a proposal that was officially abandoned in 1985, when the UC Regents  bowed to fierce community opposition. Then-medical school Dean Stanley van den  Noort refused to drop his campaign for the campus hospital, a stand that led to  his replacement.  </P> <P> Henry said that he has not "prejudged" the issue but added that the current  separation of medical operations at the hospital and science and biology  departments on the Irvine campus grows increasingly unmanageable as freeways  linking the two sites grow more congested.  </P> <P> "One of the solutions could be development of an on-campus clinical facility of  some sort," Henry said.  </P> <P> Also up for review is a faculty policy that allows UCI doctors to admit their  private patients -- those most likely to have insurance -- to other area  hospitals. No other UC hospital allows its faculty this option. For now, Henry  said, faculty admitting restrictions would not work at UCI because there is no  room for additional private patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faculty Support  </P> <P> "We will look at our affiliations with other hospitals as part of the strategic  planning process. But my personal opinion is that as we reverse the trend of  increasing numbers of indigent patients and free up beds, I am absolutely  confident that the faculty will be supportive of the medical center."  </P> <P> The response is an example of Henry's studied and open management style. He is  a consensus builder, and this strength made him the choice of the usually  fractious medical faculty when Peltason sought recommendations for a dean last  month.  </P> <P> Henry said he plans to continue to see a small number of private patients and  will remain active in the American College of Cardiology. His plate is full, he  agreed, but he said he is encouraged by the positive feedback that he has  received during a turbulent first 10 days.  </P> <P> Soon, Henry said, he will get around to hanging a few paintings in his bare  office.  </P> <P> "Things certainly aren't boring here," he said.  </P> <P> UCI MEDICAL CENTER FISCAL WOES  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.64IN:2.55IN:3.21IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3">

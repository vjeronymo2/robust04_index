			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (9): Plain talk has won respect - Profile of Alejandro Foxley, finance minister MR Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, embodies the change in economic thinking that has put Latin America on a new course of development after the 'lost decade' of the 1980s. Once a fierce critic of General Augusto Pinochet's free-market policies, Mr Foxley came to accept the benefits of an open economy and a reduced role for the state. He faced a difficult balancing act when he took over the finance ministry in March 1990, on Chile's return to democracy. The business community was nervous of the new government, a coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists. The political transition had also raised expectations among the mass of Chile's poor and middle-classes, who had suffered great hardship under military rule. 'Our main economic challenge was also an ethical one: how to balance economic development with a greater degree of social equality,' he says. But Mr Foxley also had to prove that democratic governments in Latin America could avoid populist traps and be responsible economic managers. His leitmotif since assuming the finance portfolio has been to pursue a 'conservative fiscal policy with progressive ends.' One of Mr Foxley's first acts was to push a tax package through the congress that raised corporate taxes from 10 to 15 per cent, and the sales tax by two points, to 18 per cent. The extra Dollars 1bn in revenues was earmarked for social spending. Pensions and family benefits were increased; state subsidies for low-cost housing were extended; and teachers and health workers got more pay. In spite of this, Mr Foxley faced a rash of public sector strikes in 1991. He refused to bow to wage demands. He has been equally firm with Chile's business leaders; he once told them to 'stop whining' when they complained about high interest rates and the appreciating peso. Mr Foxley's detractors accuse him of arrogance, and say he takes criticism badly. But his plain talking has also won much respect for the 53-year-old finance minister. He is acknowledged as a heavy-weight in President Patricio Aylwin's cabinet. If the ruling coalition wins the December 1993 elections, it will be largely as a result of the steady economic course charted by Mr Foxley. He is tipped to become Chile's next foreign minister, but many of his supporters believe he may want to make a bid for the leadership of the Christian Democratic party, to launch his presidential candidacy in 1997. An economist by training, with a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in the US, Mr Foxley cut his political teeth during General Pinochet's dictatorship. Like most academics who advocated the restoration of democracy, Mr Foxley was banned from teaching at state universities, and was subjected to police harassment, isolation and censorship. His house was broken into several times and death threats were left inside his passport. Together with other banned academics, he founded Cieplan, an economic think tank with Christian Democratic leanings. When General Pinochet gave way to contested elections in 1989, Mr Foxley joined Mr Aylwin's presidential campaign. By then he was convinced that retaining the broad lines of the military's economic policies was the key to a smooth political transition. He was rewarded with the finance portfolio. Mr Foxley is also earning a reputation abroad as a leading exponent of the importance of free trade for developing countries. He chaired the IMF/World Bank's development committee between 1990 and 1992, from which position he reminded industrialised nations of the need to dismantle protectionist barriers. With much of Latin America betting on an export-led model of development, he argues, access to foreign markets has become much more important than aid, soft loans or debt-relief. 'The absence of further liberalisation in industrialised nations means that middle-income countries like Chile are losing a unique opportunity to expand their exports,' Mr Foxley says.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Zaide - Opera Zaide is not really an opera by Mozart at all, finished or unfinished, but the title bestowed by a Viennese publisher on the collection of 15 numbers written to texts by Johann Andreas Schachtner in Salzburg in 1779-80. There is no surviving dialogue or scenario to connect up Mozart's sequence of arias and ensembles, and attempts to associate the two-act plan with any pre-existing Singspiel plots set like Zaide in a Turkish harem have all failed. It remains an intriguing torso with decent though largely unremarkable music. The two short melodramas are the most interesting feature of the score, suggesting Mozart may have been trying them out as an alternative to dialogue or recitative and perhaps that he abandoned the project because he was dissatisfied with the result.                          *      *      * The new City of Birmingham Touring Opera Zaide, directed by Graham Vick, is being given in the version that the late Italo Calvino made for the Musica nel'Chiostro Festival at Batignano in 1981. The set pieces are delivered in their original German, and around them a modern-day narrator (using William Weaver's limpid English translation) elaborates a plot, setting up the characters, and leading them along the story line implied by the original texts. Only then does Calvino begin to tease and pick at the threads of the narrative, opening out its possibilities. The action is stopped, reversed and run through again from a new perspective, finding the right dramatic context for each number, until there is a maze of pathways and the final quartet can settle in its own comfortable niche. Vick directed the Batignano premiere (which was brought to the Old Vic for three performances later the same year). His new staging is played out on a single set by Paul Brown which faithfully reproduces the clutter of the narrator's shabby room. It is unfussy without extraneous detail; everything is focused upon Calvino's dramatic framing and sleights of hand, and the scrupulous presentation of Mozart's music. That is conducted by Simon Halsey with a period band, and could have been delivered with more energy and panache. The singing, though, is generally first-rate: Jane Leslie Mackenzie seizes upon Zaide's arias with clean, confident attack; Iain Paton is forthright in the music for Gomatz. There is a suitably blustering Soliman from Anthony Roden, eye-rolling Osmin from Peter Snipp, and cloudy-toned Allazim from Mark Holland. James Maxwell is the narrator, a sorcerer's apprentice who only just keeps control of his creations; he makes the most of the moments when Calvino's text takes flight and evokes the orientalism of the harem in luminous imagery. Then this Zaide seems most perfectly poised ' between the enigmatic classicism of Mozart's fragment and the delicate labyrinths of this most elegant of 20th-century writers.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Exodus from inner cities continues BRITAIN'S population map altered significantly during the 1980s, with continuing movement away from the big cities. The first detailed results of last year's 10-yearly census show that the overall population counted on census night - 54,156.067 - had changed little since 1981. Resident population, taking account of people who were absent from home on census night, was 54,888,844. Without exception, however, populations of the inner-urban areas had fallen. East Anglia and the south-west were the biggest gainers. The East Anglian population had the fastest growth rate - an annual average of 0.8 per cent between 1981 and 1991 - finishing the decade with 154,500 more people in the region. The south-west gained 273,000 people - a 0.6 per cent annual increase - almost the same number as the north-west lost. Of the 259,600 people who left the north-west - the region with the sharpest population decline - between 1981 and 1991, the biggest proportionate loss was from Merseyside. England and Wales gained 177,300 people since the 1981 census, while the Scottish population dropped by a similar amount - 168,583. Last year's census included a question about ethnic origin for the first time, providing the most accurate data ever available on Britain's ethnic minorities. It shows that 94.5 per cent of the British population describe themselves as white. Indians are the biggest ethnic group - 1.5 per cent - followed by 0.9 per cent of black Caribbeans and a similar proportion of Pakistani origin. Most organisations representing Britain's ethnic minorities supported the inclusion of the ethnic-origin question in the census. By combining the results with answers to other census questions on issues such as housing and employment, it will be possible for policy makers to access the particular needs of ethnic minorities. The national figure of a 5.5 per cent ethnic minority population - a little higher than previous estimates - disguises a varied regional distribution. Nearly 10 per cent of the south-east's population is from ethnic minorities, rising to more than 25 per cent in inner London. By contrast, more than 98 per cent of the populations of Scotland, Wales, the south-west and the north (covering the north-east) describe themselves as white. One of the striking social changes of the 1980s - a sharp increase in home ownership based largely on the sale of council houses - is confirmed in the results. By last year 66.4 per cent of households owned their accommodation, a 10.6 percentage points increase over 1981. The proportion living in council rented accommodation fell by 9.7 percentage points. More than a quarter of households - 26.8 per cent - consisted of one person living alone. That is an increase of 4 percentage points since 1981, and is another trend that is likely to continue. Most Britons - nearly 60 per cent of households - live in semi-detached or terraced houses, while 20 per cent live in detached ones and 17 per cent in purpose-built flats. Measured in terms of amenities, the census points to improved lifestyles since 1981. The proportion of overcrowded households fell by 2.1 percentage points to 2.2 per cent of families, and by last year only 1.3 per cent of households lacked baths and internal lavatories, compared with 4.7 per cent 10 years earlier. A third of households had no car available for their use, but 23 per cent had two or more cars - up by 8 percentage points. The Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys admits that a 'substantial number of people', consisting mainly of men in their 20s, was missed out last year. Although it believes its staff managed to track down almost everyone aged 45 and above, estimates for men in their 20s suggest an under-enumeration rate of up to 10 per cent.  ------------------------------------------------------- CENSUS 1991: The changing face of Britain  -------------------------------------------------------                        Pensioners    % self    % owner                             %      employed   occupation  ------------------------------------------------------- Scotland                   18.2        9.9        52.1 North (remainder)          18.7       10.1        65.2 North West (remainder)     18.9       12.9        75.2 Greater Manchester         18.0       11.3        64.2 Merseyside                 19.1        8.8        63.1 Wales                      20.1       13.4        70.8 West Midlands              18.3        9.5        62.9 West Midlands (remainder)  17.9       14.3        72.5 South West                 21.7       17.3        72.9 Tyne &amp; Wear                19.4        7.3        53.1 Yorks &amp; H'side (remainder) 19.7       14.1        69.7 West Yorkshire             18.0       11.2        66.2 South Yorkshire            19.1        9.4        60.9 East Midlands              18.4       12.9        70.6 East Anglia                19.9       15.1        68.5 Greater London             16.8       13.7        57.2 Outer Metropolitan Area    16.9       15.0        73.9 Outer South East           20.5       15.7        73.9  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

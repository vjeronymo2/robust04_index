			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] On this the 19th day of the fiercest offensive on  Bihac, the Serb aggressor continues his bestial orgy of  destruction. The artillery and infantry, and tank and infantry  attacks and attempts to break through on the Grmuski part of the  front have continued today, as have attacks on (Hasino Brdo) and  the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, where the chetniks have again  directed most of their forces.    They have been using a new method of shelling the town.  Probably because of the increasingly frequent overflights of  NATO aircraft, they have rescheduled their shelling of Cazin and  Bihac with howitzers, tanks, and mortars from the hills  surrounding Bihac to mornings and nights.    The defenders -- the heroes of the 5th Corps -- have been  courageously resisting the attacks, defending with their bodies  every inch of this blood-soaked land. Today they have repulsed  several attempts at tank and infantry breakthroughs.    Today there have again been provocations along the  demarcation lines with the remnants of the paramilitary of the  so-called Kladusa autonomy, and the 5th Corps Command has lodged  a strong protest with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], since  the commander of the UN French Battalion promised to mediate and  to take on responsibility for the observance of the latest  cease-fire.    All in all, the [words indistinct] is continuing with a new  uncertainty.</p>

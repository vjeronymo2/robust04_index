			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Lords reject TSW appeal on franchise THE Independent Television Commission yesterday beat off the last remaining threat to the ITV franchising process as Television South West lost its appeal in the Lords. TSW went to the Law Lords to try to overturn the majority decision of the Court of Appeal that the commission had not been unfair in rejecting its Pounds 16.11m bid. Lord Keith announced the Law Lords' verdict yesterday after a 10-minute recess at the end of a five-day hearing. The reasons for the decision will be given in the next few weeks. Mr Harry Turner, TSW managing director, said: 'It's a tough day but life has to go on.' He said his priority now was to place as many of his staff as possible with Westcountry Television, the company that won the franchise with a bid of Pounds 7.8m. The Law Lords' decision effectively ends the prospect that the commission's decisions will be legally challenged by other aggrieved losers. TV South, which lost its franchise to Meridian Broadcasting, had been considering going to the European Court if TSW had won its case. The delay will, however, pose problems for Westcountry, whose main shareholders include Associated Newspapers, South West Water and Brittany Ferries. Because of the litigation the company has not been awarded its licence and was unable to sign contracts for the building of studios. One option is to take over TSW and get a Stock Exchange quotation and operating studios at the same time. Westcountry would not, however, be interested at yesterday's price of 46p, which values the company at about Pounds 10m. If the price of TSW remains at levels that Westcountry considers unreasonably high the company will simply proceed as quickly as it can. It is unlikely that Westcountry will be able to offer the full planned service when it takes over on January 1 next year. Mr George Russell, commission chairman, said he hoped that 'in the interests of the viewers in the south-west they (Westcountry) and TSW can work towards an orderly handover'.</p>

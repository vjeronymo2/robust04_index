			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ELECTRONIC LOCKUP;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY TESTS HOME DETENTION FOR LOW-RISK OFFENDERS  </P> <P> The convicted drunk-driving offender spends about eight hours a day at his job.  When he is finished, Jeff can do a little yard work or, since he is  mechanically inclined, tinker with a few engines. He gets to spend plenty of  time with his wife and son. The bed in his room is comfortable, he can watch as  much TV as he wants, and there's a stocked refrigerator down the hall.  </P> <P> If that sounds as good as home, that is because, in this case, the place where  Jeff is serving his sentence is his Mira Mesa home.  </P> <P> Two and a half years after San Diego County began an experiment alternately  hailed as innovative and decried as having Orwellian overtones, some convicted  county criminals now do their time at home, restrained not by bars or handcuffs  but by electronic sensors.  </P> <P> Under the county's Electronic Surveillance Program (ESP), the first of its kind  in California, some "low-risk" offenders are permitted to go to work during the  day while being confined to their homes at night and on weekends.  </P> <P> The offender's movements are monitored by a six-inch-long electronic  transmitter, strapped to an ankle or wrist, that emits an inaudible beep picked  up by a receiver connected to the inmate's telephone.  </P> <P> Whenever the offender strays more than 150 feet from the receiver, the device  detects the absence and registers it with a central computer. If he leaves the  house without the approval of county probation officers, there is a good chance  the offender will find himself back in jail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started in 1986  </P> <P> Since its inception in July, 1986, 550 of the 633 inmates from the Probation  and Sheriff's departments who have participated in the program have  successfully completed their confinement at home, according to Cecil Steppe,  the county's chief probation officer.  </P> <P> That 87% success rate, combined with the contention by supporters that the  program helps free scarce and expensive jail cells for hardened criminals,  prompted the Board of Supervisors to press for expansion of the house-arrest  plan. Doing so, some argue, could be part of the answer to the county's  longstanding jail crowding problem.  </P> <P> "I think we ought to expand this to the maximum, without going over the line to  include people who belong in jail," Supervisor John MacDonald said. "It's one  of the ways we can cut the continual cost of expanding jails while also making  it possible to place certain nonviolent offenders in a better situation than  being tossed in with a lot of hard-core felons."  </P> <P> Critics, however, argue that some offenders placed in the program may be  getting off easier than they deserve, and warn that expanding the program poses  possible dangers to the public and could even be unfair to the offenders  themselves.  </P> <P> "If somebody ought to be in jail to protect the public, then that's where he  should be," Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz said. "And, if he doesn't deserve  to be in jail, then he ought to be in rehabilitative circumstances . . .  without being hassled by these electronic bracelets."  </P> <P> Since its introduction by Palm Beach County, Fla., in 1984, electronic home  detention has become increasingly common nationwide, and now is used in  two-thirds of the states. Although most programs report success rates  comparable to that of San Diego, even the most ardent advocates doubt that such  alternatives to conventional incarceration will become, at least for the  foreseeable future, more than a small part of the overall criminal-justice  picture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cautious Approach  </P> <P> According to a survey by the Washington-based National Institute of Justice,  only 2,300 offenders in 33 states were enrolled in electronic home-detention  programs last year. Although that represented a threefold increase over 1987,  the relatively small number demonstrates the resistance and cautious approach  engendered by the program, as well as its limited scope in reducing jail  populations.  </P> <P> "This is never going to be the answer to jail overcrowding," said Ron Barkett,  county probation supervisor. "But it may be one way we can keep problems like  that from getting worse."  </P> <P> Explanations of the program's limitations begin with the relatively narrow  range of offenders eligible for home detention in San Diego and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Referring to the intensive screening used to select home-detention candidates  in San Diego, Steppe notes that "it's probably harder to get into" the program  than to successfully complete it.  </P> <P> To date, county officials have not assigned offenders to the program if a judge  objected -- which is one of the reasons why only about half of those first  screened are accepted. Probation officers describe that limitation as a  "courtesy" to judges, but a judicial veto over such assignments is guaranteed  by recent state legislation authorizing a three-year, statewide pilot project  similar to San Diego's program.  </P> <P> Eligibility for the San Diego program is now limited to volunteers from the  county's work-furlough system, in which convicted offenders are allowed to work  but are locked up overnight in a detention center in Southeast San Diego.  People convicted of violent offenses, sex crimes and serious drug charges are  among those excluded from the home-detention program.  </P> <P> Those guidelines automatically rule out the vast majority of jail inmates,  narrowing the program's reach to offenses such as drunken driving, minor  burglaries, fraud and various white-collar crimes.  </P> <P> Unless those standards are lowered -- an unlikely occurrence, given the  likelihood of judicial and public opposition -- house-arrest programs probably  will never make more than a small dent in local jails' inmate populations,  which typically are nearly double the facilities' official capacities. As of  last week, only 23 San Diego residents were under the house-detention program,  although the number occasionally has been twice that large.  </P> <P> Supporters of the San Diego program, however, hasten to point out that it was  never envisioned as a panacea for jail crowding. Rather, it stemmed from  Steppe's desire to reduce a serious backlog in the work-furlough program that  often created delays of months between the time a person was sentenced to the  program and when he actually served his sentence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Certain and Swift  </P> <P> "For punishment to mean anything, it has to be certain and it has to be swift,"  Steppe said. "We were getting to a point in work-furlough where it was  neither."  </P> <P> With severe economic constraints having become all but a permanent fixture in  municipal government, the comparatively low price of electronic surveillance is  one of the program's advantages.  </P> <P> Fees paid by participants -- $10 daily if they earn less than $5 an hour, $15 a  day for most of those whose salary is higher -- have covered the cost of the 85  bracelets purchased, the computer used to monitor them and the salaries of the  two probation officers who oversee the program, Steppe said.  </P> <P> In contrast, it costs $28 daily to house a person in the county's work-furlough  detention center -- with about half that fee being paid by the offender -- and  $43 a day to feed, clothe and guard jail inmates, according to Probation and  Sheriff's departments' figures. That latter figure, moreover, does not include  the jails' multimillion-dollar construction costs -- dramatically widening the  price differential.  </P> <P> Opponents concede that home detention is cheaper than routine incarceration,  but contend that economics should not be the guiding principle behind criminal  justice.  </P> <P> "I guess my feeling is, yeah, it's cheaper -- so what?" Domnitz said. "If  people deserve to be in jail, you don't let them stay at home just because it's  going to save a few dollars. As far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is just  a gimmick to reduce jail overcrowding. It's nonsense, period."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Already Has Record  </P> <P> In addition, arguments that house arrest adequately punishes "first-time  offenders" without being unnecessarily punitive overlooks the fact that  relatively few people draw a jail sentence for their first minor offense,  Domnitz and others emphasize. By the time such a person is sentenced to jail,  he often has committed several offenses and, from the judge's perspective, has  passed the point where leniency is merited.  </P> <P> Such judicial skepticism and the prevailing public sentiment that house  detention is too easy a way out for criminals are perhaps the major barriers to  wider use of such programs, some supporters say.  </P> <P> "California used to be the national leader in innovative programs like this,  but now we're in such a punitive mode that we're way behind," said Tom  Gitchoff, a professor of criminal science at San Diego State University. "There  are ways to punish people other than just sticking them in jail cells. Besides,  some of these low-risk offenders don't really need to be in expensive,  maximum-security jails. But the public really doesn't want to hear that these  days."  </P> <P> Although conceding the obvious by agreeing that home detention is a softer form  of punishment than jail, Steppe disputes those who characterize the electronic  surveillance program as being little more than an inconvenience akin to a  teen-ager being grounded by his parents.  </P> <P> "In some ways, this can be tougher than being in jail," Steppe said. "Sure,  it's nice to be around your family, but it can get tough when your kids keep  saying, 'Dad, take us to a movie,' or 'Let's get an ice cream.' Over time, that  wears on you. . . . In jail, you lay on your behind watching TV. You know why  you're there. At home, you have more freedom, but it can be psychologically  tougher . . . accepting the limits. There are temptations and frustrations you  don't have in jail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Pretty Stiff Punishment'  </P> <P> Similarly, Gina Walker, director of Pride Inc., the private firm that runs Palm  Beach's home-detention program, said few offenders complete that program  "feeling they got off easy. Most say it's pretty stiff punishment." Even so,  the program's appeal to inmates is vividly demonstrated by the fact that  participants not only agree to pay $9 a day, but also consent to having their  jail sentences tripled. In other words, an offender facing a 30-day jail  sentence must serve 90 days under the home program. Despite the longer  sentences, that program, which handles about 400 offenders annually, has nearly  a 90% success rate, she said.  </P> <P> Although some Florida offenders have been on the program as long as 15 months,  San Diego officials have generally adhered to a 90-day maximum, feeling that  compliance would drop precipitously with longer periods.  </P> <P> Except in rare instances, such as those in which an offender's medical problems  make house arrest a logistically simpler alternative to jail, no local inmate  serves his entire sentence under electronic surveillance, county officials  stress. At a minimum, most spend at least several weeks in the overnight  work-furlough detention center, "to give them a taste of incarceration," Steppe  explained.  </P> <P> Other than work, there are few other reasons for which a person on the  electronic detention program may leave their homes. The other exceptions, to be  cleared in advance with probation officers, include medical and dental  appointments, meetings with lawyers and a brief weekly grocery store visit.  Offenders also are forbidden to drink alcoholic beverages and, occasionally, to  drive while in the program.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, however, a female offender in the program had one of the  most valid reasons imaginable for leaving her house: She gave birth to a baby  on Valentine's Day.  </P> <P> "We call it our first ESP baby," joked probation officer Ann Royer-Hirsch.  Several days later, mother and child were back within the 150-foot radius of  the transmitter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Trick Computer  </P> <P> The electronic bracelets are water-resistant, shockproof and tamper-proof.  </P> <P> "The computer can't be tricked, and if you remove (the bracelet), you'll be  caught soon enough," probation supervisor Barkett said.  </P> <P> Probation officers also make periodic unannounced visits and telephone calls to  the offenders' homes and workplaces to check for violations. Inmates who fail  to successfully complete the program can be reassigned to a work-furlough  detention center, honor camp or jail to serve their full sentence -- with no  credit for the days served at home.  </P> <P> All those factors, however, have not stopped a few inmates from trying to beat  a system that officials say is unbeatable -- attempts that usually end in comic  failures.  </P> <P> One offender, for example, offered several suspicious-sounding excuses for why  his bracelet kept "malfunctioning." Once, he said the device was damaged while  wrestling with his niece. Another time, the transmitter supposedly was  accidentally unplugged. Increasingly skeptical officials gave him the benefit  of the doubt until another unauthorized movement recorded by the computer was  explained away as the result of a violent love-making session with his  girlfriend.  </P> <P> "At that point, I said, 'That's it, get him back in here,' " Barkett said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Ask to Go Back  </P> <P> After a few weeks at home, several offenders, besieged by spousal or family  demands, have begged officials to put them back into detention facilities,  while loss of a job or place to live have forced several others back into the  work-furlough center. The most common reason for the admittedly low number of  failures, however, has been drug use or alcohol consumption, detected in random  checks.  </P> <P> Whatever the potential pitfalls of the program, however, most offenders who go  through it give it rave reviews -- particularly considering the alternative.  </P> <P> "At home, you certainly have a bigger realm, so I find it easier on the mind,"  said Jeff, the Mira Mesa man convicted on a drunken-driving charge and now in  the early stages of a three-month house-detention sentence. "When I was in (the  work-furlough detention center), I took several books with me and I think I had  them memorized. Here, I'm around my family and can pretty much do what I would  otherwise. There are some things I wanted to do -- like seeing the Padres early  in the year -- that I'll have to give up, but I accept that."  </P> <P> With economics, a successful track record and a supportive Board of Supervisors  behind him, Steppe said he hopes to find ways to meet the board's charge to  expand the program this year. He has already suggested, for example, using the  electronic bracelets to verify that youth gang members are abiding by  court-imposed curfews.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he cautions against unrealistic expectations for high-tech  incarceration.  </P> <P> "This is a valuable tool, but we have to be careful about how we use it,"  Steppe said. "Let's put it this way: There never will be more people wearing  these bracelets than are in jail. We shouldn't forget there are good reasons  for that."  </P> <P> (FOOT)  </P></p>

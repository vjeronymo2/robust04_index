			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Small price for best in the industry Sir, I would like to add a footnote to Mr Giordano's reasoned letter to you (December 1). My spell of duty with the British Gas Board covered the concluding years of nationalisation and the first few years of privatisation. The effects of the change were far more profound and dramatic than can be generally realised and were felt throughout the organisation. Prior to the change, all real authority lay with the ministry. The board could propose but not decide. Senior executives saw themselves as fulfilling ministry requirements. They were remunerated accordingly at rates close to civil service rates (with the concomitant benefits of jobs for life and pensions). Promotion depended to a great extent on the availability of 'dead man's shoes'. If success was obtained (such as bringing North Sea gas into British homes), it was entirely due to the relentless energy of the chairman of that day. Overnight, the board was required to assume responsibility for customers, shareholders, employees and the country. The loss of monopoly destroyed any remaining vestiges of 'cosiness'. Some managers found they could not live with the new situation and had to go. For the first time, new blood had to be brought in. The company was now exposed to the full weight of competition from British, American and French majors. Only the best would do and, fortunately, Dick Giordano and Cedric Brown are numbered among them. Of course, the divesting of responsibility from the ministry should have provided a substantial benefit to the national economy by the release of many civil servants, and not just in the gas industry. This benefit in itself would have offset Cedric Brown's salary many times over. Leslie Smith, Forston Farm, Forston, Dorchester, Dorset DT2 7AB</p>

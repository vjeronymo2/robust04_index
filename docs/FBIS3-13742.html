The talks have raised concern in New Delhi that closer  relations between Washington and Islamabad could lead to an  upset of the regional power equation.    A Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said here Thursday  that  Washington and Islamabad were engaged in "deep dialogue" on the  subject of nuclear non-proliferation, a priority of US foreign  policy in the region.    Neither Pakistan nor traditional rival India, which exploded  a nuclear device in 1974, are signatory to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and both suspect the other of  developing atomic weapons.    The ongoing US-Pakistan talks coincide with reports of the  willingness of the US administration to partially lift a ban on  military and economic aid to Pakistan which was imposed in  October 1990 following fears that Islamabad had embarked on a  nuclear weapons program.    The ban was implemented under provisions of the Pressler  amendment, named after US Senator Larry Pressler, which forbids  military aid to Pakistan unless the president could certify  Islamabad did not have nuclear weapons and was not trying to  develop them.    But US officials on Tuesday said Washington may ease the ban  to enable the delivery of 71 F-16 jet fighters, which were  ordered from General Dynamics but suspended when the ban took  effect, in return for a "verifiable" pledge that Pakistan will  halt its nuclear program.    Islamabad has already paid for 38 of the aircraft.    Delivery of the aircraft would boost Pakistan's  deteriorating  air force, which is equipped with some 100 Mirage jets, about  100 Chinese-made F6 and F7 aircraft and 34 F-16s.    (In New Delhi, India's Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul was  quoted  Friday by The Statesman daily as saying that the "balance of  power" in the region would change if Pakistan acquired the  aircraft, whose long ranges enable them to carry out deep strike  attacks.    ("Those machines have been manufactured and are lying there.  I have always maintained that they (the United States) will find  some way of overcoming the Pressler amendment," the daily quoted  him as telling reporters at a news conference in Bombay.    (The Indian air force chief did not spell out exactly how  the  military balance would be upset if Pakistan were to acquire the  planes.    (He however spoke about India's difficulties in upgrading  its  Russian-built MiG-21 planes because of Russian reluctance to  part with technology information following the breakup of the  Soviet Union.    (His remarks followed concern expressed by Foreign Minister  Dinesh Singh at the US proposal to dispatch the F-16s to  Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since  independence in 1947.    ("Does the United States want to encourage Pakistan to use  nuclear weapons against India?" Dinesh Singh said this week.    Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, shortly after  assuming office in October last year, said that former premier  Nawaz Sharif had "capped" the country's nuclear programme and  that she had decided to maintain that position.    A late Thursday report, quoting sources close to the foreign  office, reiterated Islamabad's position and assured the  Pakistani public that "any step taken will safeguard the  national interest."    The report also claimed that the Pressler amendment had  failed to achieve its objective of preventing arms  proliferation, but had managed to contribute to Pakistan's  conventional arms capabilities being "eroded.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK  Company News: US investment banks look to Asia - The build-up of resources in London likely to slow down next year London has been the most profitable centre for US investment banks since last year, following a build-up of resources in Europe's biggest financial centre in the early 1990s. However, the recent pressure on banks' profits in the US, together with a switch in their investment towards Asia, is set to slow the boom in London considerably next year. The surge of profits in Europe has helped to turn the focus of the banks' attentions away from the US markets, which have traditionally provided almost all their profits. Morgan Stanley employs nearly 2,000 people in London, almost identical to its Canary Wharf neighbour, CS First Boston, the unit of Credit Suisse which is run from New York. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, employs 1,600 at its European headquarters in Fleet Street, while Lehman Brothers has built its numbers to 1,300. The figures represent a substantial increase over the past two years as US banks have invested part of their huge profits from the booming US capital markets. One result has been that, since last year, their London-based businesses have for the first time earned a higher return on capital than domestic US operations, said Mr Steven Berger, managing director in charge of Lehman's European investment banking business. 'The cross-over occured in 1993, for all of us.' Also, the banks' Asian operations 'became profitable for the first time' in 1993, or in some cases 1992. 'There's been a big change in where the firms are making their money.' The push overseas looks set to continue, given the big increases in capital achieved by a number of firms recently. Operations in overseas markets, particularly for privatisation or other new issue work, have been more profitable than similar work in the US. 'No doubt US securities firms are flush with capital from the recent (profits) cycle, and some may be keen to put those profits back into the business,' said Mr Michael Flannagan, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical. In addition, some firms have received infusions of new capital this year, further bolstering their international businesses. CS First Boston, for instance, now has Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.09bn) of equity capital, up from Dollars 1.3bn at the end of last year, as part of a plan to strengthen its position in international financial markets. Lehman's equity capital base soared to Dollars 3.6bn this summer after it was spun-off by American Express following a capital infusion to secure it a strong credit rating as a stand-alone company. Although the banks do not provide figures for the amount of capital committed to non-US markets, or their overseas profits, most confirm that international operations have become a far more significant part of their businesses. Commenting on the amount of capital that Lehman has tied up in European markets, Mr Berger said: 'In the mid-1980s, it would have been 5-10 per cent of the (total) capital. Now, it is much, much more.' Although Europe might see a further small increase in headcount, he added, the bank was shifting its focus to Asia - in part using profits from Europe to grow the business in the faster-growing financial markets there.</p>

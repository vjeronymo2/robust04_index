			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mezzanine Capital pays special 4p interim MEZZANINE Capital &amp; Income Trust 2001 has declared a special interim dividend of 4p per income share. This follows the flotation of one of its investments, American Safety Razor, on the Nasdaq exchange. The US group issued payment-in-kind notes as part of a financial restructuring last year. As the PIKs were not cash, MCIT cut its interim dividend last year. However, MCIT has received a repayment of Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 4.87m) as part of the flotation, including repayment of the PIKs, and is accordingly making a special distribution. The flotation values MCIT's equity stake in American Safety Razor at Dollars 2.9m, compared with the balance sheet valuation of Dollars 1.5m. MCIT has also made a further investment, of about Dollars 9m, in debt and other securities of LePage Industries.</p>

The  warning was issued in case Skopje increases its provocations  against Athens.    Following Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's statement  Thursday [10 February] night at the presidential palace  regarding the end of dialogue with Skopje, the government  spokesman yesterday spoke with equally strong language when he  issued a harsh warning to Skopje.    The government reminded [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov  that the recent international recognitions of his state do not  diminish for Skopje the importance of normalizing relations with  Greece at all. [passage omitted]    In this way, the government is attempting to send a message  in "two directions:"    First, to the government of Skopje not to continue  provocative statements or actions due to the "comfort" of the  recent recognitions.    Second, to the international community to refrain from  encouraging Skopje by taking further actions that would actually  force the Greek Government to harden its stance toward Skopje.    Yesterday the government spokesman repeated that "there is  no  sense in a dialogue" if Skopje does not show specific and  practical signs of satisfying the Greek conditions.    However, the government is not willing at this time to  indicate what moves and measures it intends to take to pressure  Skopje.    However, the government's policy in the diplomatic and  economic fields is already under review and reform, but with no  specific indications as to how it will move, except to say there  is a "specific time limit" to its patience.    For his part, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou  yesterday insisted on the need to review Greece's policy toward  Skopje. Replying to criticism by the opposition regarding the  dangers of ending the dialogue, he described the prime  minister's statement in this regard as a "rhetorical phrase."  [passage omitted]</p>

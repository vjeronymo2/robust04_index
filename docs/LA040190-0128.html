			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD ALLIES GO TO WAR OVER REMAP;  </P> <P> POLITICS: LEAGUE'S STAND IN FAVOR OF A COMMISSION TO REDRAW DISTRICTS HAS THE  DEMOCRATS FUMING.  </P> <P> State Democratic lawmakers have declared war on the state League of Women  Voters. The staunchly nonpartisan group, a frequent Democratic ally on  public-policy issues, is allied with Republicans in backing a reapportionment  measure that Democrats hate.  </P> <P> The league got directly involved in the reapportionment issue last June, when  it endorsed Proposition 119. Authored by San Mateo County Supervisor Tom  Huening, a Republican, the June ballot measure would take redistricting power  from the Legislature and give it to a 12-member commission. Retired  appellate-court justices would appoint the commission members -- five  Democrats, five Republicans and two independents. Racial, ethnic, gender and  geographic diversity would be required.  </P> <P> As do the Democrats, the league opposes Proposition 118, which would keep  redistricting in the hands of legislators. It likes Proposition 119 because it  is "partisan neutral" and political power is shifted from officeholders to  voters.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders in Washington and California don't see reapportionment in  anything but partisan terms, since their legislative control is on the line. To  protect themselves, they have mounted a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat  both reapportionment measures.  </P> <P> Essentially, Democrats contend that Proposition 119 would let big money and  special interests shape the post-census political map. Their agents would be  the judges who'd appoint the commission, or "mostly old white men," to use  Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's description.  </P> <P> Its endorsement of Proposition 119 has clearly tarnished the league's luster in  Democratic circles. At a recent women's forum in Ontario on redistricting,  Brown implied that the League of Women Voters should stay in the kitchen where  it belongs. Since last summer, Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento have  unmercifully dumped on the organization's 17-year lobbyist, Margaret Herman.  "I've never seen anything like it," she says.  </P> <P> Michael Galizio, Brown's chief of staff, refused to meet with Herman to discuss  some policy issues on the ground that the league is "too partisan." Assemblyman  Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), Brown's chief remapping deputy, said many  colleagues were surprised at the league's "naivete" and "Alice in Wonderland"  attitude in backing Proposition 119. "The league," said Katz, "has sold out to  the GOP."  </P> <P> All this has fostered a move within the league to reconsider its support for  Proposition 119. A letter discrediting the commission idea is currently being  circulated.  </P> <P> But league president Carole Wagner Vallianos said that she would not hesitate  to go to court to defend her group's nonpartisan reputation. She has challenged  Speaker Brown to a debate on the pros and cons of Proposition 119.  </P> <P> How did Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein come upon the idea  to use Richard Nixon to fend off John Van de Kamp's negative TV ad assault and  call for a positive campaign?  </P> <P> Feinstein chose the Nixon "smear" metaphor after hearing the reaction of old  political war horse Hadley Roff, an aide, to a Van de Kamp speech last month in  San Jose. The attorney general linked Feinstein to convicted Sacramento  legislator Joseph Montoya and the crimes of ex-Philippine dictator Ferdinand  Marcos.  </P> <P> "That sounds like Nixon smearing Douglas," said Roff, referring to the 1950  U.S. Senate campaign. Nixon christened Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas the "Pink  Lady" for her allegedly leftist views.  </P></p>

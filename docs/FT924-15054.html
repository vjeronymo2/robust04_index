			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Hanson transmits mixed signals: Maggie Urry outlines the confusing clash of styles which the RHM offer represents The problem with Hanson is that it cannot behave in the 1990s the way it did in the 1980s. That is how one shareholder of the Anglo-American conglomerate characterises the challenge facing the group and its management. If the 1980s was the era of swashbuckling takeover bids and shrewd disposals, the 1990s may prove to be a period of fewer opportunities and more nose-to-the-grindstone work in running the businesses it owns. Hanson can no longer bid for companies as large as itself. When the results for the financial year just ended are published in December, they will confirm that the group's unbroken profit record has finally ended. The Pounds 780m cash offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall, announced on Monday, looks like a throw-back to 1980s Hanson style. That adds to the apparent confusion surrounding the strategy which Hanson proclaimed to analysts at a meeting in February. There was a feeling that Hanson was stung into greater openness about its plans by the hostile reaction when it took a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries in May last year. The strategy was described as concentrated on running and expanding the group's core businesses and making disposals of some of the peripheral activities. It was portrayed as a significant change of direction, if not by the group itself, certainly by commentators. It was taken to mean that Hanson was no longer a trader in assets, but an industrial group dedicated to building and managing businesses which would remain with the company. As such, one Hanson follower in the City insists the offer for RHM 'drives a coach and horses through that strategy'. Others say that in any case they had not believed the company had changed its spots. The message coming from Hanson headquarters is that its fundamental aim of enhancing shareholder value has never changed, and the offer for RHM follows that strategy. Further, Hanson admits, the word 'core' was perhaps used loosely, although it appeared again on Monday when RHM was offered the chance to become 'a new core business to Hanson'. Mr Derek Bonham, appointed this year as chief executive of the UK side of the group, says 'core to us means a significant market sector which we think is capable of responding to our management style'. It does not mean that such a business will never be sold. Nor that the existing list of core businesses cannot be extended. Hanson must blame itself if outsiders do not understand what the company is up to. For years, the group kept aloof from the City, giving shareholders little information about the business, such as where profits came from. Lord Hanson boasted an unbroken record of profits growth since he started the business in 1963, and basked in the headlines about his latest daring deal. That was enough, in the good times, to keep the share rating up. That does not work when times are tougher. The shares began to underperform the stock market in 1990 and the rating has slipped until the group's paper is now too lowly valued to allow it to be used for a takeover bid without diluting earnings. What Hanson failed to do in the good times was to emphasise the management's skills in turning around badly managed businesses and improving margins. Now it says that, for example, profits at Imperial Tobacco, acquired in 1986, have doubled in five years. However, until recently, such information was hard to unearth from published statements. Mr Bonham says: 'We cannot be seen to be serious managers of businesses if we do not tell people what we are doing.' That signals the greater disclosure in last year's accounts and in filings made in the US, including a breakdown of profits by activity. However, investors are still sometimes confronted by one-off profits; for instance, that on the sale of the Newmont Mining stake which appeared in the 1991 figures. They are also bewildered by such intricacies as interest received from cash balances held offshore and the use of acquisition accounting. Investors would rather see a lower level of repeatable earnings than higher profits from 'funnies'. If Hanson did not give enough emphasis to its managerial skills in the 1980s, it has recently gone too far the other way, in making a hostile bid such as that for RHM seem unlikely. Mr Bonham says that in the 1980s it was enough to take opportunities on behalf of its shareholders. In the 1990s, he believes, it is necessary to make stronger overtures to the target company's board, as Hanson has done to RHM.  -----------------------------------------------               OPERATING PROFITS  -----------------------------------------------                          1992          1991 Six months to Mar      (Pounds m)   (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------- Coal mining               69           65 Chemicals                 46           72 Material handling         18           20 Gold mining               18           23 Tobacco                  131          124 Aggregates                 9           27 Forest Products           34           13 House Building            17            - Other                    122          115  ----------------------------------------------- Total                    464          459  -----------------------------------------------</p>

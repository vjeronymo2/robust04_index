			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Issaias Afewerki by </F> Ahmad Hasan Dahli in Asmara; date not given: "We Will Enact the  Press Law, Submit a Draft Constitution, and Open the Door to  Party Pluralism" -- first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH  introduction ]    [Text] The Eritrean People's Liberation Front held its  third organizational conference on the 10th of last month in the  city of Nakfa, at a time when the country is passing through a  highly sensitive political period, now that independence has  been proclaimed and voted upon. Following the conference,  AL-HAYAH conducted a wide-ranging interview with Eritrean  President Issaias Afewerki, in which he addressed the difficult  economic conditions, political pluralism, the border crisis with  Sudan, Eritrea's relations with the countries of the Horn of  Africa, the Red Sea, and Israel, and, finally, the reasons that  Western countries failed to keep their economic promises to  Eritrea on the eve of its independence.    The text of the interview follows:    [Dahli] What are the broad political features you have drawn  up for the coming years in your recent conference?    [Issaias] The country is now passing through a delicate  transitional period, and so broad political lines were drawn.  They will take shape in action within two years, starting now,  and until the establishment of a constitutional government that  will effectively end the transitional period and start a new  phase in which the features of the modern Eritrean state will  become clear at every political, economic, cultural, and social  level.    [Dahli] What, then, are the broad lines of the transitional  period?    [Issaias] The Eritrean Government will try, untiringly,  throughout this transition period, to relieve the troubles of  daily life and to plan a comprehensive economic policy that will  move the country onto a constitutional path to govern and  control political activity in the country.    [Dahli] What is the role of the People's Front in the  transitional phase?    [Issaias] This is the big question, which the conference did  not answer satisfactorily or comprehensively.    [Dahli] What about the nature of the relations between the  Front and the government?    [Issaias] We will create a practical and not only a  theoretical divide between the two sides, so that we do not fall  into the problem of duplication in bearing responsibility, and  also so that there will be no interference between Front matters  and government issues. Of course, it is hard to speak of a  definitive divide between the programs of the Front and the  government, because of the mutual assistance and integration  between the two entities.    [Dahli] Will you give us some idea of the economic policy  the  Eritrean government has enacted?    [Issaias] We have no magic formula ready that can lift  Eritrea out of its bad economic conditions to the level of the  developed countries. So we have decided to submit an economic  working paper for discussion before the end of the first half of  this year. We will submit it for inspection and revision before  adopting it offficially. I don't think I need to point out that  the 30-year war caused widespread destruction. Today we are  trying to follow a path for the country's economic development  in a local, regional, and international climate, and to say the  least, things are not encouraging.    [Dahli] Conference members elected no more than three former  members of the politburo of the People's Front to the executive  office (the highest authority) 16 commanders of the upper  echelons. How do you explain this?    [Issaias] The old leadership should never sit in the seats  of  the presidency. It is in their interest, and the interest of the  organization as well, to open the way for new leadership. All  there is to it, is that there must be careful renewal to prevent  any upset in the balance of the organization that could have  disastrous consequences. The positive thing as that everyone  wanted to avoid violent shocks, so that all agencies could carry  out their role normally, and in the context of sovereignty, of a  wave of principled and permanent renewal for the leadership.  This would be a fixed principle, limiting the candidacy of any  commander of one center to a single time.    [Dahli] What is the purpose of that?    [Issaias] This decision, which appears to be mandatory, is  intended to open the field for rising generations, so that they  may in turn take up leadership positions. True, there were those  who objected to this, saying, "How can we do without people who  have long experience and great expertise and depend on youths  who lack expertise and experience?"    [Dahli] So what is the solution?    [Issaias] The solution lies in not burning bridges and then  jumping through the air. We do not want to find ourselves face  to face with an unknown fate. The wisest thing is a compromise  that provides for continuity without tampering with the spirit  of the principle of specifying the leadership in all  institutions, being on guard against falling into deadlock,  bankruptcy, and an inability to understand events, to say  nothing of the spirit of the age.  <H5>  Ramadan's Position Ideal </H5>   [Dahli] In the context of the process of renewing the  leadership to which I alluded, what is your view of (Politburo  member and former minister in the local government) Ramadan  Muhammad Nur's position in the conference, and his demand to be  dismissed from any leadership position in the organization?    [Issaias] People's selfishness often prevents them from  adopting the ideal position that our brother has taken. This  ideal position should not be confined to a specific individual.  We must establish it as a means of action in this organization  to maintain the vitality and dynamism of the body and soul of  the People's Front.    I am not sure that all the people understand the  significance  of what our brother Ramadan Muhammad Nur meant to proclaim to  the Eritrean people and all the members of the conference.    [Dahli] What was the significance of that message?    [Issaias] Renewal is the norm in life, applied equally to  him  and to others. Brother Ramadan's courageous step will benefit  many, including me. One distinctive thing is that one notes the  unhappiness of some individuals of lower rank than Ramadan  because no one nominated them, or because they did not win any  leadership position. What a difference between the two  positions!    [Dahli] What is the meaning of the opening of the People's  Front conference to the participation of most of the factions of  the former Eritrean revolution, of whom we may name Muhammad  Sa'id Nawid (President of the Executive Committee of the  Eritrean Liberation Front-Unified Organization), Hiruy Tedla  Bairu (President of the Eritrean People's Democratic Movement),  Idris Galaydos, Taha Nur (member of the Supreme Council of the  Eritrean Liberation Front [ELF], Muhammad Nur Ahmad (responsible  for foreign relations in the Eritrean Liberation  Front-Revolutionary Council), and others?    [Issaias] We tried as much as possible to broaden  participation. It is very unfortunate that the result did not  come up to our aspirations and expectations.    [Dahli] Why?    [Issaias] I do not want to lay the blame on one particular  side. I hope that those who did not heed our call the last time  will do so the next time. The door of participation is open to  whomever wishes to take part in the battle to rebuild the  country.    [Dahli] What will your position be towards those who differ  with you fundamentally?    [Issaias] From now on there must be no disputes left over  from the residue of the war of liberation phase. The reopening  of old disputes can only be a waste of time and effort. But if  there is a difference over the method of hastening the process  of rebuilding the country, or over the manner of establishing  national unity, then this by any standards would be considered a  kindness, because it benefits the country and its citizens.    [Dahli] So that we can be clearer--is the participation you  are talking about confined to the People's Front and the  Eritrean Government, or does it extend outside them? I mean, to  form opposition parties?    [Issaias] We have a great desire to expand the scope of  participation in the context of the Front, and outside it. We do  acknowledge the right to establish political parties, subject to  certain conditions, so that parties will not be founded without  objective justifications. When I say this, I am not speaking  from ignorance, but from experience, the experience of several  neighboring countries and other Third World countries I am  thinking of.    [Dahli] In past years, the People's Front vehemently denied  the existence of a secret Marxist party within it. In this  conference, you revealed the existence of this party. My  question is: When was this party founded, and why was it  disbanded at the end of 1989, as you said?    [Issaias] The party had deep roots, going back to 1966, the  year I traveled to China for a training course with Brother  Ramadan Muhammad Nur.    [Dahli] What was the identity of this party?    [Issaias] The goal of the party was to spread progressive  ideas in Eritrea, which was plagued by traditional, worn-out  political ideas, which hindered the process of launching the  Eritrean revolution, and prolonged the suffering of the people  during the war of liberation.    Attempts to establish the party were met with conditions of  prolonged sacrifice after our return to Eritrea before it took  on its official stamp in 1970, in the city of Aden in what was  then South Yemen. That event coincided, as is well known, with  the appearance of the popular liberation forces, which held  their organizational conference in the area of Sedduha'ila [name  as transliterated] in the Dankalia region, in the extreme south  of the country.    [Dahli] What reasons led you to disband the party at the end  of 1989?    [Issaias] When we reached the firm conclusion that there  were  no fundamental differences dividing the members of the People's  Front and those of that party, we decided to disband it, to  avoid getting into the predicament of duplication, and to  prevent party members and the rest of the base of the Front  creating problems from nothing.    [Dahli] What standards were used in choosing party members?    [Issaias] We had secret cells studying the readiness of this  or that person to enlist under the party's banner.    [Dahli] What were your relations with the leadership of the  secret Marxist Labor Party that existed inside the ELF?    [Issaias] There were several secret meetings between the  leaders of the two parties with the objective of uniting them as  a prelude to the uniting of the two fronts, the ELF and the  People's Front. It became clear in our meetings that there were  no essential conflicts in our general proposals.    [Dahli] In spite of that, no unity was effected between the  parties. To the contrary, Eritrea was the scene of ruinous civil  wars. Why did that happen?    [Issaias] In my view, the leadership of the Labor Party in  the ELF was dealing with Marxism on the basis of opportunism,  totally unrelated to the ideology as an ideology.    [Dahli] Did the dissolution of the party coincide with the  fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet  Union by coincidence, or was there a cause-and-effect relation  between the two events?    [Issaias] There was no cause-and-effect relation between the  two issues. We reviewed events, and our ideological positions  with the end of 1978, when the Soviet Union, former South Yemen,  and the progressive forces in the Palestinian revolutionary  factions aligned themselves with the enemies of our revolution.  We had considered them strategic allies, and included them in  our ranks in our political party schools.    [Dahli] Did your ideological position change with the Soviet  Union's change of policy vis-a-vis your revolution?    [Issaias] No. It was not that easy or that simple. Without  going into too much detail, we may say that starting that day we  freed ourselves from rigid and sterile ideological positions,  and adopted a realistic, pragmatic policy in our dealing both  with the situation in Eritrea and with the outside world.    [Dahli] Now that so many historical changes have taken  place,  what remains of your progressive ideas, not to say your Marxist  ideas?    [Issaias] I say without any hesitation: social justice.  Because the liberation of territory, raising the national flag,  and saluting the national anthem, despite their significance,  mean nothing to ordinary Eritreans without social justice, which  fills in the gap between the narrow stratum of the rich, and the  broad sector of the poor.    [Dahli] In the closing session of the conference, you said,  "after the liberation of our nation, and still now, we notice a  deficiency in the balance of members of the People's Front,  prevailing doubts about them, and their loss of confidence in  themselves. They stumble around at random. The People's Army,  the backbone of the People's Front, still has doubts about its  future and has become prey to many uncertainties and bewildered  doubts. This is because it no longer has any clear vision amid  the vague positions in all its movements." How did things come  to this dangerous pass?    [Issaias] It is a very thorny issue, and it requires study  in  depth by sociologists and psychologists. A 30-year war cannot  pass without leaving profound effects on the individuals who  emerged 100-percent safe from decades of war with all their  tears, blood, and psychological wounds. Yesterday all the people  were in one trench with the enemy before them and the drone of  airplanes above them, with no options other than life or  martyrdom. Today the situation is different, there are more  things to worry about. There is a great vacuum. There are family  problems: the fighters' families and the martyrs' families. The  government has found itself faced with problems with no  beginning or end, and has no money, because the colonialist  Ethiopian regimes that had seized Eritrea destroyed not only its  economy, but sucked out all the benefits this people might have  enjoyed. This people has lost everything, and won peace at the  end of it all. Peace makes excellent capital, beyond price, and  needs time to bear its fruit.  <H5>  Demobilization of the Army </H5>   [Dahli] Last year you demobilized the first batch of the  Eritrean Army, estimated at about 100,000 men. Are the problems  of the discharged men easier to bear than those of the remainder  still serving in the military?    [Issaias] I have no definitive answer to this question,  because it goes back to the difference in problems that affected  the demobilized men and the others. The ones demobilized from  the army were the most recently conscripted into military  service--about three years. This eased the process of their  return to civilian life, compared with people who had spent long  decades in the army.    In addition, the great majority of those demobilized were  peasants, and their problem now is that they do not want to go  back to the land and resume their old trades.    One may note that one cannot change his way of life without  taking on something new. What made this more difficult is that  the small minority of the demobilized who went back to their  farms--and we provided them with modern equipment--endured  profound psychological frustration when faced with the drought  that swept Eritrea in the last growing season and threatened  people with starvation. Despite that, the decision to demobilize  them is seen as a positive one in the final analysis, not  because they reduced the army's burden, but because they are no  longer dependants, but are relying on themselves in overcoming  life's difficulties.    [Dahli] The question of land took up much of the heated  discussions inside the conference before the resolution was made  that "the land is the property of the state." My question is,  aren't you afraid that this resolution will lead to trouble?    [Issaias] That resolution was moral more than practical.    [Dahli] So, what will happen practically?    [Issaias] We want to review the method for distributing land  in Eritrea, not with the aim of enacting superficial  resolutions, but to exploit arable lands in a sensible and  practical manner. The manner that people are used to gives no  thought to the scope of a region's needs, or a district's, and  sometimes is limited to the family. Add to that the fact that  cultivation is arbitrary, passed down from father to son,  primitive, and barely remunerative. So all we want to do is put  the land in the service of society, after preparing an accurate  scientific study, and providing modern equipment and all kinds  of fertilizers, so that the Eritrean peasantry may supply his  own needs as well as those of the Eritrean markets. Then we may  think about what surplus produce may be exported abroad. Here I  may point out that four decades ago Eritrea exported all kinds  of fruits and vegetables as well as meat to several Middle  Eastern countries and Europe. We can do so again, to some  extent, in a short time, if we pool our efforts and get  technical and other assistance from friendly countries.  <H5>  Merchants' Complaints </H5>   [Dahli] Every single Eritrean merchant is today complaining  of the tax burden imposed on him by the government, to the  degree that some say their slim profits are used to pay the  government tax bill. What is your respnse?    [Issaias] This isn't just in Eritrea. In every country in  the  world merchants cry and complain about the terrible tax burden.  In Eritrea's case, I firmly believe that there is a certain  exaggeration in the volume of merchant complaints. I have heard  the merchants' complaints because their voices are loud, and  that is because they control the markets. The simple consumers,  on the other hand, complain of price-gouging and hardly anyone  hears them.    [Dahli] A merchant might say that he is compelled to raise  prices to match the increased taxes imposed on him by the  government.    [Issaias] I don't think so. Taxes are not imposed  arbitrarily. They are calculated after a field study.    [Dahli] Some merchants think taxes have hurt the country's  one source of income, since there are no other sources.    [Issaias] No. That is inaccurate, since taxes make up only  15  percent of the state budget.    We are now in the process of considering eliminating taxes  on  basic commodities and raising them on nonessential goods such as  cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. These ideas may help people,  but will not solve their root problems.    [Dahli] Why?    [Issaias] Because Eritrea is still relying on old factories,  using imported fuels, and using a great deal of electricity.  This means high prices for our local products, which we cannot  impose on domestic markets over imported goods. This is a very  hard dilemma that cannot be solved overnight.    [Dahli] Where have the raw materials disappeared to--the  gold, oil, natural gas, uranium, and other things that the  Eritrean Front's pamphlets spoke of before independence?    [Issaias] I am extremely cautious about what is said about  the existence of minerals in commercial quantities in Eritrea.    [Dahli] Why?    [Issaias] We don't want to give people ideas about things we  aren't sure exist.    [Dahli] But there are civil studies conducted by Italian  experts between the world wars. And the Ethiopian Government  gave oil concessions to foreign countries--etc.    [Issaias] True, some foreign companies did surveying and  exploring in the era of the Derg, which proved the existence of  natural gas in substantial quantities. But with oil, no one  knows now whether it's there in commercial quantities, or very  limited quantities.    [Dahli] Have you signed agreements with foreign companies to  explore for oil?    [Issaias] We are in the process now. The surveying process,  then exploitation, will take some time. The trouble is that  people are in a hurry.    In addition, we are currently reviewing the contracts the  colonial Ethiopian authorities signed with international  commercial establishments, which are trying to monopolize the  Eritrean market at the expense of other companies. It is in our  interest to open the door to global competition among all  companies before giving concession rights to this one instead of  that one.    The important thing, in my view, is that Eritrea possesses  considerable agricultural possibilities and priceless marine  resources, but, unfortunately Third World countries have a  tendency to dream about oil wells as the solution to their  problems.    [Dahli] There appear to be many obstacles preventing foreign  companies from working directly in Eritrea.    [Issaias] As you can see for yourself, we don't have paved  roads, or modern rapid communications, nor even electrical  power--etc. All these affect the start-up of large projects.  <H5>  The Press and Opposition Parties </H5>   [Dahli] The question of economic development is linked to  political stability. Do you have a specific timetable for the  implementation of political pluralism, which can open the way to  broad participation in all fields?    [Issaias] The important thing, the central thing, in my  view,  is that the conference members confirmed the principle of  political pluralism. Translating it into reality requires  objective terms. Thus it is difficult to specify a timetable for  the formation of opposition parties.    [Dahli] There are Eritrean leaders abroad expressing their  desire to establish parties. Where do you stand on this?    [Issaias] So far there is no desire to form parties with the  people who are active in some Arab and Western countries. The  whole has to do with some elements who still have mentalities of  the past, stuck to the legacy of the ELF.    [Dahli] What do you mean by the legacy of the ELF?    [Issaias] I mean this or that group or so-and-so's group.  These issues have been outrun by the historical events of the  Eritrean revolution, which has changed the traditional structure  of Eritrean society, which had been dominated by tribal,  regional, and sectarian logic. Now it has reached a progressive  phase after three whole decades of warfare.    [Dahli] What would your conditions be for any party to  pursue  its political activity officially?    [Issaias] I do not want to get ahead of events, but in  general, and in order to safeguard Eritrea's national unity and  Eritrean political independence, we believe it is essential for  parties to be independent of direct and indirect outside  influence. Nor should they be founded on religious, ethnic,  regional, or tribal bases.    These are the redlines that must be respected. It does not  mean that there can be no discussion of this very sensitive  issue. On the contrary, discussion will be initiated, so that  Eritreans can give their views on every single issue.    [Dahli] How can that happen, when the very few media in the  country are under government control?    [Issaias] MODERN ERITREA, the only official newspaper  published in Arabic and Tigrinya, has worked hard from the  beginning to open its columns to Eritrean writers in a limited  fashion. Thus the dialogue that is underway, I think, cannot  continue without a law for the freedom of the press, which will  be introduced in the next few days. Only then can the provisions  of the Constitution, the laws, and party rules be discussed. It  will be up to the Eritreans to draw the broad lines of the  modern state.    [Dahli] Will there be laws regulating the freedom of the  press?    [Issaias] One cannot allow things to take a rambling course.  There have to be rules.    [Dahli] Such as?    [Issaias] Not tampering with national unity; the avoidance  of  cursing; and avoiding vituperative and litigious methods, to the  greatest extent possible. In return, we will reconsider  erroneous decisions, expose negative stands, and bring citizens'  complaints and expectations into the open. And, in line with  neighboring countries' experiences with press freedom, we will  permit no foreign funding for our local newspapers, to eliminate  foreign disruptions.    [Dahli] Does that mean that the government will provide  material support to the independent newspapers?    [Issaias] We are working on providing the needed technical  equipment. The mere implementation of the law on the freedom of  the press is not enough for a press free of foreign influence.  Rules must be provided for their independence, to protect the  role of the press, to guarantee its freedom in the service of  the Eritrean people, which for long decades has been deprived of  its most basic rights for an honorable life. Add to that the  fact that we in Eritrea, even until now, do not have a single  daily newspaper. MODERN ERITREA, as you can see, is published  biweekly, on Wednesday and Saturday. How would it be when the  multiparty law is enacted, with every party trying to publish  its own newspapers and magazines?  <H5>  The"Jihad" and Sudan </H5>   [Dahli] Why have the fraternal relations between Eritrea and  Sudan deteriorated so badly? Why were diplomatic methods not  used, to avoid the glare of the media?    [Issaias] To start with, I would like to reconfirm that the  stand of the National Islamic Front [NIF] led by Dr. Hasan  al-Turabi, which supports the right to self-determination of the  Eritrean people, and its right to armed struggle, has been  clear. There is no doubt about it, compared with the positions  of the rest of Sudan's vacillating parties. What is also certain  is that the growth and development of the Eritrean [Islamic]  Jihad Movement was thanks to the NIF, for its own mistaken  sectarian calculations.    [Dahli] That has not stopped you from establishing relations  with the NIF.    [Issaias] We had an ongoing dialogue with the NIF  leadership,  and we did all we could to persuade them of the futility of  supporting an Islamic jihad movement in a society like  Eritrea's, made up of equal numbers of Muslims and Christians.  Regrettably, we got no compliance from our Sudanese brothers in  this regard.    [Dahli] To what do you attribute that?    [Issaias] In my opinion, there are hardline factions within  the NIF, which think they can use the "Islamic movement" to  pressure not only Eritrea, but Uganda as well, and Kenya,  Ethiopia, and Yemen.    And it is not just a question of just the NIF. There are  also  the Ansar al-Sunnah [Supporters of the Tradition], supported by  other Arabs, who are trying to use Islam for political aims here  and there. To answer the second part of your question, I state  that we in the Eritrean Government have provided our Sudanese  brothers, whether in the government or the NIF, with the  locations and names of the Jihad elements on Sudanese soil, so  that appropriate measures can be taken, but to no avail. In the  end, this only put a cloud over relations between the two  countries.    [Dahli] What was the Sudanese response to your memorandums?    [Issaias] There were short-lived promises, with which we  could not be patient forever, especially after the incident of  16 December, when Eritrean and foreign elements infiltrated  western Eritrea from camps located inside Sudan, and fought with  our forces, which wiped out every single one of them. The  Sudanese regime knows better than anyone that we have held our  peace over several things, and looked the other way in many  instances, and at a time when the world was accusing it of  supporting global fundamentalist terrorist movements.    [Dahli] Do I understand from what you are saying that the  Eritrean Government has lost all hope of restoring fraternal  relations with Sudan to their natural state?    [Issaias] Being eager not to blow this up, or get things to  a  point that would have bad consequences for the two countries, we  brought up the subject of Sudan's interference in Eritrea's  internal affairs at the United Nations, without bringing things  to a head with the ruling regime in Khartoum. We hope that  Sudan's rulers will come to their senses and stop playing with  fire.    [Dahli] Are you optimistic about this?    [Issaias] Regrettably, no.    [Dahli] Why?    [Issaias] Because a few hours ago, I learned that one of our  officials at our consulate in Kassala was perfidiously  assassinated.    [Dahli] What is the meaning of that incident?    [Issaias] It is part of a plan aimed at escalating the  crisis.    [Dahli] What is the Sudanese regime's interest in that?    [Issaias] Sudan has no interest in it. The problem is that  the Sudanese power in Khartoum has lost its balance and lost its  credibility in dealing with friends. It is acting irresponsibly,  and this lowers our morale, because we were hoping to build a  unified economic market including Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia,  to expand to the rest of the IGAD [Inter-Government Authority on  Drought] countries: Uganda, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. It  would then bring in all the Red Sea basin countries, most  importantly Yemen.  <H5>  Yemeni Participation </H5>   [Dahli] A few days ago, you visited Sanaa and Aden, and  talked to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They, for their part, visited  Asmara after signing a "pledge and accord" document last month.  What is your assessment of Eritrean-Yemeni relations in light of  all this?    [Issaias] Relations between the Yemeni and Eritrean peoples  are nothing new. They have deep roots in ancient history. The  Red Sea, which separates the shores of the two countries by 14  miles, was and still is a bridge and contact point between the  people of both countries. We are striving with all our power to  strengthen the ties between our two peoples to serve our mutual  interests.    [Dahli] What is your view of the current crisis threatening  to destroy the union from within?    [Issaias] The union between the two parts of Yemen is a  popular demand that cannot be neglected. But our brothers became  swept up for emotional reasons and without serious study  established a merged union, and the result was a formal,  superficial unity, without the merger of the military, security,  or media institutions. Etc. Now the people are enduring  hardships caused by unrealistic steps. There is no shame in  that, if the situation is understood before it is too late, but  the unfortunate thing is that there are political forces here  and there trying to incite discord to strike at the union and  prevent the emergence of a strong, unified Yemeni state to play  a prominent role in shaping events in the southern Red Sea, the  southern Arabian peninsula, and the northwest Indian Ocean.    I have great hope that our brothers in Yemen will implement  what they agreed on in Oman, to emerge from the current crisis,  and block the way of the enemies of unity and the Yemeni people.  <H5>  Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia </H5>   [Dahli] Djibouti, your neighbor for three years, is  currently  going through political and military crises. How do you view the  situation there after your visit, and your talks with President  Hassan Gouled Aptidon?    [Issaias] Djibouti's old and new problems stem from the lack  of a development plan that takes into consideration the rights  and interests of the Issa, Afar, Arab, and Somali communities,  and that allows them to participate in the government and the  revolution on an equal footing with the country's other  citizens.    [Dahli] What about Ethiopia?    [Issaias] Throughout the colonial era, Eritrea was  organically linked to the Ethiopian economy, and, as we see, the  Eritrean Government is still using the Ethiopian currency, the  birr.    Our policy toward Ethiopia is the same as that toward all  the  countries of the Horn of Africa. This is due to our conviction  that the liberation of all the peoples of this region must be  total, or it will not be at all.    [Dahli] At the beginning of this month, General Mohamed  Farah  Aidid visited Asmara, and at the end of this same month the  American forces will leave Somalia. How do you view the future  of this Arab-African country?    [Issaias] To start with, I want to point out and emphasize  Somalia's role in the course of the Eritrean revolution, from  its beginnings up until its triumph. Somalia is the only country  that offered us all it had and never wavered one inch in its  position supporting our struggle, not over long years, not when  there was bloodshed. It should come as no surprise that we have  tried, to the best of our ability, to relieve the sufferings of  our Somali brothers.    Going back to your question, I may say that the Somalis have  learned a great deal from their destructive wars, nor do I think  they wish to bring the former nightmare scenario back to this  poor country. The withdrawal of the UN forces will leave a  vacuum at first, and that might give rise to some small  incidents, but those forces must leave Somalia for good. They  led to the creation of problems that had no beginning and will  have no end, compared with the problems they solved, or that  they originally came to solve.    [Dahli] The role of the UN forces in Somalia was, then, in  your view, a negative one?    [Issaias] It was not only negative, it actually hampered the  forging of a national accord among the Somalis.    [Dahli] Some Somali factions accuse the Eritrean Government  of aligning with General Aidid. What is your response?    [Issaias] If there is any Somali authority we align  ourselves  with, it is Somalia itself, and the Somali people--that is all.    [Dahli] You have spoken of the problems of all the states in  the Horn of Africa. Does that mean that the future of this  region is murky?    [Issaias] In spite of all the problems that each of the  countries of the Horn of Africa has experienced, and is still  experiencing, the eyes, hearts, and minds of their peoples are  on the day when everyone will work side by side to build a  bright future for future generations. This is the thing that  never ceases to nurture hope in their hearts.    [Dahli] Where do Eritrean-Saudi relations stand?    [Issaias] In light of the historic relations between the  Eritrean and Saudi peoples, bilateral relations between Asmara  and Riyadh are developing in a very positive fashion. Saudi  Arabia has great influence and a distinctive role among the  peoples of the Red Sea basin.    [Dahli] What are the dimensions of your relations with  Israel?    [Issaias] Ordinary relations between one country and another  located in the same region and the same sea. I believe that  after the solution of the Palestinian question, all the problems  about dealing with the Jewish state will disappear. The  political map of the Middle East region will see a radical  change when there are routine diplomatic relations between  Israel and Syria, and the rest of the countries of the region.    [Dahli] We have heard about promises of Western aid, but  have  seen no actual projects. What happened?    [Issaias] The Gulf states, especially the United Arab  Emirates and Kuwait, and the countries of the European Common  Market, are studying practical projects whose implementation  will begin very soon.    [Dahli] What about the United States?    [Issaias] Washington has offered us food aid, but for  reasons  having to do with their own policies, they are not, so far,  taking part in any construction or developmental project.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Shanghaied by Chinese shrimps - Kieran Cooke admits murder but claims there were mitigating circumstances I AVOID dark places. I never swim. In restaurants, I always sit with my back to the wall, facing the door. A posse from POSS is after me. POSS, the Protection of Shrimps Society, is deeply upset. My crime? Eating shrimps. Live. While kicking and screaming, their little black ball eyes still quivering. A trial has been called for. At the very least, I am in for a ticklish assault by a thousand shrimps. It is not a pleasant prospect. I plead guilty to the charge, but there are mitigating circumstances. My crime was not premeditated. The shrimps forced themselves on me. There were also deep confusions of language and culture. It was in China - Shanghai to be precise. Lunchtime, and hunger is gnawing at the system. A likely, if slightly scruffy, restaurant on the corner. I navigate my way across the street. 'What', says the smiling lady of the restaurant, 'would you like?' My Shanghai dialect is a trifle rusty. I try a few words. A crowd gathers, trying helpfully to interpret. 'What is he talking about - has he a pain in his stomach?' 'Now he's waving his hands about. He's pretending to be a fish. Foreigners are peculiar.' Finally, the light dawned, or so I thought. Yes, I would have the soup, the fish, the dumplings and some rice. Everyone seemed overjoyed at this linguistic breakthrough. Handshakes and eternal friendship pledged between the Chinese and Irish peoples. I sit back and wait. The fish arrived, big enough to feed six, its gaping mouth stuffed delicately with coriander and baby tomatoes. The dumplings were next. Dumplings, or jiaozi, are something of a Shanghai speciality. Steamed or fried, dipped in a little chilli, they slip down the gullet with consummate ease. My stomach put up the green flag. All was well. Some thin slices of pork followed, served on a bed of stewed jellyfish. Just like eating rubber bands. Takes one back to one's schooldays. All remarkably good. Some soup - made out of chicken broth with wild mushrooms. The amber flag is going up. The stomach says it is reaching capacity. A gulp of the local, very good, beer to stabilise things. A traffic policeman sits down, wearily, at the next table. Poor man, he must go home each night with a thousand bicycle bells ringing in his head from Shanghai's 7m bicycles. A covered dish arrives. A few heads turn to watch. I lift the cover. And this is where the trouble with POSS started. Inside the dish were about 50 small, dark-looking shrimps. Not just alive, but doing trampoline exercises. Leaping and somersaulting all over. The restaurant lady darted forward quickly and replaced the cover. Shouldn't they be cooked, just a little? I asked. No, she said emphatically. These are a Shanghai speciality. If you even show them a wok, all their flavour will go. But how do I eat them? The lady obliged. You simply pick one up with your chopsticks, dip it in the sauce - a mixture of Chinese wine, dark sauce and chillis - and then bite it, just there, behind the head. Then you suck away, leaving behind only the shrimp's empty armour. Even the bicyled-out policeman had turned to watch. Too late to turn back now. A challenge. A stiff upper lip and firm grasp of chopsticks was called for. I lifted the cover. Shrimps cartwheeled out. I caught one and dipped it in the wine. Presumably, the shrimps are supposed to enter the next world happily sozzled. Not so this one. Halfway to the mouth he did a triumphant flip, flicking Chinese wine into my eye while disappearing somewhere behind my left ear. Guffaws from the restaurant. An old man wiped the tears from his eyes. A young girl giggled until her cheeks were ablaze. I tried again. Success. And here I have to make a terrible admission. The shrimps were very good. The best I have ever tasted. Sweet yet bold, with a heady piquancy about them. But eating all of them was a tiring business. The stomach had put up the red flag long ago, but no matter. To leave one shrimp would have been a grave gastronomic sin. Of course, none of this goes down well with the POSS gang. The consumption of live shrimps is all right, it seems, for the Shanghainese. But if the habit spreads to the west, then all of shrimp society, as we know it, could be undermined. I have sent POSS pleading letters. I was hungry, I said. I was ignorant. The shrimps were happily drunk. I have promised to confine my live shrimp-eating to Shanghai. I will not tell a soul about how wonderful it all was. But will POSS listen? I sense their little black eyes searching for me, their little legs swimming ever closer. They are an unforgiving lot.</p>

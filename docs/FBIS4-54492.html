			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report] </F>   [Text] Bratislava -- In a statement issued yesterday,  Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac states that he learned about  the motion by 35 deputies to recall him from the post of Slovak  deputy prime minister from radio yesterday at noon. He  expresses his unequivocal rejection of the accusations leveled  against him, which he considers absurd, also because he does not  know a single reason that prompted the deputies to come up with  their motion. He is convinced that this motion is part of the  unfair strategy pursued by a certain political entity, or  entities, whose aim is to discredit their political adversaries  at any price.    Slovak Prime Minister and Democratic Union of Slovakia  Chairman Jozef Moravcik said yesterday that he was not aware of  anything connected with the person of Deputy Prime Minister  Roman Kovac that would confirm "inability to cope with the post  of deputy prime minister, suspicion of attempted corruption, and  a faulty moral profile."    Speaking to a TA SR correspondent, T. Cabaj, chairman of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Club of Deputies, confirmed  that the movement availed itself of specific evidence bearing  out Roman Kovac's corruption. He added that they would submit  this evidence only at the extraordinary NRSR meeting that has  been called to deal with their motion.    Asked about the existence of documents that might serve as  evidence, K. Tothova, former minister of justice, said that she  did not know these documents.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The isolation of Serbia THE HORROR of the human tragedy provoked by Serbia, first in Croatia and more recently in Bosnia-Hercegovina, has at last persuaded the international community to take action. Predictably, critics now maintain that the sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council last Saturday have come much too late and should have been approved at least nine months ago. But the necessary consensus was not forthcoming at the time and the US, in particular, made it plain that it did not want to get involved in a far-off ethnic conflict which did not seem to threaten wider international security. There is little point now in pursuing the argument whether the European Community is more to blame for its incapacity to solve the Yugoslav crisis in the first place, or the US, for washing its hands of the whole affair until outraged domestic public opinion forced the Administration to change its mind. What is certain is that international solutions to crises of this magnitude still require the involvement and commitment of the only remaining superpower, the US. In spite of the mixed results that international sanctions have had in the past and the bluster of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, who boasts that the Serbian economy can survive in spite of them, there is every indication that sanctions will bite deep. This is particularly true of the oil embargo, given that Serbia is dependent for some 75 per cent of its oil needs on foreign suppliers such as Russia, China, Romania and Angola. In the circumstances, it is hard to see how its military effort can be maintained indefinitely, though civilian users of cars and fuel will probably be made to pay the biggest price to keep the military machine going. Popular opposition Equally important will be the effect that shortages, the inconvenience caused to travellers by the suspension of international flights and the disappointment for a football-obsessed people of seeing its team banned from the European championship finals in Sweden, will have on national morale and Mr Milosevic's political standing. The demonstration in Belgrade at the week-end by some 50,000 anti-war protesters was an indication that popular opposition to his policies is growing, at least in the capital. The peace movement in Serbia, however, is mainly middle class-based. It would be an illusion to believe that it finds much of an echo in the rural Serb and Montenegrin population, not least the Serbs in Bosnia, who look upon the Belgrade government as their main protector and champion. Indeed, Mr Milosevic is far from being his own man in Bosnia, where the leaders of ultra-nationalist irregular Serbian military units are even accusing him of being too soft. Perverse effect There is clearly a risk, therefore, that UN sanctions could have the perverse effect of giving a boost to Serbian nationalism. Even if the Belgrade government were to have a change of heart as the result of international pressure, regional nationalist groups might well decide to pursue their crusade. The Yugoslav partisans demonstrated during the Second World War how effective they were at guerrilla warfare. If the international community were to wait until Serbia is economically exhausted or Mr Milosevic is overthrown, it could wait for a very long time. Sanctions must be given a fair chance to bring Mr Milosevic to his senses, but if they fail, what then? International military action can no longer be ruled out as a longer term option. As in the Gulf crisis, such operations would have to be sanctioned by the Security Council, though they would probably have to be undertaken by surrogate organisations such as Nato or the Western European Union. Military action should be restricted to air strikes against strategic targets. It would be most unwise to contemplate sending ground forces, since they might become stuck in Yugoslavia indefinitely and suffer politically unacceptable losses. But whatever action is finally decided, it is essential that it should be taken by the international community as a whole including the US, which alone has the clout to bring transgressors of international law to heel. Anything less, as has been proved conclusively, is doomed to failure.</p>

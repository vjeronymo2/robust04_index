			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 23 Apr (NA) -- Senator Jose  Antonio Romero Feris has announced that he is going to run as a  candidate in the 1995 presidential elections. He will represent  the Autonomous Party and "all those who wish to join the banner  of a popular and federalist force."    The Corrientes Province senator, who already had made known  his intention of running through the placards that appeared  after his victory in that province in the 10 April elections,  said that with his candidacy he is seeking "to represent all  those who want a true opposition."    Romero Feris will begin his campaign at the national level  as  soon as his mandate with the Constituent Assembly concludes.  [passage omitted]</p>

The curfew and state of emergency were declared in the  capital on January 6, 1993 and were imposed on Kurgan-tyube,  Kulyab, and Kalininabad on March 30, 1993 to restore law and  order, guarantee the citizens safety, confiscate weapons from  illegal armed groups, curb pillage and other heinous crimes.    The curfew was in effect from midnight till dawn.    The state of emergency is still in force.    As Nikolay Majar, a senior interior ministry official, has  told Interfax, not later than January 6, 1994, the state of  emergency must be either lifted or prolonged since the decree on  it is valid only for up to one year.</p>

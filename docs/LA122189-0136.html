			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN TO GRANT CITIZENSHIP TO COLONY'S ELITE;  </P> <P> HONG KONG: LONDON'S PLAN APPLIES TO FEWER THAN 4% OF THE RESIDENTS. THE  'STRICTLY LIMITED' PROGRAM COMES UNDER IMMEDIATE ATTACK IN COMMONS.  </P> <P> In an admitted compromise between the lingering responsibilities of a lost  empire and the danger of ethnic unrest at home, the British government  announced Wednesday that it will grant full citizenship to fewer than 4% of  Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents before the colony reverts to Chinese rule in  1997.  </P> <P> The "strictly limited" program will extend to a maximum of 50,000 civil  servants, professional and business people whose service is determined under a  points system to be particularly valuable to Hong Kong, Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd said in a long-awaited statement to an angrily divided House of  Commons.  </P> <P> Including dependents, Hurd added, it means that an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong  residents would gain the right of British residence as a "safety net" against  the uncertainty of 1997's scheduled transfer of power.  </P> <P> The plan came under immediate attack from both the opposition Labor Party and  Hurd's fellow Conservative Party members.  </P> <P> Gerald Kaufman, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman, charged that the  government's approach "is not simply elitist and discriminatory, but . . . in  our view wrong in principle."  </P> <P> But Kaufman did not spell out what Labor would do instead, and the party has  never been specific on the issue either.  </P> <P> Even more bitter criticism, however, came in an attack by former Conservative  Party chairman and ex-Cabinet minister Norman Tebbit, who told Hurd that "I  disagreed with almost everything you said."  </P> <P> Tebbit represents a group of rebel Conservatives who see the government's plan  as a violation of party pledges that there would be no more large-scale  immigration into Britain.  </P> <P> While they have sharply different reasons for opposing the government plan,  there is a real prospect that Labor and the rebel Tories might successfully  block government legislation to implement the Hong Kong scheme, thus handing  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher an embarrassing legislative defeat.  </P> <P> Hurd stressed that the government's purpose is "not to encourage immigration  into this country, but to persuade to remain in Hong Kong those whom we need to  retain there if our last substantial colony is to pass successfully through the  final eight years of British rule."  </P> <P> The foreign secretary described the mood in the colony as "at a low ebb" after  the massacre of a pro-democracy demonstrator in Beijing last June and resulting  fears over the scheduled transfer of control of Hong Kong under the 1984  Sino-British Joint Declaration.  </P> <P> "The problem of confidence is shown by increasing emigration from the  territory, and increasing numbers of people who contemplate leaving," Hurd  said. He said 42,000 people have left Hong Kong this year and 55,000 more are  expected to follow in 1990.  </P> <P> "A growing proportion of these people are those whom Hong Kong can least afford  to lose," Hurd said. "This hemorrhage of talent puts at risk the  competitiveness of Hong Kong's economy, the efficiency of its public service,  the effectiveness of its education system -- in short, its future."  </P> <P> The Thatcher government is gambling that many of those who might otherwise  leave Hong Kong would not do so if assured that after the Chinese take over,  they would have the protection of British citizenship.  </P> <P> About 3.2 million of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents already hold either  British Dependent Territories Citizen or British National Overseas passports.  But neither document carries with it the right to live or work in Britain.  </P> <P> Some argue that Britain owes full citizenship to all Hong Kong's residents. But  Hurd said such a step would "create unacceptable strains here."  </P> <P> Fewer than 5% of Britain's 56 million citizens belong to ethnic minorities,  most of them Afro-Caribbeans and Asians. Still, an influential committee of  Parliament members said in a separate report issued Wednesday that "racism and  its most ugly manifestations -- racial attacks and harassment -- are still  frightening realities for many British citizens."  </P> <P> In an apparent concession to the Tory rebels, Hurd stressed that not all 50,000  "assurances" would be distributed immediately. He also promised that "the  scheme would cease by 1997."  </P> <P> Said the foreign secretary: "We have eventually worked out what we believe to  be the most sensible balance between our desire for good race relations and  harmony in our cities and our very strong feeling that we have a continuing  sense of responsibility to people in Hong Kong."  </P> <P> Addressing Tebbit, he added: "This is the last main chapter in the story of  this country's empire. I am rather keen, and I'm sure you are rather keen, that  the last chapter should not end in a shabby way."  </P> <P> In addition to their importance to Hong Kong and the extent to which people in  the same category of employment are emigrating, Hurd said, the 50,000 heads of  household covered under the plan will be selected according to length of  service and knowledge of the English language.  </P> <P> The government will introduce enabling legislation "at the earliest  opportunity," he promised.  </P> <P> Hurd also stressed that all Hong Kong's major trading partners have a strong  interest in the colony's continued stability. Now that Britain has taken the  lead in providing assurances to Hong Kong residents, he noted, "we shall now be  asking our partners and allies to follow."  </P> <P> In Hong Kong, the British news service Reuters reported, the proposal was  described as inadequate and potentially divisive. Legislators and lobbying  groups pledged to fight on for the rights of all 3.25 million British subjects  in the colony.  </P> <P> "The number falls far short of our request. We remain committed to pressing the  case for all Hong Kong British subjects," Legislative Councilor Rosanna Tam  said.  </P> <P> British Citizens for Hong Kong, a group of about 800 expatriate Britons living  in the colony, denounced the package, calling it "a divisive and dishonorable  gesture of dismissal" by Britain.  </P></p>

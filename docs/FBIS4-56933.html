			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 6 May (NA) -- Interim Supreme Court  President Julio Nazareno, in a surprise move, has resigned.  Ricardo Levene will temporarily replace him. This move  threatens to prompt another crisis in the country's top court,  this time it is closely linked to salary demands by the sector's  employees.    Nazareno's resignation was considered today during a plenum  in which only six of the court's nine members participated.    The justices named Ricardo Levene to replace Nazareno for a  period of 20 days. Levene held this post until 1993 when Julio  Boggiano, the previous president of the court, took over.    The decision was made known this afternoon. It has been  decided "to elect a new president on 8 June at 1000."    The resignation came just a day after a meeting on 5 May  between Nazareno, Guillermo Lopez, Carlos Fayt, President Carlos  Menem, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Justice Minister  Jorge Mairano.    The justices demanded a solution to the salary demands of  judicial branch employees who have been carrying out a long term  action plan.    The executive branch told them the answer must come from the  sector's budget and that the only alternative would be to freeze  unfilled vacancies and make available funds pertaining to  employees that have not yet been named.    This alternative was confirmed on 5 May by Maiorano, who  visited the Supreme Court to participate in a ceremony in which  the informatics system was inaugurated.    The decision to accept Nazareno's resignation was made  during  a meeting in which Justices Augusto Belluscio, Santiago  Petracchi, and Gustavo Bossert did not participate. [passage  omitted]</p>

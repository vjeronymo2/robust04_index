			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest firm Banking group National Westminster rose 20 to 444p and saw trade of a hefty 10m shares, making it one of the day's most active stocks, after UBS turned buyer of the shares and upgraded profits and dividend expectations. Mr John Aitken, at UBS, who previously had the stock marked as a hold, lifted his current-year profits expectations by Pounds 150m to Pounds 1.55bn, and by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.9bn for the following year. The broker also raised its dividend forecast for the current year by 17 per cent to 21.5p. Hints from Granada at its results meeting on Wednesday that it would be interested in bidding for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, should the government relax the current industry takeover rules, had a predictable effect on the latter's shares, which shot forward 24 to 300p. Worries over funding for such an expansionary strategy hemmed in Granada, which paid Pounds 760m for LWT earlier this year, to a penny rise at 502p. Slow advertising volumes at Scottish TV were reported at the group's agm and the shares slid 15 to 399p. A stock overhang continued to depress British Aerospace, which declined 7 to 448p. Sentiment was further damaged by worries over leasing contracts. Engineering group Siebe, which reported a 19.7 per cent increase in full-year profits to Pounds 217.2m, remained in the doldrums for most of the session but managed to close 2 ahead at 549p after trade of 2.8m. Several brokers upgraded profits expectations for the current year, including NatWest Securities, which now expects profits to be Pounds 5m higher at Pounds 257.5m. However, Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest said: 'The shares will be a good recovery play provided the company can improve on the margins.' Profit-taking at submarine builder VSEL, which reported figures in line with market expectations, saw the shares tumble 50 to 928p. Hoare Govett also weighed in with a profits downgrade, trimming its current-year estimate by Pounds 2m to Pounds 65m. The news that shipping and engineering group Vosper Thornycroft had failed in its joint bid for a five-year contract to supply minehunters to the Australian navy sent the shares into retreat and they closed 24 down at 740p. Fears that the UK may be forced to change over to Continental electrical plugs and sockets hurt electricals group Delta. The shares relinquished 17 to 517p. The regional electricity company stocks were a weak feature as some pronounced selling defied the usual trend of following the gilts market, which yesterday was higher. However, the strong market was proving irresistible towards the close and a sector-wide rally saw the shares come off their worst. Among the sector leaders, Eastern lost 10 at 575p, London 8 at 544p and Southern 6 at 559p. Water issues, on the other hand, were underpinned by continuing hopes that the 'K factor' - the amount by which the industry regulator allows water companies to raise prices over and above inflation - will be higher than analysts forecast. Yorkshire, boosted by good results, advanced 17 to 512p, South West 13 to 516p and Anglian 11 to 486p. The strong performances seen in Bass in recent sessions continued, the shares adding 15 at 534p. News that a Saudi Arabian prince is to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in Euro Disney sent the shares sharply forward by 15 to 365p. Rank Organisation surged 20 to 379p, with house broker SG Warburg said to be recommending the shares. Profit-takers took the shine from Stakis results, the shares slipping 2 to 85 1/2 p. British Airways hardened 6 to 380p on turnover of 4.5m ahead of today's passenger traffic figures for the month of May. Figures for April disappointed the market, leading to a slide in the shares. One analyst said yesterday: 'I shall consider anything above a 7 per cent increase to be really good.' Vague bid talk returned to Royal Insurance and the shares appreciated 17 to 259p. The stock is favoured by BZW, which issued a note earlier this week saying the shares were 'undervalued'. Buying said to have started in the US encouraged support in London for tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries, which finished 17 higher at 419p. An upbeat statement at engineering group Glynwed International's annual meeting saw the shares improve 7 to 355p. UK airports operator BAA was said to have been recommended by James Capel. The stock put on 25 at 933p. News that the latest survey from the Halifax Building Society will show house prices again in decline contributed to weakness in several housebuilding stocks. McAlpine dropped 18 to 241p after announcing a return to profitability, but accompanying it with a Pounds 25m two-for-nine rights issue. Contracting margins were also said to be under pressure. Elsewhere, John Laing weakened 9 to 298p and Bellway softened a penny to 233p. A sharp jump in profits at Kalamazoo, the computer services group, saw the shares gain 6 at 135p. However, a fall in profits at Control Techniques sent the stock retreating 45 to 442p. There were positive market debuts from publisher Cassell, placed at 143p and ending the session 8 ahead at 151p, and tableware manufacturer Denby Group, which came to the market at 130p and closed 7 ahead at 137p. Relief that MEPC maintained the interim dividend, together with a positive trading statement, helped the shares firm 5 to 455p.</p>

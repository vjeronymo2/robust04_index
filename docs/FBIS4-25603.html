			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Forestry Minister Xu Youfang: "Forestry </F> Shoulders Great Mission of Environment and Development"]    [Text] The improvement of the ecology is a strategic issue  confronted by the whole world and by China as well. Forestry is  shouldering the great mission of improving the environment and  promoting development and is playing a vital role in improving  the ecology and bringing about sustained growth.    Forests are major natural resources which are indispensable  for human development. Judging from the above two most  essential characteristics, the building of forestry involves two  strategic issues: 1) As main bodies of the ecosystem on land,  forests build and refine the earth's ecology and maintain the  most basic conditions for subsistence of human being. 2) As a  key to bringing about sustained growth, forests are of extremely  momentous strategic significance to the sustained economic  development of mankind, and, in particular, to the developing  countries in their endeavor to extricate themselves from poverty.    Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental  problems faced by mankind and is therefore called a global  crisis. The destruction of forest vegetation is the source that  has caused serious soil erosion in the whole world. At present,  the forest coverage rate throughout the world is only 25.08  percent, and one-third of the land on earth has been seriously  eroded. The only way to resolve this problem is to rebuild  forest vegetation all over the world.    Desertification is the most serious of the 10 major  environmental problems in the world. At present, 35 percent of  the world's land area has already or is becoming desert, and  economic losses caused by this have exceeded $40 billion a year.  This means that one-third of the land on earth has lost or  basically lost conditions favorable to human subsistence, and  this area is constantly expanding. Therefore, extension of  forest vegetation into deserts to recover the conditions for  human subsistence has become one of the most important and  arduous tasks faced by the entire world.    Too much water causes disasters, but too little water gives  rise to anxieties. The fundamental cause lies in the serious  shortage of forest resources. Scientific research at home and  abroad shows that forests absorb rainfall like a "sponge," stop  or reduce the currents of flood water, and prolong water flow in  dry seasons. Hence, forests have the dual functions of  preventing floods and drought.    Serious destruction of forests has damaged the genetic bank  of some species. At present, there are approximately 3,956  species on the verge of extinction, 3,647 species in peril, and  7,240 species that are rare due to the sharp decrease in the  number of varieties. Protection of forests, therefore, has  become a major subject of maintaining diversification of living  things.    Serious destruction of forests is also one of the major  factors leading to poverty. Currently there are approximately  250,000 babies born all over the world each day. This drastic  population increase has forced people to make unrestrained  demands on nature. But the deteriorating environment has made  densely populated areas even poorer. At present, environmental  refugees throughout the world have increased to more than 30  million, and the deterioration of the ecology has thrown  impoverished countries and regions into a difficult situation in  terms of environment and sustained economic development. It is  thus obvious that protection of forests, development of  forestry, and improvement of the ecology have become  comprehensive and vital issues for humans and human society.    The building of forestry in China has been seriously heeded  by the party and government for a very long time. The party's  Central Committee and the State Council have included  afforestation and improvement of the ecology as basic national  policies. Over the past 10 years or so, prominent comrades of  the central authorities have taken the lead in participating in  tree-planting activities as ordinary citizens every year and  have set brilliant examples for the entire people. In the  meantime, China has deliberately formulated and practiced a  series of policies, laws, regulations, and measures in forestry,  so that the building of forestry in China has entered the orbit  of steady development.    Through the collective efforts of the people throughout the  country, China's building of forestry has undergone great  historic changes. Since 1981, people taking part in voluntary  activities of afforestation have exceeded 3.4 billion  person-hours, and a grand total of 18 billion trees has been  planted. In recent years, an area of approximately 80 million  mu was afforested throughout the country each year. There are  no more barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan now, for  which these provinces have been commended by the party Central  Committee and State Council. This year, some more provinces and  autonomous regions will have their barren hills planted with  trees. Considerable progress has been made in the construction  of seven key forestry projects throughout the country so that  the basic framework of ecological construction in China has  taken shape. With the scope of afforestation continuously  expanding, the quality has been notably enhanced too.    After  verification, the total area of qualified afforestation reached  285 million mu during the past five years, and the rate of  acceptable quality rose from 65.6 percent in 1988 to 84.5  percent in 1992. Exhaustion of forest resources has also been  effectively controlled. According to the fourth nationwide  screening of forest resources between 1989 and 1993, China's  forest resources have shown a tendency of steady growth.    However, the tasks of building forestry in our country are  still extremely arduous. On the one hand, China is still a  country with very few trees, as the forest coverage rate is only  13.92 percent, which is lower than the world average, and the  level of per-capita forest area is even lower. At present,  there are still quite a lot of barren hills and waste land  around the country which must be afforested, and vast area of  desert and land becoming desert must be harnessed. On the other  hand, owing to insufficient forests, problems concerning the  ecology are still very grim, as one-half of the country's  population, one-third of cultivated land, and major large cities  are below water level along rivers in flood season so that the  areas in which industrial and agricultural output value accounts  for two-third of the country's total are threatened by floods.  According to statistics, approximately 500 million mu of farm  land have been hit by various kinds of natural calamities in  China. To put an end to this situation once and for all, the  most important thing is to further enhance the green ecological  and environmental awareness of the entire society, vigorously  intensify the construction of forests, consistently increase  forest vegetation, fully exercise the role of forests as  ecological shelters, and make the most of their multiple  functions and effectiveness.    The voices for the development of forestry are louder and  louder in the contemporary world, and the demands on forestry  construction for China's modernization drive are higher and  higher too. As a primary mission and central element of  environmental building, forestry should make contributions not  only to ameliorating the ecology, but to getting rid of poverty  and advancing toward a moderate prosperity for the masses in  mountain areas, as well as to creating a fine investment climate  and promoting the building of spiritual civilization to  facilitate the endeavor of opening up to the outside world. We  should persist in taking the road of building forestry with  Chinese characteristics, aim at the goal of achieving high  yield, fine quality, great efficiency, and sustained growth for  forestry and, centering around the two major themes of reform  and development, comprehensively fulfill the goal of struggle  set for forestry development in the 1990's. That is, by the  year 2000, all barren hills will be basically planted with trees  in 21 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the  forest coverage rate across the country will reach approximately  15.3 percent. Besides, the country's total output value in  forestry will increase to 304 billion yuan from 140 billion yuan  at present.</p>

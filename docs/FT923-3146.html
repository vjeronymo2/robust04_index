			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Management: Corporate citizenship seen rising from the ashes Tambrands, the US tampon company, is fanatical about the quality of its product. So when Femtech, its Ukrainian subsidiary, found that a shipment of sub-standard cotton had been used, it decided to burn hundreds of cases of affected products. Most of the 300-strong, mainly female workforce was appalled at such deliberate waste in a country where tampons are in desperately short supply. But the bonfire greatly impressed the local Ministry of Health which saw the blaze as final proof that here was a foreign company that was not prepared to fob off local consumers with inferior products. Such recognition of good corporate citizenship is valuable in this newly-independent country of 52m inhabitants. Ukraine has approved liberal foreign investment and privatisation laws but is still mainly run by old-style communist apparatchiks. Their ingrained suspicion of capitalism and desire to protect their own vested interests is reflected in an often obstructive approach to foreign companies which thus far have been slow to invest in the republic. Femtech, which started life in 1988 as a 49 per cent shareholder in a joint venture with the Soviet Pharmaceutical Ministry was the first foreign company to set up in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. Since the original decision to invest up to Pounds 10m in the venture, liberalisation of the foreign investment legislation has allowed a progressive rise in Tambrands' stake. Femtech is now a 100 per cent owned Tambrands subsidiary. But much else has changed in the four years since the company took over a half-finished engineering factory in the middle of a muddy field near Kiev's Borispol airport. Ukraine was then part of the Soviet Union and having an all-union ministry as a joint venture partner meant that marketing was taken care of completely. Femtech only had to produce for a virtually limitless market. The men from the ministry distributed it among Soviet pharmacies. At that time, the rouble was also still an all-union currency and inflation, though growing, was still barely into double figures. Now Femtech operates in hyper-inflationary conditions, pays its workforce in Ukrainian 'coupons' and has had to set up its own marketing arrangements in the 15 independent states which have emerged from the old union. Many, like Ukraine and the Baltic states, have either left or are leaving the rouble zone, while the use of dollars and other hard currencies is increasingly widespread. At the same time, unemployment is rising and incomes are widening rapidly. The bulk of these changes have taken place in the seven months since Tom Collins, a 27-year-old MBA from Boston, arrived as managing director. Another production line has been added to the original two and a fourth is awaiting customs clearance. Once installed, output will rise to around 250m tampons a year, still only around 2 per cent of the potential market. Through all the changes, Tambrands has stuck to its original business plan. This was to pay roubles for all local inputs and cover unavoidable hard currency imports by exporting finished product to hard currency markets. Locally-generated rouble profits were used to finance expansion. The first acquisition was made in January when Tambrands bought a cotton bleachery in St Petersburg with profits generated in Kiev. It is now installing two tampon production lines and sending its general manager and other key Russian staff to England for training. Keeping the workforce happy in hyper-inflationary times is also a tricky business. With official statistics in disarray, Collins relies heavily on his chief accountant, Lilia Osipova, who every month turns out what is probably Ukraine's best report on inflation and local wage conditions. She sits at her phone and calls her friends in the local factories for their wage rates. She also calls up the local stores and walks round the local markets, preparing a basket of 100 goods from lightbulbs to men's business suits. Armed with this high-grade intelligence, management adjusts wages to keep abreast of inflation. Productivity and quality at the Kiev plant are up to similar standards as those in Tambrands plants elsewhere. But wage costs are only 2 per cent of total costs in Kiev compared with around 14 per cent at plants in Britain. Now Tambrands is using part of its locally-generated funds to build 104 high-quality apartments for its workforce. The land will be leased for 99 years from the local council but the flats will remain Tambrands' property and it will be able to sell them in future, when the company hopes Ukrainian currency is convertible and profits can be exported in hard currency.</p>

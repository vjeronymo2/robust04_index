			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Hybrid policy found for franc: Paris comes to terms with new monetary order of the ERM FRANCE'S political and financial leaders have been tight-lipped about the direction of monetary policy in the three weeks since the European exchange rate mechanism was forced into humiliating reform. However, remarks by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, that France is in no hurry to return to the narrow fluctuation bands within the ERM suggest the French government is coming to terms with the new monetary order. 'It was a revealing comment,' says Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'It shows they are following a hybrid policy which is neither a free float nor a system in which interest rates are determined solely by the exchange rate.' Under the former system, the French franc could fluctuate by a maximum of 2.25 per cent from its central ERM parity. The currency crisis, however, broke the franc's close link with the D-Mark and forced the fluctuation band to be widened to 15 per cent. The reform undermined the central plank of French monetary policy, a strong franc and the tight link with the D-Mark. It presented Mr Balladur and the French financial authorities with the question of how to manage monetary policy in the new European exchange rate environment. Mr Balladur's comment points to some answers. 'We must not return in all haste to the narrow band of currency fluctuations. Neither must we seek, or without seeking it, get to the point where the wide band is reached,' the prime minister said. The implication is that the French government is adopting a more pragmatic stance to exchange rate and interest rate policy. 'Their boundaries are less rigid than before,' said one French economist. 'Interest rates have a slightly higher priority than before in guiding policy.' For the French government, this stance has several advantages. It gives them room for manoeuvre in cutting interest rates to help stimulate the recession-hit economy. The removal of tight exchange rate targets also increases the risks for currency speculators - strongly attacked by Mr Balladur for causing the currency crisis. But the government's response to the new European monetary order does not represent a radical shift in economic policy. The currency will remain an important constraint on reducing borrowing costs and the prime minister has consistently ruled out a strategy of rapidly reducing borrowing costs as the British did after the pound was forced out of the ERM in September last year. 'There are no miracle cures for our economic difficulties,' said Mr Balladur on Wednesday, emphasising his continued commitment to anti-inflationary policies. For interest rates, the result is likely to be a continuation of the policy of gradual reductions. Overnight rates have been trimmed five times since the ERM reforms, bringing money market rates down to near pre-crisis levels. The 5- to 10-day rate and the intervention rate, which provides a floor for money market rates, remain unchanged at 10 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively, but economists believe they, too, will be edged gradually downwards. The pace of cuts will continue to be influenced by events in Germany. The refusal by the Bundesbank to cut interest rates yesterday may affect the timing of reduced borrowing costs. However, it should not change fundamentally the process, and should drive home the arguments for a more independent approach to French monetary policy.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Private charges by NHS consultants 'a monopoly' THE WAY some National Health Service consultants charge for private practice forms a complex monopoly under the Fair Trading Act, according to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission says that last year 9,500 NHS consultants set fees at or close to British Medical Association guidelines or the scales of Bupa and PPP, two leading private medical insurers. This finding is given in a letter to doctors setting out the provisional results of an investigation into private medical services. The commission says it thinks the action of consultants in 'following what are in effect tariffs' restricts competition, but emphasises that it has not reached final conclusions 'nor made any judgment as to whether the effects of the conduct are good or bad'. NHS consultants working part-time provide the bulk of medical manpower for private hospitals. The commission began investigating the way they set their fees last September. In its letter, the commission says it has identified a number of respects in which the behaviour of the BMA, Bupa, PPP or consultants might be considered to be against the public interest. These included questions as to whether publication of guidance had led to higher fees and whether it had reduced or eliminated regional variations in charges. The commission sets out possible remedies that might apply if it decides the action is against the public interest. These include prohibiting consultants from following published guidance and banning insurers from reimbursing claims according to tariffs of procedures. The remedies also raise the possibility of opening up private medical services to a wider range of doctors. BMA officials argue that provision of information on fees is a public benefit, and say the commission's inquiry has shown that consultants' fees rose more slowly than most other hospital charges between 1986 and last year.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 18% growth at Asprey Acquisitions helped Asprey, the jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard and Mappin &amp; Webb, raise pre-tax profits by almost 18 per cent to Pounds 25.4m in the 12 months to March 31. Although the Asprey business continued to contribute more than 75 per cent of profits and 55 per cent of sales, acquisitions made during the past two years contributed Pounds 18.6m to turnover, helping to push the total up by almost 30 per cent, from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 187.6m. On a year-on-year basis sales rose by 16.8 per cent. Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said: 'Margins are under pressure and we are steadily developing cash-generative businesses to offset our other operations.' He said he intended to pursue organic growth by opening more high-street outlets for Watches of Switzerland and Mappin &amp; Webb. 'Our customer base must be widened so that the effect of future recessions will not be so severe,' he said. Mr Attallah added that since acquiring Watches of Switzerland in June 1992 the total number of outlets has been increased to 32. In the last financial year a new trading name, Zeus, was launched, aimed at a younger client base and offering a lower price range than Watches of Switzerland. A Mappin &amp; Webb shop will be launched in Prague in October. An Asprey office had been opened in Hong Kong and the Asprey and Garrard operations were seeking new markets, especially overseas, although the company has for the time being abandoned plans to open an Asprey store in Shanghai. Asprey was also considering expanding Les Ambassadeurs, the watch and jewellery retail chain acquired last year. It also bought Ronald A Lee, an antique clocks and furniture retailer. The company has set up a Pounds 20m revolving credit facility with the Bank of Scotland. At the year end net cash was unchanged at Pounds 13m. Asprey shares moved from the USM to the Official List last July after Sears, the retail group, sold its 25 per cent stake in the company. A final dividend of 4.8p is recommended, making a total of 6.05p (5.1p) for the year. Earnings per share jumped to 21.12p (14.44p), after an 'abnormally low tax charge', due to an over-provision last time.</p>

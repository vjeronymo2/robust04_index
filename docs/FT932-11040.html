			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / ECGD gave Matrix cover for Iraq deal THE EXPORT Credit Guarantee Department agreed to provide cover for about Pounds 6.5m of equipment destined for Baghdad which it suspected of being used for military uses, the arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday. The cover was provided in 1989 after the department thought it had been given approval by other government departments. Mr David Bryars, chief underwriter for the department's short-term credit operations at the time, said concern about the equipment being exported by Matrix Churchill, the Midlands-based machine-tool manufacturer, through Industrias Cardoen of Chile, led him to contact the Foreign Office for advice. According to confidential Whitehall documents released during the trial of three former Matrix Churchill directors last year, the exchange took place in January 1989. The department, which underwrites loans for export contracts, was then government-owned. It has since been partly privatised. Yesterday Mr Bryars, questioned by Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, counsel for the investigation, said a Foreign Office official told him that Matrix Churchill's goods were the subject of an investigation by the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, and that the matter of whether or not the equipment should be licensed was with ministers. 'He said that his feeling was the decision would be that an export licence would not be required . . . I was given a strong impression that it would be OK,' Mr Bryars said. A similar impression, he added, was given by Customs and Excise. He was giving evidence on the second day of the public hearings conducted by Lord Justice Scott into the extent to which the government may have colluded in the export of defence sales to Iraq in breach of guidelines and export-licensing arrangements. The inquiry continues on Monday.</p>

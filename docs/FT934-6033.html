			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Mixed response for market newcomers The shares of three newcomers to the stock market met with a mixed response in first day dealings yesterday. Shares of Lilliput Group, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of hand-painted miniature china cottages, closed 10p down on the 135p offer price. The company placed a total of 12.04m ordinary shares with institutional and other investors, of which 4.2m were subject to a clawback to meet retail demand. In the event retail investors and employees took up only 24.7 per cent, or just over 1m shares. The flotation raised Pounds 16.3m for existing shareholders, and Pounds 2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be used to redeem preference and deferred shares. In contrast, shares of Ruberoid, the roofing subsidiary spun off by Tarmac, closed at 163p, a premium of 13p. At the 150p flotation price, the company was valued at about Pounds 72m. More than 30m shares - 65 per cent of the issue - were placed firm with institutions. The balance of 16.5m shares was 2.1 times subscribed. The issue raised Pounds 68.8m for existing shareholders, principally subsidiaries of Tarmac, and Pounds 2m for the company. Shares of the the third newcomer, Biotrace International, ended the day at 145p, valuing the the South Wales-based biotechnology group at about Pounds 44.7m. Last week Allied Provincial Securities placed 7.15m shares, representing 23.2 per cent of the enlarged share capital, at 130p. Biotrace was founded five years ago by Mr Ian Johnson, a former Welsh Water microbiologist, and Mr Colin Griffiths, an accountant. It manufactures a range of rapid testing instruments and chemical reagents to monitor hygiene levels and detect microbiological contaminants in the food and drink and other sectors. The placing included some 4.6m shares on behalf of the company which will mainly be used to increase marketing resources overseas.</p>

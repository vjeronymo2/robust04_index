			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Greeks clasp hands over the Albanian border: Religion and language link local communities, but church is also fuelling discord between two states The morning church service is normally well attended in the two villages of Dervistani and Konitsa. The Orthodox ritual of burning candles within a gallery of saints, and the intoning priest with his beard and pony-tail, give the villagers a strong sense of their Greek identity. Their common beliefs and language appear to transcend the Albanian-Greek border separating the two communities. But, like elsewhere in the Balkans, the church is also an invisible hand which is fuelling tension between Athens and Tirana over minority rights. Dervistani and Konitsa are small Greek villages, one in southern Albania, the other about 30km away in northern Greece. Both their economies are based on agriculture, forestry and remittances from emigres, and both have famous priests. In Dervistani, Fr Michailis Dakos, 77, was the first to conduct a public religious ceremony in Albania after 23 years of communist attempts to eradicate religion. He is now vigorously campaigning to improve the rights of the Greek minority in southern Albania. Two of his parishioners are among the five on trial in Tirana accused of working with Greek intelligence to encourage a secessionist movement in the south. Like the Greek government, he thinks the trial is a set-up aimed at discrediting ethnic Greek nationalism. His demands focus on better education and cultural activities, but his agenda is one of ethnic independence. 'We want to see better treatment for the (100,000 or so ethnic) Greeks living in Albania,' he says. 'We want our own education facilities, freedom to teach our language and history, and closer co-operation with the mother country (Greece).' From Konitsa, Bishop Sebastianos Economidis, 74, is trying to do just that. He runs a church-funded radio station called 'The Voice of Orthodox Greeks' which, in the words of its manager, Mrs Michailidou Epicharis, is aimed at 'educating' the Greek community in south Albania. Every afternoon it broadcasts Greek 'programmes of history and culture' which the Albanian authorities have branded as 'dangerous propaganda'. The bishop has often been accused of calling for a Greek invasion of south Albania to liberate the minority, and during the court case in Tirana, the state prosecutor has declared him persona non grata. Priests and politics have become dangerously entwined in the southern Balkans. Last year, Fr Dakos's friend and colleague, Fr Chrysostomos Maidonis, was expelled by the Albanian authorities from Gjirokastra, the main town in the south, for his political activities which resulted in another wave of deportations of Albanians from Greece. As a result, many ordinary Albanians have become suspicious of men who have taken the cloth. In theory, Albania's 3.4m population is 70 per cent Moslem, 20 per cent Orthodox, and 10 per cent Catholic. But as one ethnic Greek explained, the country has never been fanatical in its beliefs, and between 1967 and 1990 it was formally atheist. 'Religion (in Albania) is imported,' he says. 'Most of us are not religious at all and it is often used as a cover.' With the fall of communism, the Greek Orthodox churches have taken on the issue of minority rights and the question of secession for ethnic Greeks with passion. They have adopted a particular version of history to support their arguments which date as far back as the ancient kingdom of Epirus - an area which included both Dervistani and Konitsa and where Pyrrhus had his base in classical times - and to the London Conference on the Balkans in 1912 when the Great Powers gave Greece the area of Northern Epirus up to the Shkumbi river, now in central Albania. Things started to go wrong, they say, in Paris when in 1921 the Powers changed their minds and re-drew Albania as it is today. And then came the second world war and communism. 'After all this, it's only natural that our people over there turn to us for help,' explains Mrs Epicharis at the radio station in Konitsa. While Greece continues to deport tens of thousands of non-Greek Albanians in anger at the trial in Tirana, visas are readily granted to the minority Greeks. Most of Dervistani's young men work in Greece and send remittances home. Churches in Greece are financing the rehabilitation of Fr Dakos's chapel which was used under the Communists as a fertiliser store. The people of Konitsa and other towns send the Greek minority in Albania medical aid, buses, and educational materials and are promoting commercial links by exporting televisions, radios, refrigerators and importing hand-made furniture and building stone. The problem facing the still young but democratically elected government in Albania is how far it can let these links develop. A close relationship is one thing, but autonomy in the south could spell disaster. Growing tensions between Athens and Tirana is already distracting them from the urgent need to rebuild the country's economic and political structures. And the more they clamp down on political activism, especially when it concerns the church, the more the tension rises. Mr Gentz Pollo, an adviser to Albania's President Sali Berisha, says: 'The only way to resolve all this is through dialogue. Greece has so far rejected this way and we can only hope they will change their minds.' While the politicians refuse to talk, many Albanians fear the church's voice will grow louder.</p>

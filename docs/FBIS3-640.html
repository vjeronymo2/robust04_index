			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" program] </F>   [Text] Reports from the nominally independent South African  homeland of Bophuthatswana say that thousands of people have  looted a shopping center in the capital, Mmabatho, in the latest  antigovernment demonstrations. The police appear not to have  intervened. Mr. Mangope's helicopter is reported to have left  the capital, Mmabatho. Some reports say Mr. Mangope was aboard  but this hasn't been confirmed.    There have been several days of antigovernment protests in  Bophuthatswana and earlier today, about 200 policemen said they  supported calls for the homeland to be incorporated into South  Africa. Mr. Mangope has been resisting demands that  Bophuthatswana should take part in South Africa's first  nonracial elections next month. The African National Congress  [ANC] had called for the South African security forces to  intervene to stop the unrest.</p>

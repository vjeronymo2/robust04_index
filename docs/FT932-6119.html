			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Studying the Ascot form - Avril Groom says watch the legs in the Royal Enclosure this year NOT EVERYBODY who attends the events of the English social season is super-rich, and not all the seriously rich do the season. But those who are prepared to stand up and be counted at the summer's high-profile events are intensely interested in fashion and the way they look. At Royal Ascot, still the glossiest daytime occasion in the social calendar, you need confidence to run the gamut of paparazzi, scribbling gossip columnists and curious sightseers who clog the entry to the royal enclosure. Techniques vary, from those who stride out, glancing neither to left nor right in anonymous, tasteful clothes, to the publicity-seeker ambling by in an outrageous hat. But all are on display, and for many Ascot is more about seeing and being seen than about horses. Royal Ascot is so hyped that many serious racing folk stay home and watch on TV. The seriously rich who do go dress appropriately and smartly. They may not have bought a new outfit for five years. They go to traditional couture houses such as Hardy Amies, or their own dressmaker, or a shop in the country. For men one bespoke morning suit can be a lifetime's investment. But for women, more subject to fashion's changes, the season is the perfect excuse for new outfits, though not all high-profile women can be seen to spend, in spite of the Princess of Wales's recent spree in Paris. Even in 1993, however, there are seriously rich women who do not mind looking the part. They are invariably beautiful and manage to look feminine and slightly sexy while staying just within the bounds of good fashion taste. The assorted wives of Robert Sangster, for example, would not dream of doing Ascot in last year's frocks. What they would dream of is a short silk outfit, striking enough to stand out, perhaps softened with a ruffle. But fashion is changing to the long soft style, which can be dangerously casual. What women like the Sangster wives wear will be a talking point of the season. Will they cover those trophy legs? Will they abandon gilt buttons and big trims for the new plainness. Or will they sail blithely on in the short, sharp outfits that have made the past few years so smart? Soundings indicate that this season is unlikely to break records for smartness. There is a rather negative mood and a feeling that fashion is in transition. The new look is almost too trendy as yet. This year many women will probably stick with safe favourites. Among a crowd more in tune with their husbands' pockets than avant garde fashion there is resistance to the longer length. A visit to Chanel revealed a flurry of women having their slim, calf-length skirts raised to just on the knee. Bruce Oldfield, an Ascot set darling, says he has sold a few tailored jackets with long, soft skirts, 'but far more short coat and dress or jacket and dress sets. The difference from last year is that people are buying more of them.' But the soft look is having an influence, if not on length. Glitz is buried, with those big gilt buttons replaced by soft ties and bows, a near-absence of trims and gentle, narrow shoulder lines on even the most tailored jacket. Seriously rich fashion fanatics can score points by getting the soft look just right. Absolute winners are Chloe's softly fluted suits and Donna Karan's monochrome ruffled chiffons. The new long look needs a fresh approach to accessories and make-up. Plainness gives space for the big, decorative hat. Graham Smith says big brims are back, and manages to put a soft curviness into those of even his most structured styles. The hard-edged leather bag and bright red lips are redundant, while make-up should involve low-key colours like slates and peaches. 'Wearing layers with a soft skirt, split to show the leg, is a sophisticated version of the new Bohemian look, but it takes some confidence,' says Joan Burstein, of Browns. Good compromises come from Amanda Wakeley, who does pure and simple long shapes in the best of fabrics, and from Laura B, whose soft, floppy, subtle jackets have 'the right plain necklines for showing off good jewellery' and do not loudly proclaim particular designer origins. They go with flattering curvy sarongs or light georgette pleated skirts: both long, though Laura has had to do a lot of shortening. This, then, is the style designers feel the seriously rich should wear to Ascot. Whether they will is another matter, for taste and fashion sense were never the exclusive preserve of the wealthy.</p>

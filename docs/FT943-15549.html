			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ICC Bank shows 7% rise to IPounds 5.5m ICC Bank, the Irish state-owned bank, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.43m) for the six months to April 30, a 7 per cent improvement on the IPounds 5.14m recorded in the corresponding period last year. The advance was achieved on reduced income of IPounds 47.3m, against IPounds 85.8m. The reduction was directly related to the fall in interest rates, directors said. The interim dividend is maintained at 6p, more than five times covered by earnings of 31.6p (31.5p) per share.</p>

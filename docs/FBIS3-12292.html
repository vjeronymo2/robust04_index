			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nicosia, 25 Feb (INA) -- The Arab Liberation Front  [ALF] has denounced the horrendous, racial crime that claimed  the lives of dozens of martyrs as they were performing prayers  this morning at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. An ALF spokesman  said the outrage only demonstrates the spiteful nature of the  aggression against our people and our nation under the cover of  the new world order. Some who are worn out by the struggle and  dazzled by the deceptive sparkle of power rushed to make peace  with the enemy and recognized its presence on our usurged  territory, the spokesman added.    This ghastly crime and other Zionist atrocities have in  common the objective of controlling Arab territories and  eliminating their owners by expulsions or killings. Only its  scale sets this latest crime apart from previous outrages, the  spokesman noted.    We in the ALF denounce the West's collusion with the  Zionists  and their condoning of crimes against our people. We denounce  the flagging resolve of the godfathers of a settlement with this  usurper Zionist entity, and reiterate our outright rejection of  all forms of settlements with this racial and usurper enemy.    We urge all Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw  from  the talks and rejoin the struggle in all its forms, most of all  armed struggle, as the only option to liberating our land and  safeguarding the dignity and life of the Arab individual.    The spokesman called on the Arab nation and its nationalist  forces to speak up against Arab regimes associated with  imperialism and who compromise Arab rights and gamble with the  future of the Arabs.    The spokesman said in conclusion: The Arab masses and the  Palestinians in particular must sit in the trench of the Mother  of Battles -- the trench of justice and dignity that leads to a  bright and prosperous future.</p>

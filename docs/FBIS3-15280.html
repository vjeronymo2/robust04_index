For its sake every politician, social figure,  and citizen must renounce personal ambitions and claims to power  at any price and moderate his arrogance, which is a sin of  destructive force. It is necessary once and for all to renounce  the view that in our society there are two hostile camps, the  righteous and the unworthy. We have all been affected  differently by defects and shortcomings and we have only one  salvation -- justice and obedience to the law. It is that  striving which will provide the opportunity to convincingly and  fully reveal the character of a great nation -- determination,  energy, will, and morality -- because the exalted character of  each of us means the exaltation of society and the quality of a  great power. That is why we need civil peace.    The people of Russia have always been great in their  sober-mindedness and mercy. Hatred of one another and revenge  for innocently shed blood can have no place in our society  today, much less in the future. Without national reconciliation  the country cannot overcome the economic, political, and social  chaos. Without civil peace, creation and a decent life are  impossible.    Last fall all who were in the House of the Soviets and on  the  barricades performed their civic and patriotic duty to the end  in defense of the new-born parliamentarism, democracy, and the  Constitution. Many of them paid the ultimate price -- their  life -- trying to save the honor and dignity of the Russian  state and prevent the country's slide into dictatorship. They  died victorious and their names have gone down forever in the  motherland's history. I grieve deeply for the dead and the  maimed who were at the center of the bloody events. I am sure  that the fatherland will never forget the steadfastness and  courage of the selfless and cruelly slandered defenders of  Russian democracy. For my part I shall do everything in my  power to perpetuate the shining memory of those who died.    This terrible and tragic time has shown that it is  impossible  to transgress the state's fundamental law in order to hold on to  personal power without dire consequences for the people and the  whole country.    I have always consistently supported the observance of the  rule of law and I shall solemnly adhere to that principle in the  future too. There can be nothing higher than the law, and the  law itself and right must never be replaced by might. The  country and its citizens must have the opportunity to determine  their system and conditions of life themselves and improve the  laws by legal means. I cherish the words of the great Russian  philosopher Ivan Ilin, who said that "a legal system which  denies that opportunity to all or to the broad strata of the  people by denying them access to the law is preparing an  inevitable revolution for itself."    I submit to the laws of my country and the will of the  people's representatives, who adopted the wise decision that is  so necessary to us all today -- the "Memorandum of Accord" and  the amnesty decree. I fully share the provisions of that  document and will devote all my efforts to preventing enmity and  discord. I agree that each of us must find the inner strength  to acknowledge his own mistakes and respond to parliament's good  will with a readiness to unite our efforts for the well-being of  the long-suffering people and to find a way out of the prolonged  crisis as soon as possible.    I consider it my moral duty to state to those irresponsible  blabbermouths and dishonorable politicians and journalists who  have mounted a shameful and obscene campaign through the mass  media, indulging in hysterics and distorting the essence of what  happened in September-October 1993: Stop this besmirching of  innocent people, exploiting the dead, pinning the blame on  others as if theyr were the true culprits in the tragedy,  intimidating society with talk of civil war, and attributing to  me comments aimed at destabilizing the situation in the country.  Think before you inflame hysteria! Is the blood that has been  shed really not enough for you?    I appeal to a great people and I call all Russians to civil  peace, accord, and creative work.</p>

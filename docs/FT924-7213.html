			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Unctad to build trade information network THE United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) plans to set up 19 'trade point centres' by mid-1993, paving the way for development of a global information network for international trade. The centres are intended mainly to help small and medium-sized companies in both rich and poor countries, to reduce the cost of trade transactions and gain better access to world markets by exploiting information technology and electronic data systems now used routinely by big corporations. Officials say widespread adoption of paperless trading alone could cut transaction costs 25 per cent by the year 2000. The UN puts these costs at Dollars 300bn (Pounds 198.6bn), some 10 per cent of world merchandise trade, implying potential global savings of Dollars 75bn. Fears exist that small companies, especially in developing countries and eastern Europe, could face exclusion from an increasingly globalised trading system based on paperless transactions. 'Unctad's main concern is that everyone is able to share equally in the modern technology,' says Mr Jean Gurunlian, head of Unctad's trade efficiency programme. Experts from 70 countries meet in Geneva this week to discuss implementing Unctad's plan. Experience from about 19 pilot projects will be considered at a world symposium on trade efficiency set for 1994. The centres are financed mainly by governments and/or the private sector, though the US, Switzerland, Germany and Italy have contributed to Unctad's development work. Companies will pay a fee to use the centres, eventually to be linked in a global network. The idea is to bring together all participants in a trade transaction (buyers, sellers, banks, insurers, customs authorities), the technology used depending on the country's level of development.</p>

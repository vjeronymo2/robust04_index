			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods urges bid acceptance Attwoods, the UK waste company which last week fell to the hostile Pounds 391m bid from Browning Ferris Industries of the US, yesterday urged shareholders who have not taken up the offer to do so. The company said that if investors sold into the market instead, they would lose their rights to the additional contingent payment upon the sale of Attwoods' German business. The board had decided to accept BFI's offer of 116.75p, plus the proposed 3.25p dividend. Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, stands to gain up to Pounds 1.2m from the sale of his shares. Preference shareholders will have to decide whether to wait for redemption or accept BFI's offer of 92p per share. BFI has the right to redeem the shares early at their par value of Pounds 1. BFI won acceptances last week representing about 60 per cent of Attwoods' equity. If Mr Foreman leaves the company, he is entitled to a substantial compensation payment of more than Pounds 700,000.</p>

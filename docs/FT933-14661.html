			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Asko sells remaining AVA stake ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus, one of Germany's biggest retailers, said yesterday it had sold its remaining 7 per cent stake in AVA Allgemeine Handelsgesellschaft der Verbraucher, another quoted German retailer in which Asko used to own a 50 per cent interest. In a brief statement, the Saarbrucken-based Asko said the sale of its entire AVA stake since February had raised more than DM1bn (Dollars 625m). Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chief executive, said that the sale had been achieved at slightly above book value. 'With this step we have completed the most important part of our disinvestment programme,' the chief executive said. Asko, majority-owned by Metro, the large Swiss-based retailer, expanded rapidly in the late 1980s but has embarked on a drastic rationalisation plan in order to cut its debts, which stood at DM4.7bn at the end of March. The Bielefeld-based AVA, nearly 50 per cent owned by Edeka Zentrale, had turnover of DM6.8bn last year, up from DM5.1bn in 1991. It operates in the discount market and derives 60 per cent of its turnover from food retailing.</p>

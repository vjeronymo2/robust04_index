			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Rewards of the door-to-door salesman - Peter Marsh meets Mike Shirley who gave up cabbage picking to sell double glazing. He earns Pounds 80,000 a year and loves his work It is a cold December morning and Mike Shirley is at work, knocking on people's doors. He is outside a big, solid house in Nottingham. Plenty of windows, paintwork wearing thin. Just the place to sell some double glazing. Someone is in. Shirley is polite and to the point: he will be in the area again tomorrow and has a slot in his diary. Would the lady and her husband like an appointment to discuss having their windows replaced? Shirley loves his routine. He is one of Britain's most successful double-glazing salesmen, his main tools are the leaflets under his arm, the samples of glass and plastic in the boot of his Volvo, an indefatigable nature and an interest in psychology. As well as selling, Shirley also has to supervise 10 sales representatives who also work his area of the east Midlands. These people, Shirley included, are self-employed and earn no basic salary. All their earnings are related to sales. Shirley's wages are worked out according both to his performance and that of the men under him. This gives him an incentive to keep them motivated through schemes which he organises - including prizes for the 'salesman of the month' and weekend trips to encourage a team spirit. The strategy seems to work. Shirley earns up to Pounds 80,000 a year - not bad for a 36-year-old former army gunner turned vegetable picker who moved into double glazing 10 years ago. But to maintain this level of earnings Shirley, who has five children aged between six and 18, works 80 hours a week. Shirley and his men work for Everest, one of Britain's biggest double glazing companies. This supplies them with promotional literature and basic training - and leaves them to get on with selling its windows, doors and related products from their homes. The strategy makes sense for the company, cutting out overheads such as offices, phone rentals and secretaries, and may also be good for consumers, who pay less for their products. In Britain one in eight people in work is self-employed, compared with one in 14 in 1979. Some argue that rewarding people solely on the basis of sales or production figures can be demeaning and cause individuals to work too hard. But Shirley has no complaints. He says self-employment gives him not only job satisfaction but 'total control' over what he earns. Shirley moved into the window business after tiring of his back-breaking work picking cabbages. He used a phone box to respond to a newspaper advertisement for salesmen. He was told to ring again when he had a phone at home. 'I went out and got one,' says Shirley. 'It forced me to sort out priorities.' Shirley knocks on up to 40 doors a day, travelling an average of 140 miles in his 'patch' which is centred on Grantham. He is a keen student of behaviour. 'Before you sell to anyone, you've got to sell yourself, make them feel comfortable,' he says. 'You've got to be able to 'read' them, understand their body language. Every day you learn something new.' Selling, says Shirley, is a 'numbers game'. Over time - assuming a salesman is working at full potential - a set level of sales will follow a specific number of calls. On average, says Shirley, for every 13 doors he knocks at, he arranges one appointment. Allowing for half of all appointments falling through, one in every 2.5 appointments leads to a sale - of average value about Pounds 2,500. Shirley is proud that his sales to appointments ratio is better than the Everest average of one to three. More than two thirds of his business comes from knocking on doors or following up other contacts, the rest mainly from people responding to company advertisements. Shirley can be persistent. His biggest success came a year ago when he persuaded a well-heeled grandmother to buy Pounds 21,000 of double glazing. To clinch the deal he stayed up all night, talking to her and her daughter for 12 hours non-stop and got home at 6.30am. 'Taking someone from being a definite no to a definite yes can be thrilling,' he says. 'You have to push yourself beyond your comfort levels. At the same time you have to think positively and not be put off by failure.' There are things he will not do. Asked about the 'strong arm' sales tactics which have given the double glazing industry a bad name, Shirley gives a withering look. Everest's code of practice forbids such methods and they act against his interests. 'I'm not going to sell anyone anything they don't want. We want customers to recommend us to their friends: they're not going to do this if they are unhappy.' A big part of his job is linking up with the 10 people in his sales group. He says his training as a tank gunner helps him appreciate team work. Shirley sees one of his 'reps' every day, normally for lunch, and meets them all every Monday in a Newark hotel. 'I recruit them, I'm a shoulder to cry on, sometimes a marriage guidance counsellor,' he says. To 'incentivise' his team, he digs into his own earnings for prizes such as Pounds 300 worth of Marks and Spencer vouchers for the person with most sales over a month. In 1993 he spent about Pounds 6,000 on promotional schemes and incentives. All this effort pays off. During 1993, in spite of the recession, Shirley's team sold just over Pounds 1m worth of double glazing, a new record for the Grantham area. His own share of the sales were about a quarter. This put Grantham in eighth spot out of 110 in the Everest 'league table' of UK sales regions. The financial rewards have given Shirley and his family a comfortable life-style: they live in a tastefully converted 18th century barn in the countryside with views of Lincoln Cathedral. The house is double-glazed and acts as a showroom as well as an office. His wife, Kim, does a lot of the paperwork: sales figures have to be faxed to Everest's head office three times a week. He admits work has become an obsession, not just for the material rewards but because of his need to compete and for the sense of recognition that doing well for his company gives him. 'My home is my office, my home is Everest, Everest is me,' he says. 'I'm proud of what I do. But I wouldn't influence anyone to work as hard as me.'</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Britons win the techno-battle THE BRITISH may have to grant that the French are best in the kitchen and yield to the Germans in public transport, but when it comes to using technology they are right on the button. Nearly one in four Britons is a 'techno-wizard', according to a multinational survey which shows they are more comfortable using a computer, tuning a car radio and even programming a video recorder than their Continental counterparts in France and Germany. Even North Americans, in spite of their apparently greater familiarity with gadgetry, are more prone than the British to 'technophobia' - a fear of, and resistance to modern technology - in their everyday lives. About 55 per cent of American adults and teenagers admitted to technophobia compared with only 46 per cent of Britons. The electronic word processor is clearly set to stay, however. Fewer than a quarter of those questioned - regardless of nationality - look back with nostalgia to manual typewriters and the delights of changing ribbons. The survey, by the US computer company Dell, identified a family of techno-types. Techno-wizards want the hottest technology at the cheapest price. Their greatest fear is being behind the times. Techno-boomers want to look smart and research endlessly before purchasing. They are scared of being seen to make the wrong decision. The techno-to-go category want machines that work straight out of the box. Their greatest fear is being left without support. Some of the survey's findings simply reinforce popular prejudices. Men are more comfortable with technology than women and the young are more likely to savour the challenge of technology than the old. But there are surprises. Car phones and fax machines are seen across Europe as complicated and difficult to use, while only just over half of those surveyed are prepared or able to programme their favourite stations into their car radios. There is evidence of a north-south divide in the UK. Scottish pupils are significantly more likely to use a computer in school than pupils from any other part of the country, with London coming off worst. 'Incredibly,' the survey says, '72 per cent of adults in the south of the UK have never set a burglar alarm, compared with 56 per cent of northerners.'</p>

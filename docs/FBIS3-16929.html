			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer Irina Merkulova] A closed session of the  lower house's Committee on International Affairs was held at the  State Duma today. It was attended by Yevgeniy Primakov,  director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]. In an  interview with our correspondent, Yuriy Kobaladze, the head of  the FIS's Press Bureau, described the aim of this meeting in the  following terms:    [Begin Kobaladze recording] This is normal international  practice. This was simply a way of telling MP's what the  intelligence service is doing, the tasks it is facing, and the  way it is tackling them. [end recording]    [Merkulova] At the same time, our correspondent learned the  following:    [Begin Correspondent Aleksey Venediktov recording] Moscow  Echo's sources say that in his address, Primakov referred to  certain inconsistencies between the Constitution adopted on 12  December and the law on foreign intelligence. However, arms  exports were the main topic. Primakov expressed conviction that  arms sales must be controlled by a single monopoly,  Rosvooruzheniye, rather than several firms competing among  themselves. The FIS director said that arms exports could earn  the country substantial profits -- and not just in Russia's  traditional markets.    He stressed that Russia's intelligence service had observed  a  drawing together of the positions of Iran and Turkey, both in  Afghanistan and the Transcaucasus.    Referring to the United States' stance on various questions,  Primakov noted that according to his information, the United  States supports Belarus' entry into the ruble zone and advocates  the preservation of Russia's unity.    According to our sources, the hearings on foreign  intelligence were more reminiscent of a scholarly seminar than a  chance for MP's to learn about state secrets. However, the  important thing is that the first contact has been established,  our sources stressed. [end recording]    [Merkulova] Yuriy Kobaladze reacted in the following manner  when we asked him to confirm or deny that information:    [Begin Kobaladze recording] I cannot comment on those  points.  If Duma sources supply you with such information, you should  quote Duma sources.    [Merkulova] Let me add that the State Duma's Committee on  International Affairs also refused to comment. It advised that  this report should not even be broadcast.</p>

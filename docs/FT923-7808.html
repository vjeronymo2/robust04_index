			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Quest for the bare essentials - Susan Moore meditates on the uneasy British attitude to nudity in art even in art. The moral authority of the classical or Renaissance nude, no less, failed to assuage the lurking sense of shame or embarrassment that had its roots in the chill climate of puritanism. Witness the vast plaster fig leaf that used to be hooked on to the cast of Michelangelo's David every time Queen Mary visited the V&amp;A. For its second display in the 'Crosscurrents' series, the Tate Gallery dips into the irresistible subject of the nude in art. The 22 paintings, supplemented by two sculptures, are drawn exclusively from the gallery's holdings. Revealingly, they constitute virtually its entire holding of nudes by British artists. William Etty, unusually, delighted in the art form, attending daily life classes at the Royal Academy Schools long after his student days were over. His depiction of the tale of Candaules, King of Lydia, exhibited in 1830, is typical of the subjects from classical history that allowed him to clothe his nudes with a modicum of respectability. Herodotus records how Candaules, being so proud of his wife's beauty, insisted that Gyges, his favourite officer, should spy on her in her nakedness. Etty audaciously places the Queen centre-stage and paints her as a voluptuous full-length nude, albeit viewed from behind. In its hot, sensual colour and succulent glazes, it harks back to the great Venetian and Flemish masters. It was far too suggestive of the pleasures of the flesh: the picture was deemed indecent. Perhaps the inhibited viewer was also affronted by the Queen's revenge. Having sensed Gyges' presence - as we see here - she later summoned the soldier to offer him the choice of dying himself or murdering the king and taking the kingdom - and her as his bride. He chose the latter course. Poor Candaules. Poor Etty. 'I have been accused of being a shocking and immoral man,' the artist lamented. Etty marks the end of one great European tradition and hints at another. Beside this contrived Candaules hangs a striking life study. Although the model is still idealised, and her features discreetly lost in shadow, it has an honesty and a substantiality that prefigures Courbet. Only a Courbet, however, could have the temerity to take a life study and call it a finished work of art. Sickert is the first artist here to take on the earthy realism of the French. He wanted his art to deal 'joyously with gross material facts'. He depicts La Hollandaise - Balzac's prostitute - as her customers might have found her, lying on a bed, with her breasts, thigh and calf catching what little light there is in the expectant gloom of a small, shabby room. The picture positively reeks of sex. The pitch of eroticism wavers between the steaminess of Sickert and the chaste Love Locked Out of 1889 by Anna Lea Merritt - although eyes less innocent than Mrs Merritt's might find homo-erotic appeal in her youthful Cupid. The picture is in fact a memorial to her husband who died three months after their marriage. Etty whets the voyeur's appetite, Mark Gertler offers the male fantasy of the harem. His odalisque is a hideous, over-ripe and ruddy-toned creature, a real poor-man's Renoir. Contrast her with Sir William Nicholson's truly sensual stretched-out wife. Lord Leighton's bronze Sluggard has langour, Euan Uglow's Zagi a cool objectivity. Dod Proctor's Impressionistic orchard scene is the only erotic female nude here painted by a woman. Mrs Merritt and Maurice Greiffenhagen perpetuate the Renaissance notion that any concept or emotion could be expressed by the human body. There is an affecting tenderness too in Victor Pasmore's intimate oil of his wife curled up on the bed, her flesh stroked by gentle touches of pink, yellow, white and grey. That emotion is given monumental expression in Glynn Williams' Ancaster stone waking couple, who lie side by side, holding hands and touching feet. The nice distinction between nudity and nakedness is exploited this century. Steer's seated nude of around 1900 was indecorous because his model, by wearing a fashionable black hat, made it clear she did not represent a classical ideal but a modern woman who had taken her clothes off. Gwen John's Nude Girl, painted a decade later, is not idealised, unmistakably naked and uncomfortable. Perhaps the ever-sensitive Gwen John remembered her own experiences as a model. The academic practice of drawing and painting the nude from life may have survived (and accounts for many of the canvases here) but the notion of perfecting Nature had long gone. The Nude was hauled off her pedestal and not so much recorded warts and all as bared, and exposed. In the recent Lucian Freud here, the human body is less exposed than interrogated under harsh electric light, and brutalised by pigment. What unites the realism of Freud, Auerbach and Uglow is an intense, intrusive scrutiny. Their canvases sometimes take years to complete. They seem to believe that if they look long and hard enough they may find the essence of their subject. Uglow's scrutiny is more dispassionate. In one sense Zagi's carefully observed and meticulously placed flesh tones are not so far removed from the art-for-art's sake harmonies of the equally remote Reading Girl by Theodore Roussel (an honorary Brit because he studied with Whistler). Yet he, too, attempts to pin down his quarry. His eye has a precision that might almost come from focusing through the cross-wires of a telescopic sight. 'The Painted Nude: From Etty to Auerbach' continues at the Tate Gallery until December 7.</p>

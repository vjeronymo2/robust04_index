It examined  the issue of safe storage of weapons by the republican Armed  Forces. As a check shows, more than 400 units of weapons were  stolen or lost last year from military regiments. Among the  weapons are 148 rifles and automatic machines [as received], 175  revolvers, 46 grenade cup dischargers, and five machine-guns. A  certain quantity of them have been returned. But still a large  number of weapons are owned by criminals. Criminal cases have  been initiated on all these facts.    The participants of the meeting strengthened the need for  specifying a circle of people in the Armed Forces who will be  held responsible for military arsenals. The session also  discussed the aggravating criminal situation in Dzhambul Oblast.  The level of crime solvency continues to worry us. Last year  it did not exceed 52 percent. The Chu valley, with its hemp  fields, has become a destabilizing factor. It has become a sort  of a pilgrimage for drug addicts practically from all over the  CIS. The session adopted recommendations aimed at radical  improvement of the law enforcement bodies activities. It was  decided to examine the issue of their realization over a period  of four months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Planning  Commission, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Public  Security Ministry recently issued a joint "Circular Concerning  Lawful Punishment of Criminal Offenses Against Price Inspection  Personnel in Executing Official Duties."    The circular points out: Lately, vicious incidents of  jointly beating price inspection personnel have occurred  frequently, posing a threat to price inspectors in executing  their official duties, directly impeding normal operations of  the general price inspection, and causing serious social  repercussions. To ensure smooth progress of the general price  inspection, price departments and public security and  procuratorial organs at all levels must investigate and handle  cases of using violence or coercion to obstruct price inspection  once they are discovered, dealing with them resolutely to ensure  the personal safety of price inspectors and the smooth progress  of price inspection.    The circular says: Public security and procuratorial organs  at all levels must enforce the law and handle cases strictly  according to the law. Cases of obstructing price inspectors  from performing official duties, which constitute an offense  against public order, must be duly handled by public security  organs according to the relevant provisions in the "Regulations  Governing Punishment for Offenses Against Public Order." Once  facts are verified and evidence proven, cases of using violence  and coercion to obstruct price inspectors from performing their  official duties should be promptly examined and transferred by  the public security organ to the procuratorial organ for  approval to arrest, indictment, and investigation of offenders'  criminal responsibilities according to the law. In the course  of handling cases, price departments and public security and  procuratorial organs in all localities should step up the  publicity and education, teaching business operators to  conscientiously abide by various government price policies and  regulations, to engage in lawful operations, and to voluntarily  accept price inspection. Price-inspecting offices at various  levels should strengthen education on the legal system among  price inspectors to enhance their level of law enforcement and  enable them to perform duties strictly according to the law.</p>

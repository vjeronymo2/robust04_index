			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Playland - South African Theatre ATHOL Fugard's latest work commends the talking cure for political violence. Topicality gives edge to Fugard's moral earnestness, and the earnestness gives the piece momentum. Playland is a strong, static dramatic image rather than a drama. It's an image of the South African hell - a vessel overloaded with corpses. The image of hell realised on stage by Fugard and his talented designer, Susan Hilferty, is a travelling funfair on a hot New Year's Eve in the small Karoo desert town of Cradock. The stage is dominated by the curving, glaringly lit skeletons of big wheels and roller-coasters; the barking loudspeaker's injunctions to have a good time; acrid smoke from a superfluous brazier; and the inanities of Sixties rock'n'roll. It is a setting of infernal banality in flaming oranges and faded Noddyland primary colours. Playland is a confrontation between two characters, one white and one black. Martinus Zoeloe, a Xhosa nightwatchman, is played by John Kani, who has worked with Fugard since the 1960s. A stocky, forceful actor, Sean Taylor, plays the shell-shocked veteran of the Namibia war, Gideon le Roux. The play begins with Martinus threatening offstage crooks with the fires of hell and their derisive laughter. One of the debates between the two characters is about the hereafter, with Le Roux denying all but the here and now and Zoeloe all but the hereafter. Both positions, it emerges, have less to do with faith than the need to evade guilt for past acts of violence. Martinus killed a white seducer of his wife, Le Roux participated in border massacres: both are haunted by the memories and both their lives are paralysed by guilt and anger. Each presses the other to open up: much of the play's action is the process of negotiation, back-off and attack which eventually leads to the recognition that, in being haunted by ghosts, they have become citizens of limbo, and thence to forgiveness. The play has the dramatic deficiencies of allegory - particularly a disregard for improbability. And its operating assumption is peculiarly Fugardian - that stage characters will necessarily participate in joint therapy because they are bound in a blood knot of violence, anger and guilt. Yet, the play is resonant because the two performances give a degree of realism to the allegory, with Kani's performance an ornate assembly of sour-mouthed silences, hell-fire sermonising and sardonic laughter, and Taylor's based on violent shifts between hyperactivity and tearfulness. Playland is at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg</p>

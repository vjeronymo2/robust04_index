			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HORSE DEATH TOLL RISES AS OFFICIALS RECALL HAY  </P> <P> State officials Thursday ordered a recall of up to 1,000 tons of hay cubes that  may be tainted by a deadly toxin as the death toll of horses continued to grow.  </P> <P> One more horse was destroyed at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center  late Wednesday, bringing the total to 16.  </P> <P> Botulism has been blamed in the horses' deaths in four Southern California  counties, and veterinarians believe the powerful toxin was hidden in hay cubes  manufactured in Utah and shipped to at least 60 stables in the Southland,  officials said. Only a portion of the compressed hay cakes tested have been  found to contain botulism.  </P> <P> But as a precaution, a regionwide roundup has been ordered of the candy-bar  sized cubes distributed by Paramount Cubing of Paramount, said Stanley  Buscombe, head of the feed and fertilizer branch of the state Department of  Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> The tainted hay cubes have not yet surfaced in San Diego County, according to  San Diego County Veterinarian Hubert Johnstone. "We haven't had any unusual  reports of horse mortality," Johnstone said. "And I think we would have heard"  if horses had died, Johnstone said.  </P> <P> Horse owners are probably "not feeding their horses hay until they know for  sure" if their feed supply was safe, Johnstone said.  </P> <P> It is highly unlikely that the tainted product had been shipped as far south as  San Diego County, according to feed store owners and operators in North County.  </P> <P> "I know of no large equestrian centers that even use cubes," said Paul  McFadden, president of Escondido-based McFadden Feed Co. "And I don't know of  any feed stores that even sell cubes."  </P> <P> Most of San Diego's hay comes direct from the Imperial Valley, feed store  owners said. "All this is going to do is hurt some (Imperial Valley farmers)  whose reputations don't deserve to be hurt," said another feed store owner.  </P> <P> Buscombe said no complaints have been filed against Paramount Cubing, adding  that the company has voluntarily suspended all shipments of hay cubes and is  cooperating with the recall.  </P></p>

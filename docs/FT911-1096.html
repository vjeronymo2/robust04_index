			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Funding council fears for medical education CONTROVERSY over the government's health service reforms was revived yesterday when the Universities Funding Council said it was 'extremely concerned' about their possible effect on medical education. The council's comments have prompted the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals to write to the government seeking assurances that there will be 'adequate safeguards' in the implementation of the reforms to protect high-quality teaching and research. Difficulties facing teaching hospitals in inner London, the funding council's medical committee said in a report, were sufficiently serious to 'raise doubts about their future ability to deliver a viable education programme, unless urgent corrective action is taken'. The council's warning comes less than a fortnight after one inner London teaching hospital - Guy's - announced plans for about 600 job losses to improve its financial position. Under the health reforms introduced last month, hospitals are funded on the basis of their success at negotiating contracts with health authorities and general practitioners. Regional allocations of overall funds will be determined by the size and other characteristics of local populations. The potential effect of those changes on universities with medical schools, the council says, is 'very great' and has not been fully understood by some schools. The council says: 'From the point of view of the teaching hospital, failure to attract sufficient contracts from purchasing authorities could ultimately render the hospital unviable.' Some teaching hospitals would need to contract with 60 or 70 health districts to maintain their current workloads. Undergraduate teaching required a broad clinical base, but essential 'run-of-the-mill' work was most likely to be lost to teaching hospitals.</p>

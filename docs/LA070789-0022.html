			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARGARET NELSON; NORWALK'S FIRST WOMAN MAYOR  </P> <P> Margaret I. (Peg) Nelson, the first woman elected to the Norwalk City Council  who also was that city's first woman mayor, died Wednesday of complications  after a heart attack. She was 64.  </P> <P> Mrs. Nelson, who used a wheelchair after suffering a stroke in 1984, had just  recently returned home after being hospitalized for injuries suffered in a Jan.  27 auto accident, said Norwalk spokeswoman Heather Morris.  </P> <P> She was taken Wednesday morning from her Norwalk home to Coast Plaza Medical  Center, where doctors pronounced her dead.  </P> <P> Mrs. Nelson was a member of the City Council from 1976 to 1988 and served each  of her four-year terms with the honorary title of mayor. She opted not to seek  reelection last year.  </P> <P> It was her volunteer work with several groups and organizations, including the  Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District, that she said led to her seeking  office.  </P> <P> In lieu of cards or flowers, her family asked for donations to the Norwalk  All-City Youth Band.  </P> <P> There will be no funeral services.  </P> <P> She is survived by her husband Lee, 65; three children, and five grandchildren.  </P></p>

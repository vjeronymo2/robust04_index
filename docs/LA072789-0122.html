			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS PROTEST BUSING OF STUDENTS FROM SCHOOL SHUT BY TARRY SEEPAGE  </P> <P> As hundreds of children began boarding school buses, more than 100 angry  parents Wednesday protested the busing of students from Park Avenue Elementary  School in Cudahy, where a tar-like substance seeping into the schoolyard forced  the school's closure.  </P> <P> Of the 650 students enrolled at Park Avenue, 244 failed to report for school  Wednesday, school officials said, many of them kept at home by parents who  opposed their busing to a South-Central Los Angeles school where they feared  possible gang violence.  </P> <P> Carrying placards and shouting, "Hell no! We won't go," the parents said they  were not sending their children to Russell Elementary School seven miles away  because it is too far from their community and located in a neighborhood they  consider unsafe.  </P> <P> "It is a bad, rough, gang-troubled area," said George Perez, a parent and one  of the leaders of the protest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dispel Notion  </P> <P> School officials, however, sought to dispel the notion that Russell Elementary  is unsafe and told parents that violence is not a problem at the school.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Leonard Britton last week issued an  order closing the year-round Park Avenue school after the Environmental  Protection Agency took samples of the substance in the schoolyard and launched  an investigation into it earlier this month.  </P> <P> For years, The tar-like ooze has periodically seeped through the playground  asphalt. Parents of some students attributed their children's skin rashes to  the substance, although school officials said there was no evidence that it had  made anyone sick.  </P> <P> Of the 244 students who did not report for classes Wednesday, school officials  said 23 were absent because of illness.  </P> <P> Some parents, such as Perez, said they would keep their children home until  school officials decided to transfer them to schools in the Cudahy area.  </P> <P> "I'll teach my children at home," said Delia Ramirez, a mother of an 8-year-old  third-grader and a 9-year-old fourth-grader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stressed Out'  </P> <P> Bernice Garcia, 15, picketing with her mother, Anna Garcia, said her sister,  Vanessa, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, was "too stressed out" to ride the bus.  </P> <P> "This whole thing has made her sick. She is stressed from what is happening  here," Anna Garcia said in Spanish.  </P> <P> School district officials said Russell Elementary at Firestone Boulevard and  Hooper Avenue is not plagued by gangs.  </P> <P> "Russell is a nice school. It is not in the middle of gang territory," said  Maria Casillas, superintendent for the school district region that includes  Cudahy.  </P> <P> Some Russell schoolteachers and administrators were on hand to greet the  arriving Park Avenue students.  </P> <P> "We are hurt by the image portraying our school as gang-infested. It isn't,"  teacher Devota Thomas said.  </P> <P> The move drew mixed reviews from the students.  </P> <P> A 10-year-old sixth-grader in teacher Francis Copeland-Newman's class at  Russell, did not like the idea.  </P> <P> "I don't live near here. I walked to Park Avenue. I wish I was back there," she  said.  </P> <P> A preliminary investigation by a private consultant for the school district  indicates that the substance oozing from beneath the asphalt "is highly  acidic." Health and environmental agency officials have said that students  could be endangered only if they eat the substance or come into prolonged  contact with it.  </P> <P> A portion of the school is built on a landfill, and the tar-like substance is  believed to come from the refuse and petroleum products that were dumped there.  </P> <P> School officials said it could take anywhere from 12 to 18 months to assess the  extent of the problem. The EPA test results are expected within three months.  </P></p>

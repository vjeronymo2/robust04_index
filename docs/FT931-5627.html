			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Conservative Hewson upstages Keating among the workers: Australia's opposition leader is doing a good job of looking at home with ordinary people THE conventional wisdom was clear: once the election campaign was under way, Mr Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, would walk all over Mr John Hewson, the inexperienced conservative leader. It has not happened. One of the few surprises in a largely predictable campaign has been the contrast between Mr Hewson's robust electioneering and the tentative efforts of the prime minister. Mr Keating's lacklustre performance appears to stem from his dislike of the aimless and occasionally unsettling round of publicity stunts intended to guarantee vital footage on the bulletins of the five television networks. Unlike Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister ousted after a leadership battle 15 months ago, Mr Keating looks uncomfortable chatting to pensioners in shopping centres or taking questions from ordinary voters. But Mr Hewson, leader of the Liberal/National Party coalition, has kept up a ceaseless whirl of activity which focuses as often as possible on exchanges with factory workers, shoppers, commuters, and even surfers taking a break from the waves. The conservative strategy is to get the media to show the opposition leader as often as possible in the company of ordinary people, especially those who might be thought of as natural Labor voters. It is a clever attempt to combat Mr Keating's coruscating parliamentary attacks on the alleged remoteness of the conservative leadership, which he has frequently labelled the 'born to rule brigade'. But the surprise is that Mr Hewson seems genuinely at ease among the voters, even when he knows that few of those he is talking to are likely to be conservative supporters. Touring a car plant in the industrial Melbourne suburb of Dandenong, he looks incongruous in a crisp white business shirt and striped tie, surrounded by oily machinery and boiler-suited fitters. The Greek, Italian and Lebanese names on the time clock near the door suggest that many of the workers are from Melbourne's large immigrant community, which traditionally gives solid support to Labor. Yet Mr Hewson is noticeably eager to talk to workers as well as managers. Most say afterwards that he seemed interested and asked sensible questions. A few say they might even vote for him. Later, he gives a bravura performance during a question and answer session at a public meeting in a marginal constituency. Heckled by demonstrators, he simply keeps talking until they give up and leave. His weakness is a tendency to use precious expressions such as 'golly gosh' and 'gee whiz' when under pressure. Many Australians find such language risible compared to the earthier tone of everyday conversation. Nevertheless, the campaign has shown that Mr Hewson is on the same wavelength as much of the electorate, giving credence to his claims that he is more in touch with ordinary aspirations than the avowedly populist Mr Keating. Some of his self-confidence comes from his conviction, fed by supportive opinion polls, that he is destined to become the first conservative prime minister for a decade when Australians go to the polls on March 13. But much stems from his view that Australia's faltering economy can be restored through the same combination of hard work and ruthless attention to detail which propelled him to the conservative leadership. Born in Beverley Hills, an unhappily named working class suburb in south-western Sydney, Mr Hewson emerged from the state school system to earn a doctorate in economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He worked for the International Monetary Fund before becoming a consultant to various merchant banks, professor of economics at the University of New South Wales and an adviser to Mr John Howard, treasurer (finance minister) in the conservative government defeated in 1983. Campaign officials say he is determined to use the opportunity offered by five weeks of constant national attention to throw off his Keating-inspired reputation for aloofness. Mr Hewson has always had a difficult relationship with journalists, which has limited his ability to project a sympathetic image through the press. He has also appeared tense on television in the past. But the uneasiness has disappeared during the campaign, replaced by a public demeanour which reflects more of his private ability to charm and persuade, sometimes with unexpected humour.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Yeltsin predicts agreement on nuclear arms cuts RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin predicted yesterday that he and US President George Bush would reach agreement on proposed radical reductions in long-range nuclear arms during their two-day summit meeting in Washington. 'When the presidents take charge of something you can be sure it will be handled in the most efficient way,' Mr Yeltsin told reporters before a working lunch with Mr James Baker, secretary of state. 'That means we will reach an agreement,' he said. Mr Baker and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, have been working in recent days on final details of a fresh arms accord aimed at cuts in long-range missiles, bombers and submarines which go far beyond reductions required under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start). Mr Bush yesterday welcomed Mr Yeltsin to the White House for 'a new kind of summit: not a meeting between two powers struggling for global supremacy but between two partners striving to build a democratic peace'. Mr Yeltsin made it clear that in asking for US economic support he did not wish to be treated as a supplicant. 'We have not come to ask your country to solve our problems for us. We have brought along ideas and proposals,' he said. 'We have things to offer to the American farmer, to the American industrialist and to the American banker.' White House officials hope Mr Yeltsin's visit will give a boost to their efforts to win congressional backing for a Russian aid bill, and Mr Bush used his official welcoming speech to urge Congress to act on the bill. Democratic leaders in Congress say, however, that the principal obstacle to bringing the bill forward has been insufficient support from members of the president's own Republican party. But the issues set to dominate the agenda for the meeting between the two leaders - nuclear disarmament, US aid to help smooth Russia's economic transformation, trade and investment co-operation, - were initially overshadowed yesterday by the possibility that some US prisoners of war might still be alive in Russia. Mr Yeltsin raised the possibility during his flight to Washington on Monday. He struck a chord in the US, which remains committed to bringing the physical remains of its war dead home. Opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of the public believes that US servicemen listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war are still held captive. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, spokesman for Mr Yeltsin, said newly opened KGB files showed a total of 2,800 Americans had been held in the Soviet Union after the two world wars and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. 'Many were interned, many were held in prisons. . . it is not excluded that some might be still living,' he said. Mr Yeltsin's motive in reopening the prisoner of war issue may be in part to move beyond the political and economic issues on the summit agenda, and to use his visit to kindle popular enthusiasm in the US for his reform programme - and, in the process, for US financial aid.</p>

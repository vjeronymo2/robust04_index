			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA PALMA;  </P> <P> SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT TO BE SET UP FRIDAY NIGHT  </P> <P> La Palma police plan to set up a sobriety checkpoint somewhere within the city  limits Friday night in an effort to deter drunk drivers.  </P> <P> The anti-drunk driving safeguard is the third in a series undertaken jointly by  police in La Palma, Cypress, Los Alamitos and Seal Beach. About 18 officers  from the four departments will make random stops of cars at the checkpoint,  speak briefly with the driver, and -- if necessary in the officer's judgment --  conduct a visual test of balance and coordination to spot possible drunk  drivers.  </P> <P> La Palma Police Chief Police Norman Hansen, citing the "psychological  influence" that advance notice of the program may have on those who might drink  and drive, stressed that the checkpoint "is not expected to produce a dramatic  number of arrests, but rather (to) reduce the number of drunk drivers."  </P> <P> The location of the checkpoint will be announced to media two hours before the  start of the checks, police said.  </P></p>

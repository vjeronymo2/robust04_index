			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was  held in Pyongyang today to observe the first anniversary of the  publication of "10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation for the Reunification of the country," a work of  the great leader President Kim Il-song.    The 10-point programme worked out and published by President  Kim Il-song on April 6, 1993, was adopted as a great political  charter common to the nation at the Fifth Session of the Ninth  Supreme People's Assembly.    The programme outlines the general purpose of great national  unity for founding an independent, peaceful and neutral  pan-national unified state through the great unity of the whole  nation, the ideological basis of great national unity for  uniting on the basis of patriotism and the spirit of national  independence, and the principle of unity for promoting  co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and  subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification.    The programme also comprehensively indicates practical ways  for great national unity such as ending all political disputes  and promoting trust and unity between the North and the South.    Kim Yong sun, secretary of the Central Committee of the  Workers' Party of Korea, in his report, said that the 10-point  programme, for the steadfast patriotic stand running through all  its points and its fair content, serves as a most reasonable and  realistic great political programme of national unity and a  great charter of national reunification acceptable to all who  truly love the country and the nation and want the reunification  of the country, irrespective of idea and religious belief,  system and political affiliation, and place of residence.    "The 10-point programme evoked the full sympathy and support  not only of the entire compatriots in the North, South and  overseas but also of the revolutionary people worldwide as soon  as it was published, and its invincible might and vitality have  been eloquently proven through practical life," he stated.    He called for rejecting the interference of outside forces  and paving the way for the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country with the great unity of the nation  under the banner of the 10-point programme.    To hasten national reunification through concerted efforts  of  the whole nation, both the North and the South must firmly  maintain the principle of national independence.    The South Korean authorities must relinquish the reckless  confrontation and war moves, repeal the "National Security Law"  hindering the nation's unity, dissolve the "Security Planning  Board", stop suppressing the patriotic students and people who  rose up for independence, democracy and reunification and set  free, at once, all political prisoners and prisoners of  conscience who are illegally detained.    The United States must discontinue its unjustifiable  campaign  of pressure upon the DPRK and take a proper stance for a  solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through  DPRK-U.S. talks.    The United Nations Security Council must maintain a fair  stand as an international organization, abandoning such unfair  double standard attitude as not calling in question the United  States and the South Korean authorities, its servants,  increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula  and as turning a blind eye to the countries engaged in dangerous  nuclear development under the aegis of the United States, while  putting unjust pressure upon the DPRK which is conducting  nuclear activities for peaceful purpose.    The patriotic democratic movement organizations in South  Korea and the organizations of the National Alliance for the  Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) at home and abroad should  intensify various forms of mass movement to implement the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and  invigorate dialogues and contacts between the North, the South  and the overseas sides.    The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member  of C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and  vice-president, and other officials concerned.</p>

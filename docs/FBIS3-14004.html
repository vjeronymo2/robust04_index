			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jammu's Explosion"] </F>   [Text] The explosions that occurred in Jammu cannot be  dismissed as simple incidents of terrorism. Government spokesmen  and political leaders became silent after calling these blasts  cowardly acts and announcing financial relief to those who were  killed or wounded. The police will go through the formality of  announcing an additional increase in security. Yet this has  happened again and again. Governor General Krishna Rao has  appealed to the people not to be deceived by the terrorists, who  want only to increase communal tensions. Does the governor hope  that when there are bomb blasts in a busy market that remind  them of the blasts in Bombay, when people are killed or hurt and  there is great bedlam in the market, that people will not get  angry and demonstrate against the government and the police? If  this was the case, then we would suspect that the apathy of the  people in Jammu had reached its extreme, and that even the most  serious incident cannot affect them. The Kashmir government  should be thankful to the people that it was the police on which  the angry youths focused their outrage and not on a specific  group. But it is also important to understand that if more of  these incidents occurred, it would be very difficult to remain  calm. Therefore, the Jammu-Kashmir government should correct the  problems in its police administration. The armed terrorist  organizations in the Kashmir valley have gotten the support of  the people in special circumstances. They have succeeded in  establishing a reign of terror in the valley. If they succeed in  doing the same thing in Jammu, though, it would be very  difficult to fight the resulting anarchy. The entire  administrative machinery of Jammu-Kashmir is ineffective,  because the government is unable to get proper information about  anti-national and terrorist activities. Therefore, after every  incident, they make statements in a hurry, they seem to have no  other alternative.    It is surprising because the government knew that due to the  powerful campaign by Pakistan, there would be increased  terrorist activity. Because of the increased security in the  valley and in Doda, it was natural for the terrorists to attack  the softer, easier targets in Jammu. Pakistan wants to show that  the control of the Indian government in Jammu-Kashmir has ended,  and that the whole state has rebelled. The Pakistan supporters  argued in Geneva that it is not the Pakistani terrorists, but  the local people in Kashmir, that are fighting the war for  independence. The Jammu bomb blasts, therefore, should be seen  in this context. All members of Parliament have declared  Jammu-Kashmir an integral part of India and have repeated their  determination to free the part of Kashmir currently under  Pakistan's control. The central home minister is planning to  accelerate economic development processes in Kashmir. However,  all these promises will be on paper until they are implemented  and an honest, effective police and administration are  established in the state. The fact is that the Kashmir problem  was created by poor government administration. Therefore, if the  Indian government wants to give a proper and effective response  to Pakistan's anti-India tirade, then it should dispose of the  other political biases and start overhauling the administration  in Jammu-Kashmir. The political party will benefit from this  strategy because, in the present situation, no politics can be  practiced there. The national determination expressed in  Parliament should also be applied to the formation of an  effective national strategy.  *</p>

During the ceremony, which began with a recital of verses  from the Koran, brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of  the Presidential Council, delivered a speech in which he  congratulated the graduates on their success in the course and  on the approach of the holy month of Ramadan, wishing the Yemeni  people many happy returns full of good fortune, welfare, and  happiness.    He said the Political Forces Dialogue Committee today will  finalize arrangements for the signing of the document of pledge  and accord which the political forces completed last month. He  hoped that the political leadership will sign this document  within a week from today. This document was completed after a  lengthy dialogue among the political forces because of the  crisis which our country has been facing since 9 August 1993.    The brother member of the Presidential Council said that the  crisis had negative effects on the various political, economic,  and social fields, noting that it resulted in many things we  hoped will never happen and the consquences of which will be  assumed by those who caused it. He hoped that after the signing  of the document, our country will enter a new stage of security,  stability, and serious action in order to compensate for the  events of the past period in which matters reached a state of  paralysis in all parts of the country.    He added that thanks to God almighty and Yemeni wisdom, the  Yemeni people and their political forces resorted to dialogue as  a means to resolve problems. He noted that the dialogue led to  this document to which we are committed and which we will  implement, in text and spirit, because it contains many  guidelines for tackling a number of political issues in local  government, economic and security issues, the Armed Forces, and  other issues that were the cause of this crisis.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghani hoped that the graduates will perform  their  duty in this important security field with absolute sincerity  and dedication. He noted that all our Yemeni people and those  working at the Interior Ministry, who shoulder a primary  responsibility of maintaining the country's security and  stability, should pay more attention to security in our country.    Concluding his speech, he congratulated the graduates and  valued the teaching staff's great efforts and sincere work to  render this course a success. [passage omitted]</p>

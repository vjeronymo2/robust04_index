			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Concern at 'fragility' of training policy FURTHER evidence of govern-ment concern at the 'fragility' of its training policy is disclosed in a strategy paper by Sir Geoffrey Holland, permanent secretary at the Department of Employment. He says the 'initial enthusiasm' of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales has been 'dented' and adds that not all Tecs are fully effective. The main anxiety mentioned in the paper is the ability of Tecs to work with the education service and meet the government's targets for skill levels among young people. 'There is a big (but declining) gap between the achievements of young people and the target achievement,' the paper adds. Sir Geoffrey says that a shortage of resources has prevented Tecs from playing a full part in stimulating growth in the Investors In People scheme. 'We need to address ourselves to how to transform IIP into the flagship it ought to be - and must be if we are to succeed,' he writes. On an institutional level the paper states: 'Tecs clearly need to develop rapidly and professionally their partnership with education . . . Few have made much progress in this area.' Sir Geoffrey also highlights the tension between meeting government training guarantees for the unemployed and achieving training targets for those in work. That has been echoed by many Tec chairmen, some of whom would like the freedom to transfer resources from the large schemes for the unemployed - Youth Training and Employment Training - to other training initiatives. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, called for a thorough stocktaking of the success and failure of the Tec experiment but expressed opposition to any move to shift resources away from training the unemployed.</p>

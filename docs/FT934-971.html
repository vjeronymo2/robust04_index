			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Companies 'still set pay centrally' Payroll budgets are still centrally determined by the finance department in most large companies, in spite of the trend towards decentralised bargaining, a survey by Warwick Business School shows. The survey, of 176 companies each employing more than 1,000 people, also found that only 30 per cent have a main board personnel director and that the personnel department has a greater role in policing rather than in setting paybill objectives. Personnel staff play the lead role in setting budgets in only 7 per cent of companies. The survey is the first of its kind to interview finance directors as well as personnel specialists, and confirms the view that decision-taking in UK companies is shaped by the organisation's system of financial control. More than half the companies set a target for unit labour costs. In the 1991-92 pay-round, for example, most companies assumed a 'going rate' of 4 per cent to 5 per cent for pay increases, a median productivity increase of 3 per cent and a median headcount decrease of 4 per cent. The survey also shows that negotiations are not a formality and that in just more than half the companies they led to substantial changes in budgets. In most cases, however, the change was to reduce the budget assumption, not to increase it. Half of the companies had no separate budgets for training and only half of respondents on the finance side were able to put a figure on what they spent on training. Evaluation of the effectiveness of training expenditure took place in only 13 per cent of companies. Trade unions were recognised in 69 per cent of companies, with more than half of them bargaining on a site-by-site basis. Nearly one-in-five companies had wholly or partially de-recognised unions at existing sites in the past five years. Sixty per cent of large companies in the UK are multi-nationals and one-fifth are foreign-owned. Foreign-owned companies were more likely to have a personnel director on the main board, spend relatively highly on training and communicate frequently with employees.

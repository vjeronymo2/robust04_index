			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kokhet Chanthaloetlak and Watsana Nauam: "Wimon </F> Puts the Country `at Ease'"]    [Text] The reputation of the Army was badly damaged by the  May 1992 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on  Ratchadamnoen Avenue. Certain officers were accused of ordering  troops to brutally suppress protesters demanding the ouster of  non-elected prime minister Suchinda Khraprayun.    After Gen Suchinda stepped down in disgrace shortly after  the  upheaval, several key military members were transferred to  inactive posts, including former Army chief Itsaraphong  Nunphakdi, ex-Air Force commander Kaset Rotchananin and former  First Army Region commander Chainarong Nunphakdi.    Many "professional" officers were promoted to key positions,  replacing "political" officers. Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon  Wongwanit is one of the so-called professional officers,  although he's a graduate of the once-powerful Class 5 of the  Chunlachomklao Royal Military Academy and a classmate of Gen  Suchinda and Gen Itsaraphong.    Gen Wimon has on several occasions reiterated his policy of  non- interference in politics and has vowed to promote  democracy. He clearly sides with the government in dealing with  the current political situation precipitated by Chalat  Worachat's hunger strike.    "A person who fasts must die. If he does not fast he will  not die. Being fed with saline solution is not a fast, and  (Chalat) will not die," Wimon said recently.    He has said the Army belongs to the King and the people. The  Army is an agency of the government, so it must perform in line  with government policy.    In his statement on June 7, he reiterated that the Army  would  side with the elected government of Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai. This does not only mean the Army will throw its weight  behind the government, but also implies there are still  "insidious power seekers" in the Army, and Wimon realizes the  fact and thus has to make his stand clear to them.    These people want political changes which would be followed  by transfers of officers who now hold powerful posts.    It has been reported that some "brokenhearted" officers --  those whose careers were affected by the 1992 upheaval -- remain  uncomfortable about their future.    Many are officers who had close relationships with the old  power clique in the Army. It's of little surprise then that  these officers have felt uneasy since their bosses were  transferred to inactive posts.    After being promoted to the Army's top post, Wimon did not  sweep clean the Army as expected by observers. That would have  been acceptable to Army personnel.    If Wimon did purge officers loyal to the old clique, there  would have been chaos in the Army. Many officers who hold key  combat posts, including commanders of divisions, regiments and  battalions, remain loyal to the old clique.    In annual transfers under Wimon's command, only a few  officers regarded as subordinates retaining loyalty to the old  power clique have been transferred to inactive posts. Many  have, indeed, even been promoted to important positions.    But the annual round of transfers in September will be  another story. There are signs that there will be changes among  commanders of combat units. Some officers loyal to the old  clique have held key positions for too long because they have  "immunity". And it's time for them to be transferred to  inactive posts.    This would break a systematical inheritance of power set up  by graduates of Class 5 four years ago.    When Suchinda was appointed prime minister, Itsaraphong  succeeded him as Army chief. It was clear then that after  Itsaraphong retired this year, the post of Army chief would go  to Lt Gen Wirot Saengsanit, who will retire in 1996.    And after Wirot, the heirs apparent are Chainarong and then  Samphao Chusi. Commanders of key combat units were also  affected. Chainarong's colleagues from Class 11 were put in  control of important combat units.    For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional virtue.  It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still loyal to  the old power clique that once rewarded them with key posts.    For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional  virtue. It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still  loyal to the old power clique that once rewarded them with key  posts.    But in a recent reshuffle at the level of battalion  commanders, which has not yet been publicly announced, there is  a sign the best days of officers standing by the old clique are  over, according to sources.    Earlier this year, sources in an intelligence unit said  certain Army officers had tried to approach an opposition party  leader, who was tipped to be a strong candidate to become the  next prime minister.    The sources said they developed a decent relationship with  the politician because they were backed by newspaper columnists  close to the opposition party leader.    During the May crisis, one graduate of Class 5 was not  involved in the brutal crackdown on protesters, but his career  was nevertheless affected. He was transferred to an inactive  post at the Office of the Permanent Secretary of Defence. He  was then a favorite candidate to succeed Itsaraphong as Army  chief when the latter retires this year.    The officer has wondered why he was targeted. His aides who  were tipped to succeed him as Army commander were hurt too. The  "power line" prepared for them had been cut and their way to the  top blocked.    The plans for the post of Army chief to go from Suchinda to  Itsaraphong, then Chainarong and Samphao, could not be realized.  Lt Gen Chainarong is now commandant of the Institute of Army  Academics. Although he still has a chance to return to an active  post, his path is not smooth.    Chainarong's image has been tainted since the May upheaval.  He's been accused of being directly involved in the bloodshed  by ordering troops to open fire because he was commander of the  First Army Region, which oversees the capital.    Since the May incident, there have been attempts to regain  power by the old power clique, who were suspected to be involved  in a spate of violence in the South and elsewhere in the country.    Sources in intelligence agencies said the violence was aimed  at overthrowing the Chuan administration as soon as possible.  This would open the way for them to regain power.    The old power clique comprises the people who used to have  political power and certain "undisciplined" officers.    Certain officers believe that if former deputy Army chief  Wirot, who is now deputy defence permanent secretary, comes back  to succeed Gen Wimon, who is due to retire in 1995, the arranged  power line would be in effect again. Wirot's reputation has not  been tainted by the May 1992 events, but he was transferred to  an inactive post because certain senior officers wanted to clean  the Army of Wirot, a classmate of Suchinda and Itsaraphong.  Senior officers also want to sever the line blocking the  promotion of other officers.    It is justified to promote Wirot to be Army chief succeeding  Gen Wimon because of his clean image. Wirot is due to retire in  1996.    Such a promotion could be realized only when there are  changes in political power. There must be a prime minister and  a defence minister who would agree to such a move.    Certain powerful columnists are reportedly backing the old  power clique, using their columns to justify campaigns to oust  the government.    Although leaders of the Armed Forces have repeatedly vowed  that they would not stage a coup, some groups of people still  fear that other officers would turn to the outdated method of  power seizure.    An opinion poll, conducted by Suan Dusit Teachers' College  and publicized in May, showed that a lot of people disagree with  military coups. The poll and Wimon's statement on June 7 have  been regarded as a tool to stop the "underwater tide".    The old power clique can do nothing at the moment because of  the people's strong opposition to military coups. They have  opted to conduct underground campaigns, recently spreading a  rumour that a group of officers had travelled to Hong Kong to  discuss the possibility of staging a coup.    Officers who are also senators have tried to hurt  relationships between the government and permanent officials,  and between Chuan and Wimon.    They want Chuan to lose confidence in Wimon, and Wimon to  have sour relations with the press.    But Wimon knows about the plans, and isn't about to fall  into  the trap.</p>

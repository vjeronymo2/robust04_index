			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC PLANT PROFILE: AUTUMN CROCUS  </P> <P> AUTUMN CROCUS (Colchicum autumnale):  </P> <P> The toxic properties of this flowering bulb -- not a true crocus at all, but a  lily -- have been known since medieval times, and the plant has been used in  folk remedies and in witches' potions. Today, the toxic alkaloid colchicine  found in the plant is used to combat gout and in treating a kind of cancer,  granulocytic leukemia. Concentrated in the bulb, the toxic element in the  autumn crocus can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, trembling,  paralysis, coma and even death if enough is ingested.  </P></p>

Although Figueres has not officially announced his cabinet,  some of his associates who refused to be identified said former  ministers, ambassadors, and deputies have been asked to be part  of the next government of this country that has a population of  3.2 million.    According to the sources, former Minister Fernando Naranjo  will occupy the top post at the Foreign Ministry; Deputy  Alejandro Soto will head the Information and Communications  Ministry; Carlos Espinach, who directed Figueres' election  campaign, will lead the Presidency Ministry; Fernando Herrero  will head the Planning Ministry; Eduardo Doryan will be in  charge of the Housing Ministry; and Bernardo Arce will lead the  Government and Public Security Ministry. Former Deputy Planning  Minister Leonardo Garnier is being considered as a possible  candidate for the Finance Ministry position, while hotel owner  Carlos Roesch is being mentioned for the top post at the Tourism  Ministry.    Also mentioned are Roberto Solorzano, one of Figueres'  closest associates in the campaign, to lead the Culture  Ministry; Mario Carvajal to head either the Economy or Foreign  Trade Ministry; Francisco Nicolas to assume the top post at the  Transportation Ministry; and former Comptroller General Elias  Soler to take up the reins of the Labor Ministry.

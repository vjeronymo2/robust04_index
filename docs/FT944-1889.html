			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Dog days in a year that matched its name - Hong Kong / Bearish sentiment has plagued stock prices. Will 1995 be any better? The Hang Seng index, Hong Kong's stock market barometer, improved nearly 5 per cent this week. But this technical rebound, achieved on the back of thin turnover, has done little to detract from the bearish sentiment that has plagued stock prices since the beginning of the year. This sentiment has ensured that, in the Year of the Dog, the Hong Kong market has proved to be just that for investors. After a promising start, which saw the index peak at over 12,000 just four days into the new year, Hong Kong stock prices have succumbed to rising interest rates, falling property prices, and fears over the Chinese economy's ability to engineer a soft landing. The index is now 33 per cent off the January 4 peak. In recent weeks, fund managers have been selling down the market in a bid to raise cash to meet redemptions - a reversal of the institutional activity this time last year when foreign funds were reputed to be buying anything with China, or even Asia, in its name. The prospects for the traditional lunar new year rally (the new year falls at the end of January) look increasingly dim, although many brokerage houses are predicting a turnaround in 1995. Stuart Cook, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities, says a mix of attractive valuations and flattening yield curves should turn the tide for equity performances, especially in the second half of next year. The Hong Kong market is now trading on a price/earnings multiple of around 10 times 1995 earnings. He says: 'In the first half of 1995, we will see more pain coming through on the interest rate front, with short-term rates continuing to rise fairly swiftly but the long end has now stabilised. 'By the second half of 1995, (US) Fed rates will be more or less up to where they are going, so a lot of the pain will be finished - which ought to be good news (for equities).' Corporate earnings across the board are expected to grow at only 17 per cent in 1995, compared with 19 per cent this year. One reason for this drop is the expected inability of developers to to maintain earnings momentum. The US-led interest rate rises, fed through to Hong Kong via the dollar/Hong Kong dollar currency peg, also have taken their toll on the property market. Around 40 per cent of the Hang Seng is exposed to the property market. But the sector has chalked up some of the year's biggest losses as the cost of servicing mortgages has risen and developers have been forced to trim the cost of new projects. The sector first fell out of favour in March when Chris Patten, the colony's governor, announced his intention to set up a task force to look into the over-heating property market. This bid to temper prices came after a 200 per cent increase over three years in the cost of homes. The task force's recommendations, aimed largely at speculators, were implemented in June and these, together with rises in interest rates, have sliced around 15 to 20 per cent off home prices this year. Standard Chartered bank is looking for a further fall of 10 to 15 per cent next year; others expect to see still bigger drops. Political events have played little part on the sentiment-driven Hong Kong market this year, just as last year's Sino-British wrangling failed to avert the index from soaring ever higher on a flood of liquidity . But the decision by the Jardine camp to de-list from Hong Kong, allied to further attacks from China - which claimed the company had been awarded a container terminal contract unfairly in return for political favours - sent its shares tumbling. In China, premature but frequent reports of the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping drove the index lower, as did fears over out-of-control inflation and bad debts. The debts issue hit the headlines when Lehman Brothers said it would sue three of China's biggest trading companies for failing to pay Dollars 100m alleged to be owing from foreign exchange trading. Hong Kong's fortunes are linked closely with those of the Republic although, so far, investment in domestic China has been modest. Instead, companies are focused on export-oriented industries in southern China which, says Cook, will benefit only as Europe and Japan, moving out of recession, increase spending.</p>

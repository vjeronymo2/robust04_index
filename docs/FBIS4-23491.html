			<p>BFN     [Text] Pietermaritzburg June 4 SAPA -- Newly-elected  National Party [NP] KwaZulu/Natal provincial leader Danie  Schutte paid tribute to his predecessor George Bartlett at an NP  special congress in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday [4 June].    Former Home Affairs Minister Mr Schutte replaced Mr  Bartlett,  who has been appointed provincial MEC [member of executive  committee] for agriculture. The congress was called to formally  adopt the NP's new federal constitution and elect new office  bearers.    Mr Bartlett had led the NP in Natal through four-and-a-half  difficult years, Mr Schutte said. "In those years he  consolidated support in this province for the reform process;  confirmed the principles of federalism, also to the benefit of  this province; and played a major role in ensuring there was an  inclusive settlement and a peaceful transition and election  process."    Mr Bartlett had also played a major role in fostering good  relations and stability in the province, he said.    The NP's greatest feat was the implementation of a new  constitutional dispensation, but this was only the beginning of  its mission. The party now had to make the new constitution  work in the interests of all the people, and to ensure minority  and group rights were respected.    In KwaZulu/Natal, the NP had to ensure the provincial  constitution was fair to all population groups and would ensure  growth, stability and prosperity. "It is sad that it appears  the spirit of a government of national unity has not yet  permeated KwaZulu/Natal. Everything has taken so long to happen  here," Mr Schutte said.</p>

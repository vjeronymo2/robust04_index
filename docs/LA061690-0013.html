			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATH OF AUTO SHOP OWNER  </P> <P> A tip from a witness led to the arrest Friday of a man believed to be involved  in the shooting death Thursday of a West Los Angeles transmission shop owner  who was killed during a robbery in which cash and an expensive Rolex watch were  taken.  </P> <P> It was the second incident in Los Angeles this week in which the theft of a  Rolex led to death.  </P> <P> Police on Friday arrested Phillip Conrad Sanders, 38, in the shooting death of  Melvin Thompson, 49, owner of Kayser's Service in the 11000 block of Santa  Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> Police said a tip from a witness led them to a Sylmar house where Sanders had  been staying. A second man was still being sought Friday.  </P> <P> Sanders was being held without bail at the West Los Angeles police station  after he was booked on suspicion of murder, Detective Andy Monsue said.  </P> <P> Police believe that Sanders was the gunman who shot and killed Thompson as he  was closing up shop for the night.  </P> <P> Police declined to release many details of the incident.  </P> <P> However, they said the gunman entered the shop, took an undetermined amount of  cash and then took the watch from Thompson, who was alone.  </P> <P> During the incident, Thompson was shot several times but it was not clear if he  was shot before or after the robbery or if he struggled with the gunman.  </P> <P> The gunman then fled in a car driven by a second man, whom police have not been  able to identify, Monsue said. A witness saw the car fleeing the scene and  jotted down the license number, police said. Police, using that information,  traced Sanders to the Sylmar home.  </P> <P> Thompson's wife of 10 years, Catherine, was on her way to the shop to pick up  her husband at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> Approaching the garage, "I heard what I thought was backfire," but someone told  her that a man with a gun had entered the shop. She fled, she said, and called  911 from a pay phone.  </P> <P> Thompson was taken to the UCLA Medical Center where he died at 7:30 p.m.  Thursday.  </P> <P> Catherine Thompson said her husband never took the watch to work, bringing it  out only on "weekends and special occasions."  </P> <P> "He never wore it to the shop," she said. But he decided he would take it to a  jeweler Thursday. "He had lost some weight and he needed to have some links  taken out."  </P> <P> Thompson, his wife said, did not worry about his safety because he considered  it a relatively safe neighborhood. Still, he told her that if someone ever held  up the store while she was working, she should turn over all the money without  arguing, she said.  </P> <P> Catherine Thompson said her husband's shop had been burglarized several times  before, including once about three months ago.  </P> <P> "It's going to be hard," she said, sobbing.  </P> <P> Her grief was shared by others who knew Thompson. "He was a nice guy who always  tried to help people," said Patty Downs, a secretary from Bud Hand Sports Car  Co., located across the street from Kayser's. "He would do anything you asked.  He even loaned money to street people."  </P> <P> Thompson's death marked the second shooting in a week tied to the theft of a  Rolex watch, which can range in value from $950 to $23,000. On Tuesday, a  42-year-old man was shot in his newly purchased Beverly Hills home by a gunman  who struggled with him over one of the watches.  </P> <P> Renee Grissin, spokeswoman for Rolex, a New York City-based watch company, said  she was aware of the two incidents in Los Angeles, but had not received word of  similar thefts in other areas.  </P> <P> Detective Monsue said police were exploring the possibility that Thompson's  killer was someone he knew previously -- either as a customer or an  acquaintance.  </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Resort suspended The shock suspension of shares in Resort Hotels sent reverberations around the hotel sector, impacting in particular on the market's other leading small regional hotelier Friendly Hotels, which fell 21 to 198. Resort shares were suspended at 45p, the company concerned 'over a number of financing and reporting issues' and sacking its managing director. An independent accountants report is being commissioned. Leisure analysts, philosophical at the second suspension to hit the sector this year following Queens Moat Houses, said that while the information flow from Resort could have been better, concern over the company's debt levels had already put the stock on a low rating. One analyst said: 'The most worrying aspect is that Queens Moat and Resort, which are both specific situations, could frighten off investors from the sector just at the time when it's beginning to take off.' There were no such worries at Forte yesterday as the company said it was increasing the size of its floating rate note announced on July 9 from Pounds 70m to Pounds 100m. The proceeds would be used to cut its short-term debt. Forte shares gained 2 to 222p. Meanwhile, the insurance sector was alive with bid speculation. The strongest of the many rumours doing the rounds was that Commercial Union was eyeing Sun Alliance. The latter held a near-15 per cent stake in the former until it was sold last September. However one analyst dismissed the speculation saying it was nothing but 'idle summer talk. Such a deal does not make sense.' Shares in Commercial Union closed 4 ahead at 620p, on volume of 1.1m, with Sun Alliance up 6 at 378p, in trade of 1.7m. Another name mentioned as a possible target for Commercial Union was Guardian Royal Exchange. The shares firmed 4 to 203p. The bid talk in the sector boosted Royal Insurance which closed 3 up at 322p on heavy turnover of 4.7m. An upbeat agm statement from Thorn EMI helped the shares climb 8 to 920p. The stock was also boosted by a hefty buy note from Smith New Court. Analyst Mr Bruce Jones said: 'Thorn is ideally positioned to exploit the growth of world music markets and, with advances in rental, should produce significant benefits to shareholders.' Another torrid day's trading saw Rank Organisation tumble initially on a wave of criticism over its dividend policy announced on Thursday. But the shares rallied during the session to close 8 off at 739p. After Thursday's shock announcement on enfranchising its non-voting shares, Great Universal Stores continued to make ground, the 'A' shares adding 35 to 1910p. Next, where GUS is tipped to go shopping in the near future, gained 2 1/2 to 177p. International trading group Inchcape fell 7 to 528p, on volume of 3.5m after James Capel was reported to have downgraded current year profit expectations by Pounds 10m to Pounds 290m. Sentiment was also said to have been damaged by the cancellation of a series of briefings to analysts usually held just before the company goes into closed season. Another resurgence of rights issues rumours knocked Tarmac down 2 1/2 to 127p. Although the story has hovered over the stock, the company's on-going review of its housing division has rekindled the speculation. Turnover was moderate at 2.7m. The selling of its loss-making housebuilding company by Costain Group pushed down its price 3 to 36p. The purchase by Redrow was well known, but the staggered payment arrangement disappointed some analysts.</p>

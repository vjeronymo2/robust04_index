			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories look to capitalise on 'new' outlook - North-East: The region remains a Labour heartland NISSAN'S Sunderland plant, exporting cars to Japan; the derelict Teesside land where Mrs Margaret Thatcher took her 1987 'walk in the wilderness', redeveloped for service industries; these are symbols on which the Conservatives will seek to capitalise in the fight to keep their four north-east England seats. 'The NEW North East', proclaimed from government-funded Development Corporation hoardings, will be a recurrent Tory theme in this Labour heartland. 'The region's changing; we've moved away from the smokestack industries. It has new businesses, new industries, it's breaking down socially  - there are fewer Andy Capps,' says Darlington MP Mr Michael Fallon, the only minister with a seat in the 30 constituencies between the Scottish border and North Yorkshire. Mr Neville Trotter, Tynemouth's Tory MP since 1974, insists: 'As people move away from the highly unionised old industry, they are becoming much more in line with the rest of the country.' The north-east has undergone profound change. The proportion of the workforce employed in coal, steel and shipbuilding has shrunk from one third to 2.5 per cent. Its environment has improved as heavy industry has dwindled. High crime levels aside, the region arguably offers a quality of life unsurpassed in the UK for those fortunate enough to be in well-paid, secure jobs. The Tories need good news in a region where a 2.5 per cent swing to Labour would cost them not only Stockton South, held by Mr Tim Devlin in 1987 by just 774 votes, but also Tynemouth (majority 2,583) and Darlington (majority 2,661). Even Hexham (majority 8,066), the only north-east seat which has been Tory since 1945, has difficulties  - it entered the campaign without a candidate after the resignation of MP Mr Alan Amos. North-east Tories are a dogged bunch; it takes more conviction to be a Conservative in Easington than Esher. In many respects Labour is the region's establishment. Academic observers, such as Professor John Goddard of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies, dispute the Tories' assertion that industrial change equals political change. 'I don't think there's a one-to-one relationship between the two,' says Prof Goddard. 'The history of this region is deep-seated. Traditional values are still there.' Mr Andrew MacMullen, lecturer in politics at Durham University, says Labour continues to enjoy strong cross-class support. This year's 'state of the region' report by the Labour-dominated Northern Region Councils Association says the area has fewer clerical, managerial and professional workers than the national average, lower household incomes and England's lowest proportion of those aged 16 and over in education. The region still has mainland Britain's highest unemployment rate. Tories argue that Labour would jeopardise the progress made. Privately they hope that, having suffered an above-average 7 per cent regional swing against them in 1987, any swing this time will be far smaller. In Stockton South, a three-way marginal, Mr Devlin's strongest chance lies in the decision of ex-Labour and ex-SDP MP Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, narrowly defeated in 1987, not to stand this time. In Darlington, Mr Fallon's status as schools minister may help him, though his strident views may cost him votes. Both he and his Labour opponent, Mr Alan Milburn, have intellectual bite and a taste for a fight. In Tynemouth, the Tories will attack the spending of Labour-controlled North Tyneside Council: Labour candidate Mr Paddy Cosgrove is a member. The constituency's Meadow Well Estate, scene of riots last year, could be an electoral liability for Mr Cosgrove or Mr Trotter. Apart from a criminal element and feckless parenting, Mr Trotter traces the Meadow Well's difficulties to the loss of jobs in fisheries after the 1970s 'Cod Wars' and shipbuilding's move to high technology. In the new north-east, the past keeps breaking through.</p>

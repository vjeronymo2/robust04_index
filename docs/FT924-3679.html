			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: Fairy tales drawn in unexpected terms - The recent work of Paula Rego PAULA Rego's career is rather more than a simple matter of the personal exploration and development in the work, rapid and remarkable though these have been these past dozen years. Lately it has taken on an increasing importance as one of reassertion, bringing back into the centre of interest narrative art which has, for too long, been distrusted and neglected. Narrative may have sustained the great tradition of western art, sacred and profane, from the renaissance to the romantics of the 19th century, but to set up as a narrative painter in the context of modernism was to invite, at best, the charge of irrelevance, at worst that of the sentimental and the illustrative. Rising above all that, Paula Rego, since the early 1980s, has found the proper subject of her art in the fairy stories told her long ago in her native Portugal, and the darkly remembered, half-forgotten, ambiguous, embroidered incidents of her own distant childhood. And having found it, simply by getting on with it, she has turned herself into perhaps the most powerful, certainly the most intriguing figurative painter of her generation (she is now 57). The drawing is bold and simple, the handling of the paint direct, uncomplicated, effective, the space clearly established. The forms and figure too are no less clearly described in conventional terms, and we can see all too well, though perhaps not always quite make out, what is going on, who is doing what to whom, and where and why. By degrees we recognise the formal tricks and games that are being played, the iconographical references, the signs and symbols. In whichever little scene or episode, the scale and size of the protagonists shifts and changes, just as the importance of a character is relative within the childish imagination, or equally so in the narrative predellae of any early renaissance altar-piece. Her work thus is illustrative in the old, true and honourable sense, telling a story that we either know well, though stated in so much fresher or perhaps unexpected terms, or may reinvent for ourselves. She is, therefore, a natural and obvious artist to turn her attention to illustration as such. Not surprisingly, the larger part of this exhibition is taken up with the portfolio of etchings she has recently produced to illustrate the Folio Society's new edition of Peter Pan in Barrie's original text, along with the related ink and watercolour studies, and drawings, for other projects: The Wide Sargasso Sea and The Ferry Girl. There is also a number of large watercolour paintings made last summer on holiday at Estoril. The formal strength and the wit and inventiveness of her imagination are all clear enough. She relishes the play of light and dark, quite as much in metaphorical as in practical terms: the hens on the open hillside, the more sinister peacocks in the cooler undergrowth, the mass innocently at play, the darker forces massing unseen. It is this quality she has, of recognising and expressing the sinister and the macabre, and most especially the child's horrified fascination with matters of sex and death, that makes her not merely a brilliant and original exponent within the terms set by her own work, but one of considerable, more general, importance. For we live now in a timid and sentimental age, and are inclined to forget a truth that was always recognised before: that the cautionary tale and fairy story are among the devices whereby the child may begin to come to terms imaginatively with the awful truths of life and death. The Brothers Grimm were a far cry from Walt Disney, and Strewelpeter from the Pink Panther. What Disney has made safe, he has also, like pasteurised milk, rendered inert, and the delicious frisson of the old stories become almost a kind of child abuse. In rescuing Peter Pan from the vapid and the sentimental, and returning it to us as the darker, infinitely more equivocal story that Barrie wrote, as we now know, to exorcise his own demons, Miss Rego does us a service perhaps greater than she realises or intended. The service remains for all that, and done with a splendid geniality and malevolent glee, even as the Mermaid pushes Wendy to drown beneath the waves, or Tiger Lily is tied up to die at the Marooners' Rock, or the Lost Boys unwillingly succumb to the Pirates. And always there is Captain Hook, with Wendy on his arm. Paula Rego: Peter Pan &amp; Other Stories: Marlborough Fine Art &amp; Graphics, 6 Albemarle Street, W1, until January 30.</p>

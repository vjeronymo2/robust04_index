			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Mixed blessings on offer in the first set - Venice Film Festiva / Nigel Andrews views some multi-nation hybrids Planning a film festival programme is like seeding a tennis tournament. How do you place your best players for maximum effect? How do you make sure Antonioni does not knock out Bergman in the early rounds - by colliding too closely in the viewer's first-week memory - or that the final head-to-head is not between Mr Unheard-Of from Thuringia and Miss Token Feminist from Thirdworldia? Venice's Gillo Pontecorvo decided on a bold solution this year: schedule all the resistible stuff in the first four days, and clear the courts for a final week of Ermanno Olmi, Wim Wenders, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone and other class players. This is good news for almost everyone. The only loser is the critic writing on the morning of the fifth day. Peering into his memory bank, he sees a jumble of nightmare celluloid more suggestive of a mad scientist let loose in a genetic engineering lab than of opening days at the movie equivalent of Wimbledon. There was the Anglo-Macedonian film about civil war, Before The Rain; an Anglo-Hungarian offering about magic bullets and mystical rabbits, called Magic Hunter; an Italian-Hungarian-Croatian film about bull-stealing, Il Toro; the Italian film called Lamerica that never got to L'America; and the New York-set drama Little Odessa in which an Austrian (Maximilian Schell) and two Brits (Tim Roth and Vanessa Redgrave) play a Russian-American immigrant family. We know co-productions mean multi-national investment, but this is ridiculous. The best two films at Venice so far - may the lesson be learned  -were the mono-cultural Long Live Love, a Taiwanese production, and the almost likewise Loaded. 'Almost' because New Zealand director Anna Campion, sister of Jane of The Piano fame, strayed into Britain to make this psychodrama-cum-black-comedy. But then no two cultures are more compatible than those of NZ and the UK. Same language, same repressive wholesomeness, same ability to find nightmares under the tea table. The film is about seven youngsters dossing in a country mansion making a horror video. In the process they uncover secrets about themselves which prove more X-certificate than the shoestring shocker they are shooting - this being a kind of splatter version of an Esther Williams musical. Campion's first feature is hauntingly assured. It takes what could have been a ragbag of moth-eaten conventions - old dark house, sexual-jealousy chamber drama, idiot-youth comedy a la Withnail And I - and after briefly deconstructing each, quilts them seamlessly into collective character study. The film is deeply imaginative in its use of different visual modes (video, celluloid) to underscore different states of mind. And it is frightening precisely because it goes beyond Gothic into a grand guignol of the mind. Long Live Love, from Taiwan's Tsai Ming-liang, goes one better than transmuting yesterday's genres: it invents one of its own. How do we describe this maze-like essay in minimalism about two young men and a young woman who wander in and out of each other's lives and in and out of a single empty apartment? The film is like Jacques Tati and Roman Polanski meeting in a Mondrian painting. The glacial apartment has the eroticism of vacancy. Together and singly the trespassing characters act out their fantasies, comic and melancholic, while the camera roams over the sign language of the lonely. Hints of auto-eroticism, more-than-hints of transvestism, displays of paranoia or wayward passion. And when togetherness accidentally happens, touches of Feydeau farce creep into the bleached geometric existentialism. Is this apartment a symbolic womb - a pre-guilt playroom for the human soul? Is it a maze for experimental human mice? Or is it . . . ? It could be all and any of these; the movie has a perfect, daring openness. It comes without 'message' and virtually without dialogue. Yet it is so wittily styled, so playful in its cross-pollination of lives and fetishisms, that the interpretative choices are rich. So even the best-laid plans of 'worst first' tournament devisers can go wrong. Besides, if you get fed up with the official event at Venice there are always the friendly fixtures on the outer courts. Veterans like King Vidor don their full 'retrospective' kit and prance about on the prescribed rectangle: you can see the master's greatest silent hits from The Big Parade to The Crowd. And you can enjoy one-off exhibition matches from the likes of Kon Ichikawa, Oscar-winning British animator Nick Park (of Creature Comforts fame) and the late Rainer Werner Fassbinder. There is Hollywood too, that eternal tennis circus tramping the globe and celebrated in this year's Venezia Notte section: floodlit knockouts between Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) and Arnold Schwarzenegger (True Lies), Harrison Ford (Clear And Present Danger) and Jack Nicholson (Wolf). Even in a bad Venice year - or a bad Venice week - there is something for everyone.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'BLIND FAITH' KEEPS NBC ON TOP 85TH WEEK  </P> <P> NBC had faith -- the first half of the miniseries "Blind Faith" on Sunday night  -- to help it stay on top for the 85th week out of the last 86, it was reported  today.  </P> <P> An interesting thing happened to the networks on the way to the ratings war on  Sunday -- during the two-hour movie window, they had a combined audience share  of 78%, considerably higher than the 69% they usually average.  </P> <P> Two of the three competing shows -- "Blind Faith" on NBC (ranking 8th in the  listings) and the terrifying "Miracle Landing" on CBS (24th) -- were based on  real happenings. The theatrical film "Robocop" (23rd) was the ABC entry.  </P> <P> Two other docudramas were less widely watched. The second installment of CBS'  miniseries, "Family Of Spies," tied for 36th on Tuesday, which is pretty good  for CBS on a Tuesday. NBC's "Murder in Mississippi" came in 50th, which is not  good for an NBC Monday movie.  </P> <P> There were two new series bowing in last week -- "Elvis" on ABC and "The  Bradys" on CBS.  </P> <P> "Elvis," in its special premiere slot following "Roseanne," tied for 20th -- a  considerable drop from its third-place lead-in. When "Elvis" moved into its  regular Sunday slot, it dropped to 47th, down precipitously from its lead-in,  "America's Funniest Home Videos," which again made the top 10.  </P> <P> NBC won the ratings race for the week ending Feb. 11 with a 14.7 rating and a  24 share, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC took second place with a 13.2  rating and a 21 share, while CBS was third with a 12.5 rating and a 20 share.  </P> <P> The 21-week-old season-to-date ratings show NBC with a 14.8 rating and a 25  share, ABC with a 13.0 rating and a 22 share, and CBS with a 12.3 rating and a  20 share.  </P> <P> TV RATINGS  </P> <P> Here are the ratings for national prime-time television last week (Feb. 5-11),  as compiled by the A. C. Nielsen Co.  </P> <P> Program (Network) Rating  </P> <P> 1. The Cosby Show (NBC) 22.9  </P> <P> 2. Cheers (NBC) 22.8  </P> <P> 3. Roseanne (ABC) 22.5  </P> <P> 4. A Different World (NBC) 21.9  </P> <P> 5. Funniest Home Videos (ABC) 21.4  </P> <P> 6. Golden Girls (NBC) 20.3  </P> <P> 7. Wonder Years (ABC) 20.1  </P> <P> 8. "Blind Faith," Part 1 (NBC) 19.9  </P> <P> 9. Who's the Boss? (ABC) 18.9  </P> <P> 10. 60 Minutes (CBS) 18.7  </P></p>

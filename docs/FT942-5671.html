			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Maurice Paterson leaves ScotAm The departure of Maurice Paterson from Scottish Amicable a week today, after 35 years with the life insurer, will leave the post of deputy managing director vacant for a while. Responsibility for sales, which had been Paterson's remit, has been given to a team headed by Jim Cowan. Roy Nicolson, managing director, said yesterday that while there was a need for a deputy managing director at some stage, that was not his priority at present. 'Titles are not that important,' he said. The rationale for the change, he said, was the need for a fresh approach, which had struck him as he looked at the organisation in the light of changes happening to the life industry, such as commission disclosure, and the launch of ScotAm's own European venture in Dublin. He had discussed the question with Paterson who had concluded that there was not another job at his level within ScotAm that he would be interested in doing. The decision was taken on a friendly basis between the two, who had worked together for more than 30 years: 'We're still talking,' Nicolson said.</p>

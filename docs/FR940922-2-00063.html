These members are recommended by a consortium of 12 consumer organizations that has the responsibility for screening, interviewing, and recommending consumer-nominated candidates with appropriate scientific credentials. Candidates are sought who are aware of the consumer impact of committee issues, but who also possess enough technical background to understand and contribute to the committee's work. For some advisory committees the agency notes, however, it may require such nominees to meet the same technical qualifications and specialized training required of other expert members of the committee. The term of office for these members is up to 4 years, depending on the appointment date. Nominations are invited for consideration for membership as openings become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Nomination Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any interested person may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the board. Nominations shall state that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is willing to serve as a member of the board, and appears to have no conflict of interest that would preclude board membership. Potential candidates will be asked by FDA to provide detailed information concerning such matters as financial holdings, consultancies, and research grants or contracts in order to permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is issued under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2) and 21 CFR part 14, relating to advisory committees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linda A.

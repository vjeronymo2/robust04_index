			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: US healthcare groups in Dollars 1bn merger Columbia/HCA, the US healthcare group which operates the country's largest chain of hospitals, announced the acquisition of Medical Care America in an all-stock transaction valued at just over Dollars 1bn. The deal marks the latest consolidation among US healthcare providers, prompted equally by cost pressures and the growing power of managed care organisations. Medical Care America owns 96 surgery centres which between them have 504 operating rooms. Columbia/HCA, which was formed in a Dollars 6bn merger last year, already has 196 acute-care and specialty hospitals. Columbia/HCA, under chief executive Mr Richard Scott, has been more active than other US healthcare providers in pursuing mergers. By providing a wide range of healthcare services, the company hopes to sign up large customers such as Health Maintenance Organisations, which buy healthcare services in bulk for their individual members. The two companies also said a merger would save money by enabling them to negotiate bigger discounts from suppliers and to cut overheads. Around 60 per cent of Medical Care America's surgery centres is in an area also served by one of Columbia/HCA's hospitals. This overlap would help to reduce costs and make the combined service more attractive to customers, the two companies said. The deal follows discussions between the two companies about ways of strengthening an alliance that was already in place. Earlier this year, Medical Care America sold its Critical Care America home infusion unit, just 18 months after those two companies merged. That deal proved a failure as the home infusion business came under pricing pressures, slashing Medical Care's earnings per share from Dollars 1.87 in 1992 to Dollars 1.29 last year. Medical Care America's shareholders will receive stock worth Dollars 29 for each of their existing shares, if Columbia/HCA's stock stays close to its current price. The value of the deal would be subject to a sliding scale if Columbia's share price moved above Dollars 40 or below Dollars 36, with the maximum price for the acquisition set at Dollars 1.1bn. On Friday, the company's shares closed at Dollars 39 3/4 . The all-stock deal, which was approved by both companies' boards yesterday, is subject to approval by Medical Care America's shareholders, and regulatory clearance.</p>

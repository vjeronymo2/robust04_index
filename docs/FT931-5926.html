			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Russia to privatise maker of top people's limousines ZIL, the Russian industrial conglomerate indelibly associated with the black limousines which were the preserve of top communists in the former Soviet Union, is to be privatised. The government said yesterday that R1bn of nominal share capital - 1m shares with a face value of R1,000 - will be offered for sale at 100 auction centres across Russia. Although Zil limousines are still used to whisk president Boris Yeltsin and his bodyguards at high speeds through the Moscow traffic, demand has fallen now that the new commercial elite prefer Mercedes and stretch Volvos. Zil also produces heavy trucks of an outmoded design and refrigerators. The cars are handmade at a rate of two or three a year, but the mode of production guaranteed that each was unique so that parts were not interchangeable. A company official declined to reveal the price. The cars are still popular with well-heeled tourists. They are also bought by smart young Russian bankers to conduct them from work to marble-floored dachas. The armour plating and curtained seclusion of the passenger saloons, which shielded the communist elite from terrorists and stares of the curious, now serve the same function for the new commercial princes. Western consulting companies which have looked at the enterprise have concluded that any effort to transform the company into a successful and profitable enterprise will be a mammoth task. It has between between 110,000 and 130,000 workers in 17 sites across Russia. The biggest site is an ecological inferno located in a bend of the Moscow river in the southern district of the capital. Requests to visit the plant were yesterday brusquely refused on the grounds that the plant had commercial secrets to protect. The spread of Zil's sites, the wastefulness of its production methods and the archaic nature of its designs lend a certain Stalinist splendour to the company, but make it a nightmare for rationalisation and privatisation. Perhaps in recognition of the difficulty of bringing Zil to the market, a government official said foreign investment would be unlikely until 'a later stage', when the various parts of the company had been broken up. The shares offered represent 35 per cent of the share value of the company, with 40 per cent going to the workforce and management either free or on preferential terms and a further 25 per cent held in state hands for later sale. The enterprise is the first to be offered on an all-Russian basis, and represents both an attempt to prove that organisations of this size can be successfully sold off and a test of the nationwide system for offering shares.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toyota Tsusho declines 12% TOYOTA Tsusho, the trading arm of the Toyota Motors group, suffered its first fall in unconsolidated sales and profits for six years in the first half to September, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Pre-tax profits fell by 12.3 per cent to Y7.4bn (Dollars 60m) from the same period last year, while its sales fell 7.1 per cent to Y1,040.8bn. Toyota Tsusho blamed the fall on a steep drop in Japanese demand for machinery and steel. It said, however, that exports of cars remained strong.</p>

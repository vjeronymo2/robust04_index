			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Observer: Now you see it The London and Shanghai stock exchanges are going to be doing a lot more co-operating, following this week's visit to China by London stock exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith. But Observer hears that Sir Andrew's trip was not without its hiccups. To do business in China a foreign businessman needs a Chinese host. Not normally a problem, especially when the visitor has a knighthood. Hence some puzzlement in British diplomatic circles when no one seemed willing to take care of Sir Andrew, in town for a British Invisibles seminar. Sir Andrew's cv seems to have been the problem. Not only is he a member of British Invisibles but he is also a vice chairman of Britain's Guide Dogs for the Blind council. Putting two and two together, the Chinese seemingly wondered whether invisibility was something to do with blindness - which perhaps explains the delay in finding a companion for Sir Andrew. Fortunately the misunderstanding was spotted in time.</p>

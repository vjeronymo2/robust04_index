The  current situation is encouraging, he says, and so far there is  the hope that NATO intervention against the Serb batteries may  not be necessary. However, he admits that information is still  lacking about the withdrawal of their armaments and the handing  over of some of them to the blue helmets.    [Begin Solana recording] I think that one can say that the  situation on the ground remains encouraging. By encouraging we  mean that it is our hope that the objectives of the ultimatum  that has to be met tomorrow night will be fulfilled without it  being necessary to carry out air strikes. But I can also tell  you that there is still a certain confusion on the ground as  regards the withdrawal of the Serb heavy weapons. [end recording]    [Sanz] In spite of Javier Solana's reservations and the need  not to celebrate prematurely, if the withdrawal and the control  of Sarajevo by the blue helmets comes about, the minister  stressed that the solution to the conflict is not military but  political and that there are already diplomatic measures, which  will become known next week and which will have to involve the  United States and Russia.    [Begin Solana recording] Some initiatives are on the table;  I  cannot be more specific at present, but, I believe that next  week, depending on how the latest events go up to the weekend,  there may be some other initiatives of a negotiating character:  initiatives that will undoubtedly involve the European Union and  undoubtedly involve -- and we want them to be more involved --  the United States and Russia.

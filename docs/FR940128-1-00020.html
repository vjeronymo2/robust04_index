			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Meanwhile, processors and importers of scombrotoxin-forming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species can exercise HACCP controls aimed at ensuring that their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incoming raw materials or imported shipments have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature abused. Because any HACCP plans for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors or importers would be clearly inadequate if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin were not identified as a hazard and appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls were not in place and systematically monitored,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers should consider placing time/temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on vessel owners as a prerequisite to doing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP can also be applied to control of hazards from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical contaminants, even though the full range of possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical hazards is still imperfectly understood. Government and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academia have important roles to play in researching the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicities of these chemicals, in monitoring them, and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing various forms of risk assessment. In some cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these efforts may result in the establishment of national maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits. In other cases, regional advisories may be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. The seafood industry has a responsibility to know  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether chemical hazards are associated with the species they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling, whether the occurrence of such hazards depends on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest site or other factors, and whether a sampling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis program on their part would be appropriate. Processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers should monitor the origin of raw materials and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported shipments to ensure, for example, that harvest did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in locations subject to public health advisories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are but a few examples of environmentally related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards to which HACCP can be applied. HACCP controls can also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that hazards are not being created inside a processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility through improper handling, cooking, or storing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Regulatory Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From a regulatory standpoint, inspections of processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and of importers' plans and records would become more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient and would be likely to have a much greater impact if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP controls were in place. A key feature of an inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system tied to implementation of HACCP is access by Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigators to the HACCP plan and to monitoring records kept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under that plan. In contrast to the ``snapshot'' provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current inspections, examination of HACCP records will enable an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigator to see how the processing facility or the importer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates over time. It will enable an investigator to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether problems have occurred, and how they were addressed. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will also enable an investigator to spot trends that could lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to problems, and thus to help prevent them from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, it will enable the regulator to review the adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the processor's or importer's preventive control system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself. Under such an inspection system, inadequate preventive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls would warrant remedial or regulatory action regardless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of whether the processor's or importer's product is actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated or unsafe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP is not a zero risk system, however. Problems in food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and processing will still occur. HACCP systems are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to detect and document those problems, so that they can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be corrected as quickly as possible. Thus, regulatory action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be warranted on the basis of the mere occurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing problems. It would be warranted, though, if the HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is not functioning properly to detect and correct the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems, or if adulterated food is allowed to enter into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

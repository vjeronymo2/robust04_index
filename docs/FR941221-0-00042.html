			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We received comments from both commenters on this section. Both suggested that the reallocated amounts should be each State's percentage share of the unexpended funds even if that amount exceeds the amount of a State's total unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. One commenter suggested that reallocating all unexpended funds would make it possible for States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs as of December 30, 1994, to be reimbursed for any additional SLIAG-related costs they might be able to identify, document, and submit to the Department after March 15, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> There are two reasons why we are not revising the rule in accordance with these suggestions. First, the purpose of funds reallocated under this amendment to IRCA is to reimburse States for costs they incurred in providing services to eligible legalized aliens prior to October 1, 1994. Under this final rule, States are allowed 90 days (until December 29, 1994) to submit final reports documenting their SLIAG-related costs. They are allowed an additional 76 days (until March 15, 1995) to respond to comments and revise their submissions before the unexpended funds are reallocated. We believe that the amount of time we are already providing to States is adequate to document and submit SLIAG-related costs incurred prior to October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, and more important, we believe that extending the period during which States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs could continue to attempt to identify and document SLIAG-related costs would not be in accordance with the intent of the amendment to IRCA. We believe that it was intended that all States participating in SLIAG would have the same amount of time to identify, document, and submit SLIAG-related costs and that the purpose of the amendment was to provide reimbursement to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs only for those costs documented and submitted during that equal period of time. Since extending the period of time for identifying additional costs for all States would make it impossible to determine the total amount of unexpended funds for reallocation, we conclude that the intent of the amendment was to provide reimbursement only for SLIAG-related costs submitted by participating States by December 29, 1994. For these two reasons, we are not incorporating these suggestions in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

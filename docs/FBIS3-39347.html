Two other human rights  reports published this week call for an independent public  inquiry into alleged collusion between security forces and  loyalist paramilitaries.    President Clinton will be briefed on the State Department  report before he meets the Prime Minister in Washington on  February 27. Its contents, should they be raised at the meeting,  will further sour the "special relationship" between the two  countries, strained by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's visit  to New York last week.    The report gives details of recent killings and judicial  proceedings. "Although no deaths resulted from shootings by  security forces (in 1993), charges continued that soldiers  resorted to lethal force precipitately and carried out a `shoot  to kill' policy," it says.    "Security forces, both the army and Royal Ulster  Constabulary  [RUC], frequently harass citizens verbally, particularly young  people in areas where community support for terrorists is  considered strong. Security forces have also been accused of  more serious incidents of physical mistreatment."    In Political Killings in Northern Ireland, published today,  Amnesty International accuses the Government of evading its duty  to investigate "mounting evidence of collusion between  government forces and groups like the banned Ulster Defence  Association [UDA] that oppose any change in Northern lreland's  status quo.... The Government must make every effort to show  equal concern for all members of the population, by guaranteeing  equal protection."    And the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of  Justice has this week published a report on allegations of  harassment in connection with incidents involving the use of  lethal force. Of 20 families interviewed by the Committee, nine  reported that their deceased family member had received death  threats by police or soldiers.    All three reports note the killing of some 350 people by the  security forces since 1969. Most were Catholics, about half of  whom were unarmed. Up to 1991, 21 security force members were  prosecuted for killings using firearms. Nineteen were found not  guilty, one was convicted of manslaughter and given a suspended  sentence. Only one, a soldier, was convicted of murder.  Although given a life sentence, he served just over two years  and was then reinstated in the army.    Amnesty says: "The pattern that has emerged is one of  repeated allegtions that suspects are arbitrarily killed rather  than being arrested, that members of the security forces believe  they can operate with impunity, and that this is reinforced by  government failure to take steps to prevent unlawful killings.    "The Government evades responsibility by hiding behind an  array of legal procedures and secret inquiries."    It calls for an independent inquiry into the murder of  Patrick Finucane, a lawyer shot dead in February 1989 by the  outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the role played by Brian  Nelson, a UDA member and army informer sentenced to 10 years'  imprisonment last year for conspiracy to murder.    It also calls for the widening of the Stevens inquiry, which  in 1989 investigated security leaks to loyalist groups and which  was reopened last year after Mr Nelson's trial. "The apparent  failure of the security forces to take significant action  against UDA `death squads' was not addressed before the court,"  Amnesty says.    The report considers allegations that the RUC has been  negligent in gathering evidence about loyalist attacks on  catholics, that it has failed to respond adequately to demands  for protection and has failed to deter loyalist paramilitaries  from entering catholic areas or to detect them despite  surveillance.    "The facility with which loyalist gunmen raid homes in  stringently monitored and controlled Catholic neighbourhoods and  then leave witout hindrance has contributed to the lack of  confidence in the RUC," Amnesty says.</p>

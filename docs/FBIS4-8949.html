			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ajn, ina)": "The New Law Will Allow the </F> Security and Information Service To Keep Its Location Secret  From Foreigners Even to the Extent of Using Force"]    [Text] Prague--Foreign tourists who loiter in the vicinity  of civilian intelligence buildings may be exposed to the risk of  physical attack by intelligence service members. The secret  service bill anticipates that Security Information Service [BIS]  members may ask foreigners in the vicinity of BIS buildings to  show personal documents. If they refuse to do so and refuse to  wait until the police arrive, intelligence service agents may  use physical force, such as blows, hits with hands or weapons,  and kicks.    At present, the police can employ these means, including  tear  gas, but not BIS.    Stanislav Devaty, interim BIS director, has justified this  bill by saying that foreigners in the vicinity of the building  where his office is located are intentionally taking photos of  secret service members or filming them.    Jaroslav Basta, the former head of this service, affirms,  however, that no other similar service in the world has these  powers. "In every country, the secret service headquarters  locations are known, just as in the Czech Republic. Most of them  are publicly accessible, and only buildings in which there are  operative agents are kept secret," Basta says. According to  him, it is up to the secret service to keep itself secret.  There are a number of embassies and foreign embassy residences  close to the Prague BIS center. The Chinese Embassy is directly  opposite it.</p>

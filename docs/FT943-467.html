			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Bank share of home loans slips Fresh evidence that the share of new lending held by UK banks in the relatively subdued mortgage market has slipped significantly came yesterday with figures released by the British Bankers' Association. However, Lord Inchyra, the director-general of the association, contrasted the rise in the number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken by banks last month with the drop in the similar set of figures for building societies. He suggested that this might reflect customers' anticipation of the rise in interest rates which took place earlier this month, as they sought to take advantage of the fixed-rate mortgages being promoted by banks. Building societies' lending suffered in the summer from the attractiveness of banks' fixed-rate mortgage offers. The statistics for new net lending show that banks have lost market share. The seasonally adjusted figures show a 23 per cent drop between the Pounds 607m figure for last month and the Pounds 785m for August last year. The statistics show that new gross lending by banks in August was at Pounds 1.78bn, compared with Pounds 1.81bn in the previous month and Pounds 1.77bn in August last year. Figures for building societies' lending showed new gross loans at Pounds 3.45bn last month - 22 per cent higher than the Pounds 2.83bn undertaken in August last year. Non-adjusted figures for societies' new net lending show an increase between August last year and this year of 39 per cent, from Pounds 814m to Pounds 1.13bn. The more encouraging signs for the banks came in the figures for new mortgages approved - an important forward-looking indicator. The number of loans approved in August rose 8 per cent compared with July to reach 31,047. The total new lending approved was Pounds 1.61bn - 7 per cent higher than the July figure.</p>

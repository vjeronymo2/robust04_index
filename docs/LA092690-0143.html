			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA MUSEUM COMPLETES FISCAL YEAR WITH SURPLUS  </P> <P> For the first time since it completed a major renovation in 1986, the Laguna  Art Museum has ended its fiscal year in the black, according to preliminary  figures released Tuesday by museum director Charles Desmarais.  </P> <P> "We're $91,453 on the plus side" for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, Desmarais  said.  </P> <P> Last August, the organization ended the year with a $72,000 deficit. The  museum's 1990 budget is $1.3 million.  </P> <P> Desmarais said the museum held 1990 spending at roughly the same level as last  year and attributed the financial turnaround to increased charitable  contributions and grant support.  </P> <P> "I think it's a result of increased excitement about the museum and where it's  going," he said, pointing to two traveling exhibits organized by the museum --  one of work by media artist Ilene Segalove, another showcasing California  Impressionism -- and to three scholarly catalogues the museum published.  </P> <P> "We're not entirely where I'd like us to be (financially) for the long term,"  said Desmarais.  </P></p>

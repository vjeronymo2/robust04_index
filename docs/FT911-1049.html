			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Alfa-Laval declines 4% ALFA-LAVAL, the Swedish industrial, dairy and food processing equipment company, yesterday announced a 4 per cent fall in its profits after financial items to SKr293m (Dollars 47.23m) in the first quarter of the year compared with SKr304 for the same period of 1990. Sales advanced by 5 per cent to SKr3.794bn from SKr3.603bn. Mr Lars Kylberg, the outgoing president and chief executive officer, said the company would find it difficult this year to achieve the 1990 profit figure of SKr1.6bn because of the weaker business climate. The annual meeting yesterday removed the foreign ownership restriction clause from its articles of association. This will ease acquisition of its shares by Tetra Pak which made a successful bid in January for Alfa-Laval.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Bookmakers angry at National fiasco BOOKMAKERS are preparing for a rush of punters today to reclaim about Pounds 75m staked on the 1993 Martell Grand National horse race, which was declared void on Saturday and will not be re-run this year. Senior executives of William Hill are to meet today to decide whether to sue the racecourse for the Pounds 2m profit the company says it lost. Ladbroke said: 'The damage done to the public image of racing is immeasurable both in Britain and throughout the world. This is the biggest sporting event for Britain, let alone racing, and we owe it to the British public to put it back, the sooner the bet-ter.' The company said it would have to bear about Pounds 100,000 in extra advertising and staff costs. 'But it would have cost us a great deal more if the race had been run and the favourite had won.' Minutes after the race was ruled void, amid scenes of chaos watched by an estimated worldwide television audience of 300m, bookmakers announced that all stake monies would be returned, and appealed for calm when the betting shops re-open this morning. The biggest loser will be the Treasury, which would have taken an estimated Pounds 6m in betting tax on the race. Martell, the sponsor, which had brought about 550 guests to the course, some from as far afield as Malaysia and Singapore, registered disappointment at the outcome but showed no inclination to withdraw its support for the race. Mr Peter Greenall, chairman of Aintree racecourse, yesterday said that after consultations with leading trainers it had been decided that it would not be practical for the world's most famous steeplechase to be re-run later this year. Mr Greenall said that Aintree's overriding consideration was the long-term image of the race. 'I am not as sceptical as many that the Grand National has been so dented,' he said. 'The race has been run for 150 years and is a special part of our heritage.' The racecourse is holding its own inquiry on how animal rights protestors managed to get through a security cordon and onto the course, where they may have caused the first false start. Aintree would refund entry fees and travelling expenses to owners and trainers of the 40 intended runners and reimburse jockeys' riding fees. Stewards of the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, are expected to start an inquiry today into the chaos which followed two false starts to the race. Their investigation could lead to changes in the system used to recall runners after a false start. After the first on Saturday, Mr Keith Brown, the official starter, signalled with a red flag to stop the race. After the second false start Mr Brown's warning flag failed to unfurl. About 30 jockeys, who said they saw no flag, continued to race. Some finished the 4 1/2 -mile course in spite of further attempts to stop them after the first circuit.</p>

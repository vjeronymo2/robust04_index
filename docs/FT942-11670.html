			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Dutch to propose Lubbers as successor to Delors The Dutch government said last night that it will formally put forward Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister, as a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, writes Ronald van de Krol. The confirmation of Mr Lubbers' bid for the post was made minutes after polling booths closed in the Netherlands' general election. Mr Lubbers said five years ago that he planned to leave national government after the 1994 election, but refused to be drawn on his European ambitions until the election campaign ended.

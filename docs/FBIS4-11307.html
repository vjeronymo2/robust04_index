			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Today, National Assembly  President Ricardo Alarcon rejected the implementation of a  multiparty system in Cuba by saying he considered it detrimental  to national unity in the face of the historical U.S. hostility  toward the island.    The legislative leader explained the Cuban Government's  position during the first session of the The Nation and the  Emigrants Conference, which began this morning with the  participation of 210 Cubans living in 27 countries.    Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the three-day event, the  proceedings of which will be private, noted that Alarcon  described the idea that a society must have a multiparty system  to be democratic as a myth. He said the multiparty system  divides people into groups separated by interests that are not  necessarily those of the nation.    Regarding Cuba, the single party is not a creation of the  revolution (begun in 1959) but has its roots in the turn of the  last century, when Jose Marti began our struggle for  independence, Alfonso stated.    He explained that in Cuba's special case, when we have a  powerful nation so close to our coasts that has never renounced  its intent to take over the island, anything that could  undermine national unity must be carefully studied.    The president of the National Assembly of the People's Power  [ANPP] was the first important Cuban leader to speak at the  event, the fundamental objective of which is to promote the  normalization of ties between emigrants and their country.    In his speech, the text of which was distributed by  organizers of the event, Alarcon explained the real  participatory nature of the county's existing democratic system.    This is the essence of our system of the people's power: the  real connection between the persons chosen by the electors and  the real, effective, and systematic participation of the people  in all the activities of their government system, he noted.    He noted that such principles were demonstrated again in the  past few months while the people were discussing measures to  improve the country's internal financial situation, basically  imbalanced by an excess of money in circulation equivalent to 14  paychecks [salarios], over 11 billion pesos (equal to U.S.  dollars at the official exchange rate). He stated that millions  of people participated in the process, exercising the authority  of the people and direct democracy.    Alarcon said the dreams of social equality that have existed  since the age of the forefathers of independence of the last  century still exist today. The ideals of equality and solidarity  are based on humanism, on the humanist tradition of our culture.  Such ideals were born with Cubans as part of their nationality,  he stated.    For Cubans to renounce them, he said, would be more than  renouncing a just, noble society worth any sacrifice. It would  be renouncing their own identity; it would be renouncing being  Cuban.    The National Assembly president said that despite the  adverse  economic situation in Cuba, no school or hospital has been  closed and no citizen has been evicted.    He said that during one of the assemblies held to analyze  solutions to national problems, one of the peasants asked him to  tell the conference participants that they would never agree to  returning to the past of poverty and sickness that existed  before 1959.    I know that I express the feelings of millions of Cubans  when  I say that we will be able to resist and that we will know how  to resist, that we will defend the right to dream and will  defend the dreams that we have made a reality with so much love  and sacrifice.</p>

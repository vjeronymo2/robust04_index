			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (11): A battle on many fronts  -Oil and the Environment THE battleground is familiar, but the conflict is not slackening. Oil and gas companies have for years been one of the main targets of environmental regulation and of 'green' pressure groups. The companies claim in turn that they have spent a fortune looking after the environment, and that standards have greatly improved. It is true there have been vast improvements in curbing pollution - and at considerable cost. But with the addition of global warming to the list of potential environmental threats, the industry faces new pressures: international calls for energy conservation and for taxes to curb the use of fossil fuels. Environmental regulation, which affects the oil and gas industry from production to consumption, began in most countries by focusing on local and regional pollution, where the threats to health and the source of the pollution could easily be identified. One of the earliest campaigns - and one of the most successful - has been aimed at limiting the emission of sulphur dioxide from refineries and fuel, and so reduce acid rain that can travel many miles across international boundaries. According to industry estimates, emissions of sulphur from OECD refineries have decreased by more than a third in the past decade and are continuing to fall. A second focus has been on the risk of oil leaks, particularly after the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 when 267,000 barrels of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska. In 1990, the US passed the Oil Spill Act requiring new tankers to have double hulls; and this June the International Marine Organisation, which regulates shipping worldwide, also tightened rules on ship design. Commercial penalties for slight infringement of environmental rules can be so great, particularly under US tort law, that companies are prepared to go to some lengths to avoid risk. Mr David Simon, group chief executive of British Petroleum, says: 'One only has to consider the political, economic, commercial and public relations repercussions of a major environmental accident to understand why no oil company in its senses would ever needlessly run risks or cut corners.' Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are sceptical about those claims. According to Mr Simon Roberts, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth, companies have sometimes tried to meet emission and discharge standards 'by exporting the problem and locating operations in areas with slacker rules, such as developing countries.' Pressure groups are right to point to the discrepancies in international standards - the former Soviet Union countries, which collectively still produce most of the world's oil and gas, arouse some of the main environmental concerns. However, environmentalists sometimes dismiss too lightly the cost of meeting environmental rules. The costs were not always apparent when the rules were made - and many oil companies argue that ultimately they are borne by the consumer. Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Madrid in September, Mr Simon suggested the cost to the US oil industry of complying with all US environmental laws, regulations and standards was between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 20bn a year - compared with present US petroleum profits of between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 25bn a year. Industry estimates suggest that the cost of complying with existing EC rules are between Dollars 8.5bn and Dollars 9.5bn a year, equal to the net annual income worldwide of Europe's top seven oil companies. The EC estimates the investment needed to reduce sulphur in heating gas oil and diesel fuel at Ecu5bn (Dollars 6.5bn) to Ecu7bn (Dollars 9bn) up to the year 2000 and European oil companies and consultants have suggested that the cost of reducing sulphur in fuel oil and shipping could be Dollars 20bn over the same period. According to Ms Fiona Nichol, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, 'it's getting a little bit scary particularly in the US - rules are now being passed which are technically hard to put into practice, and the costs are rising because the easy stuff has been done.' Heading the list of difficult problems which have yet to be tackled adequately is the risk of global warming, linked to the emission of carbon dioxide from burning the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas. International discussions have focused on carbon or energy taxes rather than regulation, partly because the sources of emissions are so diverse. The EC has proposed a tax that rises from 3 per cent to 10 per cent by 2000, levied half on energy value and half on carbon content. According to the Commission, fossil fuels account for 85 per cent of all energy consumed in the EC, and EC countries have acknowledged that without a tax they stand no chance of meeting international targets of stabilising carbon emission levels at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Recession in the US and Europe has temporarily depressed energy use and made some of the targets easier to achieve, but it has also increased opposition to the new proposals and their accompanying costs. The economic slump has, however, moved energy efficiency initiatives higher up the agendas of governments. But while efficiency measures could help extend the life of non-renewable fuels, they could also threaten the short-term revenue of the energy companies, and some environmentalists have been sceptical about industry's support for these investments.</p>

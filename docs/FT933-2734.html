			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Labour turns its guns on Lib Dems LABOUR TURNED its fire on the Liberal Democrats yesterday, saying their record in local government contrasted with the stance of the party's MPs. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, ridiculed Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, as posing as a UK Ross Perot. 'Our very own anti-politics populist,' he said, was like the former US presidential candidate in claiming to be an outsider taking on the political establishment. Yet experience of the Liberal Democrats in councils such as Lambeth and the Isle of Wight, Mr Straw said, showed them to be 'scavengers' and 'political chameleons'. The attack underlines Labour's determination not to concede that the Liberal Democrats stand a better chance of defeating Conservatives across southern England. It comes two days after a Fabian pamphlet warned that the Liberal Democrats' challenge to the Tories in the south could threaten Labour. Both Labour and the Tories have now launched broadsides against the Liberal Democrats before the party's conference in Torquay next week. Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator, highlighted his party's success in winning 36 seats from Labour as well as its 350 gains from the Tories in the county council elections.</p>

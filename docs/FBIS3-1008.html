			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Weakening of the Right Wing -- "There are those who will say  that the weakening of the Right is a good thing, because any  split will make it more receptive to the changes taking place,"  notes the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in  English on 15 March. "Not so. A strong Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front -- AVF] gives the White Right a vehicle for  presenting its volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] aspirations. If  that vehicle breaks down, the Rights cause is harmed, and that  can spell trouble, since a frustrated people will turn to  violence as the only means of achieving their objectives.  Besides, General Viljoen [leader of the Freedom Front], though  he blew hot and cold over armed resistance, was able to keep the  extreme Right in check, and this is no longer possible."    Call for Freedom Front To Outline Party Platform --  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 16 March in its page-6  editorial notes that the Freedom Front is "gearing itself for  the election." But, "other than being against the National  Party [NP] and against the ANC [African National Congress], for  a volkstaat but against violence, except as a last resort, to  achieve one, for taking part in the election and against sitting  on the sidelines, Gen Viljoen has not expressed one political  idea that could be regarded as the basis of a party platform."  "The sooner the front outlines its platform, the better it will  fare at the polls."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   TEC Must Address Civil Servants Concerns -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 17 March in a page-18 editorial commends the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC) for the speed with which  they moved "to allay the fears and concerns of civil servants,  especially those employed by the various homeland  administrations." The TEC has resolved to establish a task  force "to defuse the crisis which is building up in the  homelands." The TEC must ensure that its task force "does not  become a forum for political point-scoring, and that it works  speedily to address the concerns of all civil servants,  including those working in the rest of South Africa. There is a  real threat of widespread civil service turmoil, which could  harm the transition process and even the election itself."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Complications in Planned Mandela-Zwelithini Meeting --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 March in a page-8  editorial refers to the meeting between Nelson Mandela and Zulu  King Zwelithini scheduled for 18 March, saying two things  complicate it: "the imbizo, that is the call to the king's  subjects to accompany him to the meeting, as well as the venue,  the grounds of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. When the king  met State President F.W. de Klerk in Durban recently, he was  accompanied by an estimated 60,000 subjects. More can be  expected in the heart of KwaZulu." "The wrong word or the wrong  gesture could cost this country dearly."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   SACP Influential Role in Power-Sharing Government Unlikely  --  On page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 March, Colin  Legum comments in his "Election Notebook" column on the National  Party's "relentless warning that a future ANC government will,  in fact, be masterminded by communists." But Legum believes  that the South African Communist Party (SACP) "is unlikely to  play an influential role in a power-sharing government between  itself, the ANC, NP and one or two smaller parties." "For the  foreseeable future, it is the ANC that will wag its communist  appendage rather than the other way around. The differences  between the ANC and SACP are likely to increase, not to  diminish. The ANC's future preoccupation in retaining the  support of the black youth is going to be with the  Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) which has a history of hostility  to the communists. Sadly, a more sophisticated analysis of the  relationship between the ANC and SACP finds no place in the  emotional climate engendered by the NP's `red scare' propaganda."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Bophuthatswana Unrest Brought Necessary Change --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 14 March argues in a page-8  editorial: "A shocking event is sometimes necessary to bring  necessary change. A few dramatic days in Bophuthatswana made  sure of that. Many things changed irrevocably. First, the rule  of Lucas Mangope came to an end. South Africa is again in  control of this teritory, which at one stage was the leading  light among the national states. Bophuthatswana is part of South  Africa again, but it could have happened with less trauma and  loss of life..." "Second, it was demonstrated clearly that the  AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] cannot be anyone's knight in  shining armor. The organization carried its racism and  indiscipline into an explosive situation and made matters worse.  If their members believed they were going to be received as  heroes, they suffered a rude awakening when they saw how  unwelcome they were. Eventually they had to leave in disgrace.  We can only hope that the AWB invasion represents the final  kicks of the era of mercenaries and white armed interference in  black affairs." "The events in Bophuthatswana also served as an  election catalyst. The on-going row in the Conservative Party  [CP] and the Afrikaner National Front has suddenly been  resolved: General Constand Viljoen and a group of moderates  decided participation is a much more constructive option than  boycotts and armed protest." "The position of Dr. Ferdi  Hartzenberg is on the line. Since he became leader of the CP,  he has led his party deeper into the desert. He and the AWB  leader are the ones who started the war talk. Does he realize,  after the events in Bophuthatswana, just what war is? Surely  the right wing cannot have such a death wish that they prefer  war above honorable negotiation. The people in the CP and other  organizations must urgently reconsider and decide whether they  need a change of leaders and policies. We have not the  slightest doubt what the answer ought to be."</p>

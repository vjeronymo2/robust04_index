			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rebel shareholders reject QMH proposals Rebel shareholders at Queens Moat Houses yesterday rejected a Pounds 1.3bn rescue plan for the debt-burdened hotels group, claiming it was unfair to existing investors. The Queens Moat Houses Shareholders Action Group, which claims to represent 4,000 investors controlling 10 per cent of the equity, said the plan - involving a Pounds 200m debt for equity swap and revised borrowing terms - was 'quite unacceptable'. Mr Denis Woodhams, secretary of the group, said holders of ordinary shares were dismayed by moves to dilute their interests from 81 per cent of the company to 24 per cent. 'These proposals are a manifestation of the board's lack of confidence in its own ability to produce even an industry average profit performance,' he added. The dissident group has proposed an alternative rescue rights issue drawn up by Mr Peter Eyles, former managing director of Norfolk Capital Group, the luxury hotel company acquired by Queens Moat in 1990. It is likely, however, to encounter strong opposition from the Queens Moat board. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, warned last week that the group would have to cease trading if it failed to take up the debt-for-equity and financial reconstruction proposals. Claims, meanwhile, that the rebel group would receive widespread support at this week's annual meeting have been rejected by the company. 'The institutions were canvassed in advance of our (reconstruction) scheme and are supportive of it,' Queens Moat said. The company also questioned the number of shares controlled by the action group, adding that it would not have an opportunity to challenge the rescue plan until an extraordinary meeting was called in the new year. Nevertheless, a solicitor acting for Mr John Bairstow, Queens Moat's former chairman, is expected to seek an adjournment of Wednesday's annual meeting. Mr Alan Reed, who manages several shareholding trusts, wants the re-election of directors delayed until shareholders have considered the refinancing proposals. The company dismissed such action as 'nuisance making'.</p>

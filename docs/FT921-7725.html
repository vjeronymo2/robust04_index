			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Kurds plant bomb in Istanbul A BOMB exploded at Istanbul's Chamber of Commerce yesterday, killing a woman and injuring 19 people, Istanbul's security chief said, Reuter reports from Istanbul. A statement from Istanbul's governor said four were in a serious condition. Two Kurdish groups claimed responsibility for the explosion, according to the semi-official Anatolian news agency. Unidentified callers to Istanbul newspapers said the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) and Kurdistan Revenge Units, a hitherto unheard of arm of the PKK, were behind the bombing, it said. PKK has stepped up attacks in cities, including a December 25 fire-bombing of an Istanbul department store where 12 people died. It had previously confined its eight-year guerrilla war for an independent state to south-east Turkey.</p>

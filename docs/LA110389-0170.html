			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH TO BACK CONGRESS MOVE TO HIKE ITS PAY  </P> <P> The White House today said President Bush will support a new attempt on Capitol  Hill to get a pay increase for members of Congress, federal officials and  judges who saw a 51% pay hike go down in flames earlier this year.  </P> <P> "We're just waiting for them to give us a package," press secretary Marlin  Fitzwater said. "We'll be supportive if the Congress produces any reasonable  proposal."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush would like to see any raise tied to a package of ethical  standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honorariums -- fees for  speeches, public appearances and writing.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Minority Leader Robert H. Michel  (R-Ill.) met with Bush on Wednesday to discuss pay hikes, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Foley and Michel both back a raise proposal, made by a bipartisan task force,  that would phase in a 35% salary boost over two years, according to  congressional aides. The plan would also include changes in Congress' ethics  rules, including new restrictions on members' speaking honorariums.  </P> <P> A Democratic leadership aide said today that "no final decision has been made"  on moving a pay increase this year, but the meeting with Bush was sought  because "presidential support would be essential" if lawmakers go ahead with a  salary plan.  </P> <P> "You can't leave the implication the package is finished and agreed to," said  the aide.  </P> <P> A public uproar caused Congress earlier this year to kill a pay proposal that  would have raised salaries by 51%.  </P> <P> A House task force has suggested a 10% increase in 1990 and the rest of the  raise following the year after. That would give congressmen a salary of about  $127,000 a year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEQUOYAH SCHOOL SCARES UP ANNUAL PUMPKIN FESTIVAL  </P> <P> All this week, students at Pasadena's Sequoyah School will be putting the  finishing touches on a haunted house, practicing ghost stories and boning up on  their skeleton paintings.  </P> <P> It's all part of the 1990 version of the school's 8th Annual Pumpkin Festival,  which celebrates not only Halloween but also the creativity of children.  </P> <P> Saturday's festival, which is open to the public, features games and other  events for children of all ages, with an emphasis on introducing them to new  ideas and experiences.  </P> <P> Included in the activities will be a corn-husking contest, a costume parade  (children can select disguises or accessories from a costume shop on the  premises), a ghost-story hour, a dragon-painting mural, food-decorating booths  for young children, a professional face painter and games such as "Pumpkin  Land" (an obstacle course) and "Beetle in a Haystack."  </P> <P> For adults, there will be a jazz band, barbecued ribs and a $10-a-ticket  lottery with donated prizes ranging from a year's membership in a local health  club to getting someone to come your house to show you how to program your  videocassette recorder.  </P> <P> One new event this year will be a concert for nose-flugelers, said festival  chairwoman Nancy Kyes. The nose-flugel is a type of kazoo played through the  nose. A nose-flugel concert, for anyone who cares to participate, will be held  at 2 p.m. as part of the festival.  </P> <P> The Sequoyah School, which has been operating for 35 years, is a private  kindergarten-  </P> <P> through-eighth-grade school that emphasizes open learning, which means that  children are grouped according to ability and social readiness rather than by  age, Kyes said.  </P> <P> The festival runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday on the grounds of the school,  at the corner of Pasadena Avenue and California Boulevard in Pasadena.  Admission is free, and festival-goers are encouraged to come in costume.  </P> <P> Game tickets will be sold for 25 cents each, and barbecue plates will be about  $5, Kyes said.  </P> <P> Proceeds will benefit the school.

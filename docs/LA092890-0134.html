			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRAGGS' HOME RUN HELPS REDS INCH CLOSER TO TITLE  </P> <P> Glenn Braggs played detective Thursday night to move the Cincinnati Reds a step  closer to a championship.  </P> <P> Braggs deduced that a fastball was coming from Atlanta's Steve Avery, and he  lined it for a two-run homer that put the Reds ahead to stay in a 4-2 victory  at Riverfront Stadium.  </P> <P> Cincinnati's magic number was reduced to two as its National League West lead  grew to five games over the Dodgers with six to play. The Reds have won six of  their last seven games to put their first title in 11 years within reach.  </P> <P> "It's right around the corner," Braggs said. "It seems like every day someone  has been coming up with it. Today it's me."  </P> <P> He beat the Braves with logic.  </P> <P> Cincinnati was held to four hits through five innings by Avery (3-10), who was  pitching with a blister on a finger of his pitching hand. He became the starter  when Charlie Leibrandt came down with flu.  </P> <P> The rookie took a 2-1 lead into the sixth inning, then walked Eric Davis.  Braggs hit the next pitch over the wall in left-center for a 3-2 lead that  ended Avery's outing.  </P> <P> "The blister ripped open in the first," Avery said. "It really didn't bother me  on fastballs or change-ups, but it took away my curve."  </P> <P> Braggs knew it, too. "The thing I noticed him doing was throwing mostly  fastballs," Braggs said. "We figured because of his blister, he didn't want to  risk throwing any breaking balls. I was looking for that particular pitch, and  he threw it -- a fastball down and away. I knew when I hit the homer that it  was a big blow for the team and we would be on our way."  </P> <P> Red starter and winner Tom Browning (15-9) had struggled since spraining his  left ankle Aug. 17, going 2-2 in his next five starts.  </P> <P> Browning gave up seven hits in the first three innings. He allowed no more hits  through the seventh to raise his career record against Atlanta to 12-3.  </P> <P> Rob Dibble pitched two perfect innings, striking out three, for his 11th save.  He and Browning combined to retire the last 12 in order.  </P> <P> The only drawback for Cincinnati was a shoulder injury to Davis that forced him  to leave the game in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> The left fielder slammed into the wall in foul territory after making a catch  in the sixth, jamming his left shoulder. He rolled on the ground for several  minutes, had the shoulder examined by trainer Larry Starr, and decided to stay  in the game.  </P> <P> Davis led off the bottom of the inning with a full-count walk from Avery and  let his left arm hang limply as he rounded the bases on Braggs' homer. He was  replaced in the top of the next inning.  </P></p>

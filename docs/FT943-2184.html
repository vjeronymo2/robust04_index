			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Michelin Michelin, best known for its dumpy Bibendum mascot, has been on a strict dietary regime since 1990 when it swallowed Uniroyal Goodrich in a Dollars 1.5bn gulp. Digestion has not been easy. Net debt continues to lie heavily on the group, and has fallen only 3.8 per cent since December 1992. Costs remain high, in spite of two draconian rationalisation programmes. Yesterday the company proudly announced that over the last year it had cut salary costs by 3.8 percentage points to only 39.7 per cent of sales. A more apt comparison might be with Goodyear, where wage costs last year were equivalent to 24.4 per cent of turnover. Michelin expects further help from a market which may not be that co-operative. In the US, where its operations are still not in profit, the market has enjoyed three years of growth and may soon peak. In Europe, car sales have risen 6 per cent so far this year, but growth rates may be slackening. The European high-margin replacement tyre market, where Michelin is particularly strong, remains sluggish and there are no signs the group can pass on higher raw material costs. Profits and cash flow will undoubtedly continue to improve as Michelin rides the cycle, but if it wants to become anything more than a large, but flabby tyre manufacturer, a stricter regime is required.</p>

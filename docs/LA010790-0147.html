			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAITH IN MICHAEL  </P> <P> Bravo to Dennis Hunt ("Times' Critics' Best Albums of the '80s," Dec. 24).  </P> <P> Of the 12 "critics" who chose their favorite albums, only Hunt included George  Michael's "Faith."  </P> <P> Beside being one of the best-selling records of this decade, it gave George  Michael three American Music Awards and a Grammy for album of the year, it was  the No. 1 album for several weeks and it had several No. 1 singles.  </P> <P> I think it's about time people started rating records on public response and  not solely on critical acclaim.  </P> <P> DIANA GONZALEZ  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

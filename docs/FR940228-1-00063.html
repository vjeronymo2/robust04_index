			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 102&hyph;325, (the Amendments of 1992), Congress provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under that part, States and accrediting agencies are required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting associations, and the Secretary are linked to create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate or wish to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated evaluation of institutions by the three components of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education or training provided by the institutions or programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the State, the HEA added a new focus: reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute allocates legal responsibility among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities that compose the program integrity triad. While the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of institutional review. Within this statutory scheme, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates as efficiently as possible, with maximum integration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary institutions. In order to assist the Secretary in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary specifically requests comment on the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may establish different standards for evaluating the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's educational program. Thus, a reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's standards even though those standards address the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the burden on institutions and enable the triad entities to carry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out effectively their statutory functions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Should final regulations be more explicit in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consider in its evaluation of an institution?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the education or training offered by institutions that the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredits. Lastly, subpart 3 specifies the procedures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the NPRMs to implement the SPRP provisions in subpart 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3604) and the accrediting agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3578). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's publication of this NPRM prior to the publication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations implementing the SPRP and accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions provides the Department of Education an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinate all comments received on the triad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional eligibility requirements found in 34 CFR part 600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 10, 1994, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes changes to 34 CFR part 600. This NPRM addresses those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to subparts A and B of 34  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 668. Subpart A contains definitions applicable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. Subpart B contains requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial and continued participation in the programs. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, the following provisions in this NPRM address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of subpart 3: Proposed &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16 delineate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards for the evaluation of an institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and administrative capability, respectively, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by section 498(a), (c), and (d) of the HEA. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15 also codifies the definition of persons who exercise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control of an institution found in section 498(e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.12 addresses the requirements of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 498(b) of the HEA that requires the Secretary to develop a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application form to be used by institutions that wish to apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Proposed &sect;668.13 includes the provisions governing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of financial guarantees from owners found in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 498(e) of the HEA, addresses the provision that requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs found in section 498(g) of the HEA, and codifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions governing provisional certification of institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in section 498(h) of the HEA. Pursuant to sections 498(g)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (h) of the HEA, proposed &sect;668.26 delineates the date that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's period of participation would end, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's period of participation expires, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's provisional certification is revoked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Solution near in LA airport landing fees row A potential shutdown of Los Angeles airport appeared to have been averted yesterday after representatives of the airport authority and the big airlines neared a deal over higher landing fees. The airport this summer announced plans to triple its landing fees, and had threatened to shut down operations at midnight on Friday for airlines that refused to pay up. Both sides were summoned by Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, for talks in Washington aimed at averting potential disruption at the US's third busiest airport, which serves around 120,000 passengers a day. Mr Pena said on Tuesday night, after 14 hours of talks, that the two sides had reached agreement in principle, and talks resumed yesterday with the aim of finalising the deal. US airlines pay more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year in landing fees, and although this makes up only about 4.5 per cent of their costs, some carriers fear that airports across the country could be encouraged by Los Angeles's example to raise their fees. The airlines, which are already in shaky financial condition after years of rising costs and cut-throat competition, are afraid of being milked by cities anxious for new revenue sources. A separate case, in which airlines complained that higher fees at Grand Rapids airport in Michigan violated a federal law requiring them to be reasonable, was argued this week before the US Supreme Court. Even after tripling its fees, Los Angeles would be a long way from the most expensive airport in the country. The increase to Dollars 1.56 per 1,000lb, or about Dollars 900 for a Boeing 747, would still leave Los Angeles charging far less than the three New York area airports or Chicago's O'Hare. With the exception of Qantas, all the big US and foreign airlines had refused to pay the higher landing fees, and have filed a lawsuit against the increase. Mr Richard Riordan, Los Angeles's new mayor, promised in his election campaign to raise money from the airport to pay for more police officers, but he has backed away from this, which would be an illegal diversion of funds because Los Angeles received federal grants to help pay for capital improvements at the airport. Los Angeles serves as an important hub for flights between the US and the Asia-Pacific region, with around 2,000 take-offs and landings a day.</p>

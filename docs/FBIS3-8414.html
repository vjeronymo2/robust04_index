The HZDS is the major party in the government coalition and  the SDL is the largest opposition party.    The two men did not reach agreement on the date for the  early  elections or the extension of the present coalition, but the  talks are to continue and a later agreement has not been ruled  out.    The SDL suggests September or October as a "compromise"  election date while the HZDS sticks to the June term.    "We have formed a basis for further alignment," party  spokesmen said.    "The [Slovak National Party] SNS led by Jan Slota is not an  acceptable partner for the SDL," Ftacnik said, adding that he  considers finding clear answers to the contents of the political  agenda on future legislation and social, political and economic  policy a priority compared with personnel questions.    "If Meciar's government agreed to take on certain  obligations, we could visualise the present cabinet leading the  country to early elections," Ftacnik said, mentioning wider  government coalition and replacing the present cabinet with  another one with or without Meciar's participation as other ways  to resolve the current political situation.    "We remain a party of the opposition," Ftacnik said.</p>

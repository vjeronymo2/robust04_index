			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. KOREA DISSIDENTS AGAIN BATTLE POLICE; SEOUL ISSUES WARNING  </P> <P> Radical students and dissidents fought South Korean riot police in street  battles in Seoul and other cities Thursday for the second day, despite a  government warning against violence.  </P> <P> Riot police moved swiftly to disperse the groups of 200 to 500 students who  chanted "Down with President Roh Tae Woo!" during scattered protests in the  capital.  </P> <P> Thousands of riot police were deployed in downtown areas. They tightened street  checks and took away young pedestrians suspected of participating in the  clashes.  </P> <P> Shortly before nightfall, riot troops fired tear gas to disperse 1,500 students  carrying firebombs who had occupied a main street on the eastern edge of  downtown.  </P> <P> News reports said thousands of radical students armed with rocks, steel pipes  and firebombs battled police Thursday outside about 40 campuses or in the  streets nationwide. Details were not given.  </P> <P> Police did not say how many people were arrested Thursday.  </P> <P> Police detained 1,864 people in Seoul and 16 other cities during Wednesday's  street clashes, the largest and most violent since Roh took office in February,  1988.  </P> <P> About 100,000 students and dissidents participated in Wednesday's protests, and  247 police were injured. Protesters demanded that Roh annul the January merger  of his governing party with two opposition groups and resign.  </P> <P> Opposition and radical students say that Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party,  formed after the merger of three parties, was a "political coup d'etat" because  it was not ratified in an election. They contend that the merger in effect  nullified elections in which people voted for the two opposition parties as an  anti-government expression. Before the merger, Roh's party lacked a majority in  the National Assembly; the merged party has a sizable majority.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, protesters attacked 24 police stations, governing party offices  and government buildings. An office of the U.S. Information Service center in  Seoul was gutted by firebombs.  </P> <P> Roh's government warned Thursday that it would move swiftly and forcibly to  block labor and political violence.  </P> <P> Dissidents said they would stage more protests.  </P> <P> "Let's destroy the pro-American fascist" and "Drive out the Yankees," about 200  people shouted during a rally Thursday at Myungdong Cathedral in central Seoul.  </P> <P> In 1987, the cathedral was the focal point of nationwide anti-government  protests. That unrest forced authoritarian President Chun Doo Hwan to carry out  major democratic reforms, including the presidential election that brought Roh  to office.  </P></p>

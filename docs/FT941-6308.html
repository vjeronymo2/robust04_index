			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: T Cowie beats City forecasts Sharply lower interest costs helped T Cowie, the car leasing, motor trading, bus and tractor group, achieve a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 38m. The advance, from Pounds 24.3m in 1992, was ahead of market expectations and Cowie's shares closed up 7p at 331p. Turnover grew to Pounds 799.8m (Pounds 605.9m) including Pounds 148m generated by the Keep Trust motor group of 18 dealerships acquired for Pounds 28.6m last May. Earnings per share improved by 55 per cent to 20.8p (13.4p). A final dividend of 5.5p (4.25p) makes 7.85p, up 26 per cent. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said the results highlighted that 'the company car market is returning to normality,' with fleet renewals continuing to improve. Operating profits, including a Pounds 2.54m contribution from Keep Trust, slipped to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 61.7m) mainly reflecting the impact of falling interest rates on the core finance division and lower margins in the acquired motor dealerships. Offsetting this, the group recorded a net Pounds 3.82m exceptional gain mainly reflecting proceeds from share transactions compared with a net exceptional gain of Pounds 805,000 in 1992. Pre-tax profits were boosted by a sharp decline in interest costs and similar charges to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 36.2m). On a divisional basis, the finance division, which mainly comprises market-leader Cowie Interleasing, reported lower turnover of Pounds 230.3m (Pounds 245m), but a 43 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 16.6m). The motor division lifted its contribution to Pounds 8.53m (Pounds 5.48m) on turnover of Pounds 518.5m (Pounds 316.3m), partly reflecting the Keep Trust acquisition. Grey-Green, the group's London bus and coach operator, increased turnover to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.5m) but profits declined to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.8m) because of increased insurance costs. Hughes DAF, the national bus and coach distribution business, lifted turnover by 20 per cent to Pounds 16.1m and profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 2.26m. Net borrowings of Pounds 288m at end-December were down from Pounds 308.7m a year earlier and represented gearing of 212 per cent, down from 306 per cent. COMMENT The acquisition of Keep Trust has boosted Cowie into the big league of UK motor retailers. In the short term, however, it has eroded operating margins in the motor division - the new dealerships generated Pounds 1,763 of profits per employee in the final 9 months last year, still way behind the Pounds 4,891 per head generated in the established Cowie dealerships. Squeezing more profits out of the new dealerships coupled with the growth of contract hire and stronger fleet market should boost pre-tax profits to about Pounds 43.5m this year, producing earnings of 23p. Despite the recent increase in the share price they are still only trading on a forward multiple of 14.4 and could go higher.</p>

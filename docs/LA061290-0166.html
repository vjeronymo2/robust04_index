Final  </P> <P> BULGARIA STUDENTS STRIKE OVER ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Students formed a human chain around Sofia University today and declared a  strike over alleged government manipulation of what were billed as Bulgaria's  first free elections in 58 years.  </P> <P> The long-ruling Communists, who have renamed themselves the Socialist Party as  they strive to break with a repressive past, appeared headed for a decisive  victory in Sunday's elections.  </P> <P> Leaders of the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces claim a series of election  irregularities affected the outcome of Sunday's first round of balloting.  </P> <P> They rejected the Socialists' offer to join a governing coalition, and about  60,000 opposition supporters staged a protest rally Monday night.  </P> <P> "Down with the Red Mafia" and "We won't work for the Reds," they shouted.  Today, demonstrations forced the closure of several downtown roads.  </P></p>

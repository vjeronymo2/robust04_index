A maritime and goods stock  exchange in a Black Sea port, that can be good business, Viorel-  Marian Pana, chairman of the maritime stock exchange told a reporter  from the periodical ECONOMISTUL.  For the beginning, the Constanta  stock exchange has half a billion lei (about $460,000) in capital  and 124 shareholders, among which the Romanian Foreign Trade Bank,  the Romanian Commercial Bank, the Credit Bank, Bankcoop, and the  Romanian Development Bank.  "We have a system of computers which we  can call high-tech, and by its means we will be permanently in touch  with all goods stock exchange agencies that are to be set up by our  shareholders.  These agencies will participate, via their brokers,  in auctions," said Pana.  We have completed studies showing that we  should structure our activity, at least over the initial phase, for  a service market and a maritime management one.  Barter transactions  will also be made," added the Constanta goods stock exchange  chairman.

The company was supplied with  materials by a Yugoslav firm.  Part of the equipment has been  stopped, part of it has operated only at 70 percent of its capacity.  More than 1,000 employees have been made redundant.  The company has  spent a lot of money on buying raw materials from other markets.  Spending is increasing parallel with the drop in production.

This is a donation by the Japanese  Government and is part and parcel of the Romanian?Japanese                                                  ?  intergovernment agreement designed to help ensure an adequate  standard of instruction in management and related areas with most  up-to-date equipment.  Japanese Ambassador Joshiki Sugiura expressed  his confidence that the donated equipment, along with the  instruction of Romanian experts in Japan and the presence of  Japanese experts in Romania, would help the Bucharest institute  fulfill its targets.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1741 GMT 3 Dec  93 AU)      TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR MOLDOVA:  According to the program for  economic assistance granted by Romania to the Republic of Moldova,  the government has adopted two important decisions.  The first one  meets a request by the Government of Moldova regarding 245 million  lei from the funds at the disposal of the government for relations  with Moldova, which was initially intended to equip 65 trucks.  The  government decided that this sum of money should be spent to ensure  deliveries of veterinary medicines, sanitary equipment, and electric  utensils.  The second decision regards a 20-billion-lei credit made  available for the Republic of Moldova to finance Romanian deliveries  of fuels, mineral oils, and other goods urgently needed for 1993.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1842 GMT 3 Dec 93 AU)      SUCCESS OF ROMANIAN-TURKISH COMPANY:  The Freedom Star group of  companies, headquartered in Constanta, represents an example of  success in business.  In 1993 the turnover of this five-member  company -- international, holding, trading, electronics, and  shipping -- totaled some 60 billion lei (about $55 million).  About  80 percent of the turnover is represented by investments in  metallurgy and raw materials and the remainding 20 percent by  investments in electronics and household electrical appliances.  The  board of directors includes two Romanians and two Turks.  Freedom  Star International was founded in the fall of 1990.  First, its  trade consisted of small import-export operations.  "We have been  cooperating with two Turkish partners for three years now.  We have  made joint investments in the manufacture of television sets and in  a milk-processing unit.  The Turks could have cashed their profit,  that is 2 1/2 billion lei, but instead our Turkish partners  reinvested their profit along with us," Ion Serban, president of the  Board of Directors said.  "We will start new investments in 1994.  We believe in Romania's future and we want to continue to invest  here," Turkish Director Erhan Iarhun said.  Freedom Star is a group  with a special economic potential and with strong economic  relations.

Mr. Berinde also pointed out that the bilateral talks  referred to an increased share of commercial exchanges by growing  imports as well as exports.  He also added that "an appeal was made  on Austrian firms holding collaboration ties with Romanian companies  to act more firmly for the investment process in Romania, for the  manufacturing of products that will be subsequently exported on  third markets and even on the Austrian market."  Presently, Romanian  imports from Austria cover exports by only 64 percent, which is the  main reason why stress was laid on the achievement of a greater  equilibrium of the trade balance between the two countries.  During  the proceedings of the joint commission, the Austrian side showed  interest in the completion of several concrete projects for  collaboration.  "It is in fact the building of the Grand Hotel in  Bucharest, mostly financed by the Austrian side and Austrian support  in the building of a bridge across the Danube that would ensure a  smooth path for commercial exchanges within the current context of  the embargo imposed on Yugoslavia," said Mr. Berinde.  (Bucharest  ROMPRES in English 0507 GMT 7 Dec 93 AU)      ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH FINLAND:  "Romanian-Finnish commercial  ties accounted for some $10 million last year, which is rather  little compared with the real possibilities," the ambassador of  Finland in Bucharest, Timo Koponen, told the daily JURNAL NATIONAL.  Some $8 million has been registered until present, according to the  Finnish diplomat, which forecasts a certain growth for the current  year compared to 1992.  Ten Finnish companies are currently  operating in Romania, said the ambassador of Finland, the newest  one, Metaneff.  In his opinion, these projects started after the  signing of several agreements last year, following the visits paid  to Finland by Romania's President Ion Iliescu and the speaker of the  Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and during the meetings in  Bucharest of the Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu with  Finnish officials, agreements in the field of industry and  agriculture, as well as the understanding signed among eight  countries including Romania and Finland.  The ambassador also  considered as extremely important the Romanian-Finnish understanding  in the field of investment protection, which sets the legal  framework necessary for all investors.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in  English 0550 GMT 7 Dec 93 AU)      ROMANIAN-AMERICAN JOINT VENTURE:  The United States  Administration announced the financial support and assistance that  should be granted to a Romanian-American joint venture led by  Purolite International of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.  The joint  company will produce ion-exchanging resins for water purification.  The overseas private investments corporation (OPIC), which is an  agency of the American Administration, will provide up to $20  million for the virolite functional polymers plant.  This is the  first OPIC project in Romania.  The project will lead to the  technological improvement in water purification for the domestic  market and will generate exports for hard currency.  This joint  venture will encourage other American businessmen to invest in  Romania, said OPIC president Ruth R. Harkin.  Representatives of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) announced at  the signing ceremony in Bucharest that the EBRD would invest an  additional $3.5 million in this project and that it would make an  $11 million loan to the joint venture.  About 60 percent of the  production is estimated to be exported, thus bringing over $17  million from the exports to the American market alone.

The aircraft, used as training planes, were until 1992  sold only to the former USSR.  Ten planes have now been sold to  Western countries, the U.S. and Canada and 12 are prepared for  delivery to Hungary in the first quarter of next year.      FORUM FOR EXPARTIATE BUSINESSMEN:  Foreign Secretary Adrian  Dohotaru and Aurel Ghibutiu, president of the Romanian Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, held a news conference at the Gafencu Hall of  the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday, 26 November,  about the forthcoming forum of Romanian and Romanian-born  businessmen, scheduled for 29-30 November in Bucharest under the  aegis of the president of Romania, Ion Iliescu, at the initiative of  the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chamber of Commerce  and Industry.  Of the about 500 Romanian business people invited  from the diaspora, some 100 have already confirmed that they will  participate.  Top executives will present the Romanian legislation,  the restructuring programs, and the potential and requirements of  the Romanian economy in the present phase of the transition to a  market economy.  Business meetings and workshops will be organized  on specific subjects:  industry, agriculture, transportation,  finance, tourism, privatization, banking, and others.

Structural changes that have taken place in Romania set Romanian-  Brazilian ties on a new foundation.  Brazilians are interested in  free trade in Romania.  The South Constanta Port may work as  supplier of Brazilian iron ore to Central European countries.  At  the close of the Romanian-Brazilian Joint Commission, Mihai Berinde,  secretary of state in the Romanian Trade Ministry, and Francisco  Junquira, head of the Europe Department of the Brazilian Foreign  Ministry, initialed a trade and economic cooperation agreement, a  stimulation for long-term business.  On the basis of this agreement,  a framework was created for the free action of economic units of the  two countries willing to cooperate.

In June 1991, Mania set up -- together with  the Electrotimis company of Timisoara -- Stimel, an Italian-Romanian  joint venture manufacturing electrical equipment, with $4 four  million worth of capital.  Stimel's turnover had reached $1 million  by the end of 1991.  Mania and the Infratirea enterprise of Oradea  later set up Stimin.  The Stima group of Italy intends to open some  more Italian-Romanian joint ventures in Romanian towns.  Together  with the Dacia Felix Bank, Ioan Mania drafted a financial project  aimed at facilitating exports by the Italian industrial group and  finance Romanian industry.  Although important, tradition and human  resources are not enough for Romania's development, as equipment and  productivity have to be considered, Mania said.  "The existing  handicaps can be overcome," added the Romanian industrialist.  He  said his love for his country had acted as an incentive in his  cooperation with Romania.

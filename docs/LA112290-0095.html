			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO PALOS VERDES OKS DEAL FOR WASTE PICKUP AND RECYCLING  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council on Tuesday approved a five-year franchise  agreement with Waste Management of California Inc. to pick up trash and  recyclables at all multiple-family residential complexes beginning Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Waste Management also holds a franchise on trash collection for most of the  single-family residential units in Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> (Ivy Rubbish Disposal Services serves fewer than 500 residences in the  Portuguese Bend area.)  </P> <P> Under the terms of the agreement, the cost of trash pickup at townhouses,  condominiums and apartments will vary depending on the number of times trash is  picked up and the size and number of trash bins at each site.  </P> <P> The city negotiated with Waste Management for the flat rate per bin, bin size  and number of pickups per week. For example, one three-cubic-yard bin picked up  once a week will cost $63 per month. The same bin picked up six days a week  would cost $162 per month.  </P> <P> A comparative analysis by the city of rates that residential complexes are  presently paying shows many rates will go up, some by as much as 100%. Public  Works Director George Wentz told the council that the old rates did not include  a franchise fee or a recycling fee. He said that in some instances trash  collection companies employed by the housing complexes had not increased rates  recently because they knew the city was preparing to seek trash collection  bids.  </P> <P> Funds earned from the sale of recyclables collected in the city will come back  to the city to help pay the costs of implementing a state law that requires  cities to significantly curtail the amount of waste headed for landfills.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Salim Ayubzod, Igor Rotar report under the "talks" rubric: </F> "Tajiks Seek Peace in Moscow"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Tajik Government  delegation at talks in Moscow that opened on 5 April insists on  the following provisions: the suspension of hostilities along  the Tajik-Afghan border, and the return of refugees from  Afghanistan and CIS countries. Shukur Zukhurov, head of the  government delegation and minister of labor and population  employment, who previously would not give any guarantees of  safety of refugees wishing to go back to Tajikistan, stated in  his address that the republic's government gives full guarantees  to all who "wish to return to the republic with the intention of  rehabilitating the ravaged economy." But right on the heels of  it Zukhurov added in an interview for a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent that this question would only be resolved through  joint efforts of the government and the opposition. Zukhurov  paid special attention in his address to the question of  guarding the border. "Helped by Russia and the CIS countries,  Tajikistan will be able to protect itself, but we do not want  this to be done at the price of young people dying. Which is  why these talks are so important," Zukhurov declared.    Otakhon Latifi, head of the opposition forces delegation and  chairman of the Coordination Center of Democratic Forces of  Tajikistan in CIS Countries, underlined right at the start of  the talks that the opposition had not gone back on their plan  for the settlement of the conflict, and he thought that the  border question, like the one about the return of refugees,  cannot be resolved without political accord. A political  consensus, according to the opposition, becomes possible in the  event of the creation of a Council for National Reconciliation  (with representatives of all regions of the republic taking  part), a State Council comprising neutral and competent people,  disarmament and disbandment of all government and opposition  armed groups and formations, the return of refugees, and the  holding of free democratic elections. In his interview for a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Latifi pointed out that even  today's Dushanbe leaders, "including in that number Emomali  Rakhmonov himself, talk about the incompetence of the old  parliament, whereas electing a new parliament in conditions of a  breakdown of law and order and the absence from Tajikistan of  nearly 1 million citizens is a road toward a new impasse."  [passage omitted]    So far Tajikistan's government has been rather evasive in  its  reaction to the opposition's demand for the creation of a State  Council. For example, Makhmadsaid Ubaydullayev, Tajikistan  Council of Ministers deputy chairman, underlined in an interview  to ITAR-TASS yesterday that today's government is quite  legitimate because it was elected by the country's Supreme  Soviet. On the other hand, in Ubaydullayev's opinion, this  question, likewise the form of a future state system of the  republic, can be decided on and chosen only by the people of  Tajikistan rather than an individual group of people. In this  sense, the deputy prime minister ruled out the holding of a  referendum.    According to information from trustworthy sources, results  of  the current talks are being eagerly awaited not only by tens of  thousands of refugees, but also by armed opposition groups.  Conferences of opposition field commanders are taking place  these days in Talukan (Afghanistan) to discuss further actions.  Sources maintain that these forces have so far undertaken no  major offensive against the Tajik-Afghan border. [passage  omitted]    Even if the talks take the most favorable turn, one should  not forget about the time factor. Both sides are represented at  today's stage of talks by "second echelons" of the power  structures. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told in  yesterday's telephone conversation by Haji Akbar Turadzhonzoda,  former head of Tajikistan's Muslims who is now in Teheran, that  he did not come to Moscow because the government delegation is  not representative enough. Interestingly, Tajikistan Foreign  Minister Rashid Alimov is in Moscow as a private individual and  seems to be secretly in control of the official Dushanbe  delegation.    It is therefore hardly probable that the delegations, in  their present composition, will score appreciable successes. As  in all similar conflicts, time is not on the side of those  advocating compromise -- a further delay in resolving the  problem may result in the situation finally getting out of  control and events assuming an uncontrolled, spontaneous nature.</p>

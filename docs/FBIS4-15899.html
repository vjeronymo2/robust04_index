			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva April 13 TASS -- Georgia and Abkhazia  disagree on the conflict areas where U.N. peace-making troops  should be deployed.    ITAR-TASS has learned about these differences from  participants of the Tuesday meeting in Geneva, attended by the  Georgian and Abkhazian delegations, as well as representatives  from the United Nations and Russia.    The Georgian delegation moved to deploy U.N. peace-making  units and inspectors along the entire parameter of the conflict  zone in Abkhazia, in particular, along the Psou river (the  border with Russia) and the Inguri river (the border with  Georgia), on mountain passes, along the littoral and at the  airports of Sukhumi and Bombara. It believes the "blue helmets"  should prevent the resumption of hostilities and should put an  end to the delivery of weapons and manpower to the conflict zone.    The Abkhazian side believes that U.N. peace-makers should be  posted only along the Inguri river, which now separates the two  conflicting sides, and that the "blue helmets" should ensure the  disengagement of the conflicting sides, should prevent the  infiltration of their troops into the 6-10-kilometre wide  disengagement corridor.    The discussion will be continued in the course of further  consultations on Wednesday and possibly on Thursday. The U.N.  experts are expected to outline their views during these  consultations, which will not adopt any decisions. However, the  exchange of views will help Eduard Brunner, the U.N. secretary-  general's special envoy, who is presiding over the meeting, and  then the secretary-general himself to formulate the U.N.  Security Council's proposals. The council is to decide whether  it is worth sending U.N. peace-makers to the region and how many  men should be dispatched there if a corresponding decision is  adopted.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKY'S THE LIMIT WHEN YOU WANT TO AVOID TRAFFIC;  </P> <P> SCHEDULED LONG BEACH-L.A. FLIGHT CUTS DOWN 17-MILE TRAVEL TIME  </P> <P> Frazzled at the thought of facing the bumper-to-bumper commute down the San  Diego Freeway?  </P> <P> Find flaws with such ecological alternatives as the car pool or such pricey  fare as the taxi?  </P> <P> Well, you can always take a plane. Among the 89 far-flung cities listed in a  new American Airlines ad campaign for summer discount fare destinations from  Los Angeles International Airport is one just 17 miles away: Long Beach.  </P> <P> Fact is, it might be cheaper to rent a stretch limousine.  </P> <P> American reservations clerks will tell you that the least-expensive, round-trip  coach price for the intra-county flight is $85. That's $7 more than the fare to  San Diego, San Francisco or San Jose.  </P> <P> What's more, to qualify, passengers must comply with the same restrictions on  the Long Beach-to-Los Angeles jaunt as they would taking a 2,475-mile  transcontinental trip to New York City.  </P> <P> Specifically, tickets must be purchased two weeks in advance and travelers from  Los Angeles must stay overnight in Long Beach at least one Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $134 Price Prevails  </P> <P> Otherwise, the airline said, the trip costs $134.  </P> <P> Few passengers pay full fare, American officials said, inasmuch as the  twice-daily flights on the 15- and 19-passenger commuter propjets operated by  the airline's American Eagle subsidiary are offered primarily as a feeder  service for travelers making connections with long-distance flights in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> But there are exceptions.  </P> <P> "I recently had someone coming into LAX from a long flight who looked down and  saw the 405 Freeway was an absolute disaster," said David Michel, a passenger  service supervisor for American Eagle. "When he landed, he threw his credit  card down and paid me $67 for a one-way flight to Long Beach."  </P> <P> Couriers dismayed by heavy freeway traffic also occasionally make use of the  service, according to American officials.  </P> <P> American is the only major airline that flies between Los Angeles and Long  Beach. The concise route is not the shortest scheduled by a major commercial  carrier -- that title goes to United for its once-daily, 11-mile run over the  bay between San Francisco and Oakland. But Long Beach-Los Angeles is apparently  the briefest over land, besting a TWA route between Burbank and Long Beach by  nine air miles.  </P> <P> "The record time from Long Beach to LAX," said Michel, "is 4.5 minutes from  lift-off to touchdown."  </P> <P> Last Friday morning, Flight 5313 from Los Angeles revved up right on schedule  at 11:13 a.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compact Compartment  </P> <P> The twin-engine Beechcraft C-99, which felt like a vibrating, airborne  toothpaste tube, is so small that the four passengers were seated in the same  compartment as the pilot and first officer.  </P> <P> There was no flight attendant, no food, no beverages and no bathroom aboard.  "We tell them the movie today is the 405 Freeway," joked pilot John  Villedrouin.  </P> <P> After an eight-minute wait to leave the ground, the plane headed west toward  the Pacific, climbing to 5,000 feet and hugging the South Bay coastline before  veering east past the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Seal Beach and swinging back  toward Long Beach. Within 17 minutes -- about the time it took for passenger  Sue Sucher to consume a couple of pages of a paperback -- the plane was back on  terra firma.  </P> <P> Sucher, headed to Long Beach from Palo Alto for a youth soccer conference,  thought the flight was fascinating. But she added that the haze of smog that  hid most of the Los Angeles Basin was mortifying.  </P> <P> "I have a daughter in college in Claremont," she said, "and it's very  frightening."  </P> <P> After a 20-minute layover, the return flight was airborne only 8 1/2 minutes --  two minutes less than the time it took to taxi in to the terminal once the  plane had landed.  </P> <P> The flight -- north toward Inglewood and then west to LAX -- was also choppier.  </P> <P> "It's a bumpy road," said sweating, Chicago-bound Eddie Acuna of Cerritos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Going to Take a Car'  </P> <P> Acuna and his wife, Ophelia, had taken the Long Beach flight to avoid having  their 18-year-old son drive them to LAX. Next time, Acuna said, "I'm going to  take a car or a cab."  </P> <P> In May, 224 passengers flew between the two communities on a single scheduled  late-morning flight in each direction, according to American Airlines spokesman  Ed Stewart. Those numbers were strong enough, Stewart said, that a second,  mid-afternoon flight was added last month.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, there are people who would fly next door if the service  were offered," Stewart said. "We are starved for planes. If it wasn't used, I  guarantee it would be canceled in 10 seconds."  </P> <P> Added the Dallas-based spokesman: "I've never been to Los Angeles for an  extended period but I've heard the freeways are as bad as putting a bullet  through your head."  </P> <P> Besides their function as connector flights, the Los Angeles-Long Beach flights  serve several other purposes.  </P> <P> Free-trip junkies seeking to pick up quick miles for their frequent-flier plans  occasionally hop on, since the minimum award American offers for any of its  flights is 500 miles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequently Half Empty  </P> <P> American employees also hitch rides, usually for business purposes, on the  frequently half-empty planes.  </P> <P> "It's kind of pretty to fly at 2,000 feet," noted American Eagle passenger  service representative Alex Syracopoulos.  </P> <P> Richard M. Valade, a merchandising manager for General Foods in New York,  recently took the noon hop from Long Beach to Los Angeles to take advantage of  a cost-cutting scheduling quirk.  </P> <P> Valade would have had to pay $934 for an unrestricted transcontinental round  trip between New York and Los Angeles because he made last-minute reservations.  But American was offering a special $318 unrestricted fare from the East Coast  to Long Beach.  </P> <P> "It was much cheaper to fly from New York to Long Beach than from New York to  Los Angeles," Valade said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES SURGE ON MIDEAST NEWS, TREASURY AUCTION  </P> <P> A swirl of Persian Gulf developments and a robust $12.5-billion auction of  Treasury notes sent long-term bond prices significantly higher Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 13/16 point, or $8.31 per $1,000 in  face amount. Its yield was down to 8.28% from 8.35% late Monday. Markets were  closed Tuesday for Christmas.  </P> <P> Analysts said the Treasury's successful $12.5-billion auction of two-year  notes, while adding an overall bullish tone to trading, may also have dampened  demand in the secondary market's short-end.  </P> <P> Yields on the auctioned two-year Treasury notes fell to 7.32%, their lowest  level since two-year notes averaged 7.16% on Feb. 24, 1988.  </P> <P> In the secondary market, short-term maturities were up 1/16 point to 3/16  point, intermediate maturities rose 9/32 point to 15/32 point and long-term  issues gained 9/16 point to 25/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial  information service reported.  </P> <P> The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a  $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> Overall trading was choppy and light, with many traders waiting to make a move  until after New Year's. This made the market particularly vulnerable to the  day's steady stream of Middle East developments.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are trying to get themselves a low profile for the year-end,"  said Jim Kenney, head trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.  </P> <P> Early in the day, the market backed off on news that the State Department asked  all nonessential personnel and dependents of U.S. government workers to leave  Jordan and Sudan before the Jan. 15 deadline that the United Nations has set  for Iraq to withdraw or face the possibility of war.  </P> <P> The State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens defer travel to the  two countries, where the populations generally support Iraq.  </P> <P> Traders interpreted the development as heightening the prospect for a war in  the Persian Gulf that could spark higher inflation. High inflation generally  erodes the value of government securities such as bonds and notes.  </P> <P> Prices rebounded on an Israeli newspaper report, later denied, that Washington  and Baghdad had set a date for talks on an Iraqi withdrawal from occupied  Kuwait.  </P> <P> The independent daily Maariv, quoting Israeli diplomats in contact with  American officials, said Secretary of State James A. Baker III probably will  meet with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9. The State Department said the  report wasn't true.  </P> <P> "There's one rumor after another," said Carol A. Stone, senior economist at  Nomura Securities International Inc. "The rest of it has to do with the fact  the recession gives the bond market a positive tone."  </P> <P> The Lehman Bros. daily Treasury bond index, which measures price movements on  all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.85  to 1,181.30.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 6.66%, as the discount was down 6  basis points to 6.47%. Yields on six-month bills were down to 6.86%, as the  discount fell 7 basis points to 6.55%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 6.93%,  as the discount was down 4 basis points to 6.51%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 7.5%, up from 7.0% late Monday.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds was unchanged from late Monday's 91 5/32 point. The average yield to  maturity also was unchanged at 7.48%.  </P></p>

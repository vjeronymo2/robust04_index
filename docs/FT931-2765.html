			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Effect on consumer spending uncertain CONSUMERS ARE under the fiscal equivalent of the sword of Damocles. How much heed people pay to the Pounds 16bn of tax increases over a two-year period from April next year will make a big difference to the pace and timing of any sustained recovery. The balance of opinion among economists and experts in consumer behaviour yesterday was that Mr Lamont's fiscal tightening would act to depress consumer spending in the year ahead. Professor Peter Abell, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, said: 'From a psychological point of view, the prospect of tax rises is a damper. It will reinforce the air of despondency that many people feel after the economic shocks of the past two years.' The chancellor is gambling that by choosing a range of methods to raise extra revenue the effects will be little noticed. The measures include imposition of VAT on domestic fuel, higher national insurance contributions and a freeze on income tax allowances. Mr Lamont hopes also that the economic forces already prodding Britain in the direction of an upturn will have had their full effect by the time the tax rises take place. Whatever their impact, the rises will serve as a highly practical test of economic theories about 'rational expectations' - the idea that people and businesses will adjust their behaviour in the light of all available information, including the prospect of extra strains on their finances. One sceptic is Mr Dan Elliot, an economist at PA Cambridge Economic Consultants, a consultancy specialising in consumer behaviour. He thinks rational expectation does not stand up when the information presented to consumers is relatively diffuse and technical. As a result, the announcement will have little impact on consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of total UK output. 'In a few weeks, people will have forgotten about the tax rises,' said Mr Elliot. Another apparent sceptic is Mr Lamont, who said yesterday he thought the tax rises would have no lasting effect on consumer confidence ahead of their implementation. Even so, the Treasury's economic projections published with the Budget statement indicate that consumer activity will remain extremely weak over the next nine months. The Treasury reckons consumers' real, inflation-adjusted disposable income will grow by only 0.75 per cent this year, after a relatively high 2.3 per cent last year. On the Treasury view, consumers will be prepared to save less of their incomes, as confidence grows. It reckons the savings ratio - personal savings as a proportion of disposable income - will fall from 11.4 per cent in the final quarter of last year to just under 11 per cent next year. But even with this prospect, the Treasury thinks consumer spending will rise only slowly. It is predicting growth in spending of a modest 1.25 per cent this year, after a 0.25 per cent rise last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] The dialogue between the Central American chiefs of  state and U.S. Vice President Al Gore resulted in the setting of  conditions and promises that did not come anywhere near what had  been expected.    For the six presidents who participated in the dialogue with  Gore, it was most important to know the White House's position  on the possibility of the Central American countries forming  part of the free trade agreement signed by the United States,  Canada, and Mexico. But for the United States, the objective of  the minisummit was to prepare for the upcoming hemispheric  summit President William Clinton convened in Miami for December.    Gore discounted any kind of short- or mid-term link between  the Central American countries and NAFTA. Instead, the vice  president offered his interlocutors a program that would only  give textiles and apparel treatment equivalent to that provided  under NAFTA.    Gore cautioned, however, that to benefit from this program,  the Central American nations would have to open their domestic  markets to U.S. textiles and apparel.</p>

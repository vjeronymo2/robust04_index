Two brothers were shot dead in Khanbal as  they were working in the field, while three people were martyred  in a village near Sopor. The rest of the people were victims of  Indian atrocities in Hindwara, Baramula, and some other places.  During these operations, the occupation troops also torched a  number of houses. In response to the growing Indian atrocities,  the mojahedin have stepped up their retaliatory attacks and have  killed four Indian soldiers on Srinagar-Jammu road. According  to reports, a mojahed commander, Farooq Ahmad Butt, attacked a  convoy of Indian troops with live grenade. Two soldiers were  blown to bits, while 11 others were critically injured. The  mojahed leader was also martyred in the attack.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 'SOUTH WON'T RISE AGAIN,' CONFEDERATE FLAG THIEF DECLARES  </P> <P> The Confederate battle flag was stolen from its perch atop Alabama's historic  Capitol in a pre-dawn theft Wednesday apparently by a man who told a news  organization: "The South won't rise again."  </P> <P> A new Rebel standard was back in place by 9 a.m. flying below the Stars and  Stripes and the Alabama state flag, officials said.  </P> <P> The Confederate flag, a target of protest by critics who contend that it  symbolizes slave-era racial oppression, was hauled down by an intruder in the  Capitol, the site where Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as president of the  Confederacy in 1861.  </P> <P> The Capitol is closed and mostly empty for restoration work.  </P></p>

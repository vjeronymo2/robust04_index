			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHONE TALKS STILL HUNG UP IN STRIKE'S 2ND DAY  </P> <P> The strike against Pacific Bell in California and two other "Baby Bells" that  supply local phone service to much of the Atlantic coast entered its second day  Monday -- normally the week's busiest day -- with informal talks taking place  but no signs pointing toward settlements.  </P> <P> No formal negotiations between the two sides are scheduled.  </P> <P> The automated networks continued working as usual at Pacific Bell, at NYNEX's  phone companies in New York and New England and at Bell Atlantic, whose  subsidiaries serve the Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> But customers still encountered aggravating delays for operator assistance,  postponement of scheduled installations and, according to union spokesmen,  delays of a week or more to obtain appointments for routine equipment repairs  that normally take 24 hours.  </P> <P> There were also isolated incidents of shortened tempers on picket lines.  </P> <P> In the San Fernando Valley, pickets blocked vans carrying management workers  who had been flown in from Oakland and other vehicles carrying non-union  workers. At one point, several vehicles inched ahead until they nudged the  blocking strikers, who responded by hammering on their hoods with picket signs.  </P> <P> The most effective roadblock proved to be a picket's 150-pound Newfoundland  dog, which dozed in a key driveway. The dog wore a sign saying: "Pac Bell's  gone to the dogs."  </P> <P> In Boston, police arrested a dozen striking workers of New England Telephone, a  NYNEX subsidiary, for allegedly blocking the exits and driveway of a company  facility.  </P> <P> Angry workers in Manhattan shouted slogans and curses in front of buildings  used by New York Telephone.  </P> <P> John Garcia, a Pacific Bell service technician on picket duty in Burbank,  predicted that such incidents would increase if a settlement failed to come  soon.  </P> <P> "It's going to turn ugly," Garcia said. "You shouldn't turn your back on your  fellow workers."  </P> <P> Gary Gonzales, a picket-line monitor representing the striking Communications  Workers of America, emphasized that violence and service disruptions are not  union policy but added: "People are not too happy. You try to control the  workers' fervor, but there's only so much you can do."  </P> <P> The CWA represents more than 41,000 employees at Pacific Bell and another 750  at the Reno area's Nevada Bell, the other phone company of the parent  organization, Pacific Telesis. There, a handful of picketing CWA members vowed  to stay off the job until contract demands are met.  </P> <P> The CWA has been joined by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  in the strikes at NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, inside phone company facilities on both coasts, management personnel  struggled to keep up with the growing volume of calls and customer requests.  </P> <P> All 17,000 of Pacific Bell's non-union personnel have strike assignments, said  spokeswoman Lissa Zanville.  </P> <P> Stepping into the front-line jobs is not necessarily an easy task for them,  some managers are finding. A harassed operator fielding directory-assistance  calls displayed confusion over whether a particular city's numbers were  available on her computer.  </P> <P> "It's loads of fun," she lamented.  </P> <P> Adding fuel to the picket line militancy was a growing awareness that  automation limits the strikers' ability to hurt their employers. At the same  time, labor-saving technology jeopardizes many of their technical and clerical  jobs.  </P> <P> Larry Beale, the CWA's chief negotiator who recently reached agreement with  Thousand Oaks-based GTE California, the state's second-largest local phone  company, said workers usually assess automation when they consider a strike.  </P> <P> "The people who work in the central (switching) office are more inclined to  say, 'Don't kid yourself, the system doesn't run itself,' " Beale said. "The  systems we have today almost operate themselves -- except that if the system  starts to get in trouble, it's so complex that they're going to have major  problems."  </P> <P> Coincidentally, GTE workers on Monday ratified the tentative agreement achieved  July 9 on the eve of a strike. The new contract is retroactive to March 5 and  will run until Dec. 17, 1992, GTE spokesman Larry Cox said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the CWA's international president, Morton Bahr, is expected to ask  the AFL-CIO's executive council, which is holding a quarterly meeting today in  Chicago, to urge all union members and their families to refuse to pay local  phone bills during the strike.  </P> <P> "The companies are still charging for key consumer services that they cannot  deliver, like directory service and repair," said a union source. "We're saying  that's not fair."  </P> <P> Major differences in all three strikes center on wages, job security and  financing health benefits. The company is asking the workers to assume a  greater share of skyrocketing health-care costs, a concept the union adamantly  opposes.  </P> <P> William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation  of Labor, said any attempt to increase telephone workers' health-care  contributions "is just another case of greed." He said unions have won improved  health benefits only by accepting lower wage increases in the past.  </P> <P> "The unions had to sacrifice wage increases to support these programs,"  Robertson said. "Now, in many, cases employers try to give the appearance that  they're providing this coverage."  </P> <P> Nearly 157,000 telecommunications workers walked off their jobs over the  weekend after contracts expired between the CWA and International Brotherhood  of Electrical Workers and three of the seven regional Bell companies created in  1984 to take over local phone operations from American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph. Only customers of Bell South's phone companies, serving Southeastern  states, were spared a strike after a tentative agreement was reached minutes  before Saturday's midnight strike deadline.  </P> <P> Contracts with the three remaining Baby Bells -- Ameritech in Chicago, US West  in Denver and Southwestern Bell in St. Louis -- will expire this Saturday.  Their phone companies provide local service throughout much of the rest of the  United States.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bob Baker, Hector Tobar and Jonathan Weber and photographer  Rick Meyer contributed to this story.  </P></p>

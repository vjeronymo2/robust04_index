However, beyond the  car stickers saying: "The people are united on the Golan," what  do the residents of the plateau think about their future? The  poll we held among the settlers was conducted by Haifa  University's Statistics Department under the scientific  supervision of Dr. Avner Halevi, an internationally renowned  expert. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling sums up the  poll's results:    Question: Do you think we can reach with the Syrians an  agreement which contains less than a full withdrawal from the  Golan Heights? Fifty-one percent of Golan residents do not  believe we can.    Question: Do you think that within five years there will be  a peace accord which includes a withdrawal? Fifty-five percent  believe that within five years there will be such an agreement  which includes some withdrawal. Twenty-four percent do not  believe there will be such an agreement.    Question: Would you be prepared to live on the Golan Heights  under Syrian sovereignty? Seven-and-a-half percent are ready to  live on the Golan Heights under Syrian sovereignty, 85.5 percent  are not prepared to do so, although even among them there are  those who believe that there will be a withdrawal in the long  run.    Question: Did you discuss the option of leaving the Golan  within your family circle? Fifty-two percent did discuss the  option with their family and that includes religious  inhabitants, kibbutz members, and people living in the town of  Qatzrin. Among these people, 11 percent have already made a  move in that direction, such as looking for other jobs and  alternative housing, and the possibility of receiving financial  compensation.    Question: Would you be prepared to leave the Golan Heights  now in return for adequate compensation? Some 12 percent are  prepared to leave now in return for appropriate compensation.  An interesting point is that all those who responded positively  on that came from kibbutzim or live in Qatzrin. Not a single  resident of the moshavim are ready to leave in return for  compensation.    Question: What compensation do you think appropriate? Among  those ready to evacuate, some 35 percent mentioned between  $100,000 and $300,000. Some 60 percent are not prepared to  quote the amount they would accept.    The next question is general: Do you support the peace  process with the PLO on an autonomy for Judaea, Samaria, and the  Gaza Strip? Golan residents are equally divided between  supporters and opponents of the agreement with the PLO: 46.3  percent both for and against. Compared to previous polls, it  appears that for the majority there is no obvious link between  their views on the Golan Heights and their positions on the  Palestinian autonomy. They support the autonomy in other areas,  but oppose leaving the Golan Heights.    The last question: How did you vote in the last elections  and would you vote the same way today? Fifty percent of Labor  voters would vote the same way again, 27 percent would not vote  Labor, and the others are undecided. Among those who voted for  right-wing parties -- Likud, Tzomet, the National Religious  Party -- 60 to 70 percent would vote for them again. Among  Meretz voters, 30 percent said openly that they would not vote  for it again, 40 percent would recast their vote for it, and 30  percent are undecided.    The telephone poll was conducted among 250 households on the  Golan Heights based on a representative sample.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: GMB poll cheer for Labour THE UNIONS have re-established their credibility as representatives of Labour voters, according to the GMB general workers' union after analysis of polling around the April general election. Figures supplied to the union by the Mori polling organisation showed that Labour took a 15 per cent lead over the Tories among trade unionists in a 25,000 sample. Labour's share was 46 per cent against 31 per cent for the Tories. The statistics will be used by trade unions to rebut accusations that they did not deliver Labour votes from among their members, and to defend links with the party. According to Mori, Labour's vote among trade unionists increased on 1987 by 4 per cent. The Liberal Democrats lost a similar percentage and the Tories picked up 1 per cent. It was the best result for Labour among trade unionists since 1979, according to the analysis. However, a 'terrifying gender gap' was detected among voters aged 18-24. Young male union members swung to Labour by 6.5 per cent between 1987 and 1992 but support from young women members fell 14 per cent. Among all trade unionists there was a strong swing to Labour of 2.5 per cent in the last three days of the election campaign, when other voters were moving against Labour. In the GMB's ballot for the Labour leadership, Mr John Smith - who is sponsored by the union - polled 110,177 against Mr Bryan Gould's 30,267. For the deputy leadership, Mrs Margaret Beckett polled 74,771 against Mr John Prescott's 37,270 and Mr Gould's 28,158.</p>

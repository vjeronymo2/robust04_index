			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Life Under ANC Rule -- "The national SUNDAY TIMES opinion  poll -- one of the most comprehensive polls ever conducted in  this country -- brings a dash of cold reality to a political  debate that has until now been wrapped in delusion and political  deceit," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 16  January in a page 16 editorial. "The ANC [African National  Congress] wins hands down, not only nationally but in seven of  the nine provinces, and perhaps in all of them." De Klerk's  ability to defend minority interests is doubted due to his own  party's weak showing in the poll, while a question is also  raised over the ANC's adherence to democratic principles. "Deep  sceptism abouth the ANC's devotion to democracy is  understandable, especially while the ANC horse carries its SACP  [South African Communist Party] jockey, but it's the best we  have," especially in light of the poll results showing the Pan  Africanist Congress, PAC, as blacks second choice. "Those  whites who see Mr Mandela as the devil incarnate .... might  reflect: it could be worse. This analysis defines rather  neatly the task which lies ahead for the minority communities,  and especially the white community: it is to help the ANC,  after April 27, to make South Africa work," otherwise the  country faces the possible "capture of power by a radical black  nationalist PAC." What the country needs now is "a new breed of  subtle men and women" like Finance Minister Derek Keys, who has  shown how "honest consultation and wise diplomacy" can "woo the  ANC towards success."  <H6>  SUNDAY STAR </H6>   ANC Urged To Campaign Honestly -- "Optimism about the future  is understandable, particularly among South Africa's millions of  unemployed black youth," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY STAR in  English on 16 January in a page 26 editorial. "Now with  democracy just months away they believe the new government is  going to improve education and provide jobs. And do this  overnight. There is every reason to believe the ANC is going to  try its damndest to deliver the goods, but it's going to take  time, and the going will be tough," therefore, "the ANC must not  make promises it cannot keep. The ANC must prepare the  understandably impatient youth for the realities it will face  when it moves into the Union Buildings in three months' time."  "If it promises the earth and can't deliver in the short term,  there's going to be more than heartache as a result," concludes  the SUNDAY STAR.  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Right Wing Alliance Pursuit for Homeland -- "At the end of  last year, when the right wing began their hesitant dialogue  with the African National Congress, General Constand Viljoen  declared that they would [word indistinct] in a page 8  editorial. "Just a few weeks later the very same general and  his co-leaders were forced to throw in the towel; the ANC was  also not going to give it to them. Now they are looking at  `other ways' of achieving their homeland." "The Freedom  Alliance, and in particular right-wing Afrikaners, must realize  that one door after another is being closed to them because they  are failing to use their options and come forward with realistic  plans. The government realized a while ago that the right wing  rarely used a rational approach. Now Mr. Nelson Mandela is  apparently also beginning to discover this. It is necessary for  everyone to realize that the losers will not be those on whose  behalf Messrs Mandela and De klerk speak. It will be Messrs  Buthelezi, Viljoen, Hartzenberg, and Mangope's followers who,  because of the shortsighted actions of their leaders, are being  defined out of the creation process of the new politics. Even  Ciskei's Oupa Gqozo could see that."    Black Matriculants' Performance `Pathetic' -- A second  editorial on the same page of BEELD says that "the pathetic  performance of black matriculants in the end-of-year  examinations surprises no one. The tragedy was foretold during  the course of last year. Now the bitter fruit of timely  warnings, which no one heeded, are being plucked. It is true  that black education is not up to standard. Yet at those black  schools where discipline was maintained, students did very well.  There were even schools where all the matriculants passed their  examinations. The political misuse of pupils, vandalism,  organized stayaways by pupils, and strikes by teachers, who act  only in self-interest, were the offenders who contributed most  to the poor results. Fortunately, it seems that those who  caused the anarchy are beginning to come to their senses. The  Congress of South African Students has called on pupils to  return to school and cultivate a culture of learning, and the  South African Democratic Teachers' Union has committed itself to  a disruption-free school year in 1994."</p>

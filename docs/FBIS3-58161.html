			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister John Major today declared NATO's door  open to new members, but said it was not yet possible to say who  would qualify to join, nor when. "Those who wish to join have  much work to do, with our assistance, to prepare themselves," he  told a summit of the leaders of existing NATO members in  Brussels.    Mr. Major said the main challenge facing the alliance was  deciding what relationships to develop with the new democracies  in East Europe.    Extending NATO was a process only now just beginning -- "an  evolutionary and transitional process without a predetermined  end result," he warned on the first day of the two-day meeting  which will shape future defence strategy for the whole of Europe.    The governments of Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and  the Czech Republic, worried by the surge of right-wing extremism  in Russia, want early NATO membership, with firm security  guarantees.    But even as the summit got under way, hard-line Russian  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy warned that  incorporating former Soviet bloc states into the alliance could  lead to World War Three.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned that expanding  NATO at present could play into the hands of his country's  nationalist extremists and destroy democratic reforms.    The summit will set out NATO's determination to accept new  members in an "evolutionary process" and make clear that no  country, including Russia, has a veto -- but will not specify  criteria for membership or set a firm timetable, effectively  shutting out new partners for at least four more years.    Mr. Major told the summit: "It must be our objective to  consolidate democracy in all of the countries to the east now  embracing it, to develop a closer partnership with them and to  help to enhance their security and stability."    But there would be no single blueprint for future links.    "These countries are not all alike and NATO's relationships  with them will differ," he said.    He welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative launched  by U.S. President Bill Clinton, saying: "The process could  clearly lead to the admission of new members. The door is open.  We cannot yet define who will be able to meet the obligations  of membership, or when."    The Poles, Czechs and Hungarians were in the front rank, but  there must not be a new dividing line in Europe which would  re-create opposing blocs. "We must show that NATO is a genuine  partner for democratic Russia, not an opponent. It is therefore  essential for NATO to build a closer relationship with Russia  which acknowledges that country's special status," Mr. Major  said.    NATO's success as a cornerstone of post-war European  security  could not be taken for granted, and maintaining a security  "insurance" required a continuing commitment.    Today the summit was battling with real conflict on its  doorstep as well as preparing for longer term security -- Bosnia  hung like a black cloud over the plaudits for NATO's past  successes.    Mr. Major was adamant that NATO had so far worked  efficiently  in the former Yugoslavia, supporting the United Nations,  enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic, carrying out air operations  and planning for a peace implementation operation. But he  admitted that, as Bosnia struggled through another winter of  war, the allies faced serious questions which the summit could  not resolve.</p>

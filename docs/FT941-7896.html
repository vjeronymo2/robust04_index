			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Israel tots up cost of settlers While publicly insisting it has no plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli government has begun calculating the cost of rehousing the estimated 32,000 Jewish settler families in homes inside Israel's sovereign borders, a report on state television said last night. The report claimed the Finance Ministry has drawn up a working paper which estimates the cost of rehousing the settlers at Dollars 300,000 per family, implying a total Dollars 9.6bn (Pounds 6.5bn) to move the entire settler population. Under its framework agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation on limited self-rule for the Palestinians of the occupied territories, Israel is not obliged to dismantle any of the 140-plus Jewish settlements over the next five years. The settlements' final status has been left for negotiation at talks scheduled to begin in 1996.</p>

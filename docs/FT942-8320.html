			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (1): Long arms of the revenue collectors - National borders are losing their effectiveness as barriers between tax payers and collecting agencies. Andrew Jack explains the reasons for the trend Tax has never been such an international issue, and never have the domestic financial affairs of individuals and companies been so affected by developments in other countries. The expansion of corporations, the spread of complex new transactions and the aggressive role of governments and their tax authorities have all been more evident than ever. The emergence of a series of regional political and economic blocs - notably the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union and the European Economic Area - has influenced the process. Nowhere has the internationalisation of tax been played out more powerfully than within the EU. The formal creation of the single European market brought with it from the start of 1993 a harmonisation of the system of indirect taxation. There have been many complaints about the administration of the new system, and many suggestions about how to handle 'triangular trade' between companies with operations in a number of different member states. Yet to a large extent, the teething difficulties have been overcome. Border controls have been relaxed, new administrative procedures have been put in place, and there are even some signs of the market beginning to drive down differentials in value added tax (VAT) rates across borders. A more important issue for the EU now is whether it will be able to switch from the current partially 'destination-based' system of VAT to its original stated objective: a regime in which all goods and services sold across borders are subject to tax in their country of origin. There is also the vexed question of greater harmonisation of direct taxes across Europe. The Ruding Commission, set up to examine the issue, has apparently been left to gather dust at a time of such political turmoil and the growing emphasis on subsidiarity. However, the EU has not entirely given up, with relevant directives being issued on mergers and reconstructions, withholding tax between parent and subsidiary companies and transfer pricing arbitration, for example. Elsewhere around the world, US President Clinton's threat early in his term in 1992 to clamp down more firmly on foreign corporations suspected of paying insufficient tax has proved largely hollow. That is not to say there is any complacency. The US Internal Revenue Service has long set an example followed by many of its counterparts elsewhere, with a growing hostility towards perceived evasion and avoidance. In the UK, this has been reflected in a mammoth finance act - easily the longest ever at 463 pages in small print - much of which is concerned with an ever increasing number of general anti-avoidance provisions as well as specific measures to close loopholes abused in the past. There have been recent tensions between the US and Japan in particular, with tax as a battleground in the larger trade war between the two countries. It has not gone unnoticed that the Japanese government's proposed Dollars 145m tax adjustment for Coca Cola is almost identical to the refund of Japanese tax agreed late last year with Nissan. Equally, eyes remain fixed on the US Supreme Court, and its imminent judgment on the highly politicised dispute between Barclays bank and the state of California, which is attempting to levy taxes on a unitary basis on the company's worldwide profits. It looks as though the case may turn against Barclays, though the indications are that this would be unlikely to spark any retaliation by the UK or other jurisdictions, given that California has since provided alternatives to unitary tax. This highlights one of the most important developing issues in international tax: transfer pricing. While countries in the past were content to leave charges between related corporate parties across borders at arm's length, they are now interfering more aggressively to tackle perceived avoidance. 'Among my corporate clients there is a desire not to avoid tax by transfer pricing but just to get it right,' says Mr Roger White from KPMG Peat Marwick in London. One potential solution receiving favourable attention at present may be the development of advance pricing agreements, such as the long-standing arrangement in place for Apple Computers between the US and Australia. Outside the large trade blocs, and eager to exploit loopholes in tax and company formation legislation, have been the offshore centres - the tax havens or, as they prefer to be known, the areas of low tax. The number of centres seeking to attract business and prop up local economies continues to grow, but the competition between them is intensifying just at a time when recession in many parts of the world has reduced the amount of potential business available. More important, tax authorities are taking a more hostile line towards regimes that may permit evasion. On the one hand, double tax treaties with some of the newer developing states in south America and the former Communist regimes are growing apace. On the other, after decades in which a network of international tax treaties between countries has been developed, many existing documents now face the prospect of being ripped to shreds. Most significant is the US-Dutch tax treaty, which threatens the structure of many companies who have traditionally used the Netherlands to take advantage of differential tax rates. US officials have already indicated that harsh revisions of other treaties - such as those with Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland - are now in their sights. This is one factor driving what Mr Peter Cussons of Price Waterhouse sees as a new emphasis by companies considering the tax implications of where they locate - such as the recently announced restructuring of Ford into global centres. 'We have been talking to a lot of clients in the last 12 to 18 months about organising on a European regional basis,' he says. 'The historical structures are out of date.' He sees a move towards a single holding company able to offset reliefs against profits across its operations. Globally, there has been a clear trend since the 1980s towards lower headline rates of tax. That certainly does not mean that the tax take has actually reduced, but rather that governments have been able to tweak the fine print. They have achieved change largely through a shift from direct to indirect taxation. In addition, allowances, deductions and reliefs in many countries have been eroded and definitions of profit changed. Attention is also spreading to new targets for tax. In the UK, in spite of memories of the poll tax which contributed to the defeat of Mrs Thatcher by her own party, the government seems to have weathered the controversy over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel. In the US, the Clinton administration has singled out tax on tobacco as a way to fund its planned reforms of the health care system. The EU has suggested a controversial carbon/energy tax levied on oil, and its Environment Commissioner has argued for a gradual shift to taxes on pollution and resources. Meanwhile, Mr White also highlights the shift in the world towards self-assessment systems in which the responsibility and costs of tax collection are increasingly shifted on to individual taxpayers. This is allowing fiscal authorities to reduce their staff and focus far more on 'auditing' tax returns submitted to them. Mr John Fairley, partner in charge of the international tax group at Ernst &amp; Young, says cooperation on investigations between many revenue authorities has also been growing. 'There has been a significant increase in the exchange of information since the 1970s.' As examples he cites the Group of Four - the UK, France, Germany and the US  -with its own code of practice, and the Pacific Association of Tax Administrators - comprising Canada, the US, Japan and Australia. The authorities are providing each other with data on taxpayers and also launching simultaneous examinations of their tax affairs. His concern is that this often takes place without the knowledge of the taxpayer, as well as involving the possible transfer of sensitive information such as trade secrets. The restructuring of fiscal authorities is also creating new challenges and opportunities for the growing number and variety of tax professionals - including lawyers, accountants and new retail providers of financial services. Such a shift may well affect how they operate, and how much longer they escape the currently relatively loose net of regulation that surrounds them.</p>

PUK forces have called on members of the  Islamic Movement to give up and said that they have smashed  positions of the Islamic movement.    However, according to sources close to the Islamic movement,  they have pushed back Jalal Talabani forces from al-Tuwaylah  region. According to the Islamic movement forces under the  command of Mullah 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in overnight fightings,  at least six PUK members were killed and five others were taken  captive. No independent source has yet confirmed the reports.    Meanwhile, mediatory efforts by leader of Iraq's Democratic  Party of Kurdistan (DPK) Mas'ud Barzani to patch up differences  between the rival groups have failed. The withdrawal of Barzani  from the leadership council of Iraq's Kurdistan is a sign of his  failure to end the hostilities. Other reports speak of fresh  clashes between Talabani and Barzani forces in Irbil region, 20  kms southeast of al-Sulaymaniyah.    In light of the recent clashes, political observers believe  that none of the two main rival groups in northern Iraq are able  to run an independent Kurdish government.</p>

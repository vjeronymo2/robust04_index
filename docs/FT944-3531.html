			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Computer highway wins first customer A Pounds 40m commercial information superhighway carried by electricity pylons and existing underground cables announced its first customer yesterday - a live network for training keyhole surgeons remotely from operating theatres in St James's Hospital in Leeds, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Torch Telecom, a joint venture between Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications, said the technology was capable of transmitting engineering or textile designs, high-quality faxes, thousands of telephone calls or large amounts of computer data. The network - being marketed to business and big public-sector customers - is developed around what Torch calls a 'backbone ring' linking Leeds, Wakefield, Huddersfield, Halifax and Bradford in West Yorkshire. Secondary circuits will allow local access throughout Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and Hull. Video-link medical applications of fibre optics elsewhere use the telephone network. Torch said its system had a bandwidth capacity of 155 megabits per second - compared with 2Mbit/s using upgraded telephone lines - giving better pictures or more reliable data transmission. The keyhole surgery system, which has been on trial for three months, will soon be improved to 622 Mbit/s, allowing 12 operations to be transmitted simultaneously from the hospital to the Leeds Institute for Minimally Invasive Therapy. As well as enabling trainees to see better, voice links allow them to communicate with surgeons as though everyone was in the operating theatre. Torch said its network would improve inward investment prospects by improving the business communications infrastructure and helping locally-based companies reduce costs.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Excellence is the only criterion - A prize like the Jerwood was long overdue Yet another prize for artists may seem old hat, but the institution of the Jerwood Painting Prize is something of an event. In the first place, an award of Pounds 30,000, winner takes all, ups the ante quite a bit. Outstripping the Turner Prize by 50 per cent, this has persuaded an extremely strong field to declare itself. Unlike the Turner there is no waiting upon nomination by the art world's great and good - if you think you are up to it, you can have a go. Nor is there any nonsense about age limits; not least of the Turner's present failings, some would say, is its high-minded commitment to artists under 40  -as though they need encouragement. With the Jerwood Prize, the only rule is that entrants must have been working in the UK for the past 10 years. But what really makes the Jerwood special is that it is a painting prize, its criterion the simple rubric of 'excellence in modern British painting'. The Turner Prize, on the other hand, has in recent years so apparently become the preserve of the sculptural and conceptual avant garde - this year the shortlist features two sculptors, a video-installation artist and one painter. The UK has as varied and vigorous, serious and mature a community of painters as any in the world, but to see what is shown of it abroad, you would hardly know. There are, of course, several other well-established open-submission awards for painting, such as the John Moores and the Hunting Prize. However, being based on the principle of selecting an exhibition first and then finding a winner, they are very different. In contrast, it really seems that the Jerwood is setting out to select a single painter from among his or her peers as the most distinguished in any year by virtue of sustained achievement and a substantial body of work. The nettle has been grasped at last. The 250 entrants were reduced by the jury to 12, each of whom was visited before the final shortlist of six was established. Those six supply the Prize Exhibition, which was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy during the Edinburgh Festival, and opens on Monday at the Royal Academy in London. The winner will be announced on September 21. Together the six artists embrace a range of what, without any condescension, we can call current mainstream modern painting. There is no conceptualism, nothing programmatic or polemical. It is work that by not being self-consciously avant garde, does not readily receive its critical due. One of the painters is still young, three are middle-aged, a couple are getting on a bit. Two are abstract - John Hoyland with his expansive expressionism, Yuko Shiraishi with her restrained, minimal colour-fields. Maurice Cockrill is an expressionist too, but one whose work is abstracted rather than abstract, his figures now subsumed within an organic, invented landscape. The other three are out-and-out figurative painters, but of very different sorts. John Lessore creates low-key and loosely stated figures and interiors. Craigie Aitchison's colour is pitched high and decorative, his figures schematised and symbolic. Euan Uglow, is committed to an exact and disciplined scrutiny of the model. Had I been on the jury, I may have chosen others from the 12, but only one or two. I have to say what a relief it is to confront a shortlist that is entirely acceptable. There is no token presence and each artist has a chance of winning - well worth a punt. Shall I mark your card? Cockrill started his career late and has finally emerged as a mature and significant painter, which he has been threatening to do for some years now. He is certainly in the frame. But Euan Uglow must be the clear favourite. Why he does not have an international reputation is no mystery, but it is a scandal. Though an artist of a very different kind, he is the one painter of the figure working today who can match Lucian Freud in measuring himself, beyond mere modernism, against the great European figurative tradition. The Jerwood Prize Exhibition: Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1, until September 28; Prize sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation and the Sunday Telegraph in association with Modern Painters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Defense Analyst Udhay Bhaskar Reddy] </F>   [Text] The report in the prestigious LOS ANGELES TIMES,  better known as L.A. TIMES, that Pakistan has managed to build  six to 12 Hiroshima-type bombs as part of its clandestine  nuclear weapons program is significant for two reasons. In the  first instance, it is not the number of bombs that Pakistan has  stashed away in the basement that is germane. The United States  was aware as early as in 1987 that Pakistan was embarked upon a  determined clandestine nuclear weapons program and had accurate  estimates about how much fissile grade material Islamabad had  stockpiled. However, Washington preferred to pretend that it  did not know as part of the Cold War charade.    What the L.A. TIMES story does is to draw attention to the  many promises and pledges broken by Pakistan in its dealings  with the United States over military aid to its clandestine  nuclear weapons program. This is the first important inference,  namely that in the past, whether it was in 1981 or 1985, the  supply of lethal modern military gadgetry by the United States  has not deflected Pakistan from its single-minded pursuit of a  covert nuclear weapons program. That a respected U.S. daily is  saying this may be reflective of the growing public  disenchantment within the United States over proliferation  perplexities. The second significant aspect is the inside the  L.A. TIMES story provides into the deep divisions within the  U.S. establishment over the Pressler Amendment and its  interpretation. As the report points out, many senior-most  officials in the Clinton Administration appear to be keen to  condone Pakistan's nuclear quest under ardent advocates of  waiving the amendment. However, there are more perceptive and  informed voices, including that of Senator Larry Pressler, who  are seized with the enormity of this seemingly casual one-time  waiver. It does appear that the Clinton team is deluding itself  that a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment would induce  Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons program and that the  proliferation problem in the region will then be resolved.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether Pakistan has  one bomb in the basement or 12, this is a level at which the  United States hopes it will capped. But, as the North Korean  and Iraqi examples have shown, clandestine nuclear programs do  not lend themselves to satisfactory external monitoring, and in  any case this capping will not assuage India's anxieties over a  bomb in the neighboring basement where even the elected prime  minister is not allowed to visit the nuclear facility, let alone  control it.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: NZ unit matches expectations BANK of New Zealand yesterday announced an unaudited operating tax-paid profit of NZ134.6m (USDollars 74.8m) for the year to March 31, which the new owners, National Bank of Australia, said was in line with expectations. The result is not comparable with last year's profit of NZDollars 172m as NAB changed the company's accounting policies in November when it bought the bank for NZDollars 1.45bn. It said then that the changes were being made to reflect its own accounting and provisioning policies. This led to an abnormal item of NZDollars 277.2m after tax. If the abnormal item is included, BNZ made a loss of NZDollars 151.3m. The managing director, Mr Bob Prowse, said the results reflected reduced income from treasury-related activities such as securities and foreign exchange trading, where the bank was adopting a more cautious approach. He said trading margins had tightened significantly during late 1992 and early 1993.</p>

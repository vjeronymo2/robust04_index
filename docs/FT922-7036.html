			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: Now time for Oftel to take on BT Sir, For once a regulatory body appears to have teeth, witness the reluctant agreement by British Gas to provide a miserly price reduction just meeting the minimum necessary to avoid legal action. Would it be too much to ask that Oftel whips up sufficient enthusiasm and courage to take on the mighty British Telecom and its cosy duopoly? After all, the profits earned (sic) last year must qualify BT as one of the most profitable companies in the world. Consider the population in the UK, compared with the US, and then ask why BT makes more profit than AT&amp;T and all the regional Baby Bells in total. Should Oftel need help in the courage department please ask them to call. Peter Knowles, CIC Investments, 17-18 Picton Place, London W1</p>

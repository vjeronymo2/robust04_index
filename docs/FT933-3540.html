			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Tough line by Kohl in election warm-up CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday spelt out law and order and economic security as the twin themes of his campaign for re-election as German chancellor next year. In a broad-ranging restatement of his vision of a unified Germany in the international community - anchored in the European Community and the Nato alliance - he denounced the rise of right-wing violence as a threat to Germany's internal order, as well as its international image. At the same time he insisted that Germans should not be ashamed of asserting their national identity within a united Europe. Patriotism must not be abandoned as a preserve of the extremists, he warned. In his keynote address to the annual conference of his Christian Democratic Union, the principal party in the ruling German coalition, Mr Kohl hammered home his other major election theme: the need for far-reaching reforms of Germany's education system, working practices and social security, to ensure the international competitiveness of the German economy. It was a speech intended to appeal to the broad middle ground of German politics, a denunciation of extremes in all their forms, and a thoughtful analysis of the biggest challenges facing German society in the wake of unification. It contained by far the strongest denunciation he has yet voiced of right-wing extremism, racist violence, and the rise of new neo-Nazi splinter groups. It was also an impressive restatement of Mr Kohl's conviction that German unification and European unification are two sides of a single coin. Yet it was not the rabble-rousing address at the start of a marathon election year which the party faithful wanted. It was a statesmanlike speech, not a party-political broadcast, and the 1,000 CDU delegates in Berlin's echoing international congress centre received it politely but without obvious enthusiasm. The Chancellor was undaunted. His popularity may be low, and he may fail to inspire any standing ovations, but he is supremely confident of his position as the architect of unification, as the dominant figure on the political scene, and as the only chancellor-candidate the CDU has got. 'At a time of sweeping change, the people need direction and stability,' he declared. 'The people want security. We are the ones who take their worries seriously.' He spelt out his firm commitment to the current ruling coalition - with the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union and the liberal Free Democratic Party - and by implication, a rejection of suggestions that a grand coalition with the opposition Social Democrats would be preferable. At a time of uncertainty, he implied, the voters would stick to the devil they knew, and that meant Helmut Kohl as chancellor. His vision of economic security did not mean 'fortress Germany,' he said. It meant reform of Germany's entrenched labour practices and of its excessively academic and over-long education system, to ensure competitiveness. He warned that financing of the social security and pensions system must be reviewed to cope with an ageing population. His emphasis on law and order is a clear response to voters' concerns, currently driving the election campaign in Hamburg, where both the CDU and SPD are fearful of a rise of the far right in next Sunday's poll. For once, he pulled no punches in his condemnation of the extreme right.</p>

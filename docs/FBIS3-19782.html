			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Lionel Barber and David Gardner in Brussels and </F> Roland Rudd in London: "EU Offers Compromise on Voting"]    [Text] Britain and Spain are being offered an automatic  right to delay European Union [EU] decisions for two months in  an effort to resolve the crisis over entry terms for Sweden,  Finland, Austria and Norway next year.    The compromise being informally offered by the 10 EU  partners  falls short of Anglo-Spanish demands to maintain present voting  rules, whereby two big countries and one small member state can  combine to block decisions.    But it might allow London and Madrid to proclaim a partial  victory in their efforts to protect the interests of big member  states when the Union expands from 12 to 16 countries.    The UK cabinet yesterday authorised Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign  secretary, to reach an agreement that falls short of Britain's  present position. But he was warned by colleagues that any deal  must preserve the "substance" of the original position. Several  ministers said that any compromise that could be interpreted as  a climbdown could cause "uproar" in the party.    Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the  government would continue to fight for Britain's interests at  the heart of Europe.    At prime minister's questions, Mr John Major rebuked a  Conservative Euro-sceptic who tried to draw him on the  negotiations. He said Mr Hurd would defend "Britain's best  interests without any delay in enlargement." Tory Euro-sceptics,  led by Mrs Ann Winterton, unsuccessfully demanded a debate on  the future shape of the EU.    Senior EU diplomats made clear that the "delaying minority"  formula was the most the UK and Spain could expect when EU  foreign ministers try, once again, to break the deadlock at a  meeting in Brussels next Tuesday [22 March]. "They will not get  all they want, but they will receive something," commented one  official.    The compromise would give member states at risk of being  outvoted an automatic right to one month's delay. The rotating  presidency of the EU and the Commission would be asked to seek a  consensus. The procedure could be repeated, again for a month,  at which point member states could take a decision.    Mr Hurd has said the UK could live with a Spanish compromise  on weighted voting. That would increase the threshold of the  "blocking minority" from 23 to 27 votes, but it would not apply  when three member states that together have 23 votes and  represent more than lOO million people either oppose or abstain  on a measure.    However, the informed judgement in Brussels is that formula  is not acceptable to the European Parliament, which must approve  accession of the four countries by May 4.    EU diplomats have also warned that several parliaments,  notably those of Belgium and the Netherlands, would refuse to  endorse the Anglo-Spanish proposals because they would paralyse  decision-making and strengthen the power of the bigger states.    A compromise on voting weights would remain in force until  1996.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung and Fung Wai-Kong] </F>   [Text] A senior Chinese official yesterday ruled out the  possibility that some legislators sitting on the 1995  Legislative Council [Legco] might not have to seek re-election  in 1997. The clear message from the Deputy Director of the  State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Wang  Fengchao, dashed hopes that legislators representing the  existing functional constituencies would survive the disbanding  of the legislature at the changeover. Asked if there were a  chance for a partial through-train arrangement, Mr Wang said:  "There is no such possibility.    "According to the decision of the National People's  Congress,  the last legislature in Hong Kong must be formed in accordance  with the Basic Law.    "The composition of the Legislative Council should be taken  as a whole, including members returned through geographical  election, functional constituency election or the Election  Committee.    "Both the number of legislators in each category and the  details of the election method should abide by the provisions in  the Basic Law. There is no partial through-train arrangement,"  he said.    Speaking after meeting Mr Wang, Liberal Party chairman Allen  Lee Peng-fei quoted the deputy director as saying all 60 seats  in the law-making assembly would be up for re-election in 1997.  Though it was likely the 21 existing functional constituency  seats would remain after 1997, Chinese officials told Mr Lee  they must be re-elected.    Despite the comments, legislators formally tabled their  amendments yesterday to the electoral bill on the functional  constituency seats, and the composition of the Election  Committee. The United Democrats amendment demands that half of  the Legislative Council be directly elected. It also includes  the abolition of the Legco seats for the Urban Council, Regional  Council and Heung Yee Kuk, to be replaced with three new  functional constituencies covering retired people, housewives  and students. The four Meeting Point legislators have indicated  support.    Another vocal supporter of democracy, Emily Lau Wai-hing,  put  forward an even more ambitious amendment which demanded a 100  per cent directly elected legislature. The Liberal Party has  yet to decide whether to table its own amendment or support  other similar ones.    A group of independent legislators is working on a more  conservative proposal which seeks to scale down the number of  voters in the functional constituencies. Eric Li Ka-cheung, an  independent legislator, has been liaising with several other  independent legislators and the Liberal Party to formulate an  amendment based on the compromise package proposed by the  British side during negotiations with China last year which  reduces the number of voters in the functional constituencies  from 2.5 million to less than 650,000.</p>

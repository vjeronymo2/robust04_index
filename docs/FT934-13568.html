			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Sellafield child cancer link found A COMPREHENSIVE study by the Health and Safety Executive of leukaemia in children whose fathers worked at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria has found a 'weak' historical link between radiation exposure and cancer. The HSE said the study 'did provide some weak support for the associations . . . between pre-conception radiation dose to the fathers and the risk of leukaemia in their children'. The executive said the excess leukaemia cases were confined almost entirely to the children of men who started work at Sellafield before 1965, when workplace exposures were more than five times higher than today. 'There is no need for preventive action to protect the health of the Sellafield workforce other than the measures in place,' said Mr Eddie Varney, deputy chief inspector of nuclear installations. The report was published yesterday, two weeks after the conclusion of a High Court test case in which British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, was cleared of causing leukaemia in two children through their fathers' radiation exposure. The judge said there was insufficient scientific evidence for such a link. Mr Martyn Day, the families' solicitor, said the report would provide 'very strong grounds' for an appeal, which is under consideration. But he was 'concerned about the very negative interpretation which the HSE is putting on its own findings'.</p>

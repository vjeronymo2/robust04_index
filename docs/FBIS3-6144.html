			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Time Has Come for Australia To Cease its </F> Suspicion of Indonesia"]    [Text] On Wednesday 23 February, Australian Defense  Minister Robert Ray announced Australia's plan to expand its  naval base in north Australia. The objective is to accommodate  its large warships, particularly the Navy's 1,200-ton patrol  vessels. He stated that Australia's northern region will  definitely remain as the most important and strategic base for  its Armed Forces. Apart from this, the development of  infrastructure for its Navy will enable the country to launch  more effective maritime operations.    A before the announcement, Defense Minister Ray stressed  that  Indonesia is a "key nation" for Australia, in its strategic  alliance, along with the other countries in the Asia-Pacific  region. He presented a 75-page doctrine on security which for  the first time unfolded the regional security situation since  the end of the Cold War. He said other nations should first  override Indonesia as an effort toward "assuring" the region's  security. This means that our national and regional defense  will be able to endure and suppress any ideological or physical  threat.    In December 1993, Australia's neighbor New Zealand, viewed  with less importance the security in its northern region.  According to their Defense Minister Gerald Hensley, his  country's military was more concerned over the huge purchase of  weapons by Asia-Pacific countries. He believes that these  countries will continue their arms build-up at an annual rate of  U.S.$131 billion until 1995. He also stated that by the end of  the decade, the maritime network SLOC (Sea Lanes of  Communication) [preceding expansion in English], which connects  New Zealand and the rest of the Asian countries, will be  patrolled by 1,800 modern Navy patrol craft, three dozen  submarines, and 200 modern warships.    Presently, most Australians believe that Indonesia forms a  "threat from the north" and which still harbors a secret  ambition of attacking the country. Whether we like it or not,  we must accept this -- the same suspicion we had regarding China  as our threat from the north.    Australian and New Zealand officials are relentlessly  embarking on diplomatic efforts toward forging more cordial  relations regarding the Asia-Pacific region's security issues --  particularly with Indonesia. Australia and New Zealand, as the  only "white group" in the region, have indicated their desire to  lessen their dependence on the West, especially the United  States and Britain. In this context, we observed that the ANZUS  (Australia, New Zealand and the United States) military pact has  become less effective. The two nations have increased their  military cooperation through FPDA (Five Power Defense  Arrangement), which also groups two other Asian nations --  Malaysia and Singapore.    We also know of Australia's series of foreign policies which  point to its good intentions of being identified as one of the  countries belonging to the Asian grouping which undertakes the  task of hastening the peace process in Cambodia; proposing  reforms in APEC through cooperation [preceding word in English]  toward becoming a community [preceding word in English];  advocating the desire of establishing an Asia-Pacific peace  group to carry out the responsibility of maintaining  international peace and security; and urge Australia's  formidable opposition party, the Labor Party, to induce Prime  Minister Paul Keating into fostering military cooperation with  ASEAN.    Currently, Australia has also become one of the potential  countries selling weapons to Asia-Pacific countries. Indonesia  -- along with South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia --  are attracted and are considering purchasing the diesel-powered  Swedish designed Collins class submarine. As the Australian  Navy is also operating this submarine, it could be considered  that the sale is one of the efforts in the sale of "standard"  military weapons to the region, a proposition currently being  discussed by the region's major governments. Apart from this,  Australia has a vision to become the Asia-Pacific region's  submarine production center.    Australia and Indonesia held their joint land military  exercises in 1993 involving a number of their special task  forces personnel. The two countries also held a 10-day joint  naval exercise in August 1993. Two thousand personnel, 14  warships and six fighter aircraft from the two countries  participated in the exercise -- the biggest joint military  exercise held over the past 10 years. A joint air exercise was  also conducted in November 1993 in Sumatera where Australia's  F-18 Hornets and Indonesia's F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft  participated.    Following this, an annual bilateral meeting on defense  cooperation was held in Jakarta centered on restructuring  defense relations with Indonesia. The restructuring is aimed at  establishing a formal defense cooperation structure similar to  that which Australia has with Malaysia and Singapore. It is also  understood that Indonesian troops will be invited to participate  in the upcoming land military exercise to be hosted by Australia  in north Australia. Even though criticism was hurled at the  Indonesian Government by the Australian press,  Indonesia-Australia defense cooperation, nonetheless, continues  to remain intact since 1986.    The time has come for Australians to eliminate all their  suspicions about Indonesia being a potential threat given the  above facts. Meeting with the visiting Australian Navy chief,  Al Beaumont, at Bina Palace last year, President Suharto gave  the assurance that Indonesia poses no threat to its neighbors  and has no intention to threaten any other nations as this is in  accordance with its defense and security policy. The assurance  was issued within the context of Indonesia's purchase of 39  former East German warships which spontaneously created undue  concern even though such a purchase was in line with Indonesia's  need.    It is true that the regional security situation is  unpredictable during the post-Cold War era. Therefore, this  will be the first occasion where ASEAN nations can freely and  openly discuss issues pertaining to regional politics and  security during the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in June in  Bangkok. During the session, ASEAN foreign ministers have the  opportunity to meet and hold discussions with their dialogue  partners, including Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans,  known for his active participation in discussions on politics  and security. This will be a good opportunity for Australia to  grasp and assimilate political and security nuances in the  Asia-Pacific region which will not be restructured by any  Western influence.    It can be clearly perceived that the Indonesia-Australia  bilateral security cooperation continues to remain good.  Australia's participation in the ARF has also indicated that it  will greatly benefit by understanding "Asian trends" -- that is,  if it still desires to be integrated into the Asian region. But  all this will still prove inadequate until the Australian  Government can convince its people that the Indonesian  Government is not expansionist. We have been waiting for a long  time for such a declaration. Such an announcement will enable  us to further smooth and improve existing bilateral relations  and defense cooperation.</p>

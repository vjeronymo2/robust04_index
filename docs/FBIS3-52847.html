			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay and Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] Shmu'el Me'ir, a deputy mayor of Jerusalem on behalf  of the National Religious Party, says that he has learned about  the existence of an informal Israeli-PLO committee that has  already begun discussing the nature of the permanent arrangement  in Jerusalem.    Me'ir says his remarks are based on reliable sources from  within the system, whose "conscience is bothered by the  end-of-season sale the Israeli Government is holding these days  on properties including Jerusalem." Me'ir claims that the  committee is drawing lines and maps that will demarcate those  areas within the city's current jurisdiction that are  indisputably Arab, and that those areas will be handed over to  the Palestinians when the permanent settlement is implemented in  the city. He claims that this category includes Arab  neighborhoods, such as Shu'fat and 'Isawiyah, in which no Jews  reside.    As stated, Me'ir refuses to disclose his sources, but he  insists that these are trustworthy people who are unwilling to  be accomplices in such a far-reaching move which, he believes,  means partitioning the city. Me'ir is going to demand an urgent  city council meeting. He plans to brief Jerusalem Mayor Ehud  Olmert on the matter and to convey his information to ministers  and Knesset members.    Reacting to Me'ir remarks, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi  Beilin said yesterday that they can be summed up by one word:  `Nonsense.'    Me'ir further asserts that he has learned that in the  recently signed Israel-Vatican agreement, Israel consented --  and this consent was not made public -- to granting  extraterritorial status to Vatican churches and other Vatican  properties in the city.    [In a live telephone interview by reporter Hayim Zissowitz  on  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 10 January,  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says that Me'ir's remarks  regarding extraterritorial status for Vatican properties are  "sheer nonsense." Beilin adds that "nothing like that was ever  agreed" and "the issue never came up." Asked whether Israel and  the Vatican have signed an agreement on extraterritorial status,  Beilin replies: "There is no such document, unless someone  forged one."]</p>

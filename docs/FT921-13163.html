			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: UK group nears deal on Kuwait base A BRITISH consortium has obtained a letter of intent from Kuwait for work thought to be worth up to Pounds 200m to rebuild the country's main naval base, writes David White. However, Taylor Woodrow. the construction concern which heads the British Kuwait Defence Group, said it was still unclear when a firm contract might be signed. Its principal partners in the consortium are Wimpey and the shipbuilding company Vosper Thornycroft. Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey were involved, along with Amec, in another consortium which won a contract last September for reinstating production at oil wells in northern Kuwait. The letter of intent was announced yesterday by Mr Tom King, the UK defence secretary, in Kuwait on the last leg of a Gulf tour.</p>

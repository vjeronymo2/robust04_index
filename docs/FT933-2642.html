			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Laporte jumps as Evode result springs surprise SHARES IN Laporte jumped 6 per cent yesterday after the speciality chemicals group surprised the City with the speed of its transformation of Evode, the chemicals and plastic group it bought in January. Laporte had been accused by some analysts of overpaying when it came in as a white knight to bid for Evode, which was under siege from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate. Laporte's agreed offer was Pounds 129m, Pounds 16m more than Wassall's hostile bid. Evode made operating profits of Pounds 13.1m in the five months to July 5, on sales of Pounds 117m, compared with Pounds 14m in the previous year under its former management. Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive, said: 'The integration of the Evode businesses has been achieved and has enhanced earnings in the first half, as promised at the time of the acquisition.' Laporte has moved quickly to trim costs, cutting 189 jobs from Evode's workforce of 2,305, including a swathe of management. The head office has been closed, as has a loss-making German subsidiary. Mr Minton said Evode's profit margins had been lifted from 3.9 per cent to double figures, and were on course to match the group average of 14 percent. The Evode acquisition helped Laporte to increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 51m on sales which were 37 per cent ahead at Pounds 440m. Group debt at the half-year was Pounds 170m. This compared with Pounds 190m immediately after the acquisition of Evode. The group said this reflected tight control being exercised on all working capital and capital expenditure. Negotiations on the sale of parts of Evode identified as non-core were well advanced. Group capital expenditure had been sharply reduced from Pounds 29m to Pounds 25.5m. This included Pounds 2.1m for the Evode companies. Mr Minton said capital expenditure was now on a downward trend from last year's total of Pounds 74m and would not exceed Pounds 53m in the full year. Mr Minton said: 'With the US markets looking more attractive, offset by subdued European markets, the group expects to sustain progress in the second half.' Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 20.1p (18.8p). The interim dividend was lifted by 5.7 per cent to 7.4p (7p). COMMENT The sharp increase in the share price reflected what one analyst described as a 'stupendous' performance from Evode. There was thus a justifiable smile on the face of Mr Ken Minton, the chief executive, who had been widely suspected of overpaying for his latest acquisition. Analysts have upgraded their full-year forecasts to about Pounds 110m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 15.5. A group so well placed to benefit from recovery in the UK and US might expect to be on better than a market average rating at this stage in the cycle, but there remains suspicion in the City towards the company. which has a large number of businesses and has caused its share of disappointment in the past. The performance of its other businesses was also subdued, after stripping out acquisitions and currency effects. A period of consolidation has been promised while recent acquisitions are absorbed. Such a pause, combined with solid trading as demand improves, could see the shares rise in the medium term.</p>

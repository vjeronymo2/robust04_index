			<p>BFN     [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says that for the  moment there are no plans to release Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin from prison. Answering  questions in the Knesset, Shahal conceded also that there was a  legal problem in enforcing any pledge signed by released  Palestinian detainees not to return to terrorism.    In response to an appeal by Knesset members Sandberg and  Ba-Gad, the minister said that he would raise at cabinet level  their request to have Kakh members under administrative  detention sign a similar pledge. If they then promise to desist  from terror, they could be released.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Elections to select delegates to Nigeria's national  constitutional conference start on Monday [23 May], and in the  run-up, state security forces have been moving against the newly  formed National Democratic Coalition, which has been calling on  Nigerians to boycott everything to do with the constitutional  conference. The boycott call has met with some success in the  Yoruba parts of western Nigeria. Today, Yoruba traditional  chieftains and leaders who backed the boycott tried to hold a  meeting, but they ran into problems. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa  reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] Fully armed policemen were brought  out this morning to prevent a meeting of traditional rulers and  political leaders of the Yoruba-speaking people in western  Nigeria from being held. The meeting was to be held at the  palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland, to take a final decision on  whether the Yoruba people should participate in the forthcoming  national constitutional conference. The Yoruba are one of the  three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Armed policemen, led by  an area commander, were at the (Djebodi Palace) gate several  hours before the guests started arriving, at about 11 o'clock.  They turned each guest back politely at the gate, saying that  they had instructions from above to abort the meeting. Those  refused entry into the palace included the former civilian  governor of the state, Chief Segun Oshoba, and his deputy, and  senators in the last democratic regime.    The traditional ruler of Ondo, Oba Festus Adesunye, was  stopped at the police checkpoint on the highway leading into the  town and was told politely not to go to the palace -- he  complied. Other traditional rulers who had had wind of the  police action stayed away. Journalists who had converged at the  palace gate were also refused entry. After being turned back,  Chief Segun Oshoba told journalists that, whether the meeting  was held or not, the boycott of the constitutional conference  election in Ogun State would be total.    At their meeting in Owo yesterday, the major Yoruba  political  leaders declared their total support for the boycott of the  constitutional conference, as demanded by the National  Democratic Coalition. The politicians said that the conference,  not being of sovereign status, could not achieve any success in  resolving the national political crisis. The government is  countering the boycott campaign by using all radio and  television stations to persuade Nigerians to turn out en masse  for the election. [end recording]</p>

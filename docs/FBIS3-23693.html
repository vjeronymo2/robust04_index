			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Ptushenko, systems analyst: "Do We Need </F> `Energiya?'"; first paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] Systems analyst A. V. Ptushenko, a longtime  writer for KHIMIYA I ZHIZN, comments on some of the positions  taken with regard to the strategic program for the development  of the Russian space program.    It happens that two schools have long been crystallized in  our space program, two approaches to the strategy for its  development. One came from Tsiolkovskiy, a confirmed supporter  of the "growth" of the space program out of aeronautics; the  other got its start in the soil of a new type of armed forces  created in the USSR -- the Missile Forces (there was never  anything like it in any other army in the world -- in the United  States, for example, missiles were shared by the army, air  force, and navy). The first school always dreamed of reusable  aerospace systems; the second adhered to the conviction that  expendable, purely rocket, vertically launching systems were  omnipotent. Supporting each school were prominent authorities,  large institutes, large groups of specialists, solid traditions,  and strict paradigms.    Of course, both schools were of the same mind about the most  important thing: both were convinced that mankind would not  survive without cosmonautics. But they are far apart in their  interpretation of the main routes to be taken in implementing  that imperative. Their views differ on the priorities associated  with this program or that program; on the role of geostationary  satellites, which hover motionlessly over a given point on the  Earth's surface; on the advisability of forcing a manned mission  to Mars and creating a nuclear rocket engine; on the prospects  for our country for having reusable aerospace systems and the  feasibility of reoutfitting already developed expendable rockets  into reusable rockets. It's too bad that V. P. Senkevich, a man  I have great respect for, has given, essentially, no attention  to these very important problems.    Let's begin with what is perhaps the most pointedly disputed  question in today's space program -- what to do with the  Buran-Energiya system, on which we've already spent, by one set  of figures, 16 billion rubles [R] and, by another set, 40  billion. Should we take it all the way, since so much money and  labor has already been invested in it, or should we do just the  opposite?    In favor of the first solution is a seemingly reasonable  consideration: the Americans have developed such a system and  are more or less successfully operating it -- which means that  we need it, too (we used to follow that principle unfailingly).  But such an answer seems reasonable only at first glance.    The fact is that we don't have the same geography, the same  strategic position that the United States has. From its  airbases, it could "get at" the whole of the European part of  the former USSR with ordinary frontline aviation; but to do  something similar to that, we would need superlong-range  aircraft that don't yet exist. That means we have to use space  systems in their place, primarily special-purpose space systems.  The Americans, who didn't have that kind of problem, could  involve themselves in the development of reusable transport  systems whose job would be to loft the necessary facilities into  the necessary orbits. But for us, that was luxury we couldn't  allow ourselves.    Space shuttles -- like the Buran-Energiya system -- are  typical space transportation systems that are partially reusable  (the Shuttle more so, Buran less so). But there is one essential  difference. Lifting off from the United States, the Shuttle can  place a payload of up to 1.5 tons into geostationary orbit;  lifting off from our country, it wouldn't be able to loft  anything into that orbit!    Our country is located much farther to the north than is the  United States -- from us to the equator, that is, to the plane  in which geostationary orbit lies, is much farther. From the  United States, the equator can be reached at an angle of  20-25; from our country, at an angle of at least  48-50. Baykonur (which no longer belongs to Russia) is  located at 48 latitude; Plesetsk is much farther to the  north. But a launched rocket, without additional maneuvers, is  capable flying along an orthodromic only -- a great circle arc  with its center in the center of the Earth --and the angle at  which it intersects the equator cannot be less than the latitude  of the launch site. In order to swing the rocket into the plane  of the equator, several times more fuel is needed at launch from  Baykonur than is needed from California or Florida, and its lift  capacity simply isn't enough for the payload: after all, all the  fuel needed for such a turn is also needed, during insertion  into orbit, to initially boost to circular velocity.    Let's continue the comparison of our system with that of the  Americans (Figs. 1 and 2) [not reproduced here]. Both have  expendable first stages that, after the propellant is expended,  are separated and fall to the Earth. When the Shuttle launches  from California, its boosters fall into the Pacific Ocean,  bothering no one; when it launches from Florida, they fall into  the Atlantic (Fig. 3) [not reproduced here]. But with us, the  boosters have nowhere to fall: Baykonur is surrounded on all  sides by populated areas. All that's left is the desert Chukotka  and a few test facilities that have had to be dug out in various  places in the former USSR. Because of that, accessible to us --  unlike with the United States -- are only a narrow range of  launch azimuths, which also means an orbit with an inclination  of 50-60.    Even worse is the fact that the orbital airplane Buran has  no  onboard booster engines. Here's how a launch goes with the  Shuttle (Fig. 4) [not reproduced here]: at launch, all the  engines are in operation at the same time, including the orbital  airplane's engines -- they are fed an oxygen-hydrogen fuel from  the tank. The solid-propellant boosters of the first stage,  after expending their fuel, separate and drop into the ocean  (from which they are later removed, put back into shape, and  reused); the airplane, with a tank, continues the boost. Not  long before the airplane enters the parking orbit, or so-called  reference orbit, from which the "orbit-to-orbit towcraft" will  start later, its tank, now empty, separates and, along the  design trajectory -- that is, a precisely determined trajectory  -- returns to the atmosphere, where it burns up safely; the  airplane, by now flying on its own engines, which are fed by  onboard fuel reserves, makes its way to reference orbit.    With Buran, however, the picture is completely different.  Since it has no booster engine (we simply weren't able to  develop a powerful reusable liquid rocket engine), the second  stage of the Energiya launch vehicle takes it to reference  orbit. And of course, that stage remains in orbit itself. Over  time, because of the resistance of the atmosphere -- despite the  fact that it is extremely rarefied -- the velocity of the stage  drops, and the stage moves toward Earth. Along an absolutely  impossible-to-calculate trajectory: there are too many random  factors affecting it. When the second stage enters the dense  layers of the atmosphere, some of its burns up; but the engines  don't burn up, because they were designed to withstand much  higher temperatures. And they fall to the Earth's surface,  wherever they please. They weigh, by the way, more than a ton.    One conclusion thrusts itself at us. We need not a Buran  with  an Energiya, but an aerospace system with a reusable, winged  first stage -- a booster aircraft outfitted with jet engines  similar to those in regular aircraft. Such a system would be  able to make it to the equator, and land wouldn't have to be  taken out of production as a drop zone for the first stage, and  the second stage wouldn't fall on anybody's head.    Unfortunately, we succeeded in only the theoretical  development of such systems (something I also took part in), and  gave up in the face of the truly great difficulties associated  with building them. But the Americans, who don't need them so  badly, are about to pass us up here, too.    But expendable, purely rocket systems, so favored by our  "rocket" school, are, in essence, a big waste. I won't risk  saying that our rocket builders don't understand that -- they  understand it, but draw their own conclusions. These days, they  see a way out in the appending of reusability to expendable  rockets that have already been built, including the Energiya.  But the principles of design for reusable spacecraft and  expendable spacecraft are, as they say in Odessa, "two big  differences." One must pay for reusability with structural  weight; but for the rocket, the weight must be as small as  possible -- otherwise, it simply won't have enough fuel for  boost. The reusable spacecraft must use air (as the medium for  creating bearing and control forces, as the working fluid of the  engine, and as the oxidizer); but for a rocket, the atmosphere  is just vexing interference; all its advantages show up in  airless space only. So going that route, like trying to cross a  chicken with a tiger, is useless.    The Energiya rocket, of course, could be used alone, without  the orbital aircraft Buran. Say, for putting large, heavy  objects into reference orbit. But all the organic drawbacks of  expendable launch vehicles about which we've already spoken  would make themselves known in that context.    There's one way out of the impasse: we need to create  reusable systems with airplane-like winged first stages.    Some thoughts on other priorities of our space program.  These  days, we, like the rest of mankind, need to be concerned first  of all with solving global problems -- energy problems,  environmental problems, and many others. Without a space  problem, they obviously can't be solved. But for that very  reason, many research programs today, including the mission to  Mars, can in no way be declared top-priority programs. Life has  shown how right the eminent American theoretical engineer K. A.  Erike was when he wrote 20 years ago that the priority should  belong to exploring near-Earth space in order to replenish the  energy and material resources of mankind and to overcome the  energy crisis. The essence of the crisis is not simply the lack  of energy carriers -- oil and coal; it is much more profound and  dangerous for mankind. On the surface of the Earth, we can  develop energy systems only to a certain extent, in order to  avoid overheating the atmosphere. There is only one way to get  around that constraint without curtailing the growth of energy  consumption -- send the energy systems outside the atmosphere.  There, the primary energy source would be the Sun. With solar  arrays, its radiant energy could be converted into electrical  energy, which directional antennas could relay as microwave  radiation down to energy receivers located on the Earth's  surface. Given certain conditions, that radiation would not  interact at all with the atmosphere.    As for the planned revival of operations associated with the  creation of nuclear rocket engines, the following can be said.  On one hand, those are the only engines that are economical  enough, that is, per unit of fuel mass, they can produce enough  work for long-duration flights like the flight to Mars. But on  the other hand, the same difficulties arise that arise with  ground-based nuclear engineering: it's not clear how to ensure  safety and what to do with the radioactive waste. And if we're  talking about manned vehicles, the problem of a biological  shield for them turns out to be virtually insurmountable. And if  we say that a mission to Mars shouldn't be considered top  priority, then work on a nuclear rocket engine can hardly be  said to be urgent.    Of course, in the limited space of a journal, it's  impossible  to examine all the problems of the domestic space program,  however worthy of such they may be. In conclusion, I would like  to add just one thing. God save us from converting the space  industry into the riveting of pots! Spending on the space  program is necessary if we want to save life on Earth. We just  have to sensibly and clearly determine what in particular we  need to spend the money on. In the opinion of those, like me,  who belong to the school of Tsiolkovskiy-Tsander-Erike, the  space program represents above all an opportunity to use sources  of energy and material that are outside the bounds of Earth.  That is what must determine our strategy for the near future.    COPYRIGHT: Izdatelstvo "Nauka" "Khimiya i zhizn" 1993</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Fidelio in concert Andrew Litton brought his Bournemouth Symphony and Chorus, and an interesting septet of principals, to the Festival Hall for a concert performance of Fidelio on Tuesday. After a couple of Beethoven-less operatic seasons, any Fidelio is better than none; and the Bournemouth one was considerably better than that. Litton has a nice, unshowy grasp of the score: sound tempi, duly accommodating of the voices, and excellent appreciation of Beethoven's long, tension-building piano passages, which premature surges always diminish. The orchestra played very well and the chorus were sturdy. Including the 'Leonora no. 3' overture in the place where Mahler intruded it, however - between the spouses' private reunion and the public explosion of relief - was surely a mistake. That needs a theatrical justification, beyond the original plea for extra scene-shifting time. Here it merely lengthened the performance of an opera which is notably concise, and postponed the human finale for too long. In any case, the homely, domestic aspect of Fidelio - its 'Singspiel' side - faded with the placement of the singers behind the orchestra. Fine for heroic voices (Leonora's and Florestan's); but deeply unhelpful for little Marzelline and Jaquino, and even old Father Rocco. As the green young pair, Linda Kitchen and the French-Canadian tenor Benoit Boutet were attractive and gracefully musical, and Donald McIntyre's Rocco suggested gruff depths, but from an awkward distance where the action wants to be cosy-cottagy. Jane Eaglen's weighty Leonora covered the distance in heroic strides, stately rather than tomboyish, but with imposing gravity. As Florestan, the young American Heldentenor Edward Cook unleashed some ringing timbre and much erratic feeling: plenty of promise, no cogent grasp yet of the size and shape of his crucial 'Gott] welch' Dunkel hier]' scena. As hateful Don Pizarro and beneficent Don Fernando, Alan Opie and Matthew Best were more than competent, if slightly less well-focussed than we know they can manage. All in all, though there were no revelations in this Fidelio, it gave honest satisfaction. Repeated in Colston Hall, Bristol, on December 3; sponsored by Harveys of Bristol, and Beales</p>

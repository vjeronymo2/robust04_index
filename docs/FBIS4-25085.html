The agricultural problem has already drawn the attention of  society as a whole. The party Central Committee and the State  Council have called two meetings on rural work within a short  time. Add to this the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC  Central Committee, which was held before the 14th National  Congress of the CPC and was devoted specifically to the study of  agriculture and rural Problems, and we have the issue being  raised three times. This indicates that the Party Central  Committee and the State Council are very concerned about the  problems in agriculture and rural China.    In recent years, with the development of a market economy,  some new situations and new problems have occurred in rural  work. Some call these contradictions at a deeper level; others  call them crises. I believe that, at the current stage, many  significant signs of danger have indeed appeared in the  countryside. If handled properly, the problems can be resolved.  If not solved in a timely fashion, then problems may occur  which have serious consequences.    Since the rural reform was implemented after the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, the  development trend of China's agriculture has been very good.  Farm products have increased on a large scale; farmers' income  has risen substantially; township and town enterprises have  sprung up as a new force; and the construction of small rural  towns has also seen substantial development. Despite a few  years of stagnation, the development trend, on the whole, has  been good. Production development brought on by rural reform  has enabled us to stockpile over 300 billion jin of grain and a  large quantity of cotton reserves. The increase in output of  various agricultural products has provided ample raw material  for the development of textile and other light industries, and  township and town enterprises have created an output value of  2.9 trillion yuan. Both rural work and rural production have  seen great achievements. However, some new contradictions and  new problems, or signs of danger, which have been exposed in  recent years should draw our attention. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  said long ago that the 1990's will either see no problems, or,  if there are problems, they will be in agriculture. What, then,  are the main problems faced by agriculture?    First, the most important manifestation is a drop in  the production enthusiasm of farmers, especially the enthusiasm  for farming. When the contract responsibility system on a  household basis with remuneration linked to output was first  implemented, farmer enthusiasm was very high, and the  agricultural productive forces, held back for many years, were  suddenly released. Hence the great achievement that was  obtained. The drop in farmer enthusiasm in recent years cannot  but catch our attention and alert us. The most active element  in the rural productive forces is the farmer. If the farmers are  not enthusiastic, how can agriculture move forward?    Why then has farmer enthusiasm dropped? There are basically  two reasons. The first is the slow increase in farmer income.  During the two years of 1988 and 1989, farmer income saw  negative growth; in 1990 and 1991 there was some increase; and  during the recent two years it has again increased, albeit at  the slow speed of 2 percent. The fall in farmer income has  affected the material interests of the farmers, the urban/rural  income gap has widened, and farmers have felt it very unfair.  The second is the substantial reduction in farmland. This  includes two factors: One is that development zones have  occupied large plots of land, and the other is that, because the  comparative benefits of farming have fallen, farmers have been  unwilling to till the land and leave some land uncultivated,  making China's traditional contradiction between a large  population and the shortage of land even more acute.    Second, the decrease or slow increase in agricultural  output. Although last year grain output exceeded the 900  billion jin mark, many have expressed doubts about this because  the cultivated area dropped last year, sales of chemical  fertilizer were down, and grain prices went up. Therefore,  although one can say that grain output broke a historical  record, whether farm products can steadily increase still  remains a very worrisome problem in the national economy. The  output of cotton was over 47 million dan, while demand was 80 to  90 million dan. In addition, the output of sugar-bearing crops  dropped, and oil-bearing crops were also in short supply.  Another phenomenon worth noting is that, in the past, grain from  the south was shipped north, but now grain from the north is  being shipped south. Guangdong may purchase over 10 billion jin  of grain this year (for human consumption, animal feed, and  industrial use) this year.    Third, the reduction of agricultural input.  According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture,  at its highest point China's agricultural basic construction  input occupied 10.3 percent of national basic construction  investment (1978). Since rural reform, the investment scale for  agriculture has been continuously depressed. During 1987 and  1988 it slowed to 3.3 percent, and, while 1989 saw a slight  increase to over 4 percent, last year it dropped again to 2.2  percent. The government's input in agriculture has not been  reduced; it is mainly that local input has been reduced. If the  relevant departments continue to neglect this issue, the input  in agriculture may continue to drop. Agriculture is also an  industry, and without input there will be no output.    Fourth, the gap between industry and agriculture has  widened; the income gap between urban and rural residents has  exacerbated; and the gaps between the eastern and coastal  regions and the central and western regions have expanded.  It should be pointed out that uneven development in urban and  rural areas and in the eastern and western parts of the country  is normal. Only through the relatively faster development of  the east can the comprehensive development of the entire country  be brought about. However, a disproportionate development of  industry and agriculture will inevitably affect the entire  national economy. Without developing agriculture, the whole  economy cannot develop in a healthy manner. History has already  given us good experience in this area. Now the disparity  between the development of industry and agriculture has advanced  to the brink of danger. If we continue to avoid adjusting it,  and if agriculture continues to be denied real support, the  entire national economy will be unable to bear the burden.    The gap between agriculture and industry has expanded. Last  year, urban per capita income grew 10.3 percent, while in the  countryside it only grew 3.3 percent. The income growth ratio  between urban and rural residents is 2.8 to 1. The ratio before  reform was 2.4 to 1, but, some time after reform, it was reduced  to 1.7 to 1. Now the gap between urban and rural areas has  expanded again, and farmers feel it is very unfair. Recently, a  Shanxi farmer wrote a letter to say that 2 jin of rice can only  trade for 1 Hongtashan cigarette and 2 jin of wheat trade for 1  jin of chemical fertilizer. The scissor gap between prices of  industrial goods agricultural products is becoming larger and  larger.    Fifth, the yearly expanding migrant labor tide reflects  that the employment situation for rural surplus labor has  already become very acute. In recent years the tidal wave  of migrant laborers has risen ever higher. According to  estimates, China's rural surplus labor force has already reached  130 million people. Several dozen million people traveling  outside their provinces have a major impact upon society. This  is the result of the rural employment problem. After liberation,  China practiced a residence registration management system which  tied farmers firmly to the land. Farmers had no freedom to go  out to seek a living. Now there is a surplus labor force, and  in many places it is "one month for the Lunar New Year Festival,  three months for farming, and eight months with nothing to do."  Since reform and opening up, especially under the onslaught of  the market economy, those farmers who cannot find any occupation  in their localities leave their home and land for the big cities  and open coastal regions. Since 1989, the scale of migrant  laborers has increased annually, and by last year the  transprovincial migrant population exceeded 20 million.    A few years ago this problem was still neglected and people  had an incorrect understanding of the phenomenon. Some people  tended to view migrant laborers as "aimless vagrants" and wanted  to block them or even to use an iron broom to sweep them from  the cities. Today the situation is better. Prime Minister Li  Peng has cleared the name of migrant laborers in his report to  this year's National People's Congress, pointing out that the  movement of farmers is the flow of history and an unavoidable  trend of economic development. The migrant labor problem has  begun to draw attention from various quarters, and the people's  understanding of this issue is becoming unified.    Sixth, the contingent of agricultural science and  technology workers is shaky and unstable. It should be  pointed out that scientific and technological progress and  popularization have played an important role in China's  agricultural development. According to estimates, the role of  the science and technology factor in agricultural growth has  been approximately 40 percent. During the past two years,  however, due to the impact of the market economy and the trend  of increasing earnings, the contingent of rural science and  technology personnel has become unstable. Many people have  entered the business world to earn money, and some technicians  have switched to other fields. This, too, is a danger sign for  agricultural production.    I have listed the danger signs above. On the whole, the most  serious problem is the drop in productive enthusiasm among the  farmers. Next is the migrant laborer problem. If this problem  is not solved properly, the rural surplus labor force will not  be able to find an outlet, the countryside will not be able to  realize a relatively well-off standard of living, and  modernization will not come about in China.    That the aforementioned problems have developed to such an  extent today is perhaps related to our failure to catch up with  the study of agricultural policies. The forces studying  agricultural policies are currently scattered. We should  concentrate our forces in studying the new problems and new  situations occurring in rural work. Many new phenomena and new  problems have appeared in the countryside, and these all require  that us to do in-depth studies and sum them up in a timely  fashion.    Danger signs have already appeared in agriculture.  Fortunately, the party Central Committee and the State Council  are already paying attention to and taking measures to solve  these problems. Within a period of less than six months, two  meetings on rural work have been called and some policy measures  have been adopted. The key issue right now is implementation  and execution. One should say that the policy measures adopted  by the central government are good, but that execution and  implementation measures are weak. So, for example, in the end  how much diesel oil for farm use or chemical fertilizer should  be supplied at fixed state prices? The central government's  determination is great, but the execution at the actual  grass-roots level will always be watered down. At present, I  think the most worrisome problem is that the central policy  measures cannot be implemented. This is the greatest problem.    One of the key reasons why the central government's policy  and measures cannot be implemented is structural. The central  authorities have held several good meetings, but after the  meetings there needs to be a forceful authoritative organ which  can take charge of coordination and ensure implementation. All  the decisions made in the previous meetings on rural work have  been very good and very valuable. If they had all been actually  implemented, China's agriculture would not have gone wrong. The  current situation, in which each department does as it likes  according to its own interests, should on no account be allowed  to continue.    Chen Xiwen, director of the Rural Development  Research Department of the State Council Development Research  Center: "The Central Government's Polities and Measures Are  Good, But It Is Difficult To Implement Them at the Local and  Departmental Levels"    The importance of agriculture and the need to pay attention  to the farmers' problems have been elaborated many times during  recent years in the speeches of leading comrades, in newspapers  and periodicals, and in documents. But many agricultural and  rural problems remain, and people are still not assured about  the future of agriculture. Where lies the problem?    Investigation and study have not been conducted  sufficiently or thoroughly; the basic situation of agriculture  and farmers is unclear; and there has been a delayed reaction to  major rural problems. Currently, one outstanding problem  is that some leading organizations tend to react rather slowly  in dealing with major rural problems. For example, although the  problem of the farmers' burden has been talked about a great  deal and much attention has been paid to it, many places still  restrict their focus to increasing or decreasing farm products  when judging the agricultural situation. Therefore, these  people feel the situation is not bad, based on the increase in  the supply of farm products in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Thus, they  have actually neglected a series of serious problems brought  about by the slowdown in the farmers' income growth or the  reduction of income. This situation has caught the attention of  the party Central Committee and the State Council. Actually,  the burden problem is the other side of the income problem. If  income rises rapidly, then a slight burden is no big deal. The  main problem is that income has been rising slowly for three or  four years in a row, and thus the burden seems particularly  acute.    For example, the increase in farmer income recovered a bit  in  1992 and reached 5.9 percent. This, perhaps, caused some  leading departments to lower their guard, thinking that the  problem had been solved. Actually they did not see that, in  1992, the economy developed rapidly due to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's speeches during his southern trip, especially in the  southeastern coastal regions, and that there was a great deal of  rapid growth in township and town enterprises. The 5.9 percent  increase of 1992 actually covered up a great income discrepancy  among farmers of different regions. I did some analysis of  farmer income in 1991 and 1992. In more than half the provinces  and municipalities, farmer income dropped. Even though 1991 saw  a 2 percent growth, 1992 saw a 5.9 percent growth, and the  national average was rising, in reality farmer income in more  than half the provinces and municipalities was dropping. Seen  from the perspective of the entire country, the problem of  adequate food and clothing has been solved. After basically  solving this problem, however, the supply of farm products is  still an important problem.    On the whole, in evaluating the situation of the entire  countryside, the index carrying the greatest overall weight  should be farmer income. If farmer income does not increase,  then the product increases you want cannot, in reality, be  realized continuously. The situation in recent years reflects  this. As Comrade Wang Yuzhao said just now, the lack of  in-depth investigation and study causes the response to these  major rural problems to be delayed.    Meetings are held, documents are issued, and  understandings reach the higher levels, but if you want people  to make real sacrifices, nobody will. The problem of "slogan  agriculture" is far from being resolved.    A very important problem now is that rural policies cannot  be  implemented. According to my information, the rural work  conference held in October last year issued a document covering  a dozen or so concrete policies, the majority of which have not  been implemented. For example, central document no. 11 issued in  1993 says that the banking system should issue an additional  22.5 billion yuan in loans for agriculture. By the time of the  rural work conference this year, when we were again drafting a  document, we saw people from the Agricultural Bank and asked  about that 22.5 billion yuan. The reply was: The notice they  received was that the entire 22.5 billion yuan was only the  scale of credit, not the actual funds, so no money had been  issued. There are many similar stories. I remember that funds  were very tight last year. The document sent to central leaders  for discussion had brackets after each policy, listing how much  money was to be involved in each project. All the various  department heads discussed it and acknowledged their  responsibilities. Then the brackets were taken out, because  listing concrete amounts of money in a central government  document looked too trivial. The result was that, after the  document was issued, not a penny materialized.    Another problem with agriculture is that, after the grain  price fluctuations of last year, the party Central Committee and  the State Council were very concerned and made a whole series of  arrangements and held a series of meetings on stabilizing grain  prices and on the shopping basket project. The purpose was to  solve the effective supply problem. An outstanding problem in  solving the effective supply problem is to keep an ample supply  of means of production. However, looking at the current supply  of means of production, the problem is still very acute. If  this problem is not solved, then I think it will be very  difficult for agriculture to recover and develop this year.    According to the fertilizer supply situation of previous  years, each year we have to import 5 or 6 million tonnes of  chemical fertilizer before the year's end, when the current  year's use of fertilizer is finished, to prepare for the spring  plowing. Last year there was a shortage of over 2 million  tonnes. So, during this spring plowing, when the spring wheat  is sown, there will be no chemical fertilizer, and we may have  to sow seeds by themselves. Another problem is that, due to the  impending readjustment in this year's foreign currency exchange  and oil prices, all departments were watching and would not make  a move. It was not until February that the Planning Commission  delegated quotas for the import of chemical fertilizers and  called for the signing of contracts during the first half of the  year for the importation of 6.2 million tonnes of chemical  fertilizer. So I went to inquire. By March 31, order forms had  only been filled for 322,000 tonnes, equivalent to 5 percent of  the quota. Judging from the current situation of the order,  only 122,000 tonnes of imported fertilizer will arrive before  April 30. Up to now the first half year's imported fertilizer  is still unaccounted for. In mid-February the State Council  issued an emergency telegram asking local governments to  organize chemical fertilizers. But when it comes to execution,  it ends up like this.    What is the reason for this? The Agricultural Materials  Company says one of the major problems they encounter is the  shortage of supplies. Compared with the same period last year,  the first quarter lacks over 6 million tonnes of fertilizer.  The chemical fertilizer for the spring plowing in northeastern  China actually has no guarantees. Now we are solving the spring  plowing problem for the south, and there are still no  guarantees. First, supplies are extremely rare, and, second, we  must deal with the prices of the means of production. There is  no way to manage, and nobody has come up with a good method.    Let us take the price of urea, a chemical fertilizer, for  example. We will only talk about the prices allowed and fixed  by the state. Before October 1, 1992 it was 538 yuan/tonne.  The price adjustment of October 1, 1992 was approved by the  State Council, adjusting it to 660 yuan/tonne. By March 1993,  only 5 months later, again with the approval of the State  Council, the hidden subsidy was changed to an open subsidy and  volumes were kept the same, while prices were liberalized. The  factory price permitted by the State Council was 1000  yuan/tonne, and the highest retail price was 1200 yuan/tonne.  Thus, before October 1, 1992 the price was only 538 yuan/tonne,  while prices after March 1993 were 1200 yuan/tonne. In less  than a year and a half, the price had more than doubled. What  compensation has been given to the farmers?    On March 23, a national conference of managers from means of  production companies was held. The factory price of major  chemical fertilizers by then had actually reached 1100-1150  yuan/ton, representing another rise of 100-150 yuan. The  price-limiting measure had not been canceled but prices had, in  fact, gone up again.    These problems have all been emphasized, everyone claims to  be very concerned, and many documents have been issued. But  when it comes to the execution of concrete guidelines, then  there is no well-thought plan as to how to execute them, who is  responsible, or how to solve problems. For example, with  chemical fertilizer in very short supply and its price soaring  this year, the means of production companies also find  themselves in a difficult position. Should they buy or shouldn't  they, and, if they import at such high prices, wouldn't the  farmers curse them? It is not clear who is ultimately  responsible for problems like this or who one should go to when  problems arise. These are rather major problems, and more  concrete problems are innumerable. It boils down to "slogan  agriculture." When you really want people to make sacrifices,  nobody will.    The supply of agricultural products is the farmers'  responsibility, and the prices of agricultural products are the  farmers' responsibility. Just how much can the farmers bear?  It is only fair to have the "three parties share it."    I believe that, under the present situation, when the rural  economy is facing so many difficulties, we must persist in the  goal of reform. This is also an important issue worthy of note  and serious study. When supplies are short, should we put them  under unified control or liberalize them? There is currently  great controversy over this issue. Actually, past experience  has already told us: The more you put under unified control,  the less you have; the less you have, the more you put under  unified control. This is a vicious circle. Whatever is  liberalized increases. Of course things are not that simple;  for example, cotton output dropped last year. Here there is  indeed the problem of guaranteeing a basic production  capability. If we can't guarantee a basic production  capability, there will be a major disaster. Even if supply is  sufficient but prices are high, there will still be disaster.  The government has to consider all these aspects. But I  believe that, if we burden farmers with both the guarantee of  supply and the guarantee of prices, then the farmers' burdens  are too heavy. Society has many departments and many people --  what are the others doing to help? If the farmers have to be  responsible for the supply of farm products as well as their  price level, it becomes too difficult.    The fluctuation of grain prices last autumn actually sent a  signal to society. We now face a choice: If we do not raise  grain prices, supplies will decrease and the farmers' enthusiasm  will be affected; to motivate the farmers, prices will have to  be slightly higher. The burden at least should be shared by the  various groups of society. The issue of grain price reform was  raised at least seven or eight years ago -- when it was said  that the consequence of price rises should be born by three  parties: farmers, urban residents, and government finance.  Currently, many of the measures make it look like farmers have  to bear all the burdens. This may lead to trouble.    The measures that we are currently adopting to revive grain  and cotton production so that the government can secure grain  and cotton resources must take farmers into consideration. We  must not make the old mistake of wanting the horse to run fast  while not letting it eat grass. Wanting them to furnish  supplies without raising prices is very difficult. For example,  when we went out to investigate at the beginning of the year,  the farmers thought the average price of 0.5 yuan a jin was  acceptable. The problem now is that people, whether they are  farmers or county and township cadres, don't know that you are  going to come out with a measure which will adjust oil prices  later on. That is why they feel the price is acceptable.  However, by the time the price of oil is raised and the summer  grain has not yet been harvested, they will surely not accept  the price of 0.5 yuan/jin anymore. If they do not accept it,  what measures will the government take to control the supply of  grain? I think we need to seriously consider this kind of  problem.    At the rural work conference, it was decided that the new  price of crude oil will come into effect on 1 May, but the  farm-use diesel price will remain unchanged between 1 May and  the end of June. This is to say, it is still necessary to watch  the grain price situation. By postponing the change for two  months, we will be able to take other measures if grain prices  continue to rise. In a word, wait and see.    I did some major calculations. For example, I discussed  things with people from the means of production company at the  beginning of April. They believe that, because of the price  change in chemical fertilizer, farmers will have to pay 11  billion yuan more. The Ministry of Agriculture estimated that  if the state fixed price for oil is canceled this year, farmers  will have to pay 13.2 billion yuan more. Added together,  farmers will have to pay 24.2 billion yuan more.    It can also be clearly worked out how much grain purchases  will compensate farmers. Say we purchase 130 billion jin of  grain, and the price of each jin of grain rises by 0.1 yuan.  This means that 18 billion yuan more can be given to the  farmers. If we can harvest 70 million dan of cotton and if the  cotton price is raised by 90 yuan a dan, farmers will get 6.3  billion yuan more. These two add up to 24.3 billion yuan.    This implies that you will pay 24.3 billion more to the  farmers, who will in turn have 24.2 billion more in expenses.  The difference is 100 million yuan, which means that each  farmer will get 0.1 yuan more, while prices of other goods  continue to rise. If this is the situation, then the farmers  will have no enthusiasm.    Under the current circumstances, a visible problem in grain  and cotton, especially groceries, is that the prices at which  farmers sell are not high; it is the difference between  wholesale and retail that is really large. Therefore, it  doesn't solve the problem at all if you just tell the farmers to  sell cheaply. The price of spinach doubles between Dazhongsi  and Zhongguancun, and the farmers actually don't get much  benefit from it. Therefore, the government needs to come up  with reform methods, specifically, more methods to perfect the  market. If we only take measures to coerce the farmers, we may  end up in failure, and price fluctuations will be even greater.  Keeping the prices of farm products stable will serve the  purpose of maintaining social stability this year. If, however,  the method we adopt in fact offends the farmers, then the goal  of social stability will by no means be realized.  As long as farm products can increase, the farmers' income  can grow; as long as township and town enterprises can develop,  the farmers' employment problem can be resolved -- this  traditional way of thinking needs to be revisited.    Currently, on one hand, there is a good situation in the  countryside, while, on the other, problems abound. We must  broaden our minds in reform and must realistically admit that  the many problems we encounter now were not only unresolvable  before reform, but the experience accumulated in the 15 years of  reform is also insufficient to solve them. We need to create  new methods and further emancipate our minds. Two examples  demonstrate that our ways of thinking are very restricted  concerning the two problems.    First, according to the traditional way of thinking, as long  as basic farm products increase, the farmers' income will grow.  This method of thinking was actually shattered already several  years ago. Sometimes grain production increases, but farmer  income not only does not rise; it drops in some places. The  method we adopt to increase farmer income requires serious  thinking and study, with further emancipated minds.    The second challenge is that township and town enterprises  have sprung up since 1984, and many comrades, including myself,  thought that, as long as township and town enterprises  developed, we would be able to solve the employment problem for  farmers. But in the 1990's, it doesn't seem that way at all.  Township and town enterprise output value has grown extremely  rapidly, but the tidal wave of migrant laborers has also been  rising. Township and town enterprises cannot take in so many  labor hands. The farmer employment problem and income problem  are linked. Thus, any new increase in farm products alone  cannot increase farmer income, and township and town enterprises  bring only limited job opportunities for farmers. So with so  many farmers, how do we solve the employment and income  problems? This is an issue requiring serious thought for the  remaining years of this century. To a certain extent, the  increase in the supply of farm products during 1979-1984, the  continuous increase in subsidies, and the rising prices have  represented small-scale fix-it measures. So has the practice of  allowing farmers to run township and town enterprises on the  basis of one household, village, or township. It seems that, in  order to appropriately solve this problem, one must consider  farmer employment and the industrialization, urbanization, and  modernization processes throughout society as an integrated  whole. This is a consensus among Chinese and foreign scholars.  The employment problem facing Chinese farmers is indeed the  number one difficult problem facing global economics. The  employment of several hundred million people is no trifling  business. If it is solved well, the country will be prosperous  and the people will be strong; if not, there is the possibility  that the country will fall into chaos. Therefore, our minds  need further emancipation in this respect.    Chen Jiyuan, director of the Rural Development  Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "Several  Problems in the Rural Areas Which Urgently Need To Be Studied at  Present"    Fluctuations occurred in last year's grain prices, beginning  in the south and then spreading to the north, and this caught  the attention of the party Central Committee and the relevant  departments. To address this situation, the central meeting on  rural work held this March raised the slogan of three  stabilizations and two balances, i.e. realizing "the  stabilization of cultivated area, output, and grain reserves and  the balance of total volume and different regions." In order to  realize this goal, the conference put forward a leading-cadre  responsibility system and said that cultivating grain and cotton  was the sacred responsibility and duty of farmers. Currently,  all these suggestions are necessary and correct, but, from a  long-term point of view, in order to solve the problems of  China's agriculture, one must treat the symptoms along with the  causes and solve the problems from the roots. That is to say,  one must solve problems by raising agricultural efficiency and  increasing farmer income. Otherwise, no matter what harsh  administrative measures are adopted, the problems facing the  Chinese countryside and agriculture cannot be fundamentally  solved.    How do we fundamentally solve our problems in agriculture? I  believe that we must first study and clarify the following  questions by combining theory with practice.    Our attitude toward the farmers: In solving the  rice-sack and shopping-basket problems we must first consider  the farmers' wallets.    Under the planned economic system, for many years the  state's  view of farmers was mainly to request grain and cotton from  them, while the farmers, based or their own needs, wanted to  increase their income. This contradiction existed for a long  time. Formerly, under the people's communes system, this  contradiction was hidden by the system of everybody eating from  the same big pot. After practicing the contracted responsibility  system with remuneration linked to output, farmers became  commodity producers. This contradiction became even more acute  after the complete switchover to a market economy. Up to now,  however, this problem has not been solved very well.    For example, solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket  problems is a key component of guaranteeing supplies and curbing  inflation. This is, of course, correct. But the purpose in  solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems should not  only be to guarantee supplies, curb inflation, and maintain  urban stability, but should also increase the income of farmers  who produce the grain and vegetables, letting them obtain some  economic benefit. If we only were to solve the rice-sack and  shopping-basket problems but paid no attention to the problem of  the farmers' wallets, then in the long run, the shopping-basket  will not be secure. In grasping agriculture, we should not only  think about what to take from farmers but should also think  about what the farmers get. If farmers increase their income by  producing grain and vegetables and the wallet problem is solved,  I believe the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems will also  be solved naturally.    The criterion for assessing the grass-roots cadres'  work is the output value or the quantity of farm products.    We have discussed the importance of agriculture for many  years. We have continued talking about it in the past two years,  and many words have been said about the correct understanding of  it. It should be pointed out that Chairman Mao had already  elucidated the importance of agriculture in "On the Ten Major  Relationships." For example, we cannot take the Soviet road by  working farmers too hard, nor can we ask the horse to run fast  but eat no grass, and so on. In the early 1960's, after some  problems had occurred nationwide, the party Central Committee  reiterated the fundamental position of agriculture quite  comprehensively. By 1978, when the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee was held and the national economy was  on the brink of collapse, from an economic perspective, it was  important to solve the agricultural problem. The plenary session  stated that it was necessary to stabilize one end first and let  farmers rest and build up strength. Only by stabilizing the  farmers can the whole country be stabilized. In recent years we  have continued to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The  Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee made  the decision on emphasizing rural and agricultural work. It was  a very correct decision. After that, between last October and  March this year, the central authorities called two meetings on  rural work. One cannot say that we are not concerned about  agriculture.    However, while the central authorities have repeatedly  emphasized the importance of agriculture and have made so many  decisions about it, why is it so difficult to implement these  decisions? Where lies the root of the problem? Perhaps one has  to seek it in structure. I believe that using gross output value  as a major criterion for evaluating local cadres is a cause.  Our party's strategic goal of development has already been  decided. The party Central Committee has made a decision to  quadruple the GNP by the end of the century. But, in evaluating  departments, local governments, and cadres, I think if we only  judge them according to the growth rate, especially the growth  rate of gross output value, this will inevitably lead to  departments and local cadres paying attention to only those  industries with high output value while neglecting those  industries with low output value. Agriculture is an industry  with great social benefit but low output value and low  comparative efficiency. It is therefore very easily put in the  most neglected position. If these problems are not solved, the  problem of neglecting agriculture will be difficult to solve.    We now include agricultural production as part of the  criteria for evaluating achievements in cadres' official  careers. Has this been implemented? It should be seriously  checked. In the past, the evaluation of industrial enterprises  always took gross output value as the central index. Now,  changes have occurred through reform, but we still lack a  scientific system for evaluating the work of local governments.  Studies should be made on this topic. Otherwise, we may talk  about the importance of addressing this issue every day, but the  problems will remain unsolved.    Conditions for nurturing in return: Are the  conditions ripe for realizing the transition from agriculture  nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture in return?    We should start from the overall situation and take the  perspective of combining theory with practice in studying the  following question: Are the conditions ripe now, or are they in  the initial stages of becoming ripe, for realizing the  transition from agriculture nurturing industry to industry  nurturing agriculture in return? We are basically still not  clear on this question. The issue of making transitions in  stages is a basic starting point in policymaking. If we say  that conditions are already ripe or are initially ripe, then we  have to come up with a series of new economic policies. If we  think the turning point hasn't yet arrived, then of course it is  another matter.    Using agriculture to nurture industry is a process that any  developing country has to go through. China has been in this  process since liberation; that is, it is using the value created  by farmers to support the development of industry and the  development of the urban economy. After a few decades, industry  has become very strong, and the ratio between industrial and  agricultural output values has now been reversed, from the  former 30:70 to 70:20-odd now. This demands that we study our  development strategy, including issues concerning the expanding  income gap between industry and agriculture and between urban  and rural areas.    Looking at these aspects, I personally believe that,  although  we can't say that the conditions are completely ripe, we can say  that conditions are initially ripe for the transition from  agriculture nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture  in return. In fact, industry has already begun to nurture  agriculture, primarily in the form of township and town  enterprises nurturing agriculture. Township and town enterprises  in the coastal regions have played this role.    Of course, this is only my personal view. But this question  is worth serious study. Only then can our agriculture have the  opportunity to better develop.    The application of protection policies. Should we lift  price controls over the means of agricultural production,  protect farmers, or do both?    Currently, the prices of the means of agricultural  production  are up, and farmers cannot afford them. Hence the issue of  protection has been raised. But how do we protect them? Some  time back I attended a seminar on the mechanization of  agriculture. Sales of farm machinery had dropped 30-40 percent  since the latter half of last year. A RENMIN RIBAO reporter  wrote a commentary which described it very vividly: Beginning  in June last year, it was as if farmers had discussed and agreed  on a course of action; suddenly, no one would buy farm machinery  any more. It is impossible for so many farmers to have  discussed and agreed on it. Yet the fact that "suddenly nobody  would buy" indicates that economic laws are working. Why  wouldn't farmers buy farm machinery? Why wouldn't they use farm  machinery? The key is whether it was financially beneficial for  them.    When contradictions occur between farmers and the  enterprises  that manufacture farm machinery, what should we do? If we let  the manufacturers all go bankrupt, it will be difficult to  revive them later. So we must protect them a little. However,  under the circumstances that large and medium enterprises are  switching their mechanisms to enter the market, if we favor the  farm-machinery manufacturing industry too much, then its ability  to survive will not grow stronger, and that won't do either.  Therefore, I believe that, in principle, industry -- i.e., the  means of agricultural production -- should be liberalized. Let  it go and compete in the market economy so that efficient  enterprises will prosper, increase their vitality, and raise  their product quality. But for farmers we should take certain  protective measures -- for example, we can let the price of  diesel oil rise, but we must take certain measures to guarantee  that the farmers can buy it at a fixed state price. Chemical  fertilizer is the same. The question boils down to either  protecting both ends or only one. If, given the soaring prices  of the means of agricultural production, we don't try to protect  the farmers' interests, agricultural production will surely drop  sharply. After farm machinery went into a slump, in many places  it was just as the newspaper described, "selling the iron ox  (tractor) to buy the farm cattle." In some places, such as  Yanqing, some farmers sold their tractors and went to Shanxi to  buy donkeys. In some places in Shanxi you can see professional  plowers. They don't use animal power, but manpower. All these  indicate that, if we still don't take measures and let the  comparative efficiency of agriculture drop, farmers will be  unable to afford modern production facilities, and the  modernization of our agriculture will be difficult to achieve  and will even hold other things back. Some people suggest  transferring farmers from cultivating the land to conducting  large-scale operations on the land. This will raise  agricultural efficiency and increase farmer income. But this  requires a long process and requires substantial development in  the non-farming industries. Water in the distance can't quench  an immediate thirst. At present, we urgently need to study how  to implement protective policies toward farmers and agriculture.    Wu Xiang, president and researcher of the Chinese  Society for the Study of the Export-Oriented Economy: "How To  Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Farmers as Viewed From the Practice  During Several Stages of Agricultural Development Since the  Third Plenary Session"    Beginning with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, rural reform has been continuing for 15  years. Looking back, we can perhaps divide these 15 years into  the following stages:    First stage: From 1979 to 1984, grain and farm  products increased rapidly, farmer income also rose rapidly, and  the city and countryside were both happy.    During the 1979-1984 period, grain production developed  rapidly. Nobody thought that the problem of securing adequate  food and clothing for the majority of the countryside could be  solved so quickly. The number one factor behind the large  increase in farm products was the implementation of the contract  responsibility system on a household basis, and the number two  factor was perhaps the rise in grain prices, which was fairly  substantial. At the same time, the state also decided to import  grain and let the countryside and the farmers rest and  recuperate. These measures, therefore, greatly benefited the  rural economy, and farmer enthusiasm was high. For a few years,  grain production continued to advance past two major milestones,  each milestone representing an increase of 100 billion jin in  output. This type of large-scale continuous growth has rarely  been seen in history. During those years, farmer income  increased rapidly, reaching an average growth rate of over 10  percent. With a large increase in farm income, farm products  increased rapidly. So the government was satisfied, farmers  were satisfied, and everybody was satisfied. But this created  an illusion among some, as if agricultural problems would all be  solved by production contracts and it would be plain sailing  from then on.    Second stage: From 1985 to 1988, grain production  dropped for one year and remained stagnant for three. Urbanites  complained loudly, but farmer income still increased to some  extent. Farmers, therefore, were basically satisfied.    In 1984 there was a bumper harvest, but immediately in 1985  there was a great reduction in yields. Actually, the drop in  1985 was foreshadowed by signs some years earlier. I remember  that Comrade Wan Li read a letter at the 1983 Rural Work  Conference. It was written by someone to his older brother in  Beijing. It said: You all say that the situation is very good.  I don't think so. Farmers are no longer willing to grow grain.  It could already be seen at that time that growing grain was  not profitable. If cash crops were planted on the same field,  then the income would be so much more. If the field was turned  into a fish pond, then the income would be even higher. If a  factory was built on the land, the income would be higher still.  At that time, however, the contract responsibility system on a  household basis was still being pushed forward. Before that,  the state's grain output had been very low. Therefore, during  the early years, development had the nature of a recovery.  Because all areas that practiced the contract responsibility  system saw the per mu grain output increase -- even though the  phenomenon of farmers being unwilling to grow grain had appeared  and grain-growing areas had been reduced -- on the whole the  total output of grain did not drop or did not drop much.  Nationwide, therefore, the grain output still rose by a large  margin. After 1984, however, the situation changed. This  recovery-based rising trend weakened. Plus, for several years in  a row, some areas that had reduced their agricultural land had  made profits, and farmer enthusiasm for growing grain dropped,  which led to a drop in output in 1985.    After document No. 4 of 1984 stipulated some preferential  policies for township and town enterprises, the township and  town enterprises developed rapidly. The result was that farmer  income increased. Therefore, in the four years from 1985 to  1988, grain output dropped for one year and was stagnant for  three. Even in 1988 the 1984 level was never regained.  Urbanites shouted loudly. After three years of stagnant  agricultural output, people from top to bottom began to pay  attention. But farmers were still happy. The voice saying that  without industry there is no prosperity greatly surpassed the  voice saying that without agriculture there is no stability.  The "peaceful" scenario left problems for later.    Third stage: From 1989 to 1991, grain output went up,  but the rise in farmer income slowed down. The income of over  half of the farmers experienced negative growth.    After the three years' stagnation, the leadership and the  rank and file all made efforts, and grain output increased in  1989. But the rise in farmer income was negative. The total  rise of income in the three years from 1989 to 1991 was 0.7  percent. This 0.7 percent was a national average (during that  period, township and town enterprises in the coastal regions,  especially in the Zhu Jiang Delta, rose on a large scale; the  export-oriented enterprises developed; and the growth in their  income surpassed this ratio). Actually, the income of more than  half of the farmers experienced negative growth. We reflected  on and recognized such an important situation very slowly and  belatedly and failed to take timely and effective measures. It  wasn't until 1992 that the situation began to change.    Fourth stage: From 1992 to the present. Looking back  and looking ahead into the future, I think the essential element  of solving the current problems in agriculture and among the  farmers is to pay great attention to the farmers' interests.    The rural reform that began in 1979 has developed smoothly  all along. But in 1985 grain output started to slip. Urbanites  were very worried, and some people even began to doubt the  contract responsibility system on a household basis. Later,  measures were taken to increase grain production, but the  farmers' income did not rise.    Looking back on it now, the root of the problem was that,  for  a long time under the planned system, the state's concern in the  countryside was only to ask for grain and farm products from  farmers, while seldom devoting any energy to the construction of  the countryside itself. It did not pay attention to increasing  farmer income and paid little heed to the economic interests of  farmers and the improvement of their living standards. This  problem has been a long term one. In the state's construction  plans, careful consideration has been given to the various  industrial projects that need to be launched -- how much  investment and what kind of equipment they require -- while  agriculture seldom or never received this attention. For  agriculture, the authorities usually just set quotas and  demanded increases of so much grain or cotton. But what were  these increases based on? The measures often were not  implemented. And when contradictions occurred between the city  and the countryside, the countryside was often sacrificed to  save the city.    Looking at the more than a decade of history since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we feel  deeply that the spiritual essence of the policies of the Third  Plenary Session was to end the previous "leftist" practice of  many years, i.e. the practice of invariably asking something  from the farmers while paying no attention to their interests.  There has been real concern for the interests of farmers. Only  when they had the political right to make their own decisions  and got real benefits economically was there an unprecedented  rise in the production enthusiasm among the hundreds of millions  of farmers. That was what made the miracle in Chinese  agriculture of the 1980's possible.    Today the key to revitalizing agriculture still lies in  truly  mobilizing farmer enthusiasm. To this end we must genuinely  solve the problems of farmers increasing output but not their  income, the dearth of rural employment opportunities, and the  fact that it is hard for farmers to get rich. Only if farmers  get rich can the country become prosperous and strong.  Countries throughout the world are watching us, thinking that  China is a large potential market. But only when the purchasing  power of the large numbers of farmers is raised can this market  become the world's largest market.    In order to raise farmer enthusiasm, we must first resolve  the question of increasing farmer income and then address the  rural employment problem. These two are linked. Currently,  this is evident in the "tidal wave of migrant laborers." It is  true that, when migrant laborers come, many problems are  exposed, such as traffic jams and chaos. People, therefore,  usually see its negative side. Fortunately now everybody has  also realized that this is a historical trend. The Ministry of  Labor has been thinking of ways to solve these problems. The  tidal wave of migrant laborers is nothing other than farmers  coming, on their own, to look for jobs. The experience of many  years has shown that farmers will always think of ways to solve  rural and agricultural problems themselves. The government just  needs to be a good guide and summarize experiences. With regard  to such major problems as rural employment, we may have to let  farmers find their own way.    LIAOWANG is a very influential news magazine which has  always  paid attention to propaganda concerning rural, agricultural, and  farmer problems. It has published many influential reports and  essays. I suggest that LIAOWANG continue this good tradition  and method. So many new problems are occurring in the  countryside today, and propaganda must be strengthened so that  both the leadership and the rank and file will pay appropriate  attention. I agree wholeheartedly with the kind of meeting you  are holding today. It doesn't require a lot of people.  Everybody can say as much as he wants. But one meeting is not  enough. We should hold several meetings in a row, and get the  relevant comrades to conduct penetrating studies and discussions  on several major problems in the reality of agriculture and the  countryside.  <H5>  Duan Yingbi, researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center </H5> of the Ministry of Agriculture: "Reform: The Only Way for  Agriculture To Get Out of Difficulty"    In recent years agriculture has encountered several new  situations, and many new problems have appeared in the  countryside. The party Central Committee and the State Council  are very concerned about agricultural and rural work and have  implemented a series of policy measures to support agricultural  production and protect the interests of farmers. At the end of  1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin called a Six-Province Rural  Work Forum in Wuhan, and Premier Li Peng called a National Rural  Work TV and Telephone Conference in Beijing. These can be seen  as a turning point in the rural situation. The problem of  "IOU's" being used to purchase farm products and of the farmers'  burdens being too heavy, which were common at the time, have  pretty much been solved. Later on, by strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control, the outflow of rural  capital and the occupation of large stretches of land have been  halted. Last October, the central authorities called a rural  work conference and came up with various policy measures for  accelerating the development of the rural economy. In March  this year, a central rural work conference was again called,  which made concrete arrangements for agriculture and rural work  this year. The level of these two meetings was very high. The  number one leaders of local party committees and provincial  governors participated, and the general secretary and the  premier gave long speeches. All these have played a very  positive role in the development of agriculture and the rural  economy. Although currently there are still many difficulties  and problems in agriculture and rural work, we can imagine that,  had it not been for the strong emphasis on the part of the party  Central Committee and the State Council, rural problems  certainly would be much more serious than they are now.  <H5>  What Policies Did the Central Authorities Give to the </H5> Farmers?    After more than four months of preparation, the central  rural  work conference came up with 12-point policy measures in light  of the major problems existing in the countryside. In terms of  the operating system, it stipulated that, when the current term  of contracts for cultivated land expire, they should be extended  for another 30 years without changing the terms, and that  compensated transfer of land according to the law should be  allowed. In terms of the circulation system, it stipulated a  rise in the purchase price of grain and cotton, the  establishment of grain risk funds and a state reserve system,  and that the "sale on credit" problem in the grain business  should be solved within a fixed period. In terms of  agricultural input, it outlined adjustments in the three  structures and rises in the three proportions, i.e., the  proportion of agricultural investment in the state capital  construction investment, the proportion of agricultural aid fund  in the state financial budget, and the proportion of  agricultural credit and loans in the state credit and loans. In  order to support the economic development of the major grain and  cotton producing areas, it decided to designate 500 major  commodity grain producing counties and 150 cotton producing  counties across the country, and said that the state would make  arrangements for 6.5 billion yuan in special loans in a  concentrated effort to help these counties. In order to guide  agriculture in the direction of high yields, excellent quality,  and high efficiency, it decided to allocate 1 billion yuan in  special loans for the establishment of a group of agricultural  demonstration zones in various places. Targeting the phenomenon  of the random occupation of cultivated land, it stipulated the  establishment of a basic farmland protection system and the  delineation of basic farmland protection zones. Apart from  this, in terms of science and technology, education, and the  work of assisting the poor by tackling development projects,  many concrete measures were also stipulated. Putting them  together, the increase in special agricultural loans comes to  22.5 billion yuan per year.    All these measures are specific and feasible. They were  put forward on the basis of a large amount of investigation and  study and after many meetings were called by the leading  comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council in  order to coordinate with the leaders of the relevant  departments. Now the problem is that some policy measures have  not been implemented, and, naturally, the effect of these  policies cannot be brought into play. That policy measures  cannot be implemented is indeed a major problem in agricultural  and rural work.  <H5>  Where Is the Obstruction? </H5>   If one asks why some policies of the central authorities are  not being carried out, this cannot be explained in a few  sentences. It is caused by many reasons, among which three are  worth noting.    First, the macro environment of agriculture. For a long  period, we used agriculture to protect industry and used the  countryside to protect the cities. The countryside had to  shoulder the task of accumulating funds for the nation's  industrialization. This situation has not yet been turned  around and probably will not be completely turned around for  some time to come. On the one hand, we want to maintain a  relatively high speed for national economic development; on the  other, we want to make a transition towards a socialist market  economic system. Under these circumstances, it is difficult not  to encounter the pressure of inflation and is difficult not to  harm the vested interests of some people, because reform itself  is an adjustment of interest relations. However, since the  interests of the city are inflexible and untouchable, a fair  proportion of the risks will have to be born by the countryside.  Of course, none of us want to have it this way. We all wish to  give agriculture a better environment, such as rationalizing the  prices of farm products and increasing inputs for agriculture.  But this is truly difficult to do. I think the so-called  "failure to implement policy measures" is related to this macro  environment.    Second, the situation of leadership at the county and  township levels. These two levels are crucial for agricultural  and rural work, because various policy measures have to be  implemented through them. Currently many counties and townships  are racking their brains over their inability to pay salaries;  some county offices have kept a few people to man the phones and  have sent the rest out to make money. Under such a situation,  how can agriculture and rural work be strengthened? The work at  the township level is indeed difficult to do. They cannot even  accomplish the imperative tasks pressed upon them by their  superiors; when do they have time for rural work? Of course,  the situation is not the same everywhere, but at least this is  not an isolated phenomenon. If this situation is not changed,  it will be very difficult for agriculture to develop.    Third, the situation in the rural work organs. On the one  hand, the organization is incomplete because there is not a  unified organization to grasp the work. On the other hand,  there is the problem of spirit. During the 1980's, rural reform  was heated. In the rural work system the leadership and the  rank and file were all very enthusiastic. They would go deep  down into reality, conduct investigation and study, and delve  into problems. That spirit cannot be compared to what we are  seeing today. Now, very few people actually go down to the  townships, villages, or households to investigate, and very few  investigation reports contain examples and analysis. On the  contrary, there are many general articles. I think this is also  one reason why policies "cannot be implemented"!  <H5>  Let the Countryside Heat Up </H5>   To solve the current problems in the countryside, in the  final analysis, we should continue to deepen rural reform,  implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, and advance toward the goal of a  socialist market economic system.    By now, rural reform is increasingly interwoven with urban  reform. Many reform measures can no longer be independently  implemented in the countryside but must be coordinated between  the cities and the countryside. However, this on no account  means that there is no room for rural reform. On the contrary,  there are still many things to do.    For example, in terms of the operating system, we can  realize  the optimal allocation of economic resources on the basis of  stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output and circulating the  various production elements in the countryside by different  means. In this respect, there have already been many  innovations among the farmers. In some economically developed  regions, many forms of moderately large-scale operations of  farmland have been developed by using land use rights as shares  or transferring land use rights for a price. Farmers in some  economically underdeveloped regions have gone to contract fields  in economically developed regions. Recently, in some places in  the northwest, the development of noncultivated resources has  been accelerated through the auction of the use rights of  uncultivated mountains, hills, wasteland, and shoals. These  innovations should be seriously summarized so as to study their  applicability and conditions and gradually promote them.    For example, in terms of the circulation system, we can do  some pioneering in developing market intermediary organizations.  Currently, the main reason why we do not dare lift price  controls over cotton and part of the grain is the fear that,  once they are liberalized, there will be chaos and all kinds of  vendors will go and "loot" the countryside and disrupt the  market and the prices. Will we then be able to develop farmers  marketing cooperatives in the countryside? Take grain as an  example. I think we can use the grass-roots grain management  offices as a basis to establish grain marketing cooperatives.  Each household can hand over its grain to the cooperative,  which will sell the grain directly in the wholesale markets.  After the deduction of costs and accumulation, the profit can  then be returned to the farmers according to a certain  percentage. Cotton can also have cotton cooperatives, with the  processing stations as a basis. This way one can both reduce  intermediate links, save on transaction costs, increase farmer  income, and avoid the situation of the market becoming chaotic  once it has been liberalized.    As for the questions of adjusting the economic structure,  developing township and town enterprises, building small towns,  and transferring surplus rural labor, still more problems must  be studied and still more work has to be done. In a word, we  should not think that there is nothing more to do in rural  reform. I hope LIAOWANG weekly will use this format to publish  more articles on deepening rural reform and, as before, build up  a momentum for rural reform.</p>

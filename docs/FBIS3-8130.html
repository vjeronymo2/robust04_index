Nor is it prepared to receive its members in  Budapest," Hungarian Ambassador to Ukraine Istvan Varga told  Nikola Makarevich, first deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, in  Kiev today. The ambassador said that the recognition of  Ruthenians as a national minority is an internal affair of  Ukraine.    The cabinet of the so-called Subcarpathian Rus was formed in  the spring of 1993 by Ruthenians seeking independence from  Ukraine. Hungary's law on national and ethnic minorities  mentions the Ruthenians and Ukrainians separately, thereby  recognizing the existence of a Ruthenian minority in Hungary.</p>

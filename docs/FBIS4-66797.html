The Yemeni foreign minister, Mr Mohammed Saleem Basendwa,  who  held extensive talks with the external affairs minister, Mr  Dinesh Singh, on cross-border terrorism and regional issues,  said India and Pakistan should resolve the Kashmir issue through  a dialogue.

Mr Basendwa invited investment from India in development  projects and also sought training of Yemeni students in  professional institutions in India, mainly in areas of  engineering, management and electronics.</p>

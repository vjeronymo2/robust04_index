Drafted by Ferdinando  Adornato and signed by 14 personalities from the culture and  business worlds (including Bobbio, Eco, Furio Colombo, Ettore  Gallo, Benetton, Marzotto, and Sylos Labini), this appeal has  become the banner of the National Cultural and Professional  Assembly, promoted by Democratic Alliance [AD] and scheduled to  take place in Rome on 12 March. The title "Reflect, Italy"  sounds like an antislogan designed to counter "Forza Italia."  Is this so? Let us listen to Adornato himself.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this, then, a last appeal to avoid the  "slumber of reason?"    [Adornato] The Italy of competence and work must make its  voice heard. The meeting which will be held in Umberto Hall  will feature the three C's symbolizing the reconstruction of the  country: competence, creativeness, and civilization. The best  part of Italy must enter the field in order to restore the image  of a nation which is on its knees but which nevertheless can  still rely on enormous resources to rise up to its feet again.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Does appealing to those who are "competent"  mean proposing a technical government, just at a time when an  attempt is being made to revive politics?    [Adornato] We must change the system, the decisionmaking  mechanisms, otherwise nothing will change. Decisionmaking must  be closely linked to expertise, following years of calculated  incompetence on the part of a worn-out and impoverished  political caste. For example, unless we get managers to run our  hospitals, we will always have a disastrous health system.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is there any sense in an appeal to  "creativeness?" Is this not an appeal to Italic vitalism in the  manner of Pasqualino Settebellezze [movie character]?    [Adornato] Not at all. This is an extraordinarily creative  country. The problem is that people have only used this asset  to bend the law and serve their own private interests -- to  adapt, conform, evade taxation, swindle the state. However, we  must now draw up a list of our resources. There is enormous  potential for the construction industry, which does not mean  more concrete, but rather, making towns more habitable. The  same applies to reviving tourism, which has been destroyed, or  putting culture to good use and making it profitable. The  private and the public sectors must work together to create new  jobs, to launch a Roosevelt-like development and reconstruction  program, starting from a number of pilot projects.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the appeal to civilization intended as a  bulwark against electoral barbarism?    [Adornato] Of course, our country cannot revert to the late  1940's ideologies. The Cold War is over for everyone. [Forza  Italia leader] Berlusconi is saying that, if he loses, he will  leave Italy for good -- an excellent example of political  incivility. We will not leave -- there is no antinational  posturing on our part. If we lose, we will stay here as part of  the opposition. As the British say: Right or wrong, this is my  country -- this Italy where 96 percent of homes have a TV set,  where it takes six months to get x-rays on the National Health  Service, this Italy which has no respect for elderly people and  children, which is corrupt and cynical, with its head in Beverly  Hills and its feet in the Third World.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Will an appeal against this egoism epidemic  be enough?    [Adornato] To begin with, in March Italians will be voting  directly for the government, for the first time ever. For  [Prime Minister] Ciampi or Berlusconi. This does not seem like  much, but actually it means a lot.</p>

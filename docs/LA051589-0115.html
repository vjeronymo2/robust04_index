			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENDL BEATS SKOFF, WINS GERMAN OPEN  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia won his 78th Grand Prix title today when he beat  Austrian Horst Skoff 6-4, 6-1, 6-3 in the rain-delayed final of the German Open  tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Lendl had to struggle in a difficult opening set as Skoff, ranked 31st in the  world, used his sharp, hard-hitting base line play to move Lendl around the  court and often catch him out of position.  </P> <P> Skoff, who beat second-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany in Sunday's  semifinals after Becker suffered a back injury, broke Lendl's serve to take a  4-2 lead in the first set. But a double fault at 40-30 in the next game cost  him dearly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serve Broken  </P> <P> Lendl broke Skoff's serve in the seventh game as he went on a four-game sweep  to win the first set in exactly an hour.  </P> <P> "At first, I was hitting the ball short, but once I got my length, everything  began to take shape. Overall I was very pleased," said Lendl, who earned  $135,000 in taking the title.  </P> <P> Lendl faced little resistance after winning the first set.  </P> <P> "I should have won the first set, but unfortunately I was very tired," Skoff  said. "If you don't put pressure on Lendl, he will kill you."  </P> <P> Lendl, a Czech citizen who lives in the United States, will spend the next week  and a half fine-tuning his game for the French Open, which begins May 29 in  Paris.  </P> <P> "I have never been in better shape physically going into the French Open.  Nearly everything I have touched this year I have won," said Lendl, who has a  37-2 record for the year.  </P> <P> Skoff collected $67,500.  </P> <P> In Rome, unseeded Mark Koevermans of Holland ousted No. 3 seed Kent Carlsson of  Sweden 6-3, 6-4 today in a first-round match in the $1-million Italian Open  tennis championship.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old Koevermans, ranked No. 98 in the world, used a strong serve and  a steady base line game to defeat the hard-hitting Swede. Carlsson is ranked  ninth in the world.  </P> <P> For Koevermans, who joined the pro tour six months ago after finishing high  school in Holland, it was the first victory over a player ranked in the top 10.  In the second round he will play the winner of the match between Jose Luis  Clerc of Argentina and Australia's Jason Stoltenberg.  </P> <P> In another first-round match, Aaron Krickstein beat Andres Vysand of the Soviet  Union 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Krickstein, the tournament's seventh seed, played steady tennis against the  Soviet, hitting deep shots and forcing his opponent into numerous errors.  </P> <P> Currently ranked 22nd in the world, the 21-year-old Krickstein has been on the  pro tour since he was 16. The American, after a promising professional start,  has been hampered by a series of physical ailments for the last four years.  Against Vysand he played with a brace on his left knee and a heavily taped  right ankle.  </P> <P> No. 16 seed Mark Woodeforde of Australia became the day's first casualty among  the seeds as he dropped his opening-round match to unseeded Fernando Luna of  Spain 6-2, 6-3.  </P></p>

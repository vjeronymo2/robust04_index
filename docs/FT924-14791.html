			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Transport at heart of Canary Wharf troubles: Robert Peston reports on the difficulties the project faced IF THE government shelves construction of the Jubilee Line extension to east London, Canary Wharf may go into liquidation, according to the projects' bankers. Mr Michael Dennis, the Canadian former law professor who spent more than Pounds 1.5bn building the neo-classical ghost town in east London, says that difficulties over adequate transport links have been at the heart of Canary Wharf's problems since Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, drove the first pile in 1988. Last week Mr Dennis resigned after five years as chief executive of O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Limited, the company set up by Mr Paul Reichmann to build the 15 monoliths which dominate the Docklands skyline. He is moving to New York, where he plans to exploit a skill acquired in the six months since Canary Wharf was placed in administration under UK insolvency procedures - he will set up a company to provide capital and management to troubled property developments. Mr Dennis says his biggest mistake was not to take control of the construction of transport links with central London. 'We should have insisted (in negotiations with the government) that we take contractual responsibility for infrastructure developments,' he said. He blames the government for failing to meet its commitment to provide adequate road and rail links. 'We undertook to build 5.6m sq ft of offices in five years from mid 1987,' he said. 'We completed 6m sq ft in four years and on budget. 'We also made a commitment to make Pounds 250m of expenditures on infrastructure - the local roads, the roundabout, the parking. In exchange the government sold to the company half the land on which Canary Wharf was built and it undertook to build the Limehouse Link and upgrade the DLR.' Responsibility for improving the Docklands Light Railway was given to London Transport, and the London Docklands Development Corporation oversaw the construction of the Limehouse Link road. Mr Dennis said the government made a firm commitment to have an efficient two-track service to Bank station in the City of London by early last year and to pay monthly damages if that date was not met for a period of three years and around Pounds 100m after that. 'We submitted a claim (for damages) which is under review', he said. In the case of the Limehouse Link, the development corporation contracted to have it completed as far as Canary Wharf by autumn last year and the whole thing by early this year. Mr Dennis said: 'It will now be at least a year-and-a-half late.' The company had had 'extensive negotiations' with half-a-dozen large potential tenants, 'three or four of whom spent well over Pounds 100,000 on legal negotiations and planning of space'. He insisted: 'All were very very serious. In every case the breaking point was transport - they simply did not believe that the transport would be there on time. That more than anything else was the stumbling block for the success of Canary Wharf.' He also believes that hopes of Canary Wharf avoiding liquidation and one day becoming a commercial success depend to a large extent on yet another infrastructure project - the extension of the Jubilee Underground line into east London. However, the Treasury has reservations about the quality of the offer made by the administrators and Canary Wharf's banks to provide a contribution to the Pounds 1.6bn costs of the line. Mr Dennis believes the government has a debt of honour to the Canary Wharf development. He said: 'We went to the wall honouring our commitments to the government on the project. Government agencies had difficulty meeting their commitments. 'One would hope that when it comes to deciding on the offer which the banks and administrators have made to move Jubilee forward, all of that would be taken into account.'</p>

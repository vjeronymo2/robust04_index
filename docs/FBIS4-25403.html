			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China and South Korea  will begin an exchange of public servants later this month for  the first time, the South Korean Government Administration  Ministry said here today.    South Korea plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level  officials on June 28 to a three-week group training course for  public servants offered by the Chinese Personnel Ministry.    China, in turn, will send 15 public officials to South Korea  in early September to attend a training course at the central  officials training institute here.    This exchange is based on an agreement signed last March to  expand personnel cooperation between the two countries.    The ministry said the exchange is designed to promote  friendly cooperation between civil servants by widening their  knowledge of the other nation's reform policy.</p>

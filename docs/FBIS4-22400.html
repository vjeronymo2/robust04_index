Arutyunyan, vice president of the Republic of  Armenia.    Information on the assistance rendered the work of the  competent commissions looking into the circumstances of the loss  on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh of an Iranian C-130  military-transport aircraft and the causes of the tragedy by the  Armenian authorities was heard at the session.    Profound regret was expressed in connection with the  aircraft  catastrophe and the human casualties, and it was noted that  Armenia was assisting in every way and would continue to assist  the investigation of all the circumstances of the loss of the  aircraft by specialists who had come from Iran and the competent  commission of the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee.    The shipment of the remains of the victims of the tragedy  from Stepanakert to Yerevan and from there to Tehran has been  properly organized also.    At the same time it was observed at the session that the  disinformation being spread from time to time by certain foreign  news media and the biased interpretation of the incident are  making this accident a subject of political speculation.    It was observed also that many questions still await a  definitive answer. According to the specialists from Iran, the  C-130 aircraft did not have a "black box." It was ascertained  also that the aircraft lost pressure 50 minutes after departure  from Moscow and lost 2,400 meters in altitude, but the crew  decided not to return to the Moscow airport and continued the  flight.    The investigation confirms that the aircraft did not enter  Armenia's air space at all and did not make contact with  Yerevan's air traffic control services, although the latter had  attempted to establish communication also via a Russian  aircraft, Flight 954, when Georgia's air traffic control  reported that the airplane had strayed off course and that  communications with it had been lost.    It is still not clear why the aircraft deviated abruptly  from  the flight path on the territory of Georgia and went for quite  some time deeper onto the territory of Azerbaijan, losing  altitude appreciably (approximately 4,000 meters).    At the same time hope was expressed that the answers to all  the questions might be obtained after a comprehensive study of  the incident by specialists and the competent commissions.    Emphasizing the vital need for the establishment of  stability  and peace in the region, concern was also expressed at the  session in connection with the fact that Azerbaijan's  frustration of the peacemaking initiatives for a settlement of  the Karabakh problem was becoming a cause of the tragedy of the  sons not only of the Armenian and Azerbaijani but  also--involuntarily--of the friendly Iranian people.    A number of current matters concerning Armenian-Iranian  economic relations was discussed at the commission session also.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Administration presses for a minimum of amendments - Congress PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has called on Congress to deal with his economic programme as a complete package, instead of picking apart each component. 'I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made,' Mr Clinton implored in his speech to both houses of Congress on Wednesday night. But the legislative realities could mean that this will be difficult to achieve. The current strategy is to pass a package of immediate spending measures, intended to boost the economy in the short term, in the form of a supplemental appropriations bill. Congressional leaders hope they will be able to get this through House and Senate committees in four to five weeks. All of the tax measures proposed by Mr Clinton would then be rolled together into a budget proposal, to be laid before Congress by the administration on March 23, and pushed through in the form of a budget reconciliation bill. Some members of congress had favoured attaching at least some of the proposals to a bill to raise the legal limit on the federal debt - which must pass sometime before the end of March, when the current Dollars 4,145bn (Pounds 2,871bn) ceiling will be breached. But this bill, as well as legislation to extend benefits for those who have been unemployed for a long time, is expected to be passed 'clean', without extraneous amendments. President Clinton also called in his speech on Wednesday for a number of other legislative items, including gun control, tougher measures against crime, campaign finance reform, curbs on lobbyists and easier voting registration. Democratic leaders hope they can begin hearings on the reconciliation bill at the end of March and start to mark it up in detail at the end of April. The goal is to have it passed and sent to President Clinton for signature before Congress goes on holiday in August - though many congressional staffers believe they will be lucky to complete the bill before the autumn. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the leader of the House Democratic majority, is understood to want to add in to this bill the comprehensive reform of the healthcare system that Mr Clinton has promised to produce by May. Many others in Congress believe a healthcare reform package will, realistically, not be completed until next year. One fear for the package is that members of Congress could amend it to death, adding their favourite tax provisions and exemptions. The House ways and means committee, which has primary jurisdiction over tax legislation, is expected to remain relatively disciplined. Members who want to propose amendments that will cost money must simultaneously propose offsetting spending cuts to pay for them. Once it gets to the Senate, the legislation could become more difficult, even though budget rules, which are tighter than usual senate rules, allow only germane amendments. 'There are a zillion tax proposals sitting over there, many of which are plain mischievous,' a House staffer said.</p>

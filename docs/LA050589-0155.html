			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> SOME PLACES TO MUNCH BRUNCH WITH MOTHER  </P> <P> Mother's Day is almost here, and for many families, that means celebrating in  the form of a festive Sunday brunch. Hotels are always a reliable bet on  holidays, but the choice is by no means limited to them. Check to see if your  favorite restaurant is planning to open, and, if not, consider one of the  following suggestions. But remember, these brunch spots are popular enough on  normal Sundays, so make reservations as soon as possible. All are sure to be  booked solid days before the holiday.  </P> <P> If mother has sumptuous tastes, the first-class buffet brunch at the Newporter  Resort seems an obvious choice. Chef Jon Benson plans an even bigger spread  than he had at Easter, when several rooms were filled with tables groaning with  haute specialties.  </P> <P> Begin at the cold table and choose smoked tuna and salmon, carved to order, or  ethereal minceur terrines made from wild mushrooms, scallops and other luxury  items. Then proceed to the breakfast station where omelets, pasta dishes and  pancakes are cooked to order with such embellishments as caviar, chorizo, pesto  or fresh berries.  </P> <P> Hot dishes should be every bit as elaborate: Bourbon-glazed ham, beef  Wellington and Benson's wonderful stuffed chicken, near to bursting with a  mixture of chevre, spinach and wild mushrooms.  </P> <P> For those who can still eat, desserts include gateau St. Honore and golden  raspberry mousse. There's free-flowing, complimentary champagne and a strolling  Dixieland band. Seating is from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. in the Jamboree Cafe and  the patio.  </P> <P>  The Newporter Resort, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. (714) 644-1700.  Brunch is $19.95 for adults, $9.95 for children. All major cards accepted.  </P> <P> Brunch at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point is probably the county's most  expensive. The hotel offers a gorgeous natural setting, plus opulent trappings  for its Pavilion buffet. There's a classical pianist, orchid sprigs for the  ladies and a special children's table with dishes like Ovaltine porridge and  peanut blueberry muffins.  </P> <P> Come early and look around -- flowers are in bloom on the 18-acre garden  overlooking the Pacific. Then get a load of the French tapestries and crystal  chandeliers in the Ballroom where brunch is served.  </P> <P> A cold salad bar features such delicacies as Oriental carpaccio, wild mushrooms  and fresh fennel in a Chardonnay thyme vinaigrette, sliced fresh fruit with  creme fraiche, and fresh shellfish. Hot stuffed veal and beef tenderloin with  chanterelle and tarragon are carved to order. Don't miss the apple and almond  crepes in rum raisin sauce, or chef Rassinoux's wonderful mousselines. You  can't miss the centerpiece, a life-size ice carving of mother and child.  </P> <P>  The Ritz-Carlton hotel, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. (714) 240-5008.  Brunch from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., $35 per person, $18 for children 12 and under.  All major cards accepted.  </P> <P> If a lively atmosphere is what you are after, Peppers is the ticket. This  restaurant caters to singles, families and just about anybody else. This year's  special brunch features a live barbershop quartet plus a gaudy spread that  includes an eggs Benedict station, a Belgian waffle bar, made-to-order omelets,  a fajitas bar, a shrimp and ceviche bar, a fresh fruit and salad bar and, hold  your breath, a hot fudge sundae bar. The food is surprisingly good, and the  prices more than reasonable.  </P> <P>  Peppers, 12361 Chapman Ave., Plaza Alicante, Garden Grove. (714) 740-1333.  Brunch from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., $12.95 for adults, $6.95 for children. All major  cards accepted.  </P> <P> Gandhi, an upscale Indian restaurant in South Coast Village, is a  non-traditional Mother's Day alternative, but it may be just what mother would  like.  </P> <P> This is a rather formal restaurant where waiters wear tuxedos, tables are set  in linen, and the tone is quiet and understated. But there is nothing  understated about the food, which is highly spiced and almost overly rich.  </P> <P> The special prix fixe menu will include tandoori chicken (cooked in the clay  oven), lamb kabab, prawn saag (cooked with chopped spinach), chicken jalfrezi  (sauteed in butter and spices, with tomato, bell pepper and onion), and the  requisite north India vegetable dishes: eggplant with spring onion, garbanzo  beans stewed with ginger, and vegetarian pilau. Sit in the glass-enclosed  greenhouse for more exotic reflections.  </P> <P>  Gandhi, 3820 Plaza Drive Santa Ana. (714) 556-7273. Champagne brunch from  11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., $12.95 for adults, $6.60 for children under 10. All major  cards accepted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Canterra looks as if it belongs in the tropics. It's a relaxing, luxurious  restaurant with plenty of pastel colors, tropical plants and fresh flowers. It  is located in Laguna Beach's San Maarten Hotel, about as exotic a locale as one  can find in these parts, and I find it one of the area's most pleasant dining  rooms.  </P> <P> All the stops will be pulled out on Mother's Day with a lavish, sit-down brunch  including a fashion show staged by Chez Joey. Additionally, every mother will  get a complimentary family picture.  </P> <P> Chef Mark Price plans to serve dishes such as Cajun scramble, French toast  stuffed with pear puree, a toothsome linguine primavera. He also has some  surprises in store just for the occasion. There is no set price for the brunch,  but champagne will be poured free of charge.  </P> <P>  Canterra, 696 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-0162. Brunch from 10  a.m. to 3 p.m. All major cards accepted.  </P> <P>  A note from Times News Bites columnist Beverly Bush Smith:  </P> <P>  Several restaurants normally closed on Sunday mornings will be open for  Mother's Day brunch, including the Rex at Newport Pier ((714) 675-2566) and  Monique French restaurant in Laguna Beach ((714) 499-5359).  </P> <P>  And for those who would rather celebrate Mother's Day in a home setting, A'la  Carte Bistro in Huntington Beach will offer a special takeout brunch featuring  10 different items for a minimum of four hungry people, at $11.95 per person.  Dishes include a California fruit platter, seafood platter, chicken Mendocino  and Swiss fresh strawberry cake ((714) 840-8152).  </P> <P> </P></p>

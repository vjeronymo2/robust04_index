			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has called on the  Goldstone Commission to subpoena Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] member Pravin Gordhan.    The IFP said it would like him to reveal the identity of the  author of an alleged ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South  African Communist Party] document outlining a plan for the  overthrow of the kwaZulu government. The IFP said it believed  that Mr. Gordhan, a member of the SACP, had seen the document.  It alleged that a recent statement by him calling for TEC  intervention in kwaZulu was in line with the strategy set out in  the document for the destabilization of kwaZulu. Earlier, the  Goldstone Commission said it would ask the IFP for details of  the allegations to enable it to conduct a full inquiry.    Confirming that he had received a copy of the document, Mr.  Justice Goldstone said that if the IFP was unable or unwilling  to furnish the information it should indicate the action it  wanted the commission to take.</p>

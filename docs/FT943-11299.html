			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Property: The Caribbean's allure - A look at the growing accessibility of a rich man's playground The Caribbean has long been the playground of the rich. But as the cost of flights has fallen and the islands have become more developed, the possibility of buying property in the Caribbean has been opened up to larger numbers. The allure of the Caribbean, with its white sands, turquoise seas and carefree atmosphere, is such that even casual visitors are persuaded to buy holiday homes there. The range of property on offer is large: from luxurious villas offering privacy and exclusiveness, to modest apartments in resorts boasting discos and casinos. Buyers can walk into ready-furnished villas or else they can start from scratch on a plot of their own. Potential buyers can choose between bustling islands like Antigua, where it is possible to party every night, to tiny, exclusive islands which are peaceful and charming. Recluses can play the part of Robinson Crusoe by buying their own private islands. In the British Virgin Islands, for instance, Green Cay and Sandy Spit - a one-acre island rimmed by white sands and reefs - is being offered for sale by Smiths Gore at Dollars 1.7m. Property values are now back to 1984 levels having fallen 40 per cent since the boom in 1987-1989, when values were supported by an influx of money from high earners abroad. Some of the most expensive properties are not bargains, however. 'People who are not forced to sell are not prepared to drop the price,' says Fred Connell, of Smiths Gore, property consultants. Caribbean islands vary greatly in their terrains, atmosphere and languages, typically English, French and Dutch. Barbados, which ranks as one of the most sophisticated, well-established and expensive of the Caribbean islands, is the most popular for British buyers, followed by the British Virgin Islands, St Lucia and Antigua. Most potential buyers of Caribbean property want to visit a number of islands before making a decision. 'People investigating buying properties in the Caribbean take their time,' says John German, of Cluttons. He is marketing property on the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands, an English-speaking island known for its scuba diving. The Richmond Hill Estates, for example, has eight four-bedroom, three-bathroom villas for sale, half a mile from the sea, in a complex with tennis court and swimming pool for sale for Dollars 265,000 (Pounds 171,000). Beach-front property is more expensive: the asking price for a three-bedroom beach-front property is Dollars 950,000. The company is also acting for Isles Bay Plantation in Montserrat, a British colony, 27 miles south-west of Antigua. Isles Bay Planation has two remaining houses for sale, although it has additional sites awaiting development. The villas are Caribbean style, complete with verandas, shaded loggias, double-height ceilings and natural timbers. Prices ranges from Dollars 300,000 for a two-bedroom house to Dollars 695,000 for a five-bedroom house. Management charges are about Dollars 6,000 a year for looking after the houses, pools, gardens and rentals for the owners. Montserrat has just abolished exchanges controls, which will allow buyers to raise a mortgage in US dollars at far cheaper rates than Eastern Caribbean dollars. Nearby Antigua is more highly developed. The island, which was colonised in 1623 by English settlers, boasts 365 beaches and a developed tourist industry with plenty of restaurants, car hire, golf and scuba diving facilities. The building boom, which began in the mid-1980s, together with the sharp decline in the market, has left an abundance of property, at a range of prices. At the market's cheaper end, buyers could consider Jolly Harbour, on the west coast of Antigua. The project, which was developed by Dr Alfred Erhart, a Swiss entrepreneur who pioneered mass market tourism in Majorca, is one of the largest developments in the Caribbean. The 500-acre scheme, centred around a marina, comprises 500 two-bedroom terraced houses - each with a private jetty. The villas cost around Dollars 125,000; the management charge is currently Dollars 120 a month. Plots of land are for sale for hundreds more houses. Round the coast, the St James's Club village on Mamora Bay consists of 73 two-bedroom villas, set in tropical gardens with three swimming pools. Prices range from Dollars 350,000 to Dollars 475,000. Service charges are about Dollars 1,200 a month; insurance is about Dollars 2,000 dollars a year. Jumby Bay Island is an island of 300 acres two miles north of Antigua. The shortage of rain is a boon to holiday makers although it gives the place an arid appearance. Jumby Bay prides itself on its quiet exclusiveness, which is reinforced by the absence of television, radio and telephones from the island. It has 12 villas for sale at prices between Dollars 1.2m and Dollars 1.5m. Its beach-front villas are clusters of buildings around a terraced patio sheltered by a large umbrella roof. The majority of developers offer to organise rentals for purchasers, which will help them with their running costs. These are often heavy because of high local taxation and high repair and maintenance bills. 'If you want to let the property, it is best to buy near a golf course, marina or holiday cottage complex,' says Allan Lazurus, of Prime Property Services. The best chances of obtaining a letting are in the high season between November and May. But the charm of the islands should not seduce potential buyers into ignoring the possible disadvantages of buying property in the Caribbean. 'Our advice is to buy with no expectation of economic return,' says Connell. 'If you can get a holiday home to keep its value, you have done quite well.'

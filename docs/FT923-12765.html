			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Go east, honourable members - David Owen recently found the following letter in a Whitehall litter-bin, written on notepaper from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, which offers this advice to the prime minister Sir, Might we respectfully propose an answer to the problem of Canary Wharf's future that we think would produce a felicitous outcome for you, us and Britain as a whole. We believe the government should buy this luxurious and strategically located development, uproot parliament and transfer the heart of Britain's democratic process from Westminster to Docklands. It is a radical proposal, we think you will agree, but one made in the spirit of the government's own suggestion of relocating a large contingent of civil servants to east London. Allow us to enumerate the arguments we feel sure will overcome your understandable reluctance to desert the pomp and circumstance of Westminster. (You should be assured that technical wrinkles such as the need to provide adequately proportioned debating chambers would not pose a problem to the site developers.) First, cost. Not to put too fine a point on it, this unique and world-renowned complex would be available at an absolute snip. Administrators are a prime source of bargains for those with liquid resources, as your advisers will confirm. Why not act now to take advantage of what we can safely say would be a never-to-be-repeated offer? Of course, the Treasury would not be the Treasury if it did not hesitate to sanction the unbudgeted expenditure. But we are sure they can be convinced of the long term advantages of what we propose - particularly if it is intimated the development could be sold and leased back at a fat profit when the property market improves. Equally, the government should have little difficulty demonstrating it had fulfilled its undertaking to secure value for money for British taxpayers. The financial argument is particularly persuasive if you take into account certain spin-off benefits. Consider, for example, how many lobbyists and other assorted hangers-on would wish post-haste to follow the government to Docklands. There would be ample surplus space to rent to these captive clients at highly advantageous rates. Our specialists would be delighted to advise on how to exploit this opening most effectively. Meanwhile, the Palace of Westminster could be reconfigured forthwith as an admission-charging museum, complete with refreshment and leisure facilities. In truth, it is much better suited to this role than to its present function and the burger franchise alone would be worth a small fortune. A strongly-branded selection of quality products, ranging from Speaker's Choice malt whisky to House of Commons fudge, is already available on the premises, as you will be aware. Think of the revenue-generating potential of marketing these to a wider audience] It is a moot point whether the upper chamber should remain in situ to entertain visitors. With time and a little work, one section of the building - perhaps the press facilities - could be converted into a luxury hotel. Once the complex was ticking over satisfactorily, it would be a clear candidate for privatisation. This brings us to our second point: the move to Docklands would be extremely popular with MPs. At a stroke, all hard-working parliamentarians would be whisked from the cramped mock-gothic squalor in which most now toil to comfortable, state-of-the-art new offices. We need hardly remind you of the recent parliamentary early day motion (copy enclosed) recognising 'the severe restrictions the 19th century Palace of Westminster places on the provision of modern, efficient facilities for members of parliament'. This had been signed by more than 140 MPs at our last count - a sizeable protest vote by any standard. It is true the motion urges the leader of the House to 'lease additional accommodation in Westminster' (our italics). But we are confident this is because it did not occur to most honourable members that a move further afield was possible. A third consideration is that we can think of few surer ways to ensure Docklands flourishes - a happy state of affairs that could hardly fail to reflect favourably on the government. You will understand what we mean by suggesting that MPs will not be content to labour long in a new location without satisfactory local amenities. Their presence will certainly ensure that more high-class restaurateurs and trades people consider opening up in the area. In fact, what would probably happen is that sufficient advisers, observers and consultants would follow on the politicians' coat-tails to create a veritable parliamentary village in Docklands. Add a few civil servant refugees from Marsham Street and you would have the nucleus of the sort of self-contained administrative centre favoured by thrusting young nations like Brazil, Australia and Nigeria. Of course, with all these groups heading east, it would be much easier to justify picking up the entire bill for the Jubilee Line extension, as the government might well be obliged to do if it accepted our proposals. In any case, the Pounds 400m private-sector contribution originally promised would have been spread over more than 20 years and is therefore considerably less substantial than it might at first appear. It is also worth observing that a large contingent of journalists would be dependent on the extension to facilitate their commuting. Dare we suggest that favourable coverage of the change of tack might be easier to engineer under such circumstances? Finally, there is the question of prestige. It is clearly vital that an institution as valued and venerable as the British parliament should move to a suitably eminent location if it is to move at all. In this respect, Canary Wharf can scarcely be beaten: what could have more cachet, after all, than permanent stewardship of Europe's largest development? If we may permit ourselves a self-serving observation, the move also has much to recommend it on aesthetic grounds. Next to the strong, simple contours of the Canary Wharf tower, Big Ben appears spindly, ill-proportioned and distinctly over-ornate. Of course, many MPs will nevertheless have formed a sentimental attachment to the famous clock tower. Might we suggest therefore that a strategically-positioned replica could speed their settling-in We are advised that a fully functioning bell-chime could be installed in such a replica at reasonable cost. Whether this would have quite the resonance of its Westminster prototype, however, could not be guaranteed. Yours etc,</p>

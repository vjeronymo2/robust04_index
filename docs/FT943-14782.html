			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / MacGregor denies involvement in 'details' of Railtrack negotiation Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said at a meeting of the Commons employment committee yesterday that he had told members of the British Rail board on June 9 that Railtrack's 5.7 per cent interim pay offer to the RMT transport union conflicted with government guidelines. However, Mr MacGregor denied he was involved in the 'details' of negotiation. In a written memorandum to the committee, the Department of Transport said that it had been made clear to Railtrack that any increases in pay for signal workers had to be 'offset by improvements in efficiency and productivity and the package must represent value for money'. During his session with the committee Mr MacGregor said he hoped the two sides would return to negotiations and there could be an early settlement of the dispute.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Salinas and Clinton in Nafta talks PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday re-affirmed his support for the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and said he would 'immediately move' to address supplemental labour and environmental accords that he would like to attach to the trade agreement. Mr Clinton said he would soon put an official in charge of bilateral issues arising from Nafta. His repeated support for Nafta after his meeting with President Carlos Salinas in Austin, Texas - his first with a foreign leader since the election - and his desire for 'this to be wrapped up in a prompt fashion' will come as a relief to Mexico, which was looking for such a signal. The Mexican government needs the agreement approved as fast as possible, both to help the sluggish economy, and to boost public support before next year's presidential election. Mr Clinton used the opportunity to address criticism of the Nafta in the US. He said the side agreements must produce high-wage jobs on both sides of the border, and not - as had been the case with the Caribbean Initiative - reduce wages while costing the US government lost tax revenues. He said he would look to other 'models' - presumably the EC - to address the 'great disparity' of living standards between the US and Mexico. Despite the anti-Nafta chants from demonstrators, the two leaders talked about 'a new era' in US-Mexican relations. Mr Clinton said he 'looked forward to a strong partnership and close relationship' with Mr Salinas.</p>

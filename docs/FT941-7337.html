			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Labour pledged to mixed economy Mr John Smith yesterday committed a future Labour government to a mixed economy by proposing a new partnership between the public and private sectors. The Labour leader used a symposium on public and private finance to replace the party's traditional support for nationalisation and public ownership with a pledge to marry the private and public sector. He said: 'We can transcend the old battle lines and the old dogmas that have held our country and our people back. 'As well as continuing to own and to employ directly, government must take on a new role, as partner and co-ordinator, working with the private sector to secure investment and bring together the best of the public-service ethos and the strengths of private capital and entrepreneurial sprit.' Mr Smith's new policy came under fire both from both leftwingers in his party and from the government. Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington and a member of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, questioned how the new partnership would work when the important objective should be increasing employment. Ms Abbott said: 'The private sector wants to take all of the profit and none of the risk.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, welcomed Labour's 'conversion' after insisting that public service should go hand in hand with public provision. He said: 'Fifteen years after the government stamped on its tail, the message has reached the dinosaur's brain. It is time to move. It's new to Labour, but it has represented mainstream government thinking for more than a decade.' Mr Smith, who dismissed the fears of leftwingers in his party, accused the government of being blind to the opportunities of working towards a genuine partnership. He blamed the government's insistence that the Channel tunnel should be privately financed as an example of a delay in the project due to ideology. 'In Britain we don't even have a starting date for the link to London while on the French side the rail link has already been completed,' the Labour leader said. This was a wholly unnecessary price to pay for dogma and such a project was ready-made for public and private collaboration, he said. Mr Smith said Labour wanted most leading public utilities kept in the public sector but where possible there would be private-sector participation.</p>

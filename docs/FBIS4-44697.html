			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Rapeseed Oil Test in Freiburg Successful"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt--In Freiburg a field test with 29 taxi  drivers, who for two years operated their diesel taxis  exclusively with rapeseed oil and drove a total of about 2.5  million kilometers, has been successfully concluded. Model 190 D  and E Mercedes-Benz vehicles were used and about 240,000 liters  of non-estered rapeseed oil (RME).    As reported by Mercedes-Benz AG, just a few technical  problems occurred during the test. The test results are so  promising that the test series will continue with two modified  C-200 diesel taxis this year in Stuttgart.    The RME fuel was supplied by Novamont (Montedison-Ferruzi  Group). It is comparable to diesel, but is nontoxic and  biologically degradable. When it is growing rapeseed absorbs  about as much carbon dioxide as is released when burning it.  According to information by the Federal Environment Office, the  absolute carbon dioxide emission is about 35 percent below that  of a diesel-operated passenger car.    The Freiburg taxis equipped with exhaust gas recirculation  and oxidation catalysts only needed a small amount of technical  alteration, it is further said. This applied to the replacement  of elastomer hoses and seals in the fuel supply with parts made  of special rubber. Dealing with the fuel itself, however,  required a great deal of attention. Rapeseed oil turned out to  have a tendency to become contaminated, which occasionally led  to clogged injection nozzles.    But such fuels are unsuitable for widespread use. In order  for all diesel cars in the old laender to be able to drive on  RME, 56 percent of the German agricultural area would have to be  planted in oil plants. However, it is worth considering  application in consumer niches, argues Mercedes-Benz.</p>

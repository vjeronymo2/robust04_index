			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Council ordered to restore pay A COUNTY council treated 1,300 dinner ladies unfairly when it cut their pay and working conditions to compete with the private sector for school meals contracts, an industrial tribunal ruled yesterday. Backed by their union Nupe, the women argued that they had suffered discrimination by North Yorkshire County Council. Predominantly male groups of workers in other council services had won several contracts without cuts in pay and working conditions. The tribunal has ordered the council to restore the women's pay and conditions to equal those of male workers.</p>

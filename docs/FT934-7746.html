			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (8): Retailers woo black buyers - Consumers 'CHOOSE BLACK Like Me' exhorts a poster at the World Trade Centre, the Johannesburg venue for the multi-party talks. But it turns out to be addressed to the consumer rather than the voter, advertising nothing more epoch-making than a range of hair care products. Black consumers, particularly those in urban areas, are becoming the focus of the South African retail sector in recognition of the sheer size of the market and the expectation that wage differentials with whites will continue to narrow. On average a black household still has an income only one sixth of that of its white counterpart, is likely to have more offspring to support, as well as dependent members of the extended family often living in rural areas. A survey by the Bureau of Market Research at the University of South Africa shows that metropolitan blacks commit 7.5 per cent of their household expenditure to the support of relatives. This compares with only 0.2 per cent for those living in the quasi-independent 'homelands' who are more likely to be recipients of remittances from city breadwinners. Given such burdens, opportunities for discretionary spending - and for those businesses seeking to attract it - seem limited. Holidays, for example, absorb a bare 0.3 per cent of black outgoings. So, it is no surprise that the South African retail and consumer products industries have most conspicuously reorientated themselves to urban blacks in sectors such as food (which takes 20.4 per cent of their household spending), clothing and footwear (8.1 per cent), alcohol (6.5 per cent) and tobacco (4.8 per cent). Edgars, the clothing chain with nearly a fifth of all sales in its sector, now has close to half its revenues coming from blacks, according to a retail industry analyst at a stockbroking firm. Blacks now consume some 80 per cent of all lager drunk in the country, shifting away from home-brewed sorghum beer and helping the near-monopoly South African Breweries (SAB) maintain volumes. Checkers, the supermarket chain which merged with Pepcor, owner of the down-market Pep clothing shops, has converted many of its stores into cheaper-line Shoprite outlets and held prices down. Mr Mervyn Serebro, managing director of OK Bazaars, says: 'Our customer is now the emerging nation. There is no embarrassment in saying we are not in the crayfish and caviar business.' OK is targeting middle-income blacks rather than the 'fringe of affluence,' of whatever colour. All advertise extensively in black media such as the Sowetan newspaper, conscious of the need to establish their brand while there remain few black-owned companies with the capital to compete. Billboard campaigns in particular convey the imagery of egalitarian multiracial bonhomie which exists more in the minds of advertising agency creative departments than on the street, beach or bar terrace which form their backdrops. At the same time, though, some companies have pursued particular strategies to boost demand among blacks. CNA Gallo, which runs a chain of newsagent/stationers as well as cinemas and a record label, has become the largest seller of postage stamps apart from the Post Office itself. This is not because that business is itself lucrative - rather, it gets blacks coming into its stores, previously an apparent preserve of white reading matter. Malbak, an industrial group which has interests in food, pharmaceuticals, packaging, furniture and appliances, has examined each of these sectors to see where potential black demand offers scope for expansion. For example, it is placing emphasis on the supply of generic drugs which are cheaper than their proprietary equivalents - the Unisa survey shows urban black households allocate as much as 20.7 per cent of their spending to medical and dental needs. Mr Grant Thomas, chairman of Malbak, argues: 'If you look at the new South Africa, where will the money be spent? Housing, health, transport, education. If you build a house it will have at least one plug. Then look at what they want: lights, TV, fridge, cooker.' Beyond that, the family would be likely to buy packaged foods once they have a refrigerator, thus neatly covering two more of Malbak's bases. With demand for household durables such as fridges at near-saturation among whites, the source of growth for electrical goods manufacturers and retailers is clear. Rapid urbanisation following the abolition of the restrictive pass laws in the 1980s has brought around half South Africa's black population to the cities. As electrification of the townships progresses, and some residents trade up into previously white inner-city areas, black spending should help fuel a consumer-led recovery if one takes off. Baring Securities estimates that overall private consumption expenditure, which has begun to revive this year, will grow by 2 per cent in 1994 and add a percentage point each year through 1996.</p>

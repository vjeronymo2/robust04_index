The municipalities have realized that  they cannot continue to expand as they did in the late 1980's,  and the public sector has had to cut back on its bureaucracy.  But the recession has also given rise to problems -- among them  high unemployment and the still growing public debt -- that we  will leave behind us for the next generation.    That is the opinion of Pekka Parkkinen, a researcher at the  State Economic Research Institute (VATT). Parkkinen has produced  a forecast under the title "What the Generations Have Inherited  in Finland," and his view of what we will leave to coming  generations is mainly favorable. The spiral of indebtedness can  be interrupted, all the talk about a huge deficit in the pension  fund is exaggerated, and the national wealth we will leave  behind us totals far more than 1 trillion markkas.    Moreover, the next generation will have received a solid  education that, thanks to its parents, society has paid for.  Education and research are the most important things we can  bequeath, and they constitute a sector where we must not  economize, Parkkinen says.    But he refuses to call himself an optimist, claiming instead  that his view of the future is realistic. The biggest threat to  the future of the Finns is not to be found anywhere within our  country's borders. It is not the national debt or unemployment:  The threat comes from the East. Unrest in Russia is the thing  that would have the most negative influence on Finland's future.    "Our own problems we can take care of, but global problems  such as environmental pollution or widespread war are things we  cannot manage," says Parkkinen.  <H5>  Declining Debt </H5>   The foreign debt has been regarded as one of today's major  problems, but Parkkinen points out that if exports continue to  rise as they are doing now, that problem will be solved  relatively quickly in the private sector. Foreign loans will  make it worthwhile to finance investments yielding at least as  much as the interest on the foreign debt, Parkkinen believes.  But most of the foreign debt contracted by the state has been  used to finance bank subsidies, unemployment benefits, and other  public transfers of income.    And the national debt will continue to grow if economic  growth turns out to be around 2 percent per year, Parkkinen  believes. According to him, an optimal growth rate would be 4  percent, since it would then be possible to halt the growth in  the national debt by the turn of the century. Otherwise, it is  impossible to predict how long the debt will continue to rise  and how much it will rise. The debt is a problem that the next  generation will have to contend with and that it will have to  pay.    Parkkinen believes that Finland's national economy will  continue to grow satisfactorily during the rest of the 1990's.  Company profits are rising, and that in turn is leading to new  investments, which in turn create new jobs. Faith in the future  is returning, and people are gradually venturing to borrow and  to use their money again -- many people need a new home or a new  car. There will be a favorable chain reaction.  <H5>  Idle Citizens </H5>   But not even new industrial investment can create enough new  jobs. Unemployment will continue to be a problem, Parkkinen  emphasizes. We must do what we can to avoid creating a  generation that has never gotten accustomed to working -- a  group of idle citizens in society that people who work will have  to pay for.    On that subject, Parkkinen sees an opportunity in an  integrated Europe and the European Economic Area agreement. They  will give our well-educated young people a chance to enter the  Central European labor market, stay there a few years and  increase their capital, and then come home richer both  spiritually and materially a few years later. True, there is an  obvious risk that many will stay in Central Europe, but the open  labor market provides a good opportunity, he feels.    "There is no instant solution to the unemployment problems.  We will have to make further cutbacks in the public sector, and  when agriculture is slimmed down for the EU [European Union],  there will also be unemployment in that sector."  <H5>  No Pension Bomb </H5>   But even though the large age groups will gradually enter  the  pension age, and even though the public's unemployment problems  will remain, Parkkinen does not believe there is a "pension  bomb." With the national economy growing by a couple of percent  annually, there will be enough money to pay pensions, although  it means that the working population will have to pay higher  pension contributions. But wages will also be higher in the  future, he says.    What a small country like Finland must safeguard in all  situations is research and education, and in that respect,  Parkkinen believes that we have intelligent and farsighted  politicians. If we cut back too far on education and worsen its  quality, we can say good-bye to all favorable development.    One factor over which we have no control is environmental  pollution on a global scale. Parkkinen says he is not worried by  Western industrial production's influence on the environment,  but at a time when the industrialized countries are reducing  their discharges of pollutants, discharges of "greenhouse  gases," for example, are increasing in the Third World.    "Each generation leaves behind an environment that is poorer  in natural resources than it was before, and what we have right  now is a steadily deteriorating environment."    Parkkinen points out, however, that he feels that Finnish  ecology is well managed. He feels that globally, reducing  environmental problems will require a kind of development aid  for the environment.    Pekka Parkkinen's view of the future we will bequeath to the  next generation is rather positive. He says, however, that the  farther into the future one tries to see, the harder it becomes.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS LOSE LEAD AND GAME TO BENGALS;  </P> <P> AFC: ESIASON'S THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES HELP CINCINNATI COME BACK FROM A 13-0  DEFICIT AND WIN, 21-16.  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers lost another close one Sunday, falling, 21-16, to the  Cincinnati Bengals before 48,098 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> The Chargers' last 14 games have been decided by seven or fewer points, with 10  ending in defeat.  </P> <P> "It's like reaching for that stick so you don't fall off the cliff, and then  someone moves the stick away from you," Charger safety Vencie Glenn said.  </P> <P> The Chargers squandered a 14-10 fourth-quarter lead a week ago to lose to  Dallas, 17-10, and then Sunday had a 16-14 edge go by the wayside down the  stretch.  </P> <P> The Bengals (2-0), known not so long ago in their own right as a bungling  fourth-quarter outfit, got three touchdown passes from Boomer Esiason, with the  third completing the come-from-behind victory.  </P> <P> A 10-yard scoring pass to James Brooks early in the second quarter cut a 13-0  San Diego lead to 13-7, and a 30-yard scoring pass to Eddie Brown just before  haltime made it 16-14.  </P> <P> Then a questionable touchdown pass to Brown from 23 yards out less than three  minutes into the fourth quarter gave the Bengals the victory.  </P> <P> "It was one of those games where we were going to find out if we could win,"  Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche said. "It was a game of big plays, and Eddie Brown  is a name that jumps out at you when you think of big plays."  </P> <P> Brown caught 10 passes for 178 yards, including his disputed 23-yard touchdown  reception on third down and 20 with 12:08 to play. Brown maneuvered his way  behind cornerback Donald Frank and appeared to push off the rookie just before  falling back to make the winning catch.  </P> <P> "They called interference on us," Coach Dan Henning said. "Some of our players  came off saying it was the other way around, but that's the way it goes."  </P> <P> The Bengals' first score was to a wide open Brooks, the former Charger running  back, who was supposed to be covered by Byrd. Byrd was also on the coverage  when Brown hauled in Esiason's 30-yard touchdown pass later in the second  quarter.  </P> <P> "I was playing soft out there, I was just flopping around the field like I was  in another world," said Byrd, who had an interception -- his career 26th -- to  move into second place on the team's all-time list. "I should have made that  play on the ball to Brown; it cost us."  </P> <P> The Chargers' popgun offense, which has scored more than 30 points but once in  its last 43 games, jumped out to a 13-0 first-quarter lead.  </P> <P> Billy Joe Tolliver, who was starting in place of Mark Vlasic, hit Plan B  acquisition Ronnie Harmon for a 36-yard touchdown pass play on the team's first  offensive series. After an Esiason pass was intercepted, the first of three,  Tolliver went 17 yards to fourth-year H-back Joe Caravello for Caravello's  first NFL touchdown.  </P> <P> On the extra-point try, however, defensive lineman George Hinkle was penalized  for illegal use of the hands. After being pushed back 15 yards, Fuad Reveiz's  try for the extra point was blocked by James Francis.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 4 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of  the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Goran Percevic, said  on Saturday that SPS is willing to open a dialogue with the  representatives of ethnic Albanian parties from Serbia's Kosovo  province on condition that they recognize the integrity of  Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    Even our most bitter enemies in the world and the fiercest  opponents of the Serbian national interests do not question  Yugoslavia's integrity and the Albanian alternative should be  aware that this issue is not negotiable, Percevic told the radio  of Jagodina, town in central Serbia.    A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades  been active in Kosovo. The separatists have illegally  proclaimed the `Kosovo Republic' and advocate its secession from  Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation with neighbouring Albania.    Underscoring that the offer for a dialogue has remained open  for some time, but that the ethnic Albanian parties are  rejecting it, Percevic said that in the end they will have to  accept it because they are also becoming aware that `their aim  -- an independent Republic of Kosovo -- cannot be realized.'    British minister of state at the Foreign Office, Douglas  Hogg, who was recently in Kosovo, also told the ethnic  Albanians, national minority in Serbia and Yugoslavia, that they  cannot count on their own state.    We had political contacts with some political parties from  Albania but not with ethnic Albanian parties in Serbia which  rally most members of this minority, simply because they refuse  a dialogue with the legal Serbian and Yugoslav authorities,  Percevic said.    Commenting persecution claims by ethnic Albanians, Percevic  said that the `representatives of the Albanian minority are  intentionally boycotting the rights they have been granted by  this country's consititution with the aim of convincing the  world to the contrary.'</p>

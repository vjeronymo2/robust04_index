			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Managment: Moving out of apartheid's shadow I was in the new South Africa last week talking to human resources directors, consultants and managers. All labelled themselves as 'pale males', whose jobs and futures are threatened by new affirmative action initiatives. Apartheid, always a pigment of the imagination, casts a long shadow in the business world of this beautiful country. Many are worried by the prospects of legislation that would make organisations reflect the demographic status of society. In other words, about 75 per cent of all staff at all levels should be black. There is talk everywhere of 'Africanisation', although what this means is rather unclear. The word Eurocentric is used pejoratively to dismiss any idea or activity that is not favoured and is seen to be the practice of the 'white minority racist regime'. Yet the American-originated concepts of victimisation, entitlement, affirmative action and the equality of results (not opportunities or inputs) are embraced with open arms. There is an obsession with the redistribution of poverty. In so many spheres Mandela has shown an excellent example by letting go of the baggage of the past. But the expectations of those who voted for him were fanned by prospective parliamentarians and could never be fulfilled. Political and organisational leaders find themselves in a dilemma. Support affirmative action publicly and the skilled whites the economy desperately needs continue to emigrate, believing there will be less of a future for themselves and their children. Let the 'disadvantaged of the past' remain underdogs and the inflated expectations of the blacks might lead to more revolution. It all seems rather a no-win situation. Some organisations try to compromise by giving 'glass-ceilinged' pale males a hefty financial reward for promoting a young black manager over him or her as second prize. But only the most successful can afford this strategy. One of the big problems in the new South Africa is the whole process of consultation. The country moved from paucity to plethora; from authoritarian diktat with no consultation at any level to a proliferation of forums where everyone can, must and does have their say however mundane, repetitive or ill-informed. No manager dare not let a representative have his/her say. This can lead to a whole series of problems. Many managers feel intimidated enough to abdicate their responsibility for decisions and allow majority rule to prevail. Accountability is thus diffused and unfocused because the rules of participation and responsibility are never spelled out. But the most notable result is that all decision-making processes are long and tedious and satisfy no one. The old South African government was spectacularly successful at creating decision-making structures of Byzantine complexity. Parliaments, boards, committees multiplied, often to the advantage of those that sat on them. Obtaining an approval in the old system was a nightmare because of the sheer complicated nature of the government structures. Alas, not only did business organisations mirror this love of complexity but the new masters, rather than sweeping the state clear have only added to it. People from all persuasions are aware of the fact that entanglement in bureaucratic niceties can be an excellent ploy to hide real issues and promote the status quo. This is not the slash-and-burn approach of revolutionaries nor the work of right-sizing, re-engineering. It remains the analysis-paralysis approach which may work well when one is dealing with constitutions, but is less well suited to the world of making widgets. As always in times of great change, people's time perspective shifts from the long to the short term. For years, informed South African business leaders were filled with a sense of impermanence and discontinuity. Trapped between the powerful forces of Afrikaaner hegemony and Black African nationalism, English-speaking whites and many Indian entrepreneurs simply kept their heads down and tried to make money. . .and get it out of the country. The short-term 'let's-live for the day' philosophies still prevail in the 'wait-and- see' period. But business needs to invest in, and build for a future which involves a significant cultural shift. There is a saying in Afrikaans which directly translated means 'tomorrow is another day'. It is usually regarded as a statement of optimism about the future, looking forward to the possibility of a new start. There is a lot of business optimism in South Africa. But like all big political and economic metamorphoses it takes time and effort. The economic situation of eastern Europe is a reasonable parallel. In the words of the prime minister 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working.' The author is head of the business psychology unit at University College London.</p>

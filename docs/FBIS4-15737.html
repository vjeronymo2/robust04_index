			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov and Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Boris </F> Yeltsin Will Be Doing His Job in Spain, Not Visiting the Doctor"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Russian president's first official  visit to Spain will be brief, businesslike, and with a  relatively small delegation -- the foreign minister and the  minister of foreign economic relations.    Yeltsin's main tasks are to reinforce the political mutual  understanding between our countries and to get economic  cooperation moving. He will meet with King Juan Carlos and  Premier Felipe Gonzalez and will sign the Treaty of Friendship  and Cooperation that was initialed in Moscow back in April 1992.    But this relates to the political side of the visit; as for  economic relations, these will boil down to the expression of  good intentions. According to every indicator, the level of  mutual trade -- which was not distinguished by any great  achievements in any case -- simply collapsed last year. Russian  exports were almost entirely made up of raw materials, and sales  of machinery and equipment fell. At the same time, Russian  imports from Spain -- with foodstuffs predominant -- almost  doubled. Over the past year trade turnover between our  countries has fallen 46 percent.    According to the Russian delegation members, Boris Yeltsin  will not be raising the question of "unfreezing" the unused part  of the $1.5-billion Spanish loan granted to the USSR in 1990.  By early 1993 Moscow had not repaid its debt on the half of  this sum that has already been "consumed." Moreover, the  Spanish Government has no spare cash. So in practice Oleg  Davydov, minister of foreign economic relations, has very little  room for maneuver on achieving a breakthrough in the development  of trade relations with Spain.    On other point: The Russian president, contrary to the  considerable speculation about his health, will not be  undergoing medical treatment at the Barcelona hospital where he  underwent an operation in 1990. He will not even be visiting  it. But Yeltsin will meet at his residence with the doctors who  treated him.</p>

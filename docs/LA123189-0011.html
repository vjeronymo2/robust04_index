			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT THE TOP MOVIES  </P> <P> If your selection of the best movies is any indication, the 1980s was a  depressing decade indeed.  </P> <P> The best films in the 1980s emphasized brutal, cold-blooded violence and sexual  perversion ("Blue Velvet," "Once Upon a Time in America," "Prizzi's Honor"),  marital turmoil ("War of the Roses," "Shoot the Moon"), drug abuse ("Drugstore  Cowboy"), child degeneration ("Pixote" -- about a 10-year-old pimp, drug user  and murderer) and even offered a bleak look at the future ("Brazil," "The Road  Warrior" and "Blade Runner").  </P> <P> Hopefully, movies in the 1990s will be a little more uplifting.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Eight pits under lease to reopen Private-sector companies are to reopen up to eight of the 28 collieries which have been offered for leasing by British Coal in the past year. Final hopes for resuming mining at two pits died yesterday when British Coal said there had been no bids for Frickley in South Yorkshire and Littleton in Staffordshire. The corporation said it had received tenders from companies wishing to operate Hatfield, South Yorkshire, and Silverdale, Staffordshire, the other pits in the last batch of four which were put to tender. Clipstone in Nottinghamshire has been handed to RJB Mining. Negotiations continue on granting licences for Betws, south Wales, to a buy-out team, and for Rossington and Markham Main in the Yorkshire area to RJB Mining and Coal Investments respectively.

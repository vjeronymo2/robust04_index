			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Two move to invest in Save &amp; Prosper Fund management group Save &amp; Prosper has two new board members, Mark White (right), who moves from within the Robert Fleming Group, and Steen Steincke who was previously with Hafnia, the Danish insurer whose parent company went into receivership last August. White returns to the UK after seven years in Hong Kong, to replace 52-year-old Simon Walters as investment director in charge of the fund management performance of Save &amp; Prosper. Walters in turn goes back to Hong Kong where he prefers living, to become head of international investment operations at Jardine Fleming. Both Jardine Fleming and Save &amp; Prosper are subsidiaries of the Robert Fleming Group. Just 37, White joined Flemings from Oxford in 1976 as an analyst. Latterly a director of Jardine Fleming Holdings and Jardine Fleming Investment Management, White was also chairman of the Hong Kong Unit Trust Association. Paul Bateman, S&amp;P's chief executive, said it was appropriate at this stage of his career for him to return to a UK-based job. Save &amp; Prosper has long had the reputation of being a slumbering giant, although Walters was able to achieve some improvement in investment performance. Meanwhile Steincke, a 44-year-old Dane who speaks six languages, joins in the newly created role of director of European retail operations. The job had previously been included in Bateman's remit; the creation of a separate role reflects the growing importance of the Continent - principally France, Luxembourg and Spain - to Flemings. Bateman says that Steincke had been looking for a job with a European perspective which he had missed in his last assignment as chief executive of Hafnia Holdings UK. The group says Hafnia's fate was not relevant to the decision to hire him, and that Steincke had an impressive previous track record. Between 1986-1990 Steincke was president of Hafnia Bank in Copenhagen before moving to London to become managing director of Prolific Financial Management in London. Hafnia has now sold the Prolific life insurance operation to Scottish Provident.</p>

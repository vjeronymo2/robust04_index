			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, February 16 (XINHUA) -- French Senate  president Rene Monory today expressed the hope that Paris and  Beijing will further develop their equal and mutually beneficial  cooperation in politics, economy, science, and culture.    In an interview with XINHUA, Monory, who will pay an  official  visit to China on February 22-27, said that his trip will aim to  "further improve our relations, especially economic, financial,  and political, which have now entered an active and positive  phase."    Monory will be the first French Senate president to visit  China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30  years ago.    Noting that he had recently met with Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur on Franco-Chinese relations, Monory stressed that "the  french government has declared that there will be no more arms  sales to Taiwan," and that this expresses "the government's  intention to develop friendly economic and political ties with  China."    He added that he fully supports the government's position.    Monory said that France, as a major European country, should  play an active role in promoting political and economic ties  between China and Western Europe.    Monory said he believes there is great potential for  Franco-Chinese cooperation, and China's rapid economic growth is  also in the interest of Europe.    He said he will attempt to give medium and small enterprises  in France a full picture of China's opening policy and economic  situations after his return in order to expand bilateral  cooperation beyond large enterprises and big projects.    Monory visited China in 1988 when he was the French minister  of national education.</p>

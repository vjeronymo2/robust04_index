			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Your lapses are their profits . . .  -If you're baffled by life policy surrender values, so was the Office of Fair Trading One of the continuing great mysteries for Mr and Ms Policyholder has been how to calculate how much cash will be returned if an insurance policy is cashed in early. While there are no official figures on how many policies might fall into this category, data prepared for securities' regulators two years ago suggest that one-quarter to one-third of all policies are cashed in during the first two years alone. The Office of Fair Trading says its own information suggests that the policies most likely to lapse before maturity are unit-linked and sold by direct sales forces, while those least likely are with-profits policies sold through independent financial advisers. This week, the OFT released results of a study aimed at taking some of the mystery out of early surrenders. Aided by an actuarial consultant, Alexander Clay and Partners, it looked at how 60 of the UK's largest life insurers treat their customers. It found that a number of companies actually profit from early lapse rates - and that many people holding policies with companies that have relatively high lapse rates are actually worse off than if they had no policy at all. The OFT concluded: 'On the basis of assumptions about lapse rates and projections of surrender and maturity values, the policyholders of some companies appear to receive average rates of return which are no more than marginally positive, or even negative.' The OFT noted that the reason for there being mystery about surrender values was because life insurers had never been required to disclose them. From January, new rules - urged by the OFT - will help to remedy that. The data compiled by the OFT shows huge differences in surrender values: On a 10-year with-profits policy paying Pounds 50 a month, Equitable Life will return 98 per cent of actual premiums if surrender takes place in the first year, and 113 per cent - if policy is surrendered in year five. If you add in notional investment income to the premiums, as we have done in the tables, the figures are still a respectable 94 per cent. On exactly the same type of policy, Royal Life pays nothing if surrender occurs in the first year and only 75 per cent of premiums for a policy surrendered in year five. For a 25-year, unit-linked policy paying Pounds 50 a month, TSB Life returns 43 per cent of all premiums paid if surrendered in year one, and 93 per cent if surrender occurs in the fifth. Allied Dunbar returns zero per cent of premiums if surrendered in years one or two, and only 50 per cent if surrender occurs in year five. The OFT study also attempts to explode one of the great myths of life industry advertising. This has placed great emphasis on the final maturity values of long-term policies. Financial publications also tend to give these figures. Moreover, some companies pay very low surrender values in early years but deliberately tilt their policies to give the greatest bonus in the final year, effectively propelling them to the top of the league tables. The OFT argues, however, that because the vast majority of clients are unlikely to hold their policies to maturity, it would be more helpful to look at each company's weighted average rate of return (WARR). And policyholders whose company is at the top of the final maturity value league table may find that the WARR is actually less attractive than that of competing providers. The OFT prepared tables showing how this works. It identifies two companies, Company H and Company L (each of which is a composite of three) and demonstrates how they treat customers with a 10-year policy. By adding a five per cent maturity bonus, Company L comes top of the league table with a final value of Pounds 7,690. But for policies surrendered in year one, Company L pays nothing while Company H offers a refund of Pounds 343. In year two, Company L pays Pounds 532 while Company H pays nearly twice that, at Pounds 957. In fact, in nine of the 10 years of the policy, Company H is the better bet, a fact which never shows up in the league tables at all. Moreover, the OFT said, the idea that unit-linked policyholders could understand readily the surrender values of their policies simply by reading the product literature was quite false. John Mills, head of the OFT's consumer policy division, added: 'These things are not only obscure to the average consumer but to the informed consumer as well.' The OFT, in attempting to compare the charges on unit-linked policies, found that companies used so many different mechanisms that it was almost impossible to judge one against the other. It discovered that nine of 42 used a 'reduced allocation' in early years, while eight had a device called 'capital units' upon which management fees of three to four per cent were levied. One company reduced investment returns for early leavers, one set penalties on premiums outstanding, and six had cut both allocations of units and investment returns. All tables based on OFT statistics. Total premiums of Pounds 3,625 include Pounds 625 of accumulated interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 year unit-linked plans: Pounds 50 a month  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   End of   Accum'd   Effect of   Surrender   Surrender Life office         year  premiums     charges     penalty       value                             Pounds      Pounds      Pounds      Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average results  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1       624         222         198         204                        2     1,295         308         184         803                        3     2,016         396         151       1,469                        4     2,792         498         132       2,162                        5     3,625         610         106       2,909  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Maximum surrender values  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life         1       624          35           1         588 Equitable Life         2     1,295          79           0       1,216 Equitable Life         3     2,016         128           2       1,886 Equitable Life         4     2,792         188           3       2,601 Equitable Life         5     3,625         255           6       3,364  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum surrender values  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Several offices)      1       624         300         324           0 Confederation Life     2     1,295         439         856           0 Axa Equity &amp;

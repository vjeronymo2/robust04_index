			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / An enigma behind the UK recovery The old proverb says that every grey cloud has a silver lining. The British, however, are good at seeing the grey lining around every silver cloud. There is thus a resistance to seeing how good the recent economic news has been in a recession-beset world. For instance, the surprise October fall in the retail prices index took the index so far below what was expected that it has given a downward push to the inflation trend. Students of the inflation process must get used to three inflation measures. There is the 'headline' RPI rate, heavily distorted by the timing of mortgage rate changes and which now stands at the unrealistically low rate of 1.4 per cent, year on year. Then there is the official measure of the underlying RPI rate, which excludes mortgage interest and stands at 2.8 per cent. Finally there is the core rate which attempts to remove other temporary disturbances, such as those caused by indirect tax changes. How to measure the core is controversial. But an estimate by Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers puts it at 2.8 per cent too. Taking into account the increases in value added tax in the pipeline and assuming a further small increase in excise duties, Saunders expects the underlying rate to rise briefly next summer to a couple of decimal points above the official 4 per cent target ceiling; but he expects the core rate not to rise much above 3 per cent. This downward pressure on prices reflects a more competitive atmosphere than that normally brought about by a slack economy. The RPI indices are supported by pay settlements, which are the lowest since the Confederation of British Industry databank started in 1977. Earnings increases due to third-quarter pay awards in manufacturing are estimated at 2.3 per cent. In services they are 2.8 per cent, a fall from the previous quarter. The CBI estimates are corroborated by official figures showing recorded earnings increases for September down to 3 per cent. UK pay per unit of output is actually down on a year ago compared with 6 per cent increases in both Japan and Germany. Only the US is increasing its competitiveness more rapidly than the UK. To cap it all, lower inflation has been accompanied - contrary to what might be expected at this stage of the cycle - by falling unemployment. The number out of work peaked in January at 10.6 per cent, and has since fallen by 0.4 percentage points, the fall now spreading for the first time to the long-term jobless. The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, will be free to argue in his Budget next week either that the economy is now doing so well he can avoid a tax increase, or that it is strong enough to withstand such an increase. But having celebrated the good news, an economic analyst should want to dig deeper. In particular, he should ask about the present upturn; is it vigorous enough to reduce the gap between actual and potential output? Or is it so feeble that the gap is getting larger and depression intensifying? Official output figures still suggest the latter. Non-oil gross domestic product rose by well under 2 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1993. This is below the most conservative estimate of the growth of capacity and fits in with the popular impression of a modest and patchy recovery. How can this be reconciled with falling unemployment and rapidly rising productivity? The most optimistic explanation is that the upturn is stronger than realised. The pessimistic explanation is that productivity gains are being overstated because of inadequate allowance, for instance, for the increasing numbers of part-time workers. It will be some time before there is enough data for a full explanation. The fact that unused capacity, as measured by the CBI survey, is declining along with unemployment, makes it look as if there is a genuine reduction in the margin of slack. The best guess is that the productivity of workers using existing capacity is indeed increasing rapidly, but at the same time there is inadequate capacity to support a true recovery. In other words, capacity shortages will recur while there are still large resources of unused labour. Some industrialists will want, in conjunction with the Labour party, to fix the capacity problem by government hand-outs for investment, a 'business plan for Britain' and so on. A more reflective person would look at the inhibitions discouraging businessmen from extending capacity, as distinct from just making it more cost saving. The remedy probably lies in still more flexible labour markets, plus more topping up of social security payments to workers of low earning capacity. Low pay and some dole are better than no pay and no work.</p>

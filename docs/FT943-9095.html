			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Airlines face dogfight over new staff contracts The Japanese Transport Ministry is threatening a confrontation with the country's airlines over their plans to hire most new flight attendants on short-term contracts at sharply lower wage levels. The airlines, pushed into losses by the domestic recession, the high yen and a worldwide decline in demand for first and business class seats, are anxious to cut costs. In the past few years they have stepped up recruitment of foreign cabin crew, who are commonly paid a fraction of what their Japanese colleagues earn. Now they aim to hire Japanese, largely for domestic routes, who would be paid by the hour and could not expect to earn more than a third of the salary paid to their colleagues. The move is a further erosion of Japan's system of lifetime employment. The contract staff who, although described as part-timers would usually work a full week, could be shed and rehired as traffic demands. Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said after a cabinet meeting yesterday that co-operation between regular cabin crew and the contract recruits could be disrupted during an in-flight emergency. He said the airlines should rather look for savings among ground staff and warned the ministry could retaliate, for example by refusing applications to open new routes. Mr Michihiko Matsuo, the ministry's top civil servant, sought to dilute his warning, saying the ministry could not regulate employment at airlines and did not intervene in labour issues. By invoking the issue of onboard safety, Mr Kamei has distressed the airline industry. Japan Airlines said yesterday: 'Our plans to employ part-time stewardesses pay very close attention to safety and security. We will study any recommendation from the ministry.' JAL has begun advertising for what it says would be an initial 100 contract flight attendants - all women - who would be based in Japan and would serve domestic routes. This number would eventually rise. The airline has some 6,000 full-time Japanese cabin attendants, but hopes to reduce these to 4,600 by 1998 in a drive to cut its total staff to 17,000 from a level of nearly 22,000. Japan moved further yesterday towards deregulating its domestic rice market when a government advisory council called for a wartime law controlling production and distribution of the staple to be scrapped. The government is expected to accept the broad findings of the Agricultural Policy Council.</p>

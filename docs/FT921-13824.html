			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Trial by committee: Ivo Dawnay on the work of the Commons select committees There have been times this week when it has seemed as if the political clamour in the House of Commons was being reduced to a sideshow by events elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster. Twice the battle of party leaders across the dispatch box had to compete on the TV news with dramas in Commons committee rooms: on Monday, the eloquent silence of the sons of the late Robert Maxwell before the social security committee, which had called them to testify on missing pension money; and on Wednesday, allegations of government skulduggery surrounding the Iraqi 'supergun' affair. More and more, it seems, parliament's all-party select committees are moving from the margins of politics to the mainstream. Yet how genuinely powerful are these newly-prominent backbench scrutineers of government? Are they as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, suggested last month, a waste of time and money, serving largely as publicity vehicles for second-rate MPs jealous of ministerial power? Or are the select committees - boosted by television - steadily extending their reach to become a newly significant organism in Britain's political ecology? Enhancing parliament's role as a watchdog was certainly the intention of Lord St John of Fawsley when as Leader of the Commons (and Mr Norman St John Stevas) in 1979 he created a new, comprehensive network of 14 select committees - for the first time specifically linked to the work of government departments, and empowered to call for 'persons and papers' including civil servants and ministers. Lord St John insists today on describing this as 'one of the greatest constitutional changes this century'. Yet even he admits that the performance of the select committees leaves something to be desired. Some committees stand accused of failing to make maximum use of the powers at their disposal. Many MPs also acknowledge that the adversarial nature of parliamentary debate, the role of party whips, and the lure of ministerial office have all hampered the development of a fully effective system of scrutiny by committee. Nevertheless, most MPs would also argue that there has been significant progress during the 11 years that the committees have been functioning. They have, for one thing, unearthed huge amounts of hitherto undisclosed information. The committees have gained in authority, educating their members on issues and increasing the quality of debate on the Commons floor. Furthermore, their two-hour interrogations - far more rigorous than pro forma question-time skirmishes - can pose a genuinely daunting challenge to ministers. In 1983-84, the committees produced 73 reports. Two years later Mrs Margaret Thatcher reported that 150 of their recommendations in a single session had been acted on. Last year, the number of reports had doubled to 150. The audacity of committees is also growing, their defenders claim. Despite their built-in government majorities, some committees have recently taken stands at embarrassing variance with Conservative policy. Last year the Treasury committee called for government action to stimulate the economy - at a time when the chancellor was arguing that no such action was needed - while the defence committee was strongly critical of the reasoning behind the government's Options for Change defence review. Added to this, Mr Michael Ryle, a former clerk of committees, says the committees have broadened the range of parliament's concerns, given a new platform to well informed pressure groups and steadily eroded MPs natural deference to government. 'Ten years ago this close to an election, the committees would have dropped anything controversial,' he said. If that is the positive side of the balance-sheet, critics of the committees are more than ready to point up their failings. The investigation into the Westland scandal in 1986, for example, vividly illustrated the limits on the power of committee inquiries when faced with government stonewalling. Even in a case often cited as a committee success - the investigation of 'sweeteners' allowed by the government to encourage British Aerospace to acquire a stake in Rover, the car-maker - the main evidence was revealed first in a leak to The Guardian. An earlier inquest had failed to uncover the scandal and even the trade committee's critical final report was toned down under pressure from its Tory majority. The committees have often been susceptible to pressure from government whips, notwithstanding protestations to the contrary from the whips themselves. Mr Nicholas Winterton, health committee chairman and a thorn in the government's flesh, owes his job entirely to the support of Labour committee members and an Ulster unionist; his Tory colleagues all voted loyally at the last committee election in 1987 for the whips' candidate, Sir David Price. This illustrates a more general problem, stemming from parliament's conformist traditions. Mr Brian Sedgemore, the left-wing Labour MP who serves on the Treasury committee, complains that members who display independence of spirit are frequently dismissed as 'mavericks', 'obsessed' or 'over the top'. As a result of this and of the limited time at committee members' disposal, he claims, committees often voluntarily circumscribe their activities. He cites the Treasury committee's inquiry into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International: 'BCCI is an example of a case where you should be questioning lawyers, ministers and the governor of the Bank of England for days on end. In fact, you get a few minutes.' Other Treasury committee members, such as Mr Terence Higgins, the chairman, argue that Mr Sedgemore is mistakenly comparing the UK system with the more powerful US congressional committees whose influence - especially their rights to initiate legislation - enormously increase their leverage on the executive. The separation of powers in the US - with departmental responsibilities divorced from Congress - means that party political hostilities are often submerged in the shared struggle with the executive. Many MPs stress that the real strengths and weaknesses of committees depend on the quality of their chairmen. While Mr Higgins, of the Treasury committee, Mr Frank Field of social security and Mr Winterton are admired, there are many others regarded as mere government placemen. So how might the committees' work be improved? If a self-congratulatory report produced by the Commons Procedure Committee last year is to be believed, no significant changes are needed - a conclusion described by Lord St John as 'extremely feeble'. Mr Graham Allen, a Labour dissenter from the report and rare advocate of radical change, believes that there must be free, secret-ballot elections of committee members by MPs - freeing them from the whips. Other proposals include substantially increased financial and research resources and salary payments to members; this might create an incentive for MPs to make a career in government scrutiny as opposed to government itself. Perhaps the real problem goes deeper - to the 'poverty of aspirations' of the British parliament as a watchdog. The teeth are there, but the readiness to bite is lacking. As Lord St John put it this week: 'The trouble with British politicians of all parties is that they are the most conservative people in the world.'</p>

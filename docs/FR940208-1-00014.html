			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 specifies that SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission rates for fuel combustion sources should be calculated based on emission factors published in AP&hyph;42, ``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors.'' If compliance is to be determined through fuel sampling and analysis, USEPA prefers that SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions be calculated under the assumption that 100 percent of the fuel sulfur content will be emitted from the facility as SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The factors given in AP&hyph;42, however, are acceptable. 326 IAC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 7&hyph;2 also allows IDEM's Commissioner to approve alternate SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  emission factors based on sulfur dioxide measurements, but the rule does not specify the rigorous scientific support required, or that the alternate emission factors will be included in site-specific SIP revisions. Therefore, this rule cannot be approved. For compliance determinations, USEPA cannot allow the Commissioner to have blanket authority to accept emission factors other than the generally applicable factors given in AP&hyph;42 for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  emission calculations from fuel sampling data. To be approvable, 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 must set forth any site-specific alternative emission factors allowed by the State, and the State must compile sufficient technical support for the use of those emission factors. Additional site-specific emission factors should not be allowed except through site-specific SIP revisions, which must support the alternate emission factors with data from a series of emission tests and provide for periodic reverification of the emission factors' accuracy. In any case, 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 should also clearly state the approved emission factors and formulae to be used in calculating SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  emission rates from fuel analysis data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 326 IAC 7&hyph;3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 326 IAC 7&hyph;3 requires that sources with total actual emissions of SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  greater than 10,000 tons per year install and operate ambient SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  monitors. The rule gives IDEM's Commissioner discretionary authority to grant waivers of all or part of the requirements of this rule. While the rule provides a set of criteria for reviewing these petitions, the rule should also require that monitoring data be provided in order to justify the waiver of requirements for further monitoring. The rule should also provide for USEPA review of any waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 326 IAC 7&hyph;4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 326 IAC 7&hyph;4 sets forth facility-specific SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission limitations and recordkeeping requirements for Lake, Marion, Vigo, Wayne, LaPorte, Jefferson, Sullivan, Vermillion, Floyd, Warrick, Morgan, Gibson, Dearborn, and Porter Counties. The January 11, 1991 submittal contains minor revisions to 326 IAC 7&hyph;4, which primarily consist of the removal of outdated interim compliance dates for various sources. The rule also reflects facility name changes that have occurred recently. However, in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;1(c)(10), the emission limits for Inland Steel in Lake County have been relaxed. Similarly, the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission limits for Bethlehem Steel in Porter County have been relaxed in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;14(1)(C). In the case of Inland Steel, which is located in an area currently designated as nonattainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , section 193 of the Clean Air Act precludes approval of this SIP revision. Section 193, the general savings clause, states that no SIP requirements in effect in a nonattainment area before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 may be relaxed unless equivalent or greater emission reductions are made. No emission reductions offsetting the Inland Steel relaxation have been identified by the State. Both the Inland Steel and the Bethlehem Steel relaxations are affected by section 110(l) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits USEPA from approving a SIP revision if the revision would interfere with attainment. The USEPA can approve a SIP revision containing relaxations to existing emission limitations only if the State provides a modeled attainment demonstration performed according to USEPA guidelines to show that the relaxed limits will continue to protect the NAAQS. No information has been submitted to USEPA in support of the relaxed emission limitations for Inland Steel or Bethlehem Steel. Therefore, 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;1(c)(10) and 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;14(1)(C) cannot be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Enforceability: ``Commissioner's Discretion''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rules containing ``Commissioner's discretion'' language allow IDEM's Commissioner to remove or modify federally enforceable requirements and restrictions for individual facilities. ``Commissioner's discretion'' language is found in 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, 3&hyph;3, 7&hyph;2, and 7&hyph;3. Such language is unacceptable because it does not provide for USEPA review of rule modifications or exemptions made after USEPA's approval of the original rule. Modifications to SIP rules may affect an area's attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, and may compromise the federal enforceability of the SIP limits. In order for ``Commissioner's discretion'' language to be approvable, any subsequent rule modifications made by the Commissioner must not hamper the SIP's enforceability or ability to assure the protection and maintenance of the standards. The USEPA may approve the rule if it provides that any modifications will be submitted to USEPA as SIP revisions, or if the rule explicitly states the criteria which the Commissioner will use to evaluate any requests for rule modifications or exemptions. Without such provisions, USEPA cannot be certain that each facility subject to the original rule will comply with all of the rule's requirements. Therefore, rules containing ``Commissioner's discretion'' language without either federally approved criteria for the expected modifications or provisions for USEPA review of the modifications cannot be approved and incorporated into the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The USEPA is proposing to disapprove Indiana's January 11, 1991 submittal. The rules do not couple the general SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission limits with compliance methods or averaging times adequate to ensure continuous compliance and maintenance of the NAAQS. 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, 3&hyph;3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 7&hyph;2, and 7&hyph;3 contain ``Commissioner's discretion'' language, which could hamper USEPA's ability to enforce the State rules. 326 IAC 3&hyph;2.1 fails to properly cite the acceptable methodologies for source emission testing. 326 IAC 7&hyph;4 contains emission limits which are less stringent than the previously approved limits, and the January 11, 1991 submittal failed to show that the relaxations continue to protect the NAAQS. Because of these deficiencies, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the January 11, 1991 submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

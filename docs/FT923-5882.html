			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally helps share prices A CALMER session in the foreign exchange markets provided the opportunity for a greatly welcomed technical rally in UK shares yesterday. Although gains were trimmed at the close when sterling began to soften against the D-Mark, the London market shared fully in the recovery in stock markets across Europe. Fund managers bought back a little of the stock sold on Tuesday and the session was enlivened by some basket trading - selling of stock index futures and purchasing of blue chip stocks - after traders sensed that a big US investment bank was buying the Footsie future contract. The day's gain of 26.6 left the FT-SE at 2,311.6, six points below the day's best level. Earlier, the index bounced satisfactorily off 2,300.5, after a firm opening, helped by an easier trend in London money rates, had brought out a few profit-takers. The cautious revival of confidence was encouraged by the jump of more than 1,000 points in the Nikkei Average and by a sounder performance from Wall Street. Traders were wary of placing too much significance on yesterday's rally. Tonight sees the London stock market moving into the three-day summer bank holiday weekend break, and dealers have been told to balance trading books by midsession today. Bear positions were being trimmed yesterday afternoon as securities houses bought shares to meet selling commitments. The outlook remained very uncertain, especially on the currency front, where equity strategists expect little permanent respite until the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty is out of the way near the end of September. There was little response to comments yesterday by the German finance minister on the general need for lower interest rates 'in the medium term'. Unsettling factors on the domestic scene also restrained the investment mood. Another dividend reduction, this time from Slough Estates in the property sector, brought attention back to the dangers still lurking on the corporate front. Hopes for a consumer-led recovery in the British economy received a fresh jolt from a bearish statement from Scot-tish &amp; Newcastle, which has trading interests across the range of brewing and leisure activities. The combination of modest bargain hunting by the institutions and basket trading by market firms boosted the day's Seaq volume total to 474.1m shares, against only 374.9m in the previous session. Retail, or customer, business was worth just Pounds 628.2m on Wednesday, a continuation of the effectively unprofitable trading levels which have bedevilled the London market in recent weeks. On Tuesday, however, when the Footsie fell by around 1.3 per cent, retail business totalled Pounds 1.1bn as large investment funds trimmed portfolios in the face of growing apprehension over the outlook for sterling and UK base rates. The fragility of the market's confidence yesterday was indicated by a move to take profits in utility stocks, which had stood up well against the general onslaught on equity prices because of their perceived defensive qualities.</p>

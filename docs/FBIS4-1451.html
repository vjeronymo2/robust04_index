			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Factional fighting  erupted overnight in Burundi's capital Bujumbura, where mortars  and smoke bombs were fired in a northern suburb, military  sources said Friday [29 April]. The fighting broke out as  security forces, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, carried  out an arms sweep intended to disarm civilians from the majority  Hutu group following clashes with soldiers. It was unknown  whether there were casualties.    A military spokesman said soldiers had only fired smoke  bombs  to encourage civilians to leave the northern suburb of Kamenge  and the adjoining neighbourhoods of Cibitoke and Kinama. Armed  civilians had reportedly fired mortars from the three areas  during several weeks of clashes with soldiers.    Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwe  said civilians had been "taken hostage by militiamen who wanted  to use them as human shields." "We hope that these men will  surrender and that we will not need to use tougher measures to  disarm them," a government source said. [passage omitted]    Civilians were to have laid down their arms Thursday in the  presence of diplomats and Interim President Sylvestre  Ntybantunganya. But the ceremony never took place because "an  extremist group opposed the idea," a diplomat said. The  government then ordered the Army to disarm the hardline groups,  the diplomat said.</p>

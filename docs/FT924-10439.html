			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: TSW in the black after cost savings Television South West Holdings has turned round from a loss of Pounds 1.88m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.47m in the first half of 1992, and is paying an interim dividend of 2p. However, the retained loss went up from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 3.61m as the company provided extraordinary charges of Pounds 4.52m arising from the cessation of broadcasting on December 31 last. They covered decreases in property values and equipment Pounds 3.86m, and additional redundancy and pension costs Pounds 1.21m. While turnover remained static at Pounds 18.7m, reflecting the state of the economy and national advertising revenue, costs were reduced by Pounds 2m. Sales in the second half were expected to be maintained. Earnings per share for the period were 4.2p (losses 4.8p).</p>

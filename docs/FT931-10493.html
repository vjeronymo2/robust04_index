			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / British Gas to freeze prices for 18m users BRITISH GAS will freeze prices to its 18m domestic customers and small businesses on April 1, even though the company says the complex formula that governs household prices gives it room for an increase in line with inflation. The company said it wanted a clearer view of the outlook for inflation and other factors before deciding any price move. This means the freeze may not be in place for a full year and prices could change if inflation rises or gas costs increase. The freeze follows price cuts of 3 per cent in July last year and a further 2 per cent in October after Ofgas, the industry regulator, put pressure on British Gas to lower prices rather than freeze them as the company wanted. British Gas's latest announcement came the day before the Ofgas annual report in which Sir James McKinnon, the regulator's director-general, is expected to champion the price cuts he forced on the company last year amid constant attrition between the two sides. 'It is appropriate for British Gas to buy the lowest cost gas it can and if it can keep its prices down it should,' Sir James said yesterday. British Gas estimates that the average household consumer pays about Pounds 500 a year to provide heating, hot water and gas for cooking for a family of four. Prices have fallen 20 per cent in real terms since 1986. Gas prices are dictated by a tough but complicated formula, the main part of which limits price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. But British Gas says that this year, the gas cost index - another element in the formula which is based on retail price inflation, coal, oil, and electricity prices as well as the cost of gas to British Gas - shows it could raise prices. Sir James said he would be looking very carefully at the gas cost index. He said the turbulence of sterling against currencies such as the dollar and the D-Mark could have an influence on it.</p>

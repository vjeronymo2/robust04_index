"We have found out that the United States has made a  substantial change in their schedule," an official at the  Economic Planning Board said on Wednesday.    For instance, he said, Washington now decided to lower  semiconductor tariff by only 0.7 percentage points from the  existing 3.7 percent to 3 percent whereas it earlier said they  would completely lift tariff on semiconductor.    About 110 items in the categories of electronics and  non-ferrous metal would be re-examined by the Korean Government  for possible change before its final schedule would be forwarded  to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Secretariat  early next week, the official said.    During its recent trade talks with Japan, the United States  declared they would withdraw the planned removal of tariffs in  the areas of electronics, non-ferrous metal, lumber and  distilled liquor.    The declaration came after Japan said they would lower  tariff  on lumber by 5 percentage points from the present 8 percent to 3  percent instead of lifting tariff on lumber altogether.    "Now that the United States has revised its market opening  schedule, we intend to make a corresponding change," the  official said.    He added that so far 38 countries including the United  States, Japan and the European Union (EC) have submitted their  final schedules to the GATT.</p>

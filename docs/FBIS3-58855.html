			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 22 (AFP) -- French President Francois  Mitterrand on Saturday [22 January] called for a "new departure"  in Franco-Chinese relations after talks with the Chinese foreign  minister formally healed a rift over French arms sales to Taiwan.    Mitterrand, during a 30-minute meeting with Qian Qichen who  arrived earlier Saturday, said he wanted to "give a new  departure to our relations. It would be beneficial for both our  countries."    The French president was quoted by his spokesman Jean  Musitelli, who added that the meeting "confirmed the desire for  a rapprochement" on both sides.    Mitterrand notably said that "we must increase initiatives  now that we agree that things should improve."    Qian told reporters after his meeting with Mitterrand that  "the future of Sino-French relations is very promising," when  asked about prospects for economic and industrial cooperation.    But later Foreign Minister Alain Juppe rebuked China for its  human rights record, saying "a lot must still be done" in that  area.    But Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks "a new  departure" in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of  the year-long rift over French arms sales to Taiwan.    He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting  with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional  conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which  Beijing is a permanent member.    The minister's three-day official visit was scheduled after  Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when  Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan.    Relations had been strained for a year after a contract for  the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by  the sale of gunboats, but Juppe said these contracts would be  honored although France would not be signing any new arms sales  agreements.    Mitterrand noted that "in recent years, Franco-Chinese  relations went through difficulties, particularly because of a  dip in trade," according to Musitelli.    Qian, pointing out that China was experiencing high growth  rates, said his country "is a market with strong potential for  foreign businesses, particularly French ones, which are welcome."    French businessmen are keen to return to the lucrative  Chinese market after being excluded over arms deals with Taiwan.    A pro-Tibet committee on Thursday urged French authorities  to  push the issue of human rights in the autonomous region during  Qian's visit.    Qian was due to meet French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  on Monday. Balladur is soon to pay a visit to China, probably  in March.    On Monday he is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the  United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next  June.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Appointments: Black network co-ordinator for UK The new UK network co-ordinator of the Texas-based International Black Network Exchange is David Wint Flint, former insurance broker now with his own insurance-to-property interests group WFJ Enterprise, who believes strongly in raising the profile of black business in Britain. IBNE, which is largely financed by its 70,000 members but also receives some US State Department funding, is designed to put black businessmen and professionals around the world in touch with each other. Founder Patricia Roper Saunders, who worked on a similar venture, Transatlantic Link, before IBNE was formed last year, will soon be in Britain to launch the UK service and expound on the benefits of networking. Wint Flint, who is 31, says his role is to help foreign companies find suitable partners in the UK, preferably within the black community but not exclusively so. While he collects no salary from IBNE, he expects to earn fees for his services from the companies. Britain's ethnic population may, as a group, be a significant consumer force, but not enough spending is put the way of black business. 'You don't see too many black millionaires around.' Wint Flint, whose dream is to have done sufficiently well to be able to retire before he is 40, also runs his own networking service, the African Caribbean Directors Institute Centre, which has a different mission in so far as it 'networks between other business and professional networks'. Before setting up his own business, he spent five years at Lowndes Lambert as a senior broker. So does WFJ Enterprise Group, which has a staff of 8, transact business principally within the black community? 'No I don't. Unfortunately there are not enough black people in this country to sustain the business.' ***** Marcantonio Stagno d'Alcontres is the new general manager of the London branch of BANCA DI SICILIA; his predecessor, Marcello Cali, is now general manager of the New York branch. ***** Paul Thom has succeeded Stephanie Powell as company secretary of HENRY ANSBACHER HOLDINGS. ***** COUNTY NATWEST has promoted to director Chris Huggins, Charles Philipps, Mark Aedy, Ian Marcus, Richard Fox, John Jeremy, John Carr, Alastair Gibbons, Alan Lewis, Rod Selkirk, David Black, Jim Card, Steven Clark, Richard Gee, Ted Hall, Neil Pidgeon, Charles Rowe, Peter Baynham and Graham Halstead. ***** Nigel Todd, formerly finance director at Concord Leasing, has been appointed head of group asset and liability management at its parent, FORWARD TRUST, based in Birmingham; Edward Lester is appointed head of corporate finance, based in London. ***** Hugh Grootenhuis, Torquil McAlpine and Cristoforo Rocco have been appointed directors of SCHRODER SECURITIES. ***** Dinah McKenzie has been appointed a director of MIDLAND MONTAGU ASSET MANAGEMENT. ***** Anthony Bushell has been appointed a director of FIRST SPANISH INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Bruce Bonyhady has been appointed deputy md and chief investment officer of MERIDIAN GLOBAL FUNDS MANAGEMENT (EUROPE).</p>

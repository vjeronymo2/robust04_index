			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Positions harden on Ulster talks THE round-table talks on Northern Ireland's political future resume in Belfast today amid signs that positions in the nationalist and unionist camps are hardening, and that the news blackout imposed at the beginning of the process is breaking down. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, speaking on Irish radio yesterday, dismissed as 'gamesmanship' and 'point scoring' unionist insistence that the Irish Republic drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, enshrined in its constitution, before any further progress at the talks can be made. The hardline Democratic Unionist party boycotted the Dublin phase of the talks last week, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any flexibility on the issue. The Ulster Unionist party attended the talks but little headway appeared to have been achieved. Mr Hume said the unionist position 'is not facing up to the real problem which is 'how do we live together in this island and how do we respect our differences?''. He added: 'If we were playing the same game, I would be demanding that the British constitution be changed because it is an extremely sectarian constitution. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. Church of England bishops have seats as of right in the House of Lords.' He also ruled out power sharing or majority rule as possible solutions that might emerge from the talks. Mr Hulme said that Northern Ireland 'is not a natural political entity because it was unnaturally drawn, the normal political standards do not work . . . that is a self-evident truth . . . We are not going to give back power to the unionists, full stop.' The Stormont parliament was dissolved in 1972, when direct rule from Westminster was introduced after the breakdown of law and order in the province. The SDLP proposal is for a commission of six people to govern the province, including representation from Dublin and the EC. The unionists have rejected that. The DUP said at the weekend it would abandon the talks entirely after November 16 - the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting between the British and Irish governments - if agreement between the four Ulster parties and the two governments could not be reached by then. It would attend talks in Belfast this week only if the Republic's constitutional claim was being dealt with 'seriously'.</p>

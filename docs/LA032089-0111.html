			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PAY PHONES ON GSA LAND STILL BELL'S  </P> <P> More than 3,500 public pay telephones located on federal government property  controlled by the General Services Administration will remain under license to  local Bell companies and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the GSA said  today.  </P> <P> Richard G. Austin, acting GSA administrator, said the decision is preliminary  until GSA conducts a further analysis about licensing a pay phone company. He  said the GSA's decision will not prevent the agency from selecting a  long-distance carrier other than AT&amp;T or pay phone companies other than the  Bell companies at a future date.  </P> <P> GSA's decision was in response to an order in October by U.S. District Judge  Harold H. Greene under which the owners of premises where Bell pay phones are  located must decide by April 1 which long-distance carriers to use. If they  don't make a choice, they will be assigned to a long-distance carrier by  lottery.  </P></p>

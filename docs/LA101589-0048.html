			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, 31, COAXED FROM FREEWAY OVERPASS  </P> <P> Police officers and firefighters coaxed a 31-year-old North Hollywood woman  from the edge of an overpass about 60 feet above the Hollywood Freeway in North  Hollywood on Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was the second such incident in the San Fernando Valley in two days.  </P> <P> The woman inched along the edge of the Whitsett Avenue overpass to its west  side while police held on to her clothes through a fence.  </P> <P> "She was not irrational and not combative," said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Frank  David. Police took the uninjured woman to Olive View Medical Center for  psychiatric evaluation, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Christopher Vasquez.  </P> <P> Firefighters and California Highway Patrol officers blocked traffic on the  freeway until the woman was safely off the bridge about 6:20 p.m. Officers and  firefighters had reached the scene about 10 minutes earlier.  </P> <P> On Friday, a Burbank police detective saved a 17-year-old Burbank girl by  grabbing her arm as she stepped off an overpass above the Ventura Freeway about  5 miles from the site of Saturday's incident.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An attack on Dr. Mario Bolanos, director of the  National Public Security Academy (ANSP), who was unharmed, and  subsequent armed confrontations left three people killed  yesterday. One of Bolanos' bodyguards was killed in the attack,  which occurred as Bolanos traveled along the Panamerican Highway  in Usulutan.    The attack, which occurred at the Mercedes Umana turnoff  yesterday morning, happened when seven individuals riding in  other vehicles attacked Bolanos' car by surprise.    Bodyguards accompanied the director of the ANSP, which  trains  National Civil Police [PNC] agents.    The criminals fled after realizing the attempt on Bolanos'  life had failed. Therefore, all PNC offices in the Eastern Zone  began an operation to find those who executed the attack.    One of the vehicles in which the assailants rode was found  in  Berlin, where police clashed with the criminals. One of  Bolanos' bodyguards, whose identification was not disclosed, was  killed in this incident.    After this clash, PNC agents and some of Bolanos' bodyguards  began to chase the criminals and caught up with them on 4th West  Street and 7th Northern Avenue in the neighborhood of La Merced  in Usulutan, where an armed confrontation took place. Two  criminals were killed, and one was wounded in this clash.    One of the dead was identified as Luis Alberto Ostorga  Mejia,  a 44-year old from Estanzuelas, Usulutan. More than 1,000  colones were found in his possession, money that was presumably  stolen. The other dead man was not identified. According to  the subcommissioner in charge of the operation, however, he was  approximately 30 years old, wore blue pants, a white shirt, and  tennis shoes. He had 3,000 colones, a watch, a chain, and a  yellow ring.    The suspect who was wounded was not identified. He was taken  to San Miguel Regional Hospital under police custody.    The three suspects were riding in a white Toyota van,  license  plate No. MI-2416, presumably stolen. They carried no auto  ownership papers, and the vehicle was identified as a van owned  by an international mission.    A Motorola radio, an AK-47 rifle, a Bronix weapon, and a  sawed-off Uzi machine gun were found inside the vehicle, but  none of them were registered under the criminals' name.    PNC sources consulted in San Salvador confirmed the attack  and stated a team is already investigating it.</p>

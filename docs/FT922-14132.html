			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Oil shares stand out in European trade OIL shares bucked a generally easier continental trend yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT consolidated Monday's gains and the DAX index, which had risen 10 points in early trading, closed 4.8 higher at 1,739.42. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was 5.47 firmer at 711.49, while turnover fell to DM6.7bn from DM7.1bn. The banking sector remained in focus as Commerzbank announced its 1991 results. The shares advanced DM3.3 to DM262.0 before announcing a 70 per cent rise in group operating profit for the first two months of this year. Deutsche Bank finished 50 pfg stronger at DM718 and Dresdner Bank advanced DM2.00 to DM353.50. BHF Bank, which releases its 1991 figures today, was DM2 higher at DM434. It said it would raise its dividend to DM13 from DM12. Daimler rose to an intra day high of DM781 before closing DM6.50 ahead at DM775.50 on rumours that it was to issue a covered warrant. BMW and Volkswagen both lost ground after their recent strong gains. BMW shed DM2.70 to DM583.50 and Volkswagen declined 40 pfg to DM375.40. News that the cartel office was to investigate the relationship between Asko and Metro, a privately-owned Swiss group, shaved DM5 off Asko to DM883. There were reports that Metro had doubled its declared 10 per cent stake in Asko. BASF advanced DM12.60 at DM258.00 in the absence of news. MILAN ended lower across the board following the poor showing of the coalition government - especially the Christian Democrats  - in the national elections. Dealers said domestic funds initially tried to hold up the market but soon gave up. The Comit index fell 8.19 or 1.6 per cent to 503.40 in turnover estimated at little more than Monday's L63.8bn. Analysts said that while another early election was unlikely, the market would have little faith in a weak Christian Democrat-led alliance which would usher in a period of political and economic instability. However, they added that intrepid investors might consider buying Italian equities at current depressed levels, in the hope that the inconclusive election results would force Italy to reform its electoral process. Fiat fell L53 to L4,770 and Generali lost L560 to L28,780. Telecoms fell as foreign investors took their profits, with Sip losing L34 to L1,441 and Stet down L63 to L2,148. PARIS concentrated on individual stocks as the broad market was generally flat. The CAC 40 index ended just 0.61 higher at 1,975.38 in turnover of FFr2.2bn. Alcatel Alsthom remained firm ahead of its 1991 results today, adding FFr4 to FFr623. A net profit figure above FFr5.9bn would be good news for the market. Firmer crude prices lifted the oil sector. Total gained FFr9.20 to FFr248.70 and Elf added FFr4 to FFr365.60. There was some activity in Euro Disney which fell FFr2.60 to FFr148.90. The theme park operator made a presentation to analysts and fund managers yesterday which included a tour of the park which is due to open on Saturday. AMSTERDAM closed slightly down as Royal Dutch once more dominated trading. A stronger oil price and a buy note from a US broker lifted the shares which closed up Fl 2.10 at Fl 147.20. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.1 to 125.6 in turnover of Fl 621.7m. The transport group Pakhoed, which reported disappointing 1991 profits and forecast that 1992 earnings would remain under pressure, fell to the day's low of Fl 42.50 before closing down Fl 1.60 at Fl 43.70. Nedlloyd declined 50 cents to Fl 58.80 and denied reports that it was planning to cut jobs. Fokker denied a report that it was to make a statement tomorrow on progress in its talks with Deutsche Aerospace, although analysts expect an announcement in the near future. Its shares rose 10 cents to Fl 34.70. ZURICH was unmoved by inflation figures which showed a rise of 0.3 per cent between February and March. The SMI index closed 7.5 higher at 1,850.5. Insurers remained active with registered shares in Swiss Re gaining SFr20 to SFr2,490 and in Zurich Insurance SFr10 to SFr4,050. BRUSSELS opened the first day of the new account firmer with the Bel-20 index closing up 3.62 at 1,188.27 in turnover of BFr805m. Petrofina was led higher by the rise in the world oil price and advanced BFr100 to BFr10,500. LISBON continued to rise on domestic and foreign interest following the escudo's entry into the ERM. Liquid blue chips such as banking and construction were in demand. The BTA index added 27.9 or 1.4 per cent to 2,080.4. MADRID gained slightly although disappointing economic news depressed sentiment. The general index closed up 0.05 at 248.92 in turnover of some Pta14bn. Next week's inflation data is expected to show a month-on-month rise of between 0.4-0.6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open      10 am    11 am   12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1158.42   1158.81  1159.05 1157.57  1157.47  1157.54  1156.66  1156.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1159.45    Day's Low  1156.55  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 6     Apr 3    Apr 2     Apr 1     Mar 31 1155.59   1144.60  1149.08   1141.13   1149.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

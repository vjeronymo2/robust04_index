			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FIXED IN THE MIX: Talk about patting yourself on the back. The 12-inch version  of Ziggy Marley's hit, "Tumblin' Down," is loaded with a hefty chunk of  sampling (excerpts of previously recorded songs) from the 1982 Tom Tom Club  hit, "Genius of Love." And guess who produced Marley's album? Tom Tom Club duo  (and Talking Heads members) Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. But wait -- it  turns out that the duo didn't plug their old hit in "Tumblin'." In fact,  according to Tom Tom Club manager Gary Kurfirst, Frantz and Weymouth had "no  idea" their old song was on the 12-inch single.  </P> <P> "All that sampling stuff wasn't on the original version of 'Tumblin' which  Chris and Tina produced," said Kurfirst. "Apparently when Virgin (Marley's  label) remixed the 12-inch, someone added the sampling. No one even asked for  our approval."  </P> <P> Since Frantz and Weymouth receive royalties as the record's producers -- and  are slated to handle Marley's next album -- they're happy to see the record on  the charts. Kurfirst added: "We just don't want anyone to think that Chris and  Tina took advantage of their producer's role to push their hit on Ziggy's  record."  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Money Markets: European futures rise EUROPEAN cash and futures markets continued to reflect the cautious belief that interest rates will be cut, with sterling and French franc futures prices rising several basis points, writes James Blitz. In the UK, the government's narrow victory in the parliamentary vote on whether to move towards European economic union removed the one serious obstacle to more reductions in base rates. Dealers continue to assume that another cut will accompany the Autumn Statement on November 12. The December sterling futures contract closed up 8 basis points at 93.54 yesterday, implying that three-month money will be at 6.5 per cent by the year-end. According to one clearing bank dealer, a move to 6 per cent base rate would leave three-month money at about that level. However, one discount house dealer argued strongly yesterday that the market is too optimistic, and that a base rate cut is most likely to be of the order of only  1/2 percentage point. In favour of this, he argued that sterling is weak, the dollar has a lot of pent-up strength, and a larger cut would push the pound down sharply; that the authorities would be far wiser to leave the market wanting more cuts; that the last cut reflected political panic rather than the government's clear willingness to ease policy; and that the outlook for the Bundesbank easing in the long term is increasingly uncertain. French franc futures reflected the more cautious tone of a currency bound by the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism. The French prime minister's recent statement that more rate cuts are on the way continued to impress the market. The March franc contract closed 7 basis points higher at 91.95, implying that three-month cash will fall some 140 basis points in the next five months. The rate for three-month cash has already dipped about  1/8 , to 9 7/16 per cent, in the last two days. Activity in German markets was quiet. Call money eased slightly from Wednesday's levels to between 8.80 and 8.90 per cent. The market was unaffected by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, about the need to keep credit conditions tight. 'It is not a good idea to opt for a stimulative policy, only to brake again because inflation is out of control,' he said.</p>

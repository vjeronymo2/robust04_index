			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also proposes to reclassify proposed item L.7.a. as a Class 1 permit modification, with prior approval of the Director. Our basis for this change is that the narrower scope and limited duration of the shakedown period means that a facility's activities would be less significant than the activities found under the existing L.7.a. One example of a modification under proposed item L.7.a. would be a change in combustion temperature to increase the unit's efficiency. The purpose of the shakedown period is to prepare the unit for the trial burn and, thus, any changes made during the shakedown period would not affect long term operation. The shakedown period can last no longer than 720 hours of operation, with only one extension possible. As stated previously, modification items related to the trial burn will now be addressed by the permitting authority under proposed section L.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Trial burn.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today, EPA is proposing to create a new section L.8. in Appendix I to address modifications to permit conditions during the trial burn. These conditions are contained in the approved trial burn plan, which is a part of the RCRA permit. EPA has structured this section to progress from changes before any trial burns are completed to those after a trial burn has been conducted, including changes made to reflect the results of a successful trial burn. The format of the new section L.8. is as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to revise Appendix I to address changes to the trial burn plan before the trial burn is complete (items L.8.a. and L.8.b). Under the proposed scheme, the permitting authority will consider changes to the trial burn plan a Class 2 permit modification, unless they are minor, in which case they will be Class 1, with prior Director approval. One example of a minor change would be an increase in the secondary combustion chamber temperature for a trial burn condition that is testing the destruction and removal efficiency for organic wastes. One example of a major change would be an increase in the waste feed rate. Please note that classifying changes as minor with regard to the trial burn is not a new requirement; it was previously listed under item L.7.c. However, to reflect the fact that the trial burn conditions are contained in the trial burn plan, EPA is deleting any references to ``operating requirements set in the permit'' from the modification table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects that permittees may request technical changes in the trial burn plan under L.8.a. while the permitting authority is on-site immediately before, or during, the trial burn. These changes address unanticipated issues and are often necessary for effective and protective operation and testing during the trial burn. A representative of the permitting authority, usually the permit writer, is typically at the facility during the trial burn. The Agency encourages permit writers and facilities to write trial burn plans with the flexibility to accommodate alterations during the trial burn. The permitting authority can expedite the modification process by delegating approval authority to one of its agents. The permit itself can also specify what level of permitting agency staff has authority to approve these minor changes. In deciding whether to allow such changes on-site, we encourage the permit writer to consider the criteria contained in the February 16, 1989, Trial Burn Observation Guide. Of course, the final permit conditions would limit the permittee to those conditions that met the performance standards during the trial burn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After a facility conducts a trial burn and submits the results to the permitting agency, the facility may request another trial burn. The facility must, then, submit a new trial burn plan. EPA is proposing to revise Appendix I to clarify this situation. Item L.8.c. specifically relates to situations where the facility did not meet the performance standards set in the trial burn plan and the facility proposes another trial burn, or portions of a trial burn, at improved conditions. Item L.8.c. addresses conducting additional tests to replace one or more of the failed conditions of a trial burn. Before the facility can conduct these tests, it must revise the conditions in the trial burn plan and the permitting agency must approve the revisions through a permit modification. In general, the permitting agency will not approve the modification request to conduct another trial burn unless the facility has provided a sound technical basis, demonstrating that the revised operating conditions are likely to meet the performance standards set in the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing to classify item L.8.c. as a Class 2 permit modification. The Agency recognizes that this classification represents a change from the preamble language in past incinerator technical regulations. An early incinerator rule preamble states that ``if compliance has not been shown and an additional trial burn is necessary, the permit may also be modified under &sect;122.17 [old minor permit modification language] to allow for an additional trial burn'' (See 47 FR 27524, June 24, 1982). This 1982 preamble language describes a trial burn retest of a failed condition. Since 1982, EPA has gained considerable experience regarding trial burns. EPA now believes that if a facility does not meet the regulatory performance standards during the trial burn, then the public needs to be involved before the facility revises the trial burn plan and conducts another test, because the facility's failure under certain conditions may raise concerns. Therefore, EPA believes that the additional public participation requirements of the Class 2 procedures are appropriate for this item. (See proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7) for the analogous procedures for interim status combustion facilities.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, EPA is proposing to add item L.8.d to address changes to the permit conditions that are in effect during the limited period called the post-trial burn period. (These modifications would currently be addressed under item L.7.a.) Because any changes during the post-trial burn period will be limited in duration, similar to those during the shakedown period, EPA is also reclassifying post-trial burn period modifications from Class 2 to Class 1 permit modifications, with prior approval of the Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

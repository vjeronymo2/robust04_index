			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- The French government has  decided not to privatize Hervet Bank "in the immediate future"  because of its difficult financial situation, which led to a net  loss of 1.2 billion francs (207 million dollars) in 1993, the  Economics Ministry announced on Friday [1 April].    It added that the state, which holds a 89.41 percent  majority  stake in Banque Hervet via Compagnie Financiere Hervet, will  take part in putting the bank back on its feet by providing 750  million francs in the form of stockholders' advances.    That amount will be added to the 150 million francs already  paid in at the end of last year.    The government's goal is to get the bank back to  profitability this year, the ministry said, "so as to prepare  for privatization under the best possible conditions."</p>

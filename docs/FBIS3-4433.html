Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee; and  Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the  State Nationalities Affairs Commission; attended the session.  During the deliberation, deputies from Xinjiang put forward  many constructive opinions on the government work report.    Abulaiti Amururexiti, who is attending the NPC session as a  non- voting member of the delegation, says: "I endorse the  premier's work, which I believe is realistic and conforms with  the facts. Since the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the  Chinese people of all nationalities, led by the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, have  conscientiously implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, and have comprehensively implemented the guidelines  of the 14th CPC National Congress in seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, and accelerating development. The party  Central Committee has adopted macroeconomic regulation and  control measures to promptly solve problems and contradictions  cropping up in the course of advance, thereby scoring remarkable  achievements, facilitating a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy, and achieving heartening  results in all fields of endeavor.    Discussing the rapid growth of the national economy, the  report points out: In 1993, the gross national product grew  13.4 percent to exceed 3,000 billion yuan; agriculture  registered another year of bumper harvests with a 10 percent  increase in total output value, including an all- time-high  record in grain output; village and township enterprises  continued to expand rapidly at a rate of 11.3 percent; gross  industrial output value rose 21.1 percent; and new advances were  made in reform and opening up. In line with the requirements  for the establishment of a socialist market economy, efforts  were made to continue to promote reform in various fields.    Along with the development of state and collective economic  sectors, individual and private economic sectors and  foreign-funded enterprises grew continuously. Commodity prices  were further rationalized. Programs for reforming the fiscal  and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems  were drawn up and implemented. Foreign trade developed in an  all-round way, and the volume of exports and imports was up 18.2  percent from 1992. Further progress was made in all social  undertakings; and the living standards showed continuous  improvement. In short, we achieved remarkable successes in  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Economic  prosperity, political stability, national unity, and social  progress prevailed in the country; and the work in all fields  took on an entirely new look. While affirming the work of last  year, the report also realistically and earnestly sums up  shortcomings and defects in the work of various fields, as well  as outstanding problems and contradictions in the course of  advance."    Wang Lequan says: "The party Central Committee and the State  Council will soon introduce a number of major reform programs.  Last September Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, along with some senior  officials of the relevant government departments, made a special  trip to Xinjiang to (?explain measures) for reforming the fiscal  and taxation system. While in Xinjiang, they inspected work and  held office at the grass roots to listen to opinions of the  masses and helped Xinjiang solve many problems. Following  intensive preparations last year, the new fiscal and taxation  system took effect on 1 January this year. Judging from the  implementation of the new tax system in the first two months of  this year, the situation in Xinjiang as a whole is good. The  current tax reform is a reform of fundamental nature and  involves complex work. However, we completed thorough  preparations and (?coordinated all departments concerned) within  a short period of time. Therefore, the implementation of the  new tax system in Xinjiang in the first two months was smooth  without any problem. Xinjiang's tax revenue in January totaled  460 million yuan, a record figure. Last year, the financial  revenue increased by a big margin, which mainly derived from the  increase in tax revenue; and the highest monthly income was 430  million yuan. This year, the January revenue was 460 million  yuan. The financial situation [words indistinct]. Xinjiang's  financial revenue in January increased 170 billion yuan, which  represented a 46 percent increase from last year [word  indistinct]. Therefore, we may as well say the implementation  of the new tax system is smooth."</p>

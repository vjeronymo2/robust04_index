The purpose of the program is to identify and locate USPS employees who owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government as a result of their participation in benefit programs administered by VA. Once identified and located, VA will pursue collection of debts through voluntary payments. If such payments are not forthcoming, VA may request USPS to offset up to 15 percent of the employees' disposable pay as authorized under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legal authority for undertaking this matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365), 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government, 31 U.S.C. 3711 (Collection and Compromise) and 5 U.S.C. 5514 (Installment Deduction for Indebtedness). These statutes authorize Federal agencies to offset a Federal employee's salary as a means of satisfying delinquent debts owed the United States. VA and USPS have concluded an agreement to conduct the matching program pursuant to provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(o)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USPS will act as the recipient (i.e., matching) agency. VA will provide a tape extract to USPS that contains the name and social security number (SSN) of each record subject. USPS will compare the tape extract against its database of employee records, establishing ``hits'' (i.e., individuals common to both tapes) on the basis of matched SSN's. For each hit, USPS will disclose to VA the following information: name, SSN, home address and employee type (permanent or temporary). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Records to be Matched <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USPS: Finance Records_Payroll System (USPS 050.020) containing records of approximately 700,000 employees. Disclosure will be made under routine use 24 of that system, a full description of which was last published at 57 FR 57515 (December 4, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VA: (a) ``Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records_VA'' (58VA21/22) appearing at page 967 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. The exchange of data under this agreement is consistent with routine uses 9 and 12 of 58VA21/22. (b) ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records and Vendee Loan Applicant Records_VA'' (55VA26), appearing at page 962 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. The exchange of data under this agreement is consistent with routine use 19 of 55VA26. The debtor records actually used to perform the match are maintained in the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS). CARS records, which number about 500,000, are a subset of those found in both Privacy Act systems of records listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The matching program is expected to begin on or about November 25, 1994, and continue in effect for 18 months. Matching activity will begin no sooner than 30 days after publication of this notice or 40 days after a report of this matching program has been provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), whichever is later. The agreement governing the matching program and, thus, the matching program, may be extended an additional 12 months with the respective approval of VA's and USPS' Data Integrity Boards. Such extension must occur within three months prior to expiration of the 18-month period set forth above and under the terms set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ACTION> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the proposal to conduct the matching program to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420.

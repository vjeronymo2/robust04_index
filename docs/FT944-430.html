			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / German import prices rise West German import prices moved up sharply between October and November, bearing out the Bundesbank's determination to combat future inflation as expressed in its money supply target for 1995. The November import price level was 0.8 per cent above that for the previous month and 2.2 per cent above November 1993, the federal statistics office said. The yearly rate was higher than the 1.9 per cent in both September and October. Producer prices have also been rising more rapidly. Both indicators suggest a later upturn in inflation. The central bank stressed its commitment to reaching its medium-term inflation goal of 2 per cent when setting its M3 target last week. Athough the 1995 target range is unchanged at 4-6 per cent, achieving it will mean a slower average rate of money supply growth than in 1994. The strong upturn in the economy this year has revived uneasiness about future inflation, although the rate of consumer price growth has been slowing. Provisional figures from four west German states showed a 2.7 per cent annual inflation rate in December (as in November) and the Bundesbank expects this to ease to under 2.5 per cent early next year. The average for 1994 was 3 per cent, the statistics office said.</p>

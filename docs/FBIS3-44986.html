Harbin  Bearing Plant was swept very clean to greet the arrival of a  distinguished guest.    At about 0930 that morning, Comrade Li Ruihuan, standing  committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, got off a van at a  half step and walked to Harbin Bearing Plant. After looking at  the operation situation of workers one after another, he stopped  beside Yang Jingyu, a young female worker, and cordially asked:  How many years have you worked for this plant? Yang Jingyu  answered: Three years. Li Ruihuan asked again: How much do  you earn per month? Yang answered: One hundred and six yuan. If  bonuses and subsidies are added, it totals 190 yuan. At the  maximum, it had reached 370 to 380 yuan. At the plant's meeting  room, when Comrade Li Ruihuan again mentioned the issue of  wages, workers realized that Li Ruihuan was not casual in asking  about the questions concerning wages, and he was always  concerned with the livelihood of the masses. Ma Jibo, director  of the plant, told Li Ruihuan bluntly: The average annual  income of workers is 4,000 yuan. Li Ruihuan nodded and said:  It is not much. The workers' income is connected with the  development of enterprises and with the stability of the society  and public feeling. What attracted the interests of Comrade Li  Ruihuan was how state-owned enterprises, large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises in particular, should strive for  development under the new historical condition. Ma Jibo gave Li  Ruihuan a detailed briefing of the plant's situation in  importing funds and technology and in carrying out renovation  through grafting. Then, Li Ruihuan said happily: I agree with  your method. This is a way out for large- and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises. The three major power plants in Harbin  can also be like that after renovation.    Li Ruihuan added: Your products occupy a certain place and  have a sort of monopoly on domestic markets. The state  precisely wants to foster a number of enterprises like you to  develop major fine and highly sophisticated products. There are  only several big plants producing power generating and boiler  facilities in the world. Our special technology and  installations cannot be compared with others. These remarks  inspired the workers of the plant.    At 1010, Comrade Li Ruihuan arrived at Harbin Engineering  College. The way to the meeting room was filled with teachers,  staff members, and workers. Yang Shiqin, president of Harbin  Engineering Plant, briefed Comrade Li Ruihuan on the situation  of the scientific and technological park zone of Harbin  Engineering College. Yang said: At the scientific and  technological park zone, that was established a year ago, dozens  of scientific research results have already been industrialized,  and another group of scientific research results are under rapid  transformation. After hearing this, Comrade Li Ruihuan was very  satisfied with it, and discussed with college teachers and staff  on how to combine education and scientific research with  production. Li Ruihuan said: How good is the phrase [words  indistinct]. But, it is useless because nobody follows it.  There are no such phrases in foreign countries, but they work  in good order. It will not do to shout slogans. These remarks  set college teachers and staff roaring with laughter. After  laughing, they pondered over what Li Ruihuan said. With regard  to the questions of combining education and scientific research  with production and in many other questions, we should not offer  questions merely but should also strive to find out answers. It  will not do to shout empty slogans. What is important is to  deal with concrete matters.    During the discussion, some comrades also pointed out: The  things will be better if enterprises can join hands with  universities and colleges in the fields of tackling  technological difficulties and improving the technology content  of products. Comrade Li Ruihuan was much interested in this  suggestion. Then, he encouraged college teachers and staff to  exert great efforts in working out a system of combining  education, science, technology, and production. After this,  Comrade Li Ruihuan visited the scientific hall of the college  with great interest. He said: Here is the world of robots.  When a robot wrote welcome with its machinery hand on the spot,  Comrade Li Ruihuan nodded and praised it repeatedly.    At the scientific and technological market that was about to  start business at the scientific and technological park zone,  President Yang Shiqin walked to Comrade Li Ruihuan with a  gilding certificate on his hand, and invited Li Ruihuan as  honorary adviser to the scientific and technological park zone  of Harbin Engineering College. Comrade Li Ruihuan happily  accepted the invitation, and this garnered warm applause of  college teachers, staff, and workers.</p>

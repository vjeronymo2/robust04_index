			<p>BFN     [Text] Japanese industries have unanimously expressed  dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's having listed 43  items deemed to be Japanese trade barriers in its "1994 Report  on Foreign Trade Barriers." The telecommunications, medical  equipment, and electric power industries, which are newly cited  in the report, especially do not agree with its contents,  saying: "The U.S. Government is mistaken in its understanding  of the facts" (as stated by the Federation of Electric Power  Companies). This is because the amount of procurement of  foreign goods by nine electric companies sharply increased to  $440 million in 1992 from $210 million in 1990, and U.S.-made  products accounted for 80-90 percent of the total.    It can be said that of the 43 items listed in the U.S.  report, "such items as telecommunications and medical equipment  -- which are newly listed in the report -- as well as  automobiles, computers, and supercomputers -- which were main  topics at the economic framework talks -- are the most probable  targets of the Super 301 provision of the Trade and  Competitiveness Acts" (according to the Japan Machinery  Exporters' Association).    Meanwhile, Takayoshi Masuzawa, managing director of the  Communications Machine Makers' Association, stresses: "Although  trade imbalances in the field of communications equipment as a  whole still exist, the excess of net exports of such products as  facsimile machines is now decreasing, due to an increase in  local production abroad."    Regarding the cellular phone issue, the managing director  also points out: "The introduction of the `urikiri system'  [lifting the ban on direct sales of cellular phones to  consumers] in April will promote price and service competition,  hence it will facilitate the access of foreign makers to the  Japanese market."    The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association points  out: "The Japanese computer market is an extremely free market  in which imports have been totally liberalized and tariffs have  been abolished. Procedures for government procurement of  supercomputers are transparent." The association does not try  to conceal its dissatisfaction, saying: "It is hard to  understand the U.S. report, which completely ignores Japan's  efforts and its results."    In response to the U.S. pointing out the supposedly closed  nature of the Japanese auto industry in its business dealings,  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'  Association [JAMA], says: "It is not true that we discriminate  against foreign automakers and makers of automobile parts. We  have no intention to do so in the future as well." He adds:  "It can be gathered from the report that the Clinton  administration is still taking a hardline position on  policymaking toward Japan."    However, the actual situation is that each industry is  failing to come up with concrete measures to prevent the United  States from accusing them this September of engaging in unfair  trade practices. The automobile industry announced its midterm  purchase program of foreign auto parts in late March. With JAMA  playing a leading role, the industry has also spelled out new  plans to increase imports of finished cars, including a plan to  establish a grievance committee. It is trying to coolly react  to the U.S. report, saying "there is no choice but to steadily  implement these plans, (as stated by JAMA).    Since the electric power industry is now working out such  measures as the disclosure of information on its plans to  procure materials as well as the simplification of procedures  for procurement, it intends to introduce these measures as an  answer to the U.S. demand that Japan open its markets.</p>

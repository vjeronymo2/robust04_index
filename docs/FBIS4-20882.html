			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "A Crime Endangering </F> Central Europe!"]    [Text] One of the places where, until recently, our army  concealed very dangerous bacteriological and virological weapons  was the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice!    CESKY DENIK reporters have discovered that strains for  bacteriological weapons were stored, without expert supervision  and the necessary caution, in a laboratory leased to a private  company on the grounds of the Central Military Hospital in  Stresovice. They were developed on the basis of a former Warsaw  Pact treaty in a research institute in Techonin in East Bohemia.  The laboratory, with its containers full of cultures for  dangerous infectious germs prepared for combat use, was leased  to the private Klinlab company. According to the information  available, Deputy Defense Minister Engineer Miroslav Kalousek  was involved in establishing this company and in leasing part of  the Central Military Hospital, including the facility used by  this company. The Defense Ministry also purchased expensive  laboratory equipment for the Klinlab company. The whole project  was described as top secret and of special significance.    Some of the containers, in which various kinds of bacteria  for weapons "cultivated" by Czechoslovak military experts were  stored, were sold into private hands, that is, to the Klinlab  company.    Bacteriological and viral weapons are among the most  insidious and dangerous. International agreements commit the  Czech Republic to preventing their use, development, and  storage. It is apparent from the findings of the CESKY DENIK  reporters that the cultures for the bacteriological weapons were  stored in the Central Military Hospital with the knowledge of  some of our most senior military representatives.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> When read together, subsections (w)(2) and (w)(3) of section 21A of the FHLBA indicate that Congress intended the concept of a single asset to include two or more legally discrete assets which are so interconnected as to constitute a single economic unit. On that basis, the RTC has defined ``single real property asset'' to allow for the inclusion of more than one asset in which the RTC holds an undivided or controlling interest, if such assets may logically be treated as a common asset because they have at least two common characteristics. Some examples of such characteristics are contiguity, economic integration, shared utility systems, former common ownership or operation, common infrastructure improvements, and common recreational facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (c) of section 1640.2 defines the term ``market'' as providing notice to the public of the availability of the property for sale. This definition encompasses a variety of marketing techniques, thereby permitting the RTC the discretion to choose the technique which best suits a particular asset. Marketing of an asset involves exposure to a target market through a variety of methods. These methods may include, without limitation, advertising in local, regional or national newspapers or other publications, advertising in trade journals for specialized properties such as hotels, distributing of professional marketing materials, or listing of the property with a broker or other contractor with the expertise to expose the property extensively in its target market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1640.3(a) of the interim rule requires the RTC to market and sell real property assets solely on an individual basis for 120 days or until an asset is sold under subsection (b) of the same section. During the initial 120-day marketing period, however, the RTC may promote the sale of more than a single real property asset in a single promotional medium. In addition, during that marketing period, that the RTC may sell or otherwise dispose of, a single real property asset in an open or sealed-bid auction, or other multi-asset marketing program, so long as bids are received and accepted only for individual properties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1640.4 provides that upon the expiration of the 120-day period, any single real property asset which remains unsold may be disposed of in connection with a portfolio sale or a multi-asset sales initiative under section 1640.4, only if the RTC determines in writing that such a disposition would likely maximize the net recovery to the RTC. As used in this rule, a portfolio sale or multi-asset sales initiative refers to the method of asset disposition of two or more assets (without sufficiently common characteristics to be treated as a single asset) where the RTC permits the sale of two or more assets for one indivisible price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1640.5 sets forth the exceptions to the individual marketing and sales requirement. The provisions of section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA, as implemented by the interim rule, do not apply to real property transferred as part of so-called ``purchase-and-assumption'' agreements, i.e., where assets are sold simultaneously with a resolution in which a buyer (i.e., an acquiring financial institution) purchases a significant proportion of the assets and either assumes a significant proportion of the liabilities or acts as agent of the RTC for purposes of paying insured deposits. The RTC has interpreted this exemption to apply to any single real property asset for which the RTC has granted the acquiring financial institution an option to purchase the asset, although, if the option expires and the asset remains the property of the RTC, then section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA and these implementing regulations would then apply to the property. Also exempted from the individual marketing and sales requirement are single real property assets which are transferred to de novo institutions, organized by the RTC pursuant to section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the FHLBA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> Subpart B_Disposition of Real Estate-Related Assets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 1640.11 of the interim rule describes the purpose and scope of this Subpart, i.e., to establish the methods by which the RTC intends to comply with the disposition provisions of section 21A(w)(3) of the FHLBA applicable to real estate-related assets held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993, which are not subject to a contract to sell or other disposition contract as of that date. Subsection (c) of section 1640.11 recognizes that the RTC may have taken actions, prior to the effective date of this Subpart, to satisfy the new statutory requirements, which should be used to determine the RTC's compliance with those requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of Subpart B apply only to a single real property asset or non-performing single real estate-related loan, which are considered ``real estate-related assets'' for these purposes. Under section 1640.12, the RTC defines relevant terms for purposes of Subpart B, such as real property, single real property asset, real estate-related asset, and non-performing single real estate-related loan. A ``single real property asset'' is defined as a real property asset with a book value of more than $400,000 as determined by the RTC, in which the RTC has an undivided or controlling interest. As under Subpart A, two or more separate real property assets, each with a value of more than $4,000, may be logically treated as a single real property asset if they have at least two common characteristics, as described above. A ``non-performing single real estate-related loan'' is a loan or group of loans with sufficiently common characteristics, each with a book value of more than $1 million as determined by the RTC, in which the RTC holds an undivided or controlling interest, secured by real property, which is more than 90 days delinquent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``non-performing single real estate-related loan'' includes a participation loan whenever the RTC in fact controls the management and disposition of that loan, and the book value of the entire loan, not just the RTC's share, is greater than $1 million. However, the definition does not include a participation loan which the RTC does not control, no matter how large the RTC`s ownership interest is in the loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1640.13 requires the RTC to assign the responsibility for the management and disposition of a real estate-related asset to a qualified person or entity prior to disposition of the asset, unless the RTC makes a written determination that a bulk sale would likely maximize net recovery to the RTC and provide broad participation by qualified bidders, including minority- and women-owned businesses. Under section 1640.12, a ``qualified person or entity'' for a real estate-related asset is defined as an employee of the RTC or the TDPOB or an asset management contractor of the RTC who meets the minimum qualifications established by the RTC for managing and analyzing assets of the same type. The qualified person or entity assigned to the property must analyze each individual asset, consider alternative disposition strategies, recommend a disposition strategy to maximize net recovery to the RTC, develop a written management and disposition plan, and implement that plan for a reasonable period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Unlikely star finds a different TV role: Raymond Snoddy on the Canadian broadcaster that may be a model for Channel Five A VICTORIAN building in downtown Toronto may become the model for Britain's fifth terrestrial television channel. CityTV, an influential voice in the shaping of Channel 5, has pioneered a 'high-energy' local broadcasting style, producing two 24-hour-a-day channels from Wesley Buildings, the former headquarters of a publishing company. Wesley Buildings is the star of the station  - the entire building is the studio. There are 36 camera connection points around it. Grids for mounting cameras cover the ceilings. Lights are rigged ready for an interview or a piece to camera in the boardroom and office of Mr Moses Znaimer, the station's founder and executive producer. He is also the consultant executive producer to the consortium which is the only bidder for Channel 5. Programmes are broadcast live from his office, from corridors, a balcony, the car park or the station shop. Mr Jay Switzer, the station manager, says: 'We do heavy-metal groups from the sub-basement for the atmosphere and we even did Phil Collins from the washroom.' He is a consultant to Channel 5 on the 'model'  - the term for the mixture of music, films and local news that has put CityTV second in the competitive Toronto television market. The station, which has a staff of 390, is informal, mildly irreverent and aimed at 18-49-year-olds. Analysts say it has a turnover of CDollars 60m (Pounds 26m) to CDollars 90m and is increasingly profitable, in spite of the recession. Costs are said to be about four times cheaper than conventional television. Bureaucracy is kept to a minimum. It is up to producers to find the right people. 'We pick the people who can lead the life,' says Mr Switzer. 'We want people who live the beat and can learn the television skills.' Some top producers started as switchboard operators. Editors working on news clips tell the audience what stories they are working on to promote the news. 'We glamorise the process not the conclusions,' says Mr Switzer. 'Some production assistants get more fan mail than the presenters.' Mr Znaimer believes that, if the CityTV formula succeeds in London, 'the world will come flocking to the model; if not it could remain a Toronto curiosity'. The Independent Television Commission is assessing the bid from the consortium, which is led by Thames Television. The consortium has to persuade the ITC that it can retune millions of video recorders likely to suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal. 'It's looking more encouraging,' says Mr Znaimer. The bid is backed by Thorn EMI, the parent of Thames. Sony Pictures, the Hollywood studio group, has renewed its interest and there have been initial discussions with Viacom, the US media group. Potential investors in Channel 5, which plans to launch first in London, then in Manchester followed by other UK cities have already raised the possibility of going to other countries. Eventually Mr Znaimer believes large cities all over the world will have their equivalents of CityTV.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Wen: "Italian Ceramics Office Opens"] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou--Italy's SITI, one of the world's two  giants in the ceramics industry, opened an office in Guangzhou  over the weekend--its first in China.    The company specializes in setting up research and  production  centres for ceramics manufacturing.    The new office is expected to position the firm for further  expansion or a joint venture in the country, where it already  has established a strong market presence.    SITI production lines already account for 30 per cent of the  equipment used by ceramics plants in the affluent Pearl River  Delta region of South China's Guangdong Province, where the  building materials industry is flourishing.    "Setting up our Guangzhou office represents another  significant milestone for SITI in China " said Klaus G. Fugmann,  commercial director of SITI China Ltd.    Last year, about half of SITI's business turnover was  generated from China's huge market. Its sales volume in China  reached about $100 million in 1993.    "The new office will cope with the ever-growing business  volume coming from Mainland China," said Fugmann.    The international company provides manufacturing and  research  support in all fields of the ceramics industry, including wall  and floor tiles, sanitary wares, pottery and mosaics.    "Our equipment still does not meet the demand of the Chinese  market. As the quality of housing and buildings in China is  increasing, the industry has a promising future in the country,"  said Fugmann.    Although the sales of the company's production lines to  China  decreased since last June when the central government tightened  its grip on credit, he said, he is confident about a good future  in the country.</p>

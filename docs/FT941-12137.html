			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The decision is in the post: The uncertain future of the UK Post Office poses a dilemma for the government If the government's review of the Post Office is prolonged, the service will still be in the public sector when Prince Charles' head is on the stamps.' The comment of a Tory backbench MP representing a rural constituency underlines the government's confusion over its plans for what remains the UK's biggest public sector corporation. Today Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, gives evidence to an inquiry by the all-party Commons trade and industry committee on the future service of the Post Office. The Commons investigation was prompted, in part, by fears that the corporation's profitability was threatened by uncertainty about the government plans. Ministers' indecision is baffling given that Mr Heseltine chose to put privatisation back on the agenda by announcing in 1992 a review of the Post Office's status. He is personally in favour of its sale. Adding to government discomfort, Post Office executives are increasingly vociferous in their criticism of the government's inaction. Mr Edward Leigh, the former DTI minister responsible for the corporation, says the review process has gone 'horribly wrong'. Back in 1992 he felt the case for ending the corporation's monopoly on letter deliveries costing less than Pounds 1 was overwhelming. His view that state ownership could no longer be justified was backed by the government's own adviser, Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, which last year recommended privatisation of the Royal Mail, the letters division. It suggested leaving the post offices in the public sector. (The government is already looking for a buyer for the parcels division.) After the Kleinwort Benson report was completed, Mr Leigh was sacked by Mr John Major, the prime minister, because of his views on European policy, and Mr Heseltine had a heart attack, from which he only fully recovered at the end of last year. But such events go only a little way towards explaining the delay. More significant has been the scale of opposition to privatisation, which has surprised Mr Heseltine. Many Conservative backbenchers - particularly those threatened by Liberal Democrats in the south west of England - are worried about the impact of privatisation on the rural postal service. Although the operation of 19,000 sub-post offices, has been contracted out by the Post Office - meaning that they are in effect already privatised - many in rural communities rely on a subsidy from the central Post Office. That support - which for the smallest rural post offices is worth Pounds 2,500 a year - allows them to continue acting as agents for the government in, for instance, paying state benefits. One senior Tory backbencher reports an 'alarming increase' in the number of constituents complaining to him about the future of community post offices. Ministers privately credit the Union of Communication Workers - the Post Office workers' union - for waging an effective 'scare campaign' against privatisation. Enough Tory MPs have passed on their concerns to the whips office, or to Mr Major, for the DTI to realise privatisation has receded as a politically feasible option, given the government's 18-strong Commons majority. Instead Mr Heseltine has embarked on a new approach, drawing up proposals for what some in the DTI sees as a 'half-way house', whereby the Post Office would remain in the public sector but have more commercial freedom. One proposal is that the government should agree to the Post Office's demands for a relaxation of the restrictions preventing it from forming international joint ventures. The corporation wants to be on a par with the Dutch post office, being privatised early this year, and the German and French post offices, which are allowed alliances with companies in the private sector. International expansion in, for instance, the courier business, could increase profitability by expanding the range of services the Post Office sells. But even such unambitious plans are likely to face resistance. The Treasury is opposed to state-owned companies using surplus cash to invest in alliances with private companies, arguing the money could be better used helping bring down the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, complains the corporation is being used as a 'milch cow' to raise cash for the Treasury. The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay the government each year - has risen to Pounds 230m in 1994-95 and is set at Pounds 210m for the following year. The Post Office has said it can meet the targets, but only at the expense of capital expenditure and investment. If the curbs are not loosened, Mr Cockburn says they may mean higher stamp prices and could threaten the corporation's 15-year history of profitability. Mr Heseltine thus finds his options limited. Yet a number of options remain that would allow the Post Office to make more use of its assets while remaining within the constraints imposed by the PSBR: First, the DTI could extend the government's efforts to attract private finance into public sector projects. The Treasury's objection to the Post Office using surplus cash for new business could be circumvented if the investment in joint ventures came from the private sector. Second, the DTI could propose relaxing limits on the services post offices can offer, which are intended to prevent unfair cross-subsidisation. Thirdly, the Royal Mail could be allowed to deliver a wider range of products, including newspapers. Such proposals might prove both politically expedient and appealing to the Treasury because the more Post Office shops can sell, the more profitable they could be, and the less likely they are to close. The subsidy for rural post offices would continue. Such an approach is believed to be gathering support in the DTI. It would address Post Office management's concerns. In the longer term it would leave open the option of the Post Office shops being separated from the Royal Mail and put privatisation of the latter back on to the agenda.</p>

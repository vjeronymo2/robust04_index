			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: The most innovative products of the year - John Authers asks independent advisers for their choices - and fixed-rate mortgages are both top and bottom of the list IF YOU took out a fixed-rate mortgage at the beginning of this year, you made a bad buy. Nobody is criticising the institutions who were offering them - the rates were probably as cheap as it was possible to guarantee. But the timing, we now know, was all wrong. The UK's base rates, and their bizarre behaviour, made timing in 1992 even harder than in most years and lay behind the success and failure of many products. Truly good deals, when they were offered, needed to be accepted with an indecent haste that few people care for when making far-reaching financial decisions. Double-digit fixed-rate mortgages are just one example of the products which consumers might have regretted choosing in 1992. But what were the truly innovative products of the year? We asked a panel of independent advisers to pick products which made more of a mark, or aroused more controversy, than most: National Savings' FIRST Option Bond This product was too good for the building societies or, ultimately, the government to bear. NS decided to invade the societies' traditional territory by offering a bond on which basic-rate tax had been paid already, offering a fixed rate for one year. The rate NS chose, 10.34 per cent gross on July 7, was better than anything else on the market, and it came underwritten by the government. Understandably, there was a quick rush for it. On July 16, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester raised its mortgage rate so it could offer a competitive savings return. Within days, the interest rate on FIRST had been cut and the product is now not available, although it could return. With base rates now down to 7 per cent, any basic-rate taxpayer who piled in at the start must feel very happy. An offer from National Savings which went on rather longer, and with hindsight looks attractive, was the Fifth Issue Index-linked Certificate, guaranteeing to beat inflation by 4.5 per cent over five years. Providence Capitol Building Society Bond Providence Capitol revolutionised the world of single-premium insurance bonds with a scheme that made no front-end charge and allowed investors an instant exit without penalty. For the many taxpayers who could benefit from the peculiar tax advantages of the bond, it was an excellent new home for their money. The bond shops around to find the best rate from building societies, and avoids anything more risky. Falls in savers' rates have harmed the product, according to Peter Hargreaves, of Hargreaves Lansdown. To stay competitive, building societies have been slow to follow base rates down for individual savers, but the rates on offer to institutional savers such as Providence Capitol went down straight away. So, for the time being, the product looks uncompetitive. But the other savers' rates will come down in due course, and so Hargreaves still names it his product of the year. Hypo/F&amp;C Secure Growth Protected Capital Plus This was arguably the most talked-about of the many new 'capital guaranteed' products which used derivatives to guarantee investors that their capital would not fall, while also offering them a share of any stock market upside. These products are attractive for many investors, as the fear of capital loss is the factor which inhibits most people from taking advantage of long-term growth in equities. But Hypo/F&amp;C's product has also provoked controversy. The bulk of the fund is invested in deposits, to fund the guarantee, and the rest goes into derivatives to buy exposure to the market. F&amp;C calculates that this allows it to guarantee around 60 per cent of the rise in the index for each three-month period. After every three months, you are free to exit. The capital will not have depreciated (unless one of the banks with which it is deposited has gone under), even if the stock market has gone down. If the fund has risen 10 per cent, then, so the theory goes, the investor's money will have risen 10 per cent, and this will be frozen in to the value of the investment. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, names this as his product of the year. Hargreaves has doubts, though. He points out that falling interest rates mean F&amp;C will have to put more money into deposits to back its guarantee. That means buying less exposure to the market - Hargreaves believes it could be as little as 30 per cent of any rise in the index. He says: 'I personally believe that while the F&amp;C product was probably the most innovative product of the year, it has probably been killed by the 3 percentage point base rate cut.' BESSA Blue Chip and Johnson Fry Mortgage Express Flexible Growth Scheme These products, launched at the end of August, changed the face of the business expansion scheme and are likely to dominate the tax shelter market from now until the abolition of the BES at the end of next year. John Bridel, of Towry Law, rates these as the products of the year. There were two new wrinkles which put them ahead of previous schemes. First, they came underwritten by high street banks, offering as much security as small investors could reasonably hope for. Second, they used non-recourse loans to allow investors to realise a return within a year - or even, in the case of BESSA Blue Chip, within six months. This was done solely by relying on the tax relief for top-rate payers. After a year, the banks agreed to make a loan of 76p for every Pounds 1 invested (or, in other words, for every 60p after tax relief), translating into a thumping annual return. The only security for the loans was the BES shares themselves, so people who took the loans were at no risk of being pursued if the investment turned sour. James Capel's Footsie fund The only 'special' thing about this offer is its simplicity. But this is why Graham Hooper, of Chase De Vere, names it his product of the year. Capel's unit trust was well marketed, and undertakes to track the performance of the FT-SE 100 index, the most commonly quoted measure of the UK stock market's performance. It will make no attempt to outperform, but neither will it underperform. As unit trusts tend to underperform their target indices, this fund has every hope of doing better than most, and investors can find out how their money is doing just by checking the latest level of the FT-SE. Indexation has caught on during the year, and this could be the forebear of more tracker funds. Other products More general products for which this was a good year include international bond unit trusts - which, interestingly, were the flavour of the month with fund managers in 1991; on this occasion, the industry appears to have got it right. That said, these funds were helped by the the huge boost they got from sterling's devaluation in September. Average performance for the sector to December 1 was 15.81 per cent, according to Micropal, while the leader, MGM International Bond, achieved growth of 22.14 per cent. What of the real investment 'dogs'? None of our experts thought any individual products deserved to be singled out for this accolade. But several investments proved to be a very bad idea. Those who became Lloyd's 'names' in time to catch the underwriting year of 1989 have not done too well: total losses, payable this year, were Pounds 2.06bn. Gold also lost its glister, even though it is the traditional safe haven in times of international tension and depression. At the start of the year, it was worth Dollars 348.55 a fine ounce. By late December, following some wide fluctuations, this had dwindled to Dollars 335.05. John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says this could be remembered as the 'with-profits year.' In January there was a strong fashion for with-profits bonds, which were sold in some cases as a one-way bet alternative to building societies. By the end of the year, Lautro had rapped several companies for misleading advertising material. Many bonds had been forced to apply market value adjusters (which meant that investors came away with less money than they had invested), and a few offices had withdrawn the bonds because they were putting too much strain on their reserves. A lot of advisers believe this is not the end of the story and that the bonds will prove themselves as long-term investments; but it does not look good. Cole also points out that this has been a bad year for pensions. Final salary schemes are feeling the strain, and money purchase schemes are coming under the dual pressure of indifferent fund performance and falling annuity rates. Meanwhile, the expectation of further legislation - once the Goode committee has reported and the government has decided how to equalise pension ages - is not making the life of the retirement savings industry any easier. But back to fixed-rate mortgages. As we now know, January was a dreadful time to borrow money. Fixed-rate mortgage offers then included 10.55 per cent for three years from Abbey National, or 10.8 over five years. Leeds Permanent offered 11.25 per cent for 20-25 years. At the time, they looked good. But a first-time buyer borrowing at the end of November could have a fixed rate of 6.99 per cent for three years from the Abbey - a third less than was offered 10 months earlier. That offer was worth accepting, and it was snapped up within weeks. Fixed rates are now rising. The other exceptional long-term mortgage offer came from the Halifax, which capped mortgage payments at 9.29 per cent until the year 2000. That offer has also sold out. The smartest savers may be those who fixed their savings back in January. According to Chase De Vere, the best rates for guaranteed income bonds came on January 3: 9.3 per cent over one year from General Portfolio, and 9.35 per cent over five years from Providence Capitol. Anyone who opted for one of those can afford to feel smug as 1993 nears.</p>

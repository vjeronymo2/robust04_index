			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- A Discussion of  Party History and a Study of Party History by the Older  Generation of Revolutionaries is China's first collection  of important documents specially studying the history of the  Communist Party of China. It was recently compiled by the  General Study Group of the Party Literature Research Office  under the CPC Central Committee and published by the Shaanxi  People's Publishing House.    This book collected 92 important documents totalling 650,000  characters on the party's history. They were written from 1926  to 1991, a time span of 65 years, by 31 older generations of  revolutionaries including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi,  Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun. The book is  divided into four parts. The first discusses the significance  of studying party history; the second is about the scientific  attitude and method of studying party history; the third deals  with the basic process, characteristics, experiences, and  lessons of party history; and the last reviews major events in  party history.    Experts are of the view that the book is an important  collection of the works of the older generation of  revolutionaries who analyzed party history from Marxist  standpoints, views, and methods; is a guide for studying party  history and doing research on party history under the new  historical conditions; and will greatly help party members,  cadres, and youth understand and study party history, better  understand China's past, cope with future problems, and enhance  self-awareness and a sense of historical responsibility for  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

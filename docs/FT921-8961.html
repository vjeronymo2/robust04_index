			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Booker to manage Barbadian sugar BOOKER TATE, a subsidiary of Booker, the UK food group, is to take over the management of the troubled Barbados sugar industry for six months. The island's heavily indebted industry is to be placed in receivership at the end of this year's harvest. The contract for Booker Tate's temporary management follows increasing financial problems which saw a shutdown of the Barbados sugar industry late last year. It has been restarted with the assistance of a loan from a British bank. The sugar industry owes a local bank the equivalent of USDollars 87m, and has been troubled by falling production in recent years. The 1991 harvest yielded 65,774 tonnes, the lowest in 60 years, and the industry has been having difficulty meeting its quota commitments to the European Community and the US, and satisfying domestic demand.</p>

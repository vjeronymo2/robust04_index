			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Don't think small when you can think micro If small is beautiful, microscopic must be exquisite. That appears to be the philosophy behind the new Gartmore Micro Index Trust, a closed-end fund for which Gartmore is battling to collect up to Pounds 50m by next Tuesday in tough UK market conditions. However, it claims to have the Pounds 34m institutional allocation safely gathered. Another interpretation of the Micro approach - which is to invest in the London stock market's smallest companies which in aggregate make up 1 per cent of the capitalisation - is that small cap managers are having to dig deeper to find any gold. The MicroCap index is the latest product of two prolific London Business School professors, Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh. They designed the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index in 1986, covering the bottom 10 per cent of the market by capitalisation. Their HGSC index revealed substantial and consistent outperformance over many years of history. It helped to trigger a vogue for smaller company stocks in the UK, mirroring a similar US fashion. But as so often happens, backtesting of statistics has proved to be a poor guide to the future. Small cap outperformance in the UK has melted away: the HGSC index has slightly underperformed the All-Share index over both the past five-year and ten-year periods. Undaunted, Dimson and Marsh have dug deeper. They have dreamed up the HG 1000, covering the bottom 2 per cent of the London market by capitalisation. A Pounds 30m Hoare Govett 1000 Investment Trust was launched last month. Now the still more selective MicroCap index has been licensed to Gartmore. Like the HG 1000 trust the Micro fund is a closed-end index-tracker, a format which recognises poor liquidity at this market fringe. And whatever may have happened over the past few years, small cap fans have enjoyed 1994. The FT-SE 100 index of the biggest blue chips has been the worst-performing of the various UK indices with a negative total return of 6.4 per cent to the end of November. The HGSC index shows minus 2.6 per cent but the HG 1000 (excluding investment trusts) is at plus 3.1 per cent. As for the MicroCap, it has returned 4.7 per cent, outperforming the All-Share by about 11 per cent in eleven months. What about the very long run? From 1955 to 1993 inclusive, the MicroCap achieved an annualised average rate of return of 22.0 per cent, against 18.7 per cent for the HSGC and 14.5 per cent for the All-Share. An extra 7.5 per cent a year is extraordinary. Where does the extra performance come from? At the bottom of the market lies an odd collection of the has-been and the never-was, plus the odd gems in turnrounds and shells. Right now there are recovery hopes and above-average exposure to manufacturing. Micro companies are cheap on the basis of share price to sales, but not on price to earnings. The fund offers institutions the chance to diversify into a market sector where they probably are not already exposed. Gartmore's statistics suggest cheekily that MicroCap returns have been higher and less volatile than Hong Kong's. But on the basis of its often troubled constituents this is more of a submerging than an emerging market. True, there is an enhanced small company effect, a higher return which probably relates to the poor liquidity and high specific risk when you scrape the bottom of the stock market's barrel. There is also a rebalancing effect, similar to that recently discussed in the rather different context of pension fund asset allocation strategy. Here the rebalancing arises from the way the MicroCap index is constructed, with the more successful constituents climbing out but weak companies sinking in. A manager tracking the index is forced to take profits on winners and reinvest in losers. So long as enough losers recover - which in deep recessions they may not - this recycling process is likely to add value. Let's hope so. Although the micro formula may have worked over 40 years and over one year it has struggled since the late 1980s. But with Pounds 80m of new money going into the bottom 2 per cent of the UK market the dogs may be about to have their day.</p>

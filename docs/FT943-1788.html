			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Jostling for position in German telecoms race: Christopher Parkes sees RWE Energie join a stampede to the Infobahn Convinced that they have heard the bell for the last lap, front-runners among Germany's private telecommunications companies are dashing to qualify for entry to Europe's 'information superhighway' stakes. The mixed bunch of power suppliers, engineers and bankers have put on a spurt since Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post office minister, announced 10 days ago that he would allow free competition in the German telecoms network from January 1, 1998 rather than the end of the decade. RWE Energie attempted to nose ahead yesterday with an announcement that it was in 'promising' negotiations to take over Preussag's communications business, Mobilfunk. But as Preussag was quick to point out, RWE was only one of several domestic and international network operators discussing a possible tie-up. Mobilfunk, which runs the Europe-wide AssCarfi/Talkline mobile telephone service, is expected to show its first profit this year on sales of DM400m (Pounds 165m). RWE's announcement was a response to Veba's tactical stroke earlier this week when the energy-based conglomerate revealed that its network, of 5,600km of copper cable and optical links over its 2,000km of electricity distribution lines, was to be augmented by access to the federal railways' vast trackside and signalling system. Veba also agreed to invest Dollars 140m (Pounds 90m) in the Iridium communications satellite consortium in return for rights to market its services. The events sparked by Mr Botsch's statement on deregulation highlight the speed at which Germany's private sector communications industry is developing and its direction. The industry started to take shape in 1990, when Mannesmann, heading a consortium including Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless and Pacific Telesis of the US, was awarded a licence to operate the country's first private mobile telephone service, D2, in competition with Deutsche Telekom's D1. Critics looked askance as Mannesmann, better known for its 'old technology' products - steel pipes, car components and industrial plant - moved into unknown territory. More questions were asked as set-up costs mounted and delays set in. However, since the first hand-sets were delivered in mid-1992, estimations have rocketed. Mannesmann's communications business, which contributed 3 per cent to group sales last year, is now forecast to yield up to half group profits in 1997. Mannesmann's newly-established Eurokom subsidiary, which includes an assortment of domestic and foreign stakes, owns half of a new joint venture with RWE and Deutsche Bank. They are now preparing to open their lines to corporate clients for data, voice and image transmission  - in a domestic segment estimated to be worth DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) a year - and waiting to offer services up to a wider international public. RWE is involved in other ventures specialising in corporate services. It made an important advance in May, when, as a leader of a data transmission consortium it beat the Viag group in a bid for a licence allowing the first private sector challenge to Telekom's Modacom. Until yesterday, when it revealed its hand in its negotiations with Preussag, its expectations of achieving DM500m sales in five years had been conditioned by its highly-conservative assessments of prospects in the corporate sector. With its internal network, the second most extensive after Deutsche Bahn's, it has now emerged as a clear contender for a place among the leaders. Mr Ulrich Hartmann, chairman of Veba, outlined his claim to a pole position in April when he declared telecoms was to be the group's fifth leg, augmenting its solid activities such as power, oil, chemicals and trading. The group started laying optical fibres along the power lines of its PreussenElektra subsidiary in the late 1980s, but the pace has increased steadily in the past two years with stakes which have taken it into the mobile phone business in Germany and France, corporate networks and services and Swiss cable television. Veba has now revealed the scale of its ambition. According to Mr Hartmann, the group will invest DM6bn in telecoms over the next decade. Turnover from the sector will grow from DM140m this year to DM8bn by 2003. Deutsche Telekom, facing private competitors who claim they can win 40 per cent of its business, can be counted on to continue appealing for more time to brace itself for the onslaught, but Mr Botsch has made his preferences plain. The sooner the nascent private telecoms industry is given scope to grow and mature on its home ground, the greater its chances of building up muscle and speed to compete effectively in the fast-track global market.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Long View: Hurdles after the holiday SO Westminster's politicians have gone off early on their holidays, which puts the panorama of rising unemployment, sliding production and upwardly- mobile interest rates into its true political perspective. It is apparently not very serious. The Bundesbank council has departed on holiday too, but only after giving the rest of Europe a fright. It is still not absolutely clear that the UK will be able to avoid supporting sterling with higher interest rates. The important point, perhaps, is that rates certainly will not be coming down for many months, and a really substantial decline may be years off. And if nominal rates stay unchanged while inflation is falling the real rate will be going up. Meanwhile, John Major and Norman Lamont have delivered their end-of-term sermons on economic policy. There is, they say, no alternative to sweating it out within the exchange rate mechanism, inflation should be brought down to zero, interest rates are not all that high really. And by the way, the economic recovery is about to start - although why business should pick up in the autumn if it failed to respond to the post-election euphoria in May is not at all clear. True, the increasingly troublesome backbench Tory MPs are naive in the extreme if they believe there is any easy way out. High short-term interest rates may seem like tough medicine, but on the other hand it is only membership of the ERM that has made it possible to fund the fiscal deficit so easily and (relatively) cheaply thus far. In June the monthly public sector borrowing requirement topped Pounds 4bn, or Pounds 75 per capita; without the protection of the ERM umbrella the present fiscal policy would soon prove untenable. However, there is a dark suspicion that the government is primarily following a party political agenda. After a couple of grim years the pressure will slowly be released and there will be two years of accelerating boom up to the next election. Nigel Lawson's post-election over-eagerness in 1987 and 1988 will certainly not be repeated. Celebrate your victory in the Labour leadership election, John Smith, but then eat your heart out. It might indeed look like a good scheme to political strategists at Conservative Central Office, but there are grave doubts that the government has any great understanding of what is really going on out there in the economy. Already its policies have destroyed the wealth of hundreds of thousands of young home-buyers and small businessmen who were conditioned to assume that inflationary trends would continue. Just five years ago, for instance, youngsters were being encouraged to beat a deadline for multiple mortgage interest tax allowances on shared homes, and will have subsequently lost a great deal of money because of falls in house prices. Small entrepreneurs routinely pledged the equity in their homes to obtain bank finance for their businesses, and many are now ruined. The government has never apologised for this, and maybe it is all water under the bridge. But the future is another matter. If John Major is serious about reducing inflation to zero he should stop making nonsensical claims about economic recovery and he should warn people to repay their debts and avoid taking on new mortgage commitments or business obligations in what could be a very dangerous period ahead. After all, the UK is trapped vulnerably between beggar-my-neighbour US and beggar-my-partner Germany. Ahead the hurdles loom, one after another. To begin with, we have the public spending problem. If the economy undershoots its growth targets by a percentage point this year and maybe twice as much next year the already daunting borrowing projections will have to be ratcheted much higher. In the past, similarly large deficits have only been financed at the cost of lurches from one crisis to the next. So far it has been easy for the government to sell gilts. You can argue that it has been at the expense of the private sector as the big investment institutions have begun to switch towards gilts and away from equities, with the result that new flotations have flopped and companies have been discouraged from coming to the market with rights issues. Again, that kind of crowding out does not make it any easier to believe in an economic recovery. The building societies, too, are suffering from the competition for deposits from National Savings, as Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester made clear yesterday. And although the financing of the public sector deficit has been smooth, it is already noticeable that the foreigners who were such keen buyers of gilts last autumn and winter have lost their appetite: fortunately the domestic buyers have more than compensated during the past few months. Another hurdle could appear in the shape of a balance of payments deterioration. Sterling is now a good 20 per cent overvalued in terms of the dollar, while economic growth rates - and thus export prospects  - are slowing elsewhere within the European Community. The trade deficit seems to be on a worsening trend. However, this problem may only become acute if we have a significant economic recovery, which does not seem very likely. Then there is the banking system. Could this prove the government's Achilles heel? Bankers are starting to worry about a renewed dip in the economy, with serious implications for bad debts and a further wave of bankruptcies. The last thing that bankers with long lists of tottering clients want is a high level of interest rates. In these conditions asset prices will drift further, whereas financiers desperately need some inflation in property and share values so that security can be realised at good prices and in buoyant market conditions. Has Norman Lamont thought about this? He should, even on holiday.</p>

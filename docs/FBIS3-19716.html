At his 10 February meeting with the prime minister, the  Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president proposed  to him the broad outline of this negotiation, and they have  discussed these aims over the telephone since then, without its  being ruled out that Pujol may convey them to him in writing.    CiU's intention is that these aims could be achieved in  1994,  although not necessarily completely, but at least that they  should be well under way with a view to their later resolution,  since Pujol expects progress to be made in this dialogue before  deciding on his support for the state budgets for 1995. This  negotiation, which will be examined by the liaison committee  between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and Democratic Union  of Catalonia today, is being conducted discreetly in order to  avoid the suspicions that it could otherwise arouse in certain  political and social circles; although it is proceeding at a  very slow pace right now, it is Pujol's intention to accelerate  it after the Spanish Socialist Workers Party congress.    The point that Pujol deems crucial for making possible a  different implementation of autonomy -- which he believes to be  perfectly feasible by virtue of the diversity allowed by the  Constitution -- is that of the basic laws, which must not  encroach upon the autonomous communities' exercise of their  powers. For this reason, CiU proposes that some that have  interpreted the [autonomy] statute in a restrictive manner be  amended.    The extension of the duties of the Mossos d'Esquadra  [autonomous police force] is another aspect that Pujol deems  essential and that Councillor Maria Eugenia Cuenca and  [Interior] Minister Antoni Asuncion have already discussed at  several meetings. The negotiation, which is believed to be well  under way, has as its basis the autonomous police bill and could  include some formula for integrating the National Police into  what is believed should be the Catalan police, comprising as  basic elements the Mossos d'Esquadra and the local police forces.    Turning the Generalitat into the state's ordinary  administration in Catalonia -- the single administration in  Manuel Fraga's terminology -- is also on the agenda, and has  already been achieved with respect to agriculture, on which an  agreement was signed 15 February. In the sphere of justice, CiU  is seeking a reform of the Organic Law of the Judiciary, which,  according to coalition sources, the minister is already  preparing.    Regional planning is also among CiU's aims, especially with  respect to coordination on the investments that the state makes  in Catalonia, the Generalitat's involvement in the cohesion  funds from the European Union, and the demand that the  government respect autonomous powers concerning the environment.  Public health funding is the last major area that Pujol wants  unblocked. On this point, the Generalitat has the support of  the Andalusian Junta [autonomous government].</p>

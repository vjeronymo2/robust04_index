			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH MAGIC OUT, KAREEM WILL PLAY IN THE NBA ALL-STAR GAME  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be playing in Sunday's National Basketball Assn.  All-Star game in his 20th, and final, professional season, after all.  </P> <P> David Stern, the NBA commissioner, on Thursday selected Abdul-Jabbar as the  Western Conference roster replacement for Laker guard Magic Johnson, who  partially tore his left hamstring Wednesday night against the Golden State  Warriors.  </P> <P> Stern, in a prepared statement, said he chose the 41-year-old Laker center  because he finished with the next-highest vote total from Western Conference  coaches.  </P> <P> In previous years, however, the league has replaced an injured player with the  most deserving player at the same position. Stern's action means that the  Western Conference will play with only one true point guard, Utah's John  Stockton, and three reserve centers.  </P> <P> Laker Coach Pat Riley, who will coach the West, had indicated Wednesday night  that he needed another guard on his roster, the likely candidate being Denver's  Lafayette Lever. Golden State Warriors forward Chris Mullin could move to  off-guard, joining Seattle's Dale Ellis and Portland's Clyde Crexler, but Riley  still has only one ballhandler.  </P> <P> Riley could not be reached Thursday night, but he had said Wednesday night that  he hoped Stern would select a guard.  </P> <P> Last week, however, Riley had said that Abdul-Jabbar should have been voted  onto the team by the coaches because of his contributions to the game.  </P> <P> In announcing Abdul-Jabbar's selection, Stern said: " . . . More importantly,  his participation in one more All-Star game is a fitting tribute to his  unequaled NBA career."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar now has been named to the All-Star team in 19 of his 20 seasons.  He has played in 18 of the games, missing the 1973 game because of an injury.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lakers said that Johnson underwent treatment on his left  hamstring Thursday morning and was scheduled to have another electrical  stimulation treatment Thursday night. Johnson's condition will be evaluated  Monday in an effort to determine the severity of the injury and probable length  of rehabilitation.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report COPPER prices led a general rally from morning lows at the London Metal Exchange, but aluminium nickel and tin prices still finished down on the day. Copper's early fall had found support, dealers said, and an upturn in the afternoon was encouraged by a firmer tone for the metal on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex). Sterling's weakness made the crucial difference, however, turning a Dollars 9 fall for three months metal into a Pounds 23.50-a-tonne rise from Friday's kerb (afterhours) close. ZINC followed copper, but the market was thin as buyers disappeared at the first signs of selling interest. At the close three months zinc was up only Dollars 6.50 on the day at Dollars 1,045 a tonne and by the end of kerb trading it was showing a Dollars 4 fall from the same point on Friday. NICKEL struggled to maintain its rally, even after news of the expected setback to Cuba's 1992 production (see story above). Three months nickel closed on the LME at Dollars 5,415 a tonne, down Dollars 82.50 from Friday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

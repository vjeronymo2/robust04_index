			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / MPs to get options in Sunday trade bill THE GOVERNMENT is likely to offer MPs a free vote on a range of options for the reform of Sunday trading in England and Wales in a bill it hopes to table before the end of the present parliamentary session. The options are expected to range from full deregulation on the Scottish model to a tightening of existing laws along the lines advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign. A government statement is expected before Christmas. Once a package is agreed, the government would use the whips to attempt to ensure that it becomes law. Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, conceded yesterday that the proposed strategy was not foolproof - it was possible that none of the choices would command majority support and one contradictory and anomalous regime could be exchanged for another. He said the government was prepared to make 'an act of faith' in the belief that MPs would be prepared to compromise in the interests of speeding reform. Employee protection measures were likely to be similar to those in the defeated 1986 bill, including protection against terms of employment being changed to require Sunday working, he said. Mr Lloyd accepted that the present widely flouted regime was unlikely to be replaced before 1994. The drafting of legislation must await a decision by the European Court - expected in autumn or early next year  - on whether the present law was overridden by the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome. The announcement was welcomed by reform campaigners, whose proposals are likely to form the basis of the options presented to MPs. Mr Roger Boaden, director of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, said: 'It is a tremendous victory for shoppers who will soon have the freedom to shop when they want and for shop workers who will benefit from the protection the government has promised.' His views were echoed in part by the Consumers' Association, which praised the government for committing itself to 'reform of this unholy shambles'. It added: 'Hundreds of thousands of consumers have been voting with their feet to legalise Sunday trading. Reform must mean an unrestricted claim to one of the most basic rights - choice.' The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since 1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986. A private members' bill advocating reforms along the lines of proposals drawn up by the Keep Sunday Special campaign is due to be debated in the House of Commons early next year.</p>

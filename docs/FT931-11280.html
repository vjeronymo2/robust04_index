			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells poultry operation HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, has sold its Sandycroft poultry operation to Marshall Food Group, a private company based in Newbridge, Midlothian. The price was not disclosed, but is thought to be under Pounds 10m. Marshall is one of the largest poultry processing concerns in the UK and also makes convenience foods. It achieved turnover in the 1990-91 of Pounds 141m. Hillsdown bought Sandycroft, which has 24 farms, a hatchery, a processing plant and a breeder unit, as part of the acquisition of JP Wood from Unigate a year ago. The group said the sale was part of reorganisation of its own and Wood's capacity. That programme was not complete but Hillsdown said it was within timetable and budget. The poultry market had been suffering from competitive imports until sterling left the Although the currency's fall meant feed costs were higher, Hillsdown said the improvement in the industry had helped its reorganisation programme. Hillsdown shares were unchanged at 148p.</p>

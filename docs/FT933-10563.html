			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt strengthens after ERM developments CONTINENTAL bourses were generally encouraged by weekend developments, although some consolidation might be expected over the next few days as the expected round of interest rate cuts has, in many cases, already been discounted, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT surprised many analysts by rising on the day, the DAX index closing 11.85 higher at 1,815.08, having moved between a range of 1,823 and 1,795. Turnover was DM6bn. However, activity was reported as being confused after the weekend's events, and the market is generally expected to remain slightly volatile until longer term European trends become visible. In spite of the likely loss of competitiveness in export markets, companies with exposure did not suffer the expected declines. Volkswagen for instance rose slightly, by 30 pfg to DM348.50, while BMW gained 50 pfg to DM544.00. Mr Patrick Shields, of NatWest Securities, also noted strength in stores, Karstadt was up DM14 or 2.5 per cent at DM575, and financials; while Viag, up DM12.80 at DM436.50, was still benefiting from week old news of its increased stake in Bayernwerke. Allianz, one of the day's biggest gainers, up DM55 at DM2,315, was helped by a buy recommendation from a domestic institution. PARIS continued its uninterrupted rally with the CAC-40 index nudging close to the all time record high, finishing up 43.15 or 2 per cent at 2,129.03. Turnover eased back to FFr6.8bn from Friday's massive FFr11.5bn, Goldman Sachs yesterday raised its 12-month forecast for the CAC-40 to between 2,600-2,700, with expectations that it will reach 2,300 within the next quarter. Among the movers Axa gained FFr30 to FFr1,480, SocGen FFr22 to FFr662, Bouygues FFr13 to FFr705, Carrefour FFr113 to FFr3,118 and LVMH by FFr69 to FFr4,194. AMSTERDAM drifted lower amid concern over the export sector, although there were some notable exceptions to the general trend. The CBS Tendency index ended off 1.20 or 1 per cent at 120.80. Nomura's global equity strategists see a buying opportunity in the Netherlands, recommending a switch into Dutch equities from France and Switzerland, forecasting that the market will benefit from dollar strength. Akzo, which releases second quarter results tomorrow, and Aegon were among the day's gainers, with respective gains of 30 cents and Fl 1.30 to Fl 167.80 and Fl 87.60. Polygram, due to release first half figures today, was off 50 cents at Fl 55.90, and Philips down 10 cents at Fl 31.10. BRUSSELS put on 1.4 per cent to an all-time high with the strength of the dollar improving the prospects for exporters. The Bel-20 index rose 18.27 to 1,344.63 in turnover of almost BFr1.57bn. Electrabel, the interest rate sensitive electricity utility, was the day's most active issue, rising BFr20 to BFr6,260. MADRID moved firmly ahead at the opening, pulled higher by the strength of equities and bond futures, but a subsequent strengthening of the peseta against the dollar left many domestic investors taking profits. The general index rose 2.78 to 272.74. Gains were seen across the board but foreigners were active buyers of banks. Argentaria led the sector higher, rising Pta210 to Pta5,560, with Banesto Pta55 ahead at Pta2,225, BCH Pta20 ahead at Pta3,710 and BBV Pta60 firmer at Pta3,290. LISBON's BTA index rose 38.7 or 1.7 per cent to 2,296.3 as the central bank cut its emergency rate for one day lending to resident banks to 13 per cent from 14.5 per cent. MILAN gave up some ground after a late round of profit-taking and the Comit index finished 9.38 ahead at 572.81. Trading was dominated by foreign demand for telecommunications issues. Sip, the domestic telephone company, rose L59 to L2,973 in volume of 13.2m shares while Stet, its parent, added L78 to L4,049 with almost 11m shares traded. ZURICH was little changed as investors turned their attention to other European markets and the SMI index finished 0.6 lower at 2,400.3. VIENNA rebounded from opening levels in healthy volumes and the ATX index gained 2.03 to 950.62, having picked up from a day's low of 929.36. The early weakness was attributed to uncertainty in the wake of Europe's currency turmoil, but the market received reassurance when German shares began to gain. COPENHAGEN closed 4 per cent ahead, the KFX index ending at 95.65. Unibank Securities commented that the market has lagged the rest of Europe because of the central bank's efforts to avoid a devaluation of the currency. 'Over the last month the market has risen 1.1 per cent, while the Eurotrack has risen by 6.7 per cent. However, following the ERM agreement the krone will now fluctuate within a wider band ..with market estimates of between 5-10 per cent'. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index recorded another year's high, up 4.70 at 1,207.70. In HELSINKI the HEX index added 1.6 per cent, closing at 1,310.2, while NORWAY's All Share index was little altered, losing 0.16 to 531.26. ISTANBUL rose 2.16 per cent as the market overcame uncertainty following last Friday's resignation of Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor, and the market index added 218.3 to 10,295.9. Mr Saracoglu had quarrelled with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller over her plans to cut interest rates and use central bank funds to finance deficits.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- August 2                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1247.28      1248.96      1249.49      1251.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1355.62      1350.99      1352.32      1353.94                           13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1256.37      1253.45      1251.95      1252.49 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1351.69      1352.65      1347.41      1347.49  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 30    Jul 29    Jul 28    Jul 27    Jul 26 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1253.91   1242.42   1238.35   1238.95   1240.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1343.59   1308.99   1297.56   1297.42   1294.91  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1256.51 ; 200 - 1355.69 Low/day: 100 - 1247.13  200 - 1346.20.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / BOC finance director moves to Tiphook Mr Ian Clubb, BOC's finance director, yesterday resigned to become non-executive chairman of Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group. The decision surprised analysts and institutional investors. 'After the departure of chairman Pat Rich earlier this year, this is rather unsettling. There have been a few too many changes,' said one analyst. The industrial gases and healthcare group said Mr Clubb, 53, had resigned. 'There is no question that he has been pushed. He wanted a change of life-style, away from executive to non-executive,' said Mr Christopher Marsay, BOC's investor relations manager. 'There will still be plenty of continuity at BOC. Mr Clubb will still be available to us as a consultant, and the heads of our three divisions remain in place.' Mr Clubb, who joined the company from British Satellite Broadcasting in 1991, will leave at the end of September. A successor had not been appointed, and was likely to be found outside the company, said Mr Marsay. Mr Rich resigned as chairman in April for reasons of ill health. He was replaced - in a non-executive role - by BOC's former chairman, Mr Richard Giordano, who had stepped down only two years earlier. Mr Giordano is also non-executive chairman of British Gas. Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer, 61, former executive with Air Products, the US industrial gases group, took over the role of chief executive from Mr Rich last year. Analysts speculated yesterday that Mr Dyer might have clashed with Mr Clubb. Mr Clubb will succeed Mr Rupert Hambro as chairman of Tiphook after the company's annual general meeting, which is expected in September. Mr Hambro will remain on the board as a non-executive director. Mr Hambro, who joined Tiphook in 1990, took over as temporary as chairman in March, after Mr Robert Montague, the group's controversial founder, stepped down but remained chief executive. Tiphook escaped liquidation in March by selling its biggest asset, its container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for an initial Pounds 673m. Tiphook still has debts of about Pounds 500m. Mr Hambro said: 'Ian Clubb's wide financial experience will add much, in particular, to the strengthening of the group's financial disciplines. 'With the sale of the container business behind us, the company is now making some headway. The management continues to concentrate on reducing costs, maximising cash flows and winning new business.' BOC shares closed down 10p at 683p. Tiphook's rose 2p to 51p.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: So where does the market go now? - Scheherazade Daneshkhu asks fund managers to pilot private investors through its choppy waters THE STOCK market has had a strong start to the year with the FT-SE 100 touching an all-time high of 2,900 last week, although it had fallen back to 2,843 by last night. How, then, should private investors, especially those with large cash holdings who have been disappointed by the fall in interest rates, view their prospects? The Weekend FT asked investment strategists from large institutions for their opinions on the market over the short and long terms. All agreed it would outperform fixed-interest instruments, such as gilts, in the long term but there were differences about the extent. Norwich Union Investment strategist Mike Grimble says: 'The market has been strong since the beginning of 1993 but we have short-term concerns, arising mainly out of what will happen to UK interest rates. 'Our short-term view is that there will be a cut in base rates before the Budget, which will have a positive effect on the market because it will demonstrate the government's strong commitment to growth. Some of that expectation has already been factored in to the present level of the market. 'In the medium to long term, we are expecting earnings and profits to recover and better dividend growth prospects. We are expecting an upturn in economic activity, but it is difficult to know how quickly it will pick up. We would expect the FT-SE 100 to end the year at 3,000 and to rise to 3,300 at the end of 1994. 'There will certainly be volatility, particularly in the first half of the year as the market responds to interest rate cuts. It should be more subdued in the second half. Investors should expect large day-by-day movements but the tendency of the market will be upwards. 'Gilts will benefit in the short term, but the overhang of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) will depress the longer-term outlook. 'We are expecting a low inflation and low interest rate environment in the long term. There may be some short-term inflationary effects from sterling's devaluation as a result of leaving the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), but we do not expect a return to high inflation. Our estimate for the year-end is 2.5 per cent, with this figure rising a little in 1994 but not to a major degree. 'In the long term, we still expect equities to outperform fixed-interest instruments, but we do not expect the difference to be as great as it was in the past. Our projection is that the average annual real return on equities in the 1990s will be 8 per cent compared with 15 per cent in the 1980s. The corresponding figure for fixed-interest instruments will be 6 per cent in the 1990s compared with 7 per cent in the 1980s.' Henderson Crosthwaite Research director Eric Hathorn is cautious. 'We remain confident that the index will end the year higher than at the beginning because certain benefits will come through. I see Footsie at over 3,000 by the end of the year, but not much more than that. By the end of next year it should be up to 3,300, but only if there is no major crisis. 'My reasons for thinking the index will be higher is that companies involved in overseas trade will get a boost, particularly those with US subsidiaries. In addition, UK companies have pared themselves to the bone in the recession and, if we assume some extra loading on their plants, the gearing effect should be strong. But expectations of a very strong boost to exporters may be exaggerated, since obvious export markets such as Europe are depressed. 'We also have fears that the market may be fully valued. Expectations that there will be strong profit growth in 1993 have been factored in. But demand would have to pick up pretty quickly to reverse closures which are still continuing. There are also fears regarding the balance of payments, particularly if interest rates were to come down too far. We also worry that inflation will rise. 'The good side is that there still is a lot of private money to come into the market. Against that is the PSBR demand. The government will rely on gilt issues to fund it, so there will be competition for institutional money from gilts. The effect will be to depress the equity market. By the end of the 1990s, I would see the average annual real rate of return on equities as not higher than 11 per cent, compared with 15 per cent in the 1980s. Inflation helped to fuel share price performance in the 1980s, but that performance will be more modest in the 1990s because of lower inflation.' SG Warburg Its UK economist, Kevin Gardiner, says: 'True, the market has risen quite sharply. It reached the level of our year-end forecast of 2,900 last week. We do not expect the level to be higher than this at the end of the year because we expect rights issues to cap the overall level of the market. In recent history, only in 1987 was the price/earnings ratio higher on the market than today's 17. We foresee the p/e ratio falling back to 15 at the end of the year. 'We believe that the current yield of 4.25 per cent on the market compares favourably with current returns from banks and building societies. We expect bad news in one or two areas which make us believe that in 1993 it will pay to pick stock carefully. And the old motto, 'Never invest what you cannot afford to lose,' holds as good now as ever. 'In recent months, institutional investors have pushed up the price of stocks in the capital goods sector in areas such as building materials, heavy engineering and construction. However, we believe there are dividend cuts to come which will affect the price of these stocks. We favour strong balance sheet sectors such as utilities, some textile companies, food retailing and the media. These companies are not as dependent as the capital goods industries on a revival of strong demand in the market. 'The economy will pick up steam in 1994, but we expect interest rates to edge up to 8 per cent at the end of the year because of increased inflation. Unit wage costs are falling, which will keep inflation subdued in the short term, but we would see the underlying rate at 4.2 per cent at the end of the year and 4.5 per cent in 1994.' UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Mark Brown, the chief UK strategist, is relatively cautious about the market's performance in the short term. He expects Footsie to drop to 2,700 by mid-year but to end it at 2,900. 'We have been positive for the past two years but, since last November, I have turned cautious, mainly because the market has done so well by anticipating recovery. The return on equities has averaged 20 per cent per annum in the past two years and that cannot continue. 'The other reason for caution is the obvious. The government will have to face its funding problem in the next financial year. The PSBR will put pressure on sterling and the government will have to change course on its funding policy, which will be difficult for the markets to take. We think the market is being too complacent about this. In the longer term, say two to five years, equities are the place to be in, compared with other assets such as gilts or cash. 'In the past 10 years, the average annual real return on equities was 13.4 per cent compared with 6.3 per cent from gilts and 6.2 per cent from cash. Our assessment for the next five years is that the total annual real return on equities will be 8 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent on gilts. Inflation would average 5 per cent a year over the next five years. 'It is normally not the best time to buy into the market when it is rising but, historically, investors have tended to do this. The market would appear to be on the expensive side on a p/e ratio; it is also on the expensive side using the dividend yield on the FT-All Share, which is 4.3 compared with an historical average of 5. But you have to weigh this against very low short-term interest rates. 'However, if Footsie does get down to 2,700, that would be a more comfortable level at which investors could enter. Our main advice to private investors would be to think also of putting money into bond instruments and overseas equities. Overseas bond funds look particularly attractive.' BZW Bill Smith, the head of UK research, also believes that, given the options, savers with money on deposit should be looking elsewhere, particularly at index-linked gilts and equities. 'On the income side, there is no longer a big income penalty in owning shares because of the last cut in base rates. But there will still be capital risk because the market is volatile. 'There is a high valuation on the market because of the low earnings picture, and the first year of a recovery is always going to be risky. Private investors could try to lessen risk by spreading it through the use of collective funds such as unit and investment trusts. 'The main problem facing the market is that the government, in its need to finance the PSBR, will structure its own financing needs sufficiently attractively to make shares less appealing. We still see Footsie reaching 3,100 by the end of the year.' Capel-Cure Myers Simon Rubinsohn, the portfolio strategist, provided the most bullish outlook. He expects Footsie to rise to 3,300 by the end of this year and 3,600 at the end of 1994. 'We haven't had much good news from companies but, as they report their results, we expect the chairmen's statements to be positive. This along with signs of profitability emerging, will help sentiment. 'We also take a relaxed view of the influence of the PSBR on the gilt market. There will be underfunding, but we do not think that the government will necessarily be obliged to push up gilt yields to sell its stock. 'We have quite a high exposure to index-linked gilts, which we are maintaining, but we are moving out of conventional gilts into equities because we feel that, within the next year, the real returns available on them will be less than for equities. 'The sectors we favour are capital goods such as building materials, electricals and engineering, and the 'second-liners' such as FT-SE 250 stock. We are cautious on stores because we do not see a consumer pick-up in sectors such as health and household. Companies with dollar exposure should do well: we expect the dollar to strengthen to Dollars 1.30 to the pound by the end of the year. We are also optimistic about inflation and think it will average 2.7 per cent by the end of this year and 3.7 per cent next year.'</p>

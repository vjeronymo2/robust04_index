			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / CS chief plays down fears over Austrian bank bid Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, yesterday said that Creditanstalt would remain 'a proud and independent Austrian bank with its own identity' if his Swiss financial group succeeded in winning control. Mr Gut said he was well aware of political opposition to the efforts of CS Holding to take control of Creditanstalt, Austria's banking flagship. He felt his group had an even chance of winning control against competition from a rival Austrian-led consortium. Mr Gut said he would prefer to buy all the government's 49 per cent stake in Creditanstalt which offers 70 per cent of voting stock, but would also be content with a smaller stake in the short-term. He declined to disclose his offer price. Based on Creditanstalt's share price, the government stake is worth about Sch14bn (Dollars 1.2bn). Mr Gut was in Vienna to meet Mr Ferdinand Lacina, Austria's finance minister, who wants to privatise Creditanstalt quickly, and to encourage public support for his offer. Mr Lacina has said that his decision will not be based on price but on national interest and the interests of Creditanstalt. 'The CS bid for a large stake currently owned by the Austrian government should not be seen as a 'Swiss solution' but an international solution,' he added. Mr Gut's earlier announcement that CS Holding is aiming for 100 per cent control of Creditanstalt has aroused controversy in Austria and led to the formation of the rival bid. It is made up of Creditanstalt, Generali, the Italian insurer, Commerzbank of Germany and several Austrian institutions. Mr Lacina, a social democrat, favours the CS Holding bid, but his coalition partners from the conservative People's Party fear they would lose political influence over the traditionally conservative bank. The CS Holding offer has also stirred up fears of foreign domination in the Austrian economy. Similar sentiments were voiced before the referendum on EU membership last Sunday. The outcome of a bidding race for Creditanstalt is quite open, financial sources say. CS Holding sees Creditanstalt, with its strong position in Austria and central Europe, as a perfect supplement to its subsidiaries which include Credit Suisse, Schweizer Polksbank and CSSB. 'We do not step on each other's toes, we are a perfect match,' Mr Gut said. Creditanstalt would gain from CS's capital, technological assets and international strength.</p>

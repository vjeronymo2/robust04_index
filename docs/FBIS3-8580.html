			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- Former Deputy Premier  Roman Kovac confirmed to CTK today that several parties had  proposed he become the new Slovak premier.    The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will  "almost certainly" be addressed when the new government is  formed, said Kovac, who was recently expelled from the HZDS  following his criticism of former Premier Vladimir Meciar. The  composition of the government will be decided within a week, he  added.    Leader of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan  Carnogursky called September the most likely election date. "I  hope parliament will pass the constitutional law setting the  date for early elections in the autumn," he added.    Carnogursky ruled out the possibility that he would join the  new government, adding that the idea that the cabinet be formed  without political leaders was correct.    "A new cabinet can be formed within a few hours," former  chairman of the Slovak National Party Ludovit Cernak said. "All  the parties are ready to put an end to feuds and to agree on a  broad coalition government which will lead Slovakia to early  elections," he said.    "I believe ethnic Hungarian parties will not make  extravagant  claims because all the parties have pledged to set their own  needs aside," Cernak said. He confirmed he respected the  preliminary agreement providing for the absence of political  leaders in the provisional government.</p>

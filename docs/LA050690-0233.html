			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: DONNA DEAREST  </P> <P> To most of Hilldale, Donna Stone is the perfect wife and mother. But those who  watch her every move on Nickelodeon know that she can be a tyrant.  </P> <P> Take the time she grounded the kids for disobeying her. Or when she made a  thoughtless deliveryman go back and get the right item. Once she even got  annoyed at daughter Mary for expecting her to make all her decisions.  </P> <P> The only reason she isn't always a monster is that she's too busy keeping the  house spotless, waiting on her husband and children, doing charity work and  solving the community's problems.  </P> <P> If you don't believe there is a dark side of Donna, just tune in to  Nickelodeon's "The Donna Reed Show" marathon, which begins Sunday and runs  through next Sunday-Mother's Day. This marathon isn't afraid to show Donna  Dearest at her best and worst. The Donna-thon preempts regular Nick at Nite  programming (from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.).  </P> <P> In some of her better moments this week, Donna will help out Buster Keaton  (Tuesday at 2:30 a.m.), learn a lesson from trumpeter Harry James (Thursday at  5:30 a.m.) and inspire singer Tony Martin (Saturday at 2:30 a.m.).  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs leave Arjo 36% lower at Pounds 63m ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the first six months to June 30 down 36 per cent from Pounds 99.1m to Pounds 63m. Earnings per share fell 52 per cent from 7.5p to 3.6p. This was partly because of lower selling prices, but also a Pounds 14.6m provision for restructuring at the Cesea Spanish pulp and forestry operations and the German Buhl decorative paper business. A quarter of the workforce at Cesea will be cut, and Buhl's mill at Ettlingen is being closed. Without the restructuring costs, earnings per share fell 28 per cent to 5.4p. The company also booked an Pounds 8.8m loss on foreign currency loans for the Portuguese Soporcel operations following the devaluation of the escudo. Since June there have been further devaluations. The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.65p. Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the business climate continued to be arduous. Recovery in the US and UK remained subdued and uneven. Poor demand in continental Europe and overcapacity affecting several product ranges would continue to restrict the group's profit recovery prospects until at least the second half of next year. The company intends to secure a listing on the Paris Bourse later this year. Mr Stenham said the aim of the listing would be to widen AWA's shareholder base. The undue influence of AWA's minority French shareholders have caused concern among some UK institutions. The results were achieved on turnover up 10 per cent from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.43bn. At constant exchange rates, sales volumes were up 1 per cent, but prices fell 5 per cent. Operating profits, including the exceptional items, dropped from Pounds 112m to Pounds 89m. European paper manufacturing turnover increased from Pounds 637m to Pounds 676m, but fell 8 per cent at constant exchange rates. Cost savings only partly offset price cuts, leading to trading profits down from Pounds 51m to Pounds 25m after the exceptional restructuring costs. The Appleton North American operations' trading profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 71.4m, or 12 per cent in dollar terms. US paper operations increased their sales 4 per cent from Dollars 519m to Dollars 540m. Debt increased to Pounds 351m, compared with Pounds 286m a year earlier thanks to high capital expenditure of Pounds 98m and the take up of shares during a Soporcel rights issue. Interest costs increased from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 18.8m.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): We are what we consume / Finance PURSUING HAPPINESS: AMERICAN CONSUMERS IN THE 20TH CENTURY by Stanley Lebergott Princeton University Press Pounds 16.50, 188 pages THE MESSAGE of Stanley Lebergott's book: to make yourself rich, you must not increase your money but decrease your greed. Consumption, not income, is the key to wealth. Pursuing Happiness: American Consumers in the Twentieth Century charts the story of how Americans spent their increased incomes since 1900. Lebergott looks in detail at consumption in food, clothing, housing, utilities, recreation and welfare. The book courts questions and revels in the chaos of data that full replies would need. He writes lucid prose and analysis, occasionally swamped by detail, but everywhere thought-provoking. He focuses on these indicators because, he claims, we learn more from looking at patterns of consumption than patterns of income. As civilisation advances, according to Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics, 'man's wants rapidly become more subtle and more various.' The added value which surrounds the consumer now is bewildering: lemon tea, vanilla coffee, mechanical insurance, and, as Edward de Bono predicts in Sur/Petition added access, such as designated parking space or road miles on priced roads for particular makes of car. Lebergott traces the evolution in the range and subtlety of consumer demand, mixing short essays with tables of statistics. He writes trenchantly but allows himself too many distractions; at times he is tilting at windmills, particularly in his first chapter. But he manages a few sideswipes at the economic establishment: from JK Galbraith, William Nordhaus and James Tobin back to Thorstein Veblen, making the criticism telling by focusing on the practical implications of an economic policy, always assuming that consumers behave as economists predict. The best chapter is a look at wealth through consumption rather than income. This runs counter to street-level, or even board-level economics. The rich, says Lebergott, have not become richer this century, because in 1990 they are not consuming significantly more of the US output than they were in 1900. He goes further. He ushers in the unlikely pairing of RH Tawney and John Rawls, who advocates tax on expenditure rather than income because it is levied according to how much one takes out of the common store of goods, and not according to how much one contributes, assuming one's income is fairly earned. Elsewhere, the statistics support a general relief that we are not living in 1900, and along with it, a general belief in progress. In America in 1900 (at 1982 prices) one hour's work earned 50c of personal consumption; in 1929, Dollars 2.75; in 1960, Dollars 6.50; and in 1990, Dollars 9.75. The average non-agricultural working week in America dropped from 60 hours in 1900 to 39.3 hours in 1990. But then Lebergott broadens the context: how about the Kung bushmen, who put in a mere two-and-a-half six-hour days each week? Then again, there are merchant bankers in New York who need make only one or two decisions a year to survive handsomely. The book never pretends to be exhaustive. The more fragmentary the details marshalled by Lebergott, the more fascinating the questions they spawn. The second half gives itself over to tables of indices and indicators. The indices make compelling reading. For instance, the ratio of medicines to funeral expenditures rose from 58% in 1900 to 852% in 1990. In itself, this makes a diverting statistic; but in 1900 there were only 100,000 physicians in private practice as against 586,000 in 1987 (or 1,315 physicians per million Americans in 1900, and 2,207 per million in 1987). Immediately we need other data: what constitutes a physician? How many varieties of drugs were available? What constitutes a preventative drug rather than a treatment drug? How did definitions of good health evolve over the century? What influence did marketing, academic testing or public relations have on medical expenditures? Rather than looking at what isn't there, it is better to look at what is. Everywhere Lebergott sets out the standards by which his particular social economic approach has a claim on reality. Instead of pursuing happiness, perhaps happiness is pursuing us. The Romans thought first of leisure (otium) and then of business (NEGotium), a different formula for their happiness quotient: that makes leisure the otium of the people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (PL) -- The Mexican press today  highlights several recent developments here in support of Cuba,  particularly the announcement of a visit to Havana by President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari and a resolution issued by the Latin  American Economic System [SELA] condemning the U.S. blockade  against the island.    EL DIA affirms in an editorial column that the Mexican  president's visit to Cuba confirms Mexico's right to expand its  international relations and exercise its sovereignty to  establish or strengthen its relations with every country of the  world. The article adds that Mexico's position illustrates that  we are not willing to bend under the United States' intervention  policy. It also states that the U.S. trade embargo against the  island and the so-called Torricelli Bill can only be the  brainchild of "a government that lives in a barbaric era,  ignoring law and morality."    In addressing U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli's visit to  this country, EL DIA affirms that the legislator was sent home  with nothing to tell. "He went home empty-handed and full of  resentment." The same paper, in a front-page story, highlights  the SELA resolution approved here yesterday protesting the U.S.  blockade against Cuba.    It also publishes a letter from the group known as Let's Go  for Cuba praising the gesture made by Mexican legislators of all  parties to donate one day's pay to purchase crude oil for the  island. The letter announced that the group will cast off with  the "third solidarity shipment" to Cuba at the end of this month.    The newspaper LA JORNADA carries a front-page headline that  says "SELA Calls for Lifting of Blockade Against Cuba" and an  editorial column on the resolution the organization issued  against the U.S. trade embargo on the island. According to the  daily, SELA spoke out clearly against Washington's measure.  Furthermore, says the editorial, the organization's decision to  protest the blockade "constitutes recognition of its blatant  inappropriateness and its undeniable interventionist nature."  It stresses that the step taken by SELA morally discredits the  blockade's validity, while it rallies 27 American nations around  an issue that has been the reason for conflict since 1962.    Mexico's daily EXCELSIOR also devoted a portion of its front  page to the organization's decision, with a headline reading  "SELA Demands That the United States Lift the Trade Embargo  Against Cuba."    EL SOL DE MEXICO publishes the same headline: "SELA Demands  That United States Lift the Trade Embargo Against Cuba." A  headline in the economic section of EL NACIONAL states: "27  Nations of Latin America Speak Out Against the Blockade Against  Cuba."</p>

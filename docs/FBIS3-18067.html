			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondents Carmen Parra and Javier Rivas] </F>   [Text] Parliamentarians in People's Party [PP] and  Convergence and Union [CiU] have divided up the task of  promoting, albeit in softened form, some of the main CEOE  [Spanish Employers Association] proposals on labor reform. The  PP has tabled an amendment that would open the way to  eliminating prior administrative authorization for dismissals.  The Catalonian group, meanwhile, may introduce in the Senate a  new intermediate category--"technically wrongful  dismissal"--coinciding with a proposal from the employers'  confederation. This measure is intended to lower employer costs  associated with individual dismissals. The various parliamentary  groups have presented a total of more than 500 amendments to the  three legislative bills comprising the labor reform.    Of the hundred or so amendments whose passage the PP group  will advocate, the one with the greatest impact on flexibility  in dismissals is embodied in a proposed change to the Statute on  Workers. The PP wants all provisions pertaining to collective  dismissals, temporary contract suspensions, and workweek  reductions to be taken out of that statute and regulated instead  by interconfederal accords--of all economic sectors--between  management and labor. The amendment provides for "said accords  to be adapted to community norms," which would in fact imply  elimination of prior administrative authorization.    The PP also wants--and in this it agrees with CiU--to  eliminate automatic renewal of labor-management agreements,  though it would leave in its place an eight-month extension to  allow time for employers and workers to negotiate a new pact.  CEOE opposes automatic renewal on grounds it produces  "hyperemployment."    Regarding dismissals, the PP group came up with a whole  series of alternative amendments based on their own ideas and  the employers' proposals. The initiatives ranged from minor to  radical. It was Jose Maria Aznar himself, leader of the PP, who  on bringing to a close the period for introducing amendments  Tuesday afternoon [15 February] opted for a middle-of-the-road  position, according to PP sources.    CiU is going to wait for the Senate debate before deciding  whether to present an amendment to create a new category of  individual dismissal: "technically wrongful." Employees whose  dismissal falls into this category, which covers layoffs of  between one and nine workers, would be given less severance than  the 45 days' pay for each year on the job that is currently paid  in "wrongful dismissal" cases.    The same category is also proposed in a thick CEOE document  titled "Amendments to the Reform of the Statute on Workers," a  collection of initiatives which employers have submitted to  several Congressional groups.    Miquel Roca, spokesman for the Catalonian group, alluded to  this dismissal category last Tuesday, but his group decided to  postpone its possible introduction until negotiations in the  Senate are under way because, as CiU deputy Rafael Hinojosa said  yesterday, "it's a controversial measure and needs more time to  ripen." Parliamentary sources note that the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] and IU [United Left] together have  enough votes to defeat the amendment in the Congress, though not  in the upper house. Carlos Solchaga, head of the Socialist  group, said on Tuesday that "in principle" the PSOE does not  support the Convergence amendment.    For the most part IU, the group that tabled the largest  number of amendments--210--defended the proposals of organized  labor. The group has asked that the leaders of the two largest  labor centrals--Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez--and the  secretaries general of the European Trade Union Confederation  and the CIOSL [expansion unknown]--Emilio Gabaglio and Enzo  Friso respectively--be asked to testify before Congress prior to  committee deliberations on the bill.    IU-IC [United Left-Catalonian Initiative] deputy Ricardo  Peralta publicly offered to engage the socialists in a dialogue  on the amendments of both groups, so that the reform will enjoy  the "consensus support of labor's representatives who will have  to administer it." The IU has justified almost all its  amendments on grounds they represent "technical improvements," a  formal bow to the PSOE, since the socialists have said they  would consider only "technical" changes to their labor reform  legislation.  <H5>  [Box p 15] </H5> <H5>  Amendments to Labor Reform Legislation </H5> <H5>  Dismissals: </H5>    -  Government: Eliminate administrative  authorization for individual dismissals, i.e., those affecting  fewer than 10 percent of enterprise personnel in a 3-month  period. Individual dismissals to remain subject to judicial  review. Allowable grounds for dismissal to be expanded to  include organizational or production-related improvements.    -  PSOE:  Specify that economic grounds apply when dismissals help the  enterprise cut losses, while technological, organizational, and  production-related grounds refer to efforts to increase  profits.    -  PP: Issues regarding dismissals, relocations, and  employment adjustment procedures to be decided by  interconfederal accords between employers and unions, with such  accords taking account of community norms (i.e., elimination of  prior administrative authorization).    -  CiU: No amendments to be  presented in the lower house. In the Senate, it may propose a  new category of dismissal that is less costly to the employer  than "wrongful."    -  IU: Wants to keep the terms now in effect, but  believes collective layoff provisions should apply to dismissals  affecting 5 percent of enterprise personnel. No expansion of  grounds for dismissal.  <H5>  Apprenticeship Contracts: </H5>    -  Government: Designed for  young workers ages 16 to 25 and for a maximum of three years.  First-year pay equal to 70 percent of the minimum wage. Does not  carry unemployment benefits or eligibility for temporary  disability.    -  PSOE: Recognize the right to paid maternity leave.  Enact controls to ensure companies cannot put already-employed  workers into apprenticeship slots doing the same work.

Prohibit workers from  receiving such contracts with more than one enterprise.  Contracts for youths aged 21-26 to carry reduced [employer]  taxes.    -  CiU: Agrees with amendments proposed by the PSOE.  Training time theoretically reducible on presentation of proof  of completion of vocational training courses. In such cases, the  employee would be entitled to a higher wage.    -  IU: Lower the age  limit to 20 and the maximum contract duration to two years. The  reference wage to be the pay rate currently in effect in the  enterprise or sector, not the minimum wage. Full social welfare  benefits.  <H5>  Employment Offices: </H5>    -  Government: INEM [National  Employment Institute] to lose its monopoly on employment  services. Legalize nonprofit private placement agencies and  temporary-hire agencies.    -  PSOE: Workers transferred illegally by  private agencies to acquire permanent status. Equality of access  to employment guaranteed, and no discrimination permitted for  any reason.    -  PP: Legalization of such offices to be the subject  of a separate law to be passed within one year. Elimination of  those proposed by the government.    -  CiU: None.    -  IU: Such  enterprises to be judged incompatible with the framework of the  Spanish labor system. INEM to continue exercising its past  monopoly in the field of labor-market intermediation.  <H3>  Union  Elections: </H3>    -  Government: The language in the bill has the  agreement of UGT [General Union of Workers] and CCOO [Workers  Commissions].

Creation of a central  register. Representational strength of the respective unions to  be evaluated on the basis of results obtained over a six-month  period.

Eliminate the nine-hour limit on workdays for day-laborers, and  allow weekly days off to be noncontiguous.    -  PSOE: Geographic  relocation and modification of contract terms to be deemed  justified where they contribute to improving enterprises' profit  position or competitiveness.    -  PP: Enterprises with more than 50  workers facing "employment adjustment" must enact a social plan  to retrain the individuals laid off, especially those 46 years  of age and older. Employers to be exempted from making Social  Security payments for one year on any unemployed person hired as  a permanent employee. A 50 percent reduction in employer Social  Security taxe for 18 months for each temporary hire converted to  a permanent position.    -  CiU: Eliminate automatic renewal of  labor-management pacts.

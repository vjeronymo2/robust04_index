			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah on 4 May, </F> followed by question-and-answer session with unidentified  correspondents; place not given --recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samahah] The cabinet reviewed its agenda and  approved several items, including a draft bill amending taxes on  domestic consumption of fuel to be referred to the Chamber of  Deputies. [passage omitted]    The cabinet also discussed and approved the Public Works  Ministry's road works program for the year 1994-1995.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] This issue was discussed. The conference will be  held in June, and the level of participation will be decided in  another session.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] This information was broadcast over television and  radio stations today. As for its impact on Lebanon, no matter  what has been signed, we are always concerned that any agreement  signed abroad should not have a negative effect on Lebanon. If  you mean the Palestinians' settlement in Lebanon, as far as we  are concerned, the Palestinian representatives are free to sign  whatever they want; but we do not believe that this agreement  has restored the Palestinians' legitimate rights to their land.  Lebanon rejects the settlement for two basic reasons: First,  we believe in the Palestinian people's right to return to their  land and determine their future on their own soil. Second, we  have the same concern for Lebanon's identity as an Arab country  affiliated with its Arab homeland. As concerned as we are about  the Palestinian identity in Palestine, we are also concerned  about the Lebanese identity in Lebanon and this is [words  indistinct].    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] Let us wait and see what happens with the  agreement. We are only concerned with our track. As the  president said, we are concerned about the negotiations because  we entered the negotiation process in Madrid as Arabs. The  Lebanese, Syrian, and Jordanian tracks are still on the same  level of progress.    If the Palestinians opt out, this means that they have  departed from the Arab fold. They have left the Arab fold and  Arab unity for unilateral negotiations and the signing of an  agreement.    With regard to the negotiations, we are still committed to  peace, but to a just peace based on the recovery of rights, to a  comprehensive, just, and durable peace in line with the  principles according to which Lebanon, along with Syria, Jordan,  and the Palestinians, entered the negotiations in Madrid.    [Correspondent] Christopher [words indistinct].    [Samahah] To start with, his tour is not over yet. He is  still in Cairo. [Words indistinct] that he will return in 15  days. Let us wait and see.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] Who is [word indistinct]? Secretary Christopher or  Lebanon?    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] Not only is Lebanon taking a stand. Lebanon has  adopted a position based on its conviction that it went to  Madrid based on certain principles and wants to pursue the  negotiations through these principles. I do not believe we  should interpret Lebanon's absence from Christopher's itinerary  in this context. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A children's "Tansimjul"  dancing party was held at Kim Il-song Square Monday with the  attendance of some 10,000 members of the Korean Children's Union  [KCU] in the capital city to celebrate the fifth KCU Congress.    Watching it on the platform were Pak Song-chol, Politburo  member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of  Korea [WPK] and Vice-president; Choe Tae-pok, alternate member  of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central  Committee; Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the C.C., the WPK; and  Chang Chol, vice-premier of the Administration Council.    Delegates to the congress, leading officials of the League  of  Socialist Working Youth and the Children's Union, teachers and  working people were present at the party.    Also present were members of school children's delegations  and visiting groups of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan staying in the sovialist homeland.    Foreign guests staying in Korea were invited.    When "Song of Tansim (singleheart)" floated through the  square, boy and girl members of the KCU, clad in the dress of  the children's corps members during the anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle, wove patterns with long strips of cloth  of various colors (Tansimjul) going around the maypoles.    To the melody of the song "Our Father, Marshal Kim Chong-il"  peculiar colorful scenes spread, rendering the dancing party all  the more fascinating.    The KCU members sang songs and danced, renewing their oath  to  constantly prepare themselves for General Kim Chong-il and for  the motherland, deeply cherishing the faith that they will  certainly win when there is the dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il for  them.</p>

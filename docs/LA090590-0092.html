			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Sag: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of new three-month bills at an  average discount rate of 7.39%, down from 7.49% last week.  </P> <P> Another $9.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.36%, down from 7.48% last week. The rates were the lowest since  three-month bills sold for 7.23% on Aug. 6, and six-month bills averaged 7.31%  on Aug. 13. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors --  7.64% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,813.20 and 7.75%  for a six-month bill selling for $9,627.90. The discount rate reflects the  price discount received when government securities are purchased at less than  face value.  </P></p>

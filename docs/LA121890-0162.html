			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN REJECTS FOREIGN LAWYERS  </P> <P> Japan has rejected U.S. demands to allow more foreign lawyers to practice here,  a Justice Ministry official told reporters today.  </P> <P> He was speaking at the end of two days of talks between U.S. government  representatives and officials from Japan's justice and foreign ministries.  </P> <P> Japan rejected U.S. requests to allow foreign lawyers to employ or form  partnerships with Japanese lawyers in Japan, the official said.  </P> <P> "It would be difficult for U.S. lawyers to employ or enter into partnerships  with Japanese lawyers because the two countries have very different legal  systems," he said.  </P> <P> Foreign law firms, previously banned from Japan, gained limited entry under a  1987 law allowing them to advise Japanese clients. But the law banned them from  practicing Japanese law and employing or forming partnerships with Japanese  lawyers.  </P></p>

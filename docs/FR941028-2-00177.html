			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;If HCWs are from risks groups with increased prevalence of TB, consideration may be given to including them in the skin-testing program, even if they do not have potential occupational exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , so that converters can be identified and preventive therapy offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Administrators of health-care facilities should ensure that physicians and other personnel not paid by, but working in, the facility receive skin testing at appropriate intervals for their occupational group and work location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;During the pre-employment physical or when applying for hospital privileges, HCWs who have potential for exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Table 2), including those with a history of BCG vaccination, should have baseline PPD skin testing performed (Suppl. 2). For HCWs who have not had a documented negative PPD test result during the preceding 12 months, the baseline PPD testing should employ the two-step method; this will detect boosting phenomena that might be misinterpreted as a skin-test conversion. Decisions concerning the use of the two-step procedure for baseline testing in a particular facility should be based on the frequency of boosting in that facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs who have a documented history of a positive PPD test, adequate treatment for disease, or adequate preventive therapy for infection, should be exempt from further PPD screening unless they develop signs or symptoms suggestive of TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;PPD-negative HCWs should undergo repeat PPD testing at regular intervals as determined by the risk assessment (Section II.B). In addition, these HCWs should be tested whenever they have been exposed to a TB patient and appropriate precautions were not observed at the time of exposure (Section II.K.3). Performing PPD testing of HCWs who work in the same area or occupational group on different scheduled dates (e.g., test them on their birthdays or on their employment anniversary dates), rather than testing all HCWs in the area or group on the same day, may lead to earlier detection of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All PPD tests should be administered, read, and interpreted in accordance with current guidelines by specified trained personnel (Suppl. 2). At the time their test results are read, HCWs should be informed about the interpretation of both positive and negative PPD test results. This information should indicate that the interpretation of an induration that is 5&hyph;9 mm in diameter depends on the HCW's immune status and history of exposure to persons who have infectious TB. Specifically, HCWs who have indurations of 5&hyph;9 mm in diameter should be advised that such results may be considered positive for HCWs who are contacts of persons with infectious TB or who have HIV infection or other causes of severe immunosuppression (e.g., immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When an HCW who is not assigned regularly to a single work area has a PPD test conversion, appropriate personnel should identify the areas where the HCW worked during the time when infection was likely to have occurred. This information can then be considered in analyzing the risk for transmission in those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In any area of the facility where transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is known to have occurred, a problem evaluation should be conducted (Section II.K), and the frequency of skin testing should be determined according to the applicable risk category (Section II.B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;PPD test results should be recorded confidentially in the individual HCW's employee health record and in an aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. The database can be analyzed periodically to estimate the risk for acquiring new infection in specific areas or occupational groups in the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Evaluation and Management of HCWs Who Have Positive PPD Test Results or Active TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All HCWs with newly recognized positive PPD test results or PPD test conversions should be evaluated promptly for active TB. This evaluation should include a clinical examination and a chest radiograph. If the history, clinical examination, or chest radiograph is compatible with active TB, additional tests should be performed (Section II.C.2). If symptoms compatible with TB are present, the HCW should be excluded from the workplace until either a) a diagnosis of active TB is ruled out or b) a diagnosis of active TB was established, the HCW is being treated, and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious (Suppl. 2). HCWs who do not have active TB should be evaluated for preventive therapy according to published guidelines (Suppl. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If an HCW's PPD test result converts to positive, a history of confirmed or suspected TB exposure should be obtained in an attempt to determine the potential source. When the source of exposure is known, the drug-susceptibility pattern of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  isolated from the source should be identified so that the correct curative or preventive therapy can be initiated for the HCW with the PPD test conversion. The drug-susceptibility pattern should be recorded in the HCW's medical record, where it will be available if the HCW subsequently develops active TB and needs therapy specific for the drug-susceptibility pattern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All HCWs, including those with histories of positive PPD test results, should be reminded periodically about the symptoms of TB and the need for prompt evaluation of any pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Routine and follow-up chest radiographs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Routine chest radiographs are not required for asymptomatic, PPD-negative HCWs. HCWs with positive PPD test results should have a chest radiograph as part of the initial evaluation of their PPD test; if negative, repeat chest radiographs are not needed unless symptoms develop that could be attributed to TB ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However, more frequent monitoring for symptoms of TB may be considered for recent converters and other PPD-positive HCWs who are at increased risk for developing active TB (e.g., HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised HCWs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Workplace restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Active TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs with pulmonary or laryngeal TB pose a risk to patients and other HCWs while they are infectious, and they should be excluded from the workplace until they are noninfectious. The same work restrictions apply to all HCWs regardless of their immune status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Before the HCW who has TB can return to the workplace, the health-care facility should have documentation from the HCW's health-care provider that the HCW is receiving adequate therapy, the cough has resolved, and the HCW has had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different days. After work duties are resumed and while the HCW remains on anti-TB therapy, facility staff should receive periodic documentation from the HCW's health-care provider that the HCW is being maintained on effective drug therapy for the recommended time period and that the sputum AFB smears continue to be negative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs with active laryngeal or pulmonary TB who discontinue treatment before they are cured should be evaluated promptly for infectiousness. If the evaluation determines that they are still infectious, they should be excluded from the workplace until treatment has been resumed, an adequate response to therapy has been documented, and three more consecutive sputum AFB smears collected on different days have been negative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs who have TB at sites other than the lung or larynx usually do not need to be excluded from the workplace if a diagnosis of concurrent pulmonary TB has been ruled out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Latent TB infection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs receiving preventive treatment for latent TB infection should not be restricted from their usual work activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs with latent TB infection who cannot take or who do not accept or complete a full course of preventive therapy should not be excluded from the workplace. These HCWs should be counseled about the risk for developing active TB and instructed regularly to seek prompt evaluation if signs or symptoms develop that could be caused by TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> K. Problem Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Epidemiologic investigations may be indicated for several situations. These include, but are not limited to, (a) the occurrence of PPD test conversions or active TB in HCWs; (b) the occurrence of possible person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and (c) situations in which patients or HCWs with active TB are not promptly identified and isolated, thus exposing other persons in the facility to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The general objectives of the epidemiologic investigations in these situations are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To determine the likelihood that transmission of and infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has occurred in the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To determine the extent to which  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been transmitted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To identify those persons who have been exposed and infected, enabling them to receive appropriate clinical management;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To identify factors that could have contributed to transmission and infection and to implement appropriate interventions; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions that are implemented and to ensure that exposure to and transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  have been terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exact circumstances of these situations are likely to vary considerably, and the associated epidemiologic investigations should be tailored to the individual circumstances. The following sections provide general guidance for conducting these investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Investigating PPD Test Conversions and Active TB in HCWs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Investigating PPD test conversions in HCWs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PPD test conversions may be detected in HCWs as a result of a contact investigation, in which case the probable source of exposure and transmission is already known (Section II.K.3.), or as a result of routine screening, in which case the probable source of exposure and infection is not already known and may not be immediately apparent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a skin-test conversion in an HCW is identified as part of routine screening, the following steps should be considered (Figure 2):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The HCW should be evaluated promptly for active TB. The initial evaluation should include a thorough history, physical examination, and chest radiograph. On the basis of the initial evaluation, other diagnostic procedures (e.g., sputum examination) may be indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If appropriate, the HCW should be placed on preventive or curative therapy in accordance with current guidelines (Suppl. 2) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A history of possible exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be obtained from the HCW to determine the most likely source of infection. When the source of infection is known, the drug-susceptibility pattern of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  isolate from the source patient should be identified to determine appropriate preventive or curative therapy regimens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

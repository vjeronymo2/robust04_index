			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Sources at the Nicaragua Foreign Ministry have said  it is expected U.S. aid to Nicaragua will decline over time  because, beginning in 1995, the United States will channel its  foreign aid to our country through multilateral financial  organizations, such as the IMF and the World Bank. It should be  noted the United States has a lot of influence in the  aforementioned multilateral institutions.    The Foreign Ministry sources, however, explained the  $57-million aid package for the 1995 fiscal year is not  definitive, but responds to tentative programs. The Nicaraguan  Government has reiterated the country will not live eternally on  international aid, adding that is why it is necessary to  increase production in Nicaragua.</p>

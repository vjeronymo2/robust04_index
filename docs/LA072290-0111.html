			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUSSIAN 'ROOTS'  </P> <P> Zhores Medvedev, in his (June 3) review of Dusko Doder's and Louise Branson's  biography, "Gorbachev: Heretic in the Kremlin," considers it unlikely that  Gorbachev could have had an older brother who died during World War II.  </P> <P> Even if Maria Panteleevna Gorbachev did not become a teen-age mother, she could  have had a stepson. I presume that it is correct to refer to a half-brother  some seven years one's senior as just an "older brother." However, I doubt that  Gorby would care to write a Russian "Roots" to clarify the matter.  </P> <P> KATHERYN GALLANT  </P> <P> WEST COVINA  </P></p>

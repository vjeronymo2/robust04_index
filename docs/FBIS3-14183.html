			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "United States Steps Up Its </F> Pressure To Reactivate Jordanian-Israeli Track"]    [Text] Amman -- A high-ranking Jordanian official  yesterday accused the United States of stepping up its pressure  on his country and exerting political, economic, and media  pressure to force Jordan to take rapid steps toward a peaceful  solution with Israel "that is incompatible with its national and  strategic interests."    The official said that Washington continues to impose a  maritime blockade on the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah, and it is  exerting efforts to keep Jordan in a state of Arab isolation and  working to deny the Kingdom U.S. and European financial aid.    He pointed out that the U.S. Administration "stepped up its  pressure" on Amman after Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  faltered following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron,  with a view to "reactivating the peace process through the  Jordanian-Israeli track." The official warned that these  pressures "will have an adverse impact on the negotiations with  Israel and weaken the chances of achieving progress on the  Jordanian track."    A high-level Jordanian authority has said that the United  States continues to impose the blockade on the port of  al-'Aqabah through the search operations conducted by its  warships in the Gulf of Aqaba, despite the U.S. Administration's  promises to lift the blockade and secure alternatives to  guarantee implementation of the economic embargo imposed on Iraq.    He pointed out that Washington "has since the eruption of  the  Gulf crisis imposed strict surveillance on Jordanian imports and  exports to Iraq, without taking any real measures to watch trade  exchange between Iran and each of Turkey, Iran, and Syria...,  with a view to punishing Jordan for its position during the  crisis, using surveillance as an excuse for continuing the  pressure on it in the context of the peace process."    He pointed out that Washington "completely ignored" the  stipulations of the economic embargo resolution, namely the need  to compensate the other states harmed by the embargo.    He went on to say that the continuing economic pressure on  the Kingdom and efforts aimed at keeping Jordan "without any  Arab option and pushing it toward Israel will not serve the  peace issue in the Middle East." He stressed that "it is no  longer a secret that Washington is not satisfied with the  rapprochement and coordination between Amman and Damascus in the  framework of the peace negotiations" with Israel.    Meanwhile, Jordanian liberal deputy 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Kabariti  has said that Washington insists on keeping Jordan "either on  its knees or on the tips of its toes" to ensure that it will  implement requirements for the peace process' success "in  accordance with the Israeli-U.S. conditions." He stressed that  the U.S. pressures, "which include media accusations of Jordan's  involvement in providing military aid to Jordan during the Gulf  crisis, will not change the principles and constants to which we  adhered." He said that these "pressures will fail, just as the  pressures exerted on us to participated in the Camp David  negotiations failed."    He added that the United States, which "used to be a support  for Jordan, has now become a burden on it, and it is no longer  easy to defend U.S. policy in the region."    He defended the Jordanian-Syrian relationship, saying: "The  time has come to establish a distinct relationship with Syria in  the framework of balanced relations with the Arab states,  without establishing one at the expense of another." He pointed  out that in current conditions Jordan "needs an essential Arab  rear, despite the attempts to keep it isolated from its  brothers."</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: The incredible shrinking banks When you meet one stockbroker in the Square Mile who says he banks with the Woolwich, and the next you run into recommends the Northern Rock, you don't need second sight to guess that something is going on. Depositors are getting fed up with the British clearing banks, provoked by sloppy service and above all by ever-rising, arbitrary charges. Meanwhile, would-be borrowers are either turned down flat, or charged usurious rates; and old borrowers cut their spending to pay down debt. For the banks, strapped for capital, these impositions make short-term sense, since they raise income while shrinking the balance sheet. The long-term effects will be far more important than a marketing windfall for the building societies and the Girobank. The flight from the banks will damp down whatever recovery we may hope to see, especially in asset values, and make Bank of England restraint largely redundant. This is not a transitory effect: the private sector squeeze could last as long as it takes, say, to let Canary Wharf. On the positive side, it will open almost-forgotten opportunities for the capital markets. Rights issues will remain the big source of capital for expansion. Since big companies now have better credit ratings than their banks, the commercial paper market may grow to fill the major role it does in New York - where commercial banks' credit went ex-growth years ago - or now in Tokyo. In the longer run, as slow growth reduces real interest rates to normal levels, it may even fulfil the Bank of England's long-cherished ambition to revive the corporate debenture market. All this suggests better times for brokers, but worse, surely, for investors. The change will open up a whole new monetarist debate. Should analysts be Big Endians like Professor Congdon, and follow something really broad, like M4. This would follow the money as it moves out of the banks. Or do you prefer M2, which concentrates on banks, since it reflects the present funk in the banks, and will revive, in due course, with their confidence? Or is the Treasury's M0 the only reliable guide, since it alone distinguishes transactions from the pensioner's investments? I have seen all these views in well-regarded brokers' circulars in the last week. This one will run and run. * * * These changes are intriguing, but they are the merest trivia compared with what may happen in Tokyo. The whole Japanese system, based on an extreme form of relationship banking, is now endangered, possibly fatally, as the cross-holdings become uncrossed. As David Hale of Kempers, the Chicago house, points out in a fascinating circular, this could make Japan just another short-termist stock market economy. Japanese banks invested in shares to secure future loan business, and so demanded only growth. They are now selling their holdings to insurance companies, funds and individuals who demand profits and dividends - secondary considerations in Tokyo up to now. The turn may take some time to negotiate. Companies still have to refinance their convertible bond issues, so the cost of their existing capital will rise sharply, quite apart from expansion capital. Small wonder that the Tokyo market remains demoralised while it works out these unfamiliar sums. Meanwhile, the Japanese investor seems to be seeking high returns overseas. The insurance companies have been seen in the bond markets; funds and individuals may be attracted by equities. The flow has at any rate been enough to depress the yen despite the huge continuing current accounts surplus. It may remain week as the big manufacturing companies increase their direct foreign investment - notably in China, at the moment - where the prospective returns are greatest. And what of all the warnings that the troubles of Tokyo banks would undermine capital markets everywhere else? Never, it seems at the moment, have so many got so much so wrong. The danger, as Hale points out, is likely to emerge not from the collapse, but when the next Tokyo bull run begins; but to judge from the charts which have served so well till now, we may have some years to wait.</p>

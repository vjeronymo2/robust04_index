			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: CELEBRATING THE FAMILY;  </P> <P> TIME TOGETHER SEEMS TO BE THE MOST COVETED GIFT OF ALL  </P> <P> There'll be no racing into the living room on Christmas morning for the Kemp  family of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Tradition dictates that everyone lines up, youngest to oldest, at the door  before taking a mad dash at the presents stacked under the tree. That's the  Kemps' way of protecting their young, even though each of the little ones --  never the adults! -- gets to open a gift on Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> And tradition ensures that Betty Kemp will whip lasagna out of the freezer this  morning and serve it up with a tossed salad and garlic bread tonight. Turkey  and the trimmings are reserved for Christmas Day.  </P> <P> "Lasagna is something I can cook up and freeze ahead of time," explains Betty,  wife of Tom Kemp (brother of Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban  development). "We always have it -- makes life much easier."  </P> <P> As always, there'll be ice cream for dessert tonight, along with carols played  on the piano by the Kemps' daughter, Anne Hummel, and a theatrical reading of  "The Night Before Christmas" by her husband, Rob. ("He used to be a radio  announcer in St. Louis," Betty says. "Wonderful voice.") Before the evening  ends, Tom Kemp Jr. will have engaged his grandmother, Fern Benson, in a serious  game of Scrabble. And, providing one of his grandchildren doesn't want to take  a stab at it, Tom Kemp will say grace.  </P> <P> So go the holiday traditions of one of Orange County's leading families. "Of  course, the most traditional thing of all is that we're together," Betty says.  </P> <P> Dorothy Bendetti of Emerald Bay agrees. "Our family wouldn't miss Christmas  Eve," says the woman who arranged the social whirl that surrounded the opening  of the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda. "A son is coming all the way from  Vancouver. For us, it's so special no one would miss it for the world."  </P> <P> Dorothy and Donald Bendetti's celebration begins with salmon and champagne and  a family gift exchange.  </P> <P> "We all sit around and open gifts and it's bedlam," says Dorothy. Afterward,  the family dines formally on prime rib and the trimmings. "Turkey is reserved  for Christmas Day," she says.  </P> <P> Before bedtime, Donald whips up his scrumptious Tom and Jerry drinks. "And  then, we'll all retire. We have to get up early for church," Dorothy says.  </P> <P> One of Dorothy's favorite traditions is the way she trims her tree. "I put all  of the homemade ornaments at the bottom so the little ones can touch them and  learn about them. And I put the fancy ones at the top of the tree."  </P> <P> On Christmas morning, Donald starts a "big fire in the fireplace," she says.  "And we all sit together and have coffee and muffins while we open our  Christmas stockings."  </P> <P> The most traditional thing about Mary and James Roosevelt's Christmas Eve is  that they celebrate it two days early.  </P> <P> "I always do Christmas on Dec. 22," Mary says, "because I hate to cook on  Christmas Day."  </P> <P> It all started years ago when Mary traveled a lot as a young career woman. "I  would come back to England for Christmas and our family would stay in a  wonderful old inn in the heart of the English countryside," she says. There,  she would dine on grand hotel fare.  </P> <P> "When Jim and I got married, the last thing I wanted to do on Christmas was  grow up," she says, laughing. "I'd never cooked a turkey, so I just skated  around it. I've always been entertained on Christmas Day."  </P> <P> But on Dec. 22, Mary -- who has long since learned the art of bird roasting --  pulls out the stops for Jim and their daughter, Becky. "I do a turkey dinner  right down to Christmas pudding with hard sauce," she says. On Christmas, the  Roosevelts will step out. "We're having dinner with our good friends, Barbara  and Bill Ficker," she says.  </P> <P> Leaving town for the holidays is becoming traditional for UC Irvine Chancellor  Jack Peltason and his wife, Suzanne. The couple plan to be with their two  daughters and three of their grandchildren in St. Louis on Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> "We've visited our daughter there for the last three years," says Suzanne.  </P> <P> The night before Christmas, the Peltasons will dine on ham with their family  and then go to church. "We love a Christmas Eve service," Suzanne says. Jack  Peltason calls the celebration with his loved ones, "a quiet and wonderful time  that gives significance to the rest of the year."  </P> <P> Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and his wife, Lois, hole up in their Sun Valley  condo on Christmas Eve to watch the torch parade on the snow-covered slopes.  </P> <P> "It's absolutely gorgeous," says Lois. "Skiers race down the mountain holding  flaming torches. And there are beautiful fireworks. It's Sun Valley's way of  heralding the birth of Christ."  </P> <P> On Christmas Day, the couple will ski. "It's a big deal -- tradition in the  valley to ski on Christmas," says Lois, adding that billionaire Donald Bren "is  always on Sun Valley's slopes that day."  </P> <P> For Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, Christmas  Eve marks a tradition more than 50 years old.  </P> <P> "We go to midnight Mass and then we have a chicken-salad supper before opening  our presents," Emma Jane says. "That's an old Riley family tradition.  </P> <P> She loved the tradition from the start, Emma Jane says. "I was studying voice  when I met Tom and I loved singing at midnight Mass. I have a particular  sentiment attached to it because one Christmas Eve I was lucky enough to sing  for the troops at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was the Christmas before World War  II was declared. I'll never forget singing 'O Holy Night' with a Marine officer  who had one of the most beautiful voices you've ever heard."  </P></p>

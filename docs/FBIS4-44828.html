			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karl Tetzner: "Four Stages To Highest Television </F> Quality"]    [Text] Frankfurt. "Television was invented in Europe, and  Europe wants to play a significant role in the digital age too,"  says the introduction to "Innovation Europe," sponsored for the  fourth time by the Central Association of Electrotechnology and  Electronics Industries. Television remains a significant factor:  in Germany there are 44 million sets in operation. The total is  about 160 million for Europe and 670 million worldwide.    The world of television is on the verge of emerging into the  digital age. During the meeting in Berlin, Dr. Helmut Stein  (Nokia) reported in detail that digital technology is now in a  position to differentiate image and sound quality, i.e., to  divide up the given bit rates as desired. But the price to be  paid is some loss of quality. There will be four levels:    --Limited Definition Television (LDTV) achieves image and  sound quality on the level of previous videorecorders. This  requires a data rate of 1.5 to 2 megabits per second.    --Standard Definition Television (SDTV) shows TV programs  with good PAL quality on a technologically modern receiver. The  requirement is a transmission rate of 3 to 4 megabits per second.    --Extended Definition Television (EDTV) offers improved  image  and sound reproduction, sufficient for large screens, including  those with a 16:19 height-to-width ratio and for the new PALplus  system. Here the data transmission rate is 6 to 8 megabits per  second.    --High Definition Television (HDTV) for high definition  televisions with up to five sound channels is suitable for  reproduction on very large screens. This requires a transmission  capacity of 20 to 30 megabits. The data streams will consist of  188-byte packets; a byte is equal to eight bits. Thus they are  adaptable for the future Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) on the  public broad-band networks. The first byte in the packet serves  for synchronization, the next three for recognition of the data  carried by the following 184 bytes.    As is well known, in the recent past over 100 institutions  from 14 countries have been working on the technology and  strategy of European digital television, and they agreed on the  first standard (for satellite TV transmission) in December of  1993. The norms for cable transmission and terrestrial digital  transmission will follow.    In Berlin, Stein gave the following timetable: digital TV  via  satellite and cable will begin in 1995. Terrestrial  transmission, received with conventional roof antennas, could  follow in 1997 and the highest quality level (digital HDTV)  could be available beginning in 1999. There is no longer anyone  who talks about European HDTV using the HD-Mac transmission  process, which was developed at a cost of several hundred  million German marks [DM] and given an expensive demonstration.    Dr. Herbert Bruch (Grundig) explained what will happen with  PALplus, the system which can completely fill the broad picture  surfaces of the new 16:9 [as published] sets. ARD plans to offer  about 300 PALplus program hours this year, and Baerische  Rundfunk an addition 300. The pay-TV broadcaster Premiere is  even promising 1,000 hours. But the equipment industry is not  braced for this tempo. Originally, they had been counting on  PALplus beginning in the summer of 1995.    In the meantime, some equipment manufacturers have been  making use of ASIC chips. It is true that they are more  expensive than the later mass-produced chips, but will be  available sooner. In this way the first PALplus-equipped 16:9  [as published] receivers could appear in the stores before  Christmas, with a price increase of about DM350. PALplus is also  completely compatible with the less advanced PAL standard.</p>

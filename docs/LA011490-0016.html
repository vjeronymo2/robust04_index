			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VINELAND' AND VINEGAR  </P> <P> I just can't accept Frank McConnell's Dec. 31 review of (Thomas Pychon's)  "Vineland." He is so obviously biased in favor of Pynchon that I'm sure if  Pynchon bombed Aspen, McConnell would rave about his heroics.  </P> <P> McConnell may or may not be correct in his assessment, but I hope that in all  fairness you will give us another review of "Vineland."  </P> <P> KAREN O'GRADY, PLAYA DEL REY  </P></p>

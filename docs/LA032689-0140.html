			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Peruvian diplomat was charged with smuggling 44 pounds of cocaine, valued at  $10.3 million, into Britain in a diplomatic pouch, a British official and  Peruvian sources said. A Customs and Excise spokesman said Jose Manuel Pacheco  Nunez, 30, who was not accredited to Britain, was arrested in a London hotel  after arousing the suspicions of Customs officers at Heathrow airport. The  spokesman said that because Pacheco is not accredited to Britain he does not  enjoy diplomatic immunity. In Lima, Peruvian Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco  Cox said Pacheco is a second-level diplomat who may be dismissed from the  Foreign Service. Sources there said Pacheco was in charge of the ministry's  computer system.  </P></p>

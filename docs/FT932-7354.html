			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Banesto to scrap payout and seek New York listing BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank which recently outlined plans to raise Pta130bn (Dollars 1.04bn) in new capital, told a tumultuous shareholders' meeting at the weekend that it would not be paying a final dividend for 1992. Mr Mario Conde, Banesto chairman, said he would follow a very conservative policy on dividends and provisions for this year, but promised shareholders the bank would establish open dividend guidelines for this year and 1994 soon. Banesto has already declared a zero profit for the first quarter of 1992, transferring its income to provisions to cover bad loans, which have rocketed as a result of the slump in the Spanish economy in the last six months. The bank paid Pta205 overall for 1991 and has so far paid an interim Pta95 for 1992. Analysts had been expecting a sharply lower final dividend, given Banesto's ambitious cash call, a 55 per cent fall in net profits at the parent last year and the likelihood that the Spanish recession will damage most bank income statements this year. Mr Conde, who said Banesto would seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange after its capital increase, spent most of the meeting pressing the 3,000 shareholders present to support the plans. 'I am asking you to sacrifice today's profits for reasonable expectations for tomorrow,' he said. Mr Conde, personally, and a group of investors led by J. P. Morgan, the US investment bank, are committed to big investments in the bank during the raising of new capital and Mr Conde was at pains to assure shareholders that the operation was not speculative. He said J. P. Morgan's Corsair fund, which includes leading US institutions, had agreed to hold the investment it would pick up in Banesto during the capital increase for at least two years. The intention was to hold the shares for up to five years, he said. The three-stage capital increase will raise Banesto's BIS capital adequacy ratio from 9.3 per cent to 12 per cent. Shareholders approved the capital increase and the appointment of Mr Roberto Mendoza, J. P. Morgan vice-chairman, to the Banesto board. In spite of Mr Conde's efforts to sway shareholders, it is understood that the bank and its new partners would be satisfied if they managed to raise even half the Pta130bn they have set their sights on.</p>

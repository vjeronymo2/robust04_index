			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman has said  that the president of the Republic has the military corps'  support, and he added that reports disseminated yesterday in the  capital and in certain military zones are merely rumors. He  also said the president spent yesterday conducting business as  usual, as any president would, including attending some  meetings. One of the meetings was with the boy who will be the  poster child for this year's telethon. The president later met  with the finance minister and then worked on a message he will  address to the nation, possibly today, because he could not do  it yesterday, given several priority commitments, Loarca Guzman  emphasized.</p>

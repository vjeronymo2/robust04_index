			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / VW renews Skoda pledge The Czech government and Volkswagen, the German vehicles group, yesterday partially resolved their dispute over VW's investment plans for its joint venture with Skoda, writes Patrick Blum from Vienna. Officials said VW reaffirmed that it would raise its stake in Skoda from 31 per cent to 70 per cent by the end of 1995 as planned, but investment would be reduced to DM3.7bn. A planned engine plant would not now be built.</p>

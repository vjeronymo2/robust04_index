			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Riga, 6 Jun -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs on Monday asked the government to accept his  resignation. He also gave up his seat as a member of the Saeima  today. His powers as a deputy were suspended by parliament at  the end of April because the minister's name was discovered in a  card index of agents of the former KGB.    At the same time, Andrejevs issued a statement in which he  expresses the hope that his resignation will "help society and  legislators realize the need to make changes to Latvia's laws."  He believes that only a proven fact should serve as the reason  for punishing or limiting the activity of an individual. It is  the imperfect nature of Latvia's laws, in which the concept of  "collaboration" is in need of clarification, and also the  reaction in the country to his open letter in which he described  what his contacts with the KGB had been, that made the minister  decide to resign.    As already reported, Latvian laws do not permit those who  collaborated with the KGB to be deputies or occupy certain state  posts.</p>

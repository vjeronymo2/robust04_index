A  crowd which has gathered at the prison's gates actually embraced  him. Saying "Thank you, thank you," Konstantinov came up to  his car with great difficulties and moved away.    When asked by journalists who will become Russia's next  president, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who was staying near Lefortovo answered  that the people would make their choice. In Zhirinovskiy's  words, the people will have to choose either him or Rutskoy.    Leader of the Labor Russia and Russian Communist Labor Party  Viktor Anpilov left Lefortovo at 17:25, just after Konstantinov.  Hundreds of his supporters welcomed Anpilov.    At an improvised meeting Anpilov declared: "The will of the  single Soviet people has torn us from the torture-chambers. We  have not recognized our guilt and do not recognize it. There is  no guilt. We have chosen amnesty for the sake of accord and  reconciliation in the society."    "If I leave the prison and see that prices have dropped and  people live better then Yeltsin was right. If prices raised and  people live worse then I shall continue my struggle till the  victory," declared Anpilov.    Accompanied by a 400-strong crowd of his supporters Anpilov  left the square before the investigation prison on foot.    In his interview with Interfax Anpilov said that now his  nearest task is "to organize working staffs for struggle with  the regime." He intends "to travel throughout the country and to  meet with working people."    Anpilov believes that now Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin has  occupied that place on the political arena which earlier was  occupied by Ruslan Khasbulatov.    According to Anpilov, it is necessary to hold early  presidential elections because there is a new Constitution and a  new president should swear on the new Constitution.</p>

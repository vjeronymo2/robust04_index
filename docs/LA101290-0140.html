			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DYKES REGAINS VISION; MAN IS ARRESTED  </P> <P> The eye injury wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes suffered in a scuffle outside a  nightclub is healing well, and his doctor said he should be able to play when  the New England Patriots meet the Miami Dolphins on Thursday, Oct. 18.  </P> <P> Dykes wore sunglasses as he left Rhode Island Hospital Thursday, 36 hours after  he and Patriot receiver Irving Fryar were injured in a brawl.  </P> <P> Dykes would not comment, but his attorney, Peter DiBiase, said a witness told  police that Dykes was being needled about how poorly the Patriots were doing.  </P> <P> Shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday night, police arrested a nightclub bouncer,  William Earley, 35, at his home in Portsmouth and charged him with assaulting  Dykes. Police said Earley called to give himself up.  </P> <P> Ophthalmologist Robert Bahr, who treated Dykes, said: "He is dramatically  better than he was yesterday. He's feeling better and he's seeing better."  </P> <P> Dykes' eye was swollen and he had some blurred vision Wednesday but was seeing  normally Thursday, Bahr said.  </P> <P> "He's going to probably have to take it easy for a while," Bahr said,  explaining it normally takes five or six days to recover from a blunt eye  injury. He said it looked as if Dykes took a blow directly to the eye.  </P> <P> He said Dykes, 24, should be able to attend practice by Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Ecuador eases oil investment Ecuador's congress has approved a law setting out terms for billions of dollars worth of contracts in oil and gas exploration and pipeline construction. It also breaks the monopoly of state-owned Petroecuador in some sectors. Oil companies will receive a percentage of their crude production to sell in the domestic or international market. Industry analysts say cutting bureaucratic ties between the oil companies and the government will allow Ecuador to compete with oil-producing neighbours for scarce investment capital. The country has not secured an exploration contract in five years. Contracts for the exploration and production of natural gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil in the south-west will be auctioned. Winning bidders will have up to five years to develop the field and find a market.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Venezuela approves oil project THE Venezuelan cabinet approved at the weekend a Dollars 1.7bn heavy oil project to be carried out by Conoco, a subsidiary of EI du Pont, and Venezuela's national oil company, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. The project calls for producing and upgrading very heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt, the world's largest known accumulation of heavy oil and bitumen. This is the first time a foreign company will be allowed to participate as a direct investor in Venezuela's oil production sector since the republic nationalised its petroleum industry in 1976. It is also the first step towards opening up large-scale production in the belt. Conoco and Maraven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA, will be equal partners in the project, according to Mr Frank Alcock, PDVSA vice-president. The plan, which must be approved by the Venezuelan congress, involves producing 120,000 barrels a day of extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco belt and converting it into 102,000 barrels a day of lighter gravity oil, plus 3,000 tonnes of petroleum coke. The belt, north of the Orinoco river, contains an estimated 1,200bn barrels of extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen.</p>

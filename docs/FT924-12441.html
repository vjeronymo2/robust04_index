			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Clinton keeps his lead after debate US President George Bush gave it his best shot on Monday night. But there was no immediate evidence, apart from the encouragement for his supporters, that his vigorous performance in the final presidential debate had turned the electoral tide in his favour, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Four TV network polls found him the least persuasive of the candidates. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic contender, was the 'winner' in two, Mr Ross Perot, the independent, in one, while the other had these two tied. Only in the poll that gave the nod to Mr Perot was Mr Bush reckoned to have matched Mr Clinton. This confrontation saw some spirited exchanges. The most eye-catching assaults were launched by Mr Perot on Mr Bush over his pre-Gulf war policies towards Iraq as well as over Panama, the savings and loan scandals, the health of the banking system, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and foreign attempts to take over US airlines. Mr Bush repeatedly said there was 'a dangerous pattern' to Mr Clinton's behaviour of not speaking the truth and that therefore he could not be trusted in the White House. Mr Clinton kept recalling Mr Bush's infamous 'read my lips, no new taxes' pledge of four years ago and said that although Mr Bush was only too willing to cede control of economic policy to his campaign chief, Mr James Baker, 'the person responsible for economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton'. This permitted the president one of his better interventions: 'That's what worries me, he's going to be responsible.' Yesterday, Mr Clinton promised to hammer away at economic issues, a strategy that has brought him leads of 12-18 points in most national polls.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: UK side behind Vibroplant advance Helped by improved UK trading conditions in the first half which were sustained in the second six months, Vibroplant, the specialist plant hire group, lifted pre-tax profits by 47 per cent from a depressed Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 2.8m in the year to March 31. Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, pointed out that with turnover only marginally ahead at Pounds 71.1m (Pounds 69.9m), the result was achieved through better utilisation of a smaller rental fleet. On the basis of the improved performance and with the prospect of further progress this year, the recommended final dividend is restored to the 1992 level of 2.38p (1.28p) making a total of 3.6p (2.5p). Earnings per share were 3.78p (2.66p). In the UK, pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 1.29m) on turnover up 3 per cent to Pounds 35.8m. The most marked improvement came in the second half where revenues grew by more than 7 per cent. Mr Pilkington said that while future prospects depended on the resumption of real growth in construction output, 'the outlook is now more encouraging than it has been for several years'. The US, however, remained a problematic market for the group and pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 608,000) after making a Pounds 200,000 provision this time to cover the possible outcome of a lawsuit. Translated turnover was unchanged at Pounds 35.1m, but dollar revenues declined by 10 per cent to Dollars 52.8m because of both reduced machine sales activity and a reduction in the size of the rental fleet. However, Mr Pilkington predicted that with the benefit of a growing US economy 'we can look forward to a period of steady improvement in the performance of our US operations'.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Solid sales growth lifts Heinz in first quarter Solid growth in sales volumes, especially overseas, helped HJ Heinz post profits after tax of Dollars 154.7m in its fiscal first quarter. Although net income was only slightly higher than the Dollars 152.2m earned a year earlier, sales were up 10 per cent at Dollars 1.74bn, reversing the decline recorded in the previous quarter. Investors reacted positively to the first-quarter results, and to a prediction from Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman who is chairman of Heinz, that the company would report higher earnings from on-going operations for the full year to April 1995. In late trading, Heinz's shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr O'Reilly said of the quarter's results and the outlook for earnings: 'The restructuring of our business portfolio, placing particular emphasis on food-service, infant feeding and Asia, has put us into growth areas which should enable us to deliver substantial full-year earnings growth'. Heinz's sales volume increased by 7 per cent worldwide. Its food-service business showed strong growth in particular products, notably ketchup, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and single-service condiments. Business was especially impressive in the Asia-Pacific region, with sales volume in Japan alone rising by 16 per cent. The first quarter was also an active period for Heinz in terms of further expansion into European and US markets. The company bought the Farley's infant food and adult nutrition business in the UK, and acquired a food-service unit from Borden of the US. Both transactions were part of Heinz's policy of focusing on its infant food and food-service businesses. The acquisitions - net of divestitures - added 2 per cent to sales in the quarter.</p>

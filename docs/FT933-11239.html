			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2 begins a series, Architecture Of The Imagination (9.30) which promises to 'explore the deeper meaning of everyday architectural surroundings', starting with the door. Other programmes will deal with the stairway, the window, the bridge and the tower, which, we are told, will be analysed via film clips, contemporary images and psychological revelations. For years Friday was the night to stay in and watch movies. Often there was an embarrassment of choice, with several good offers overlapping. And now? BBC1 screens a 1988 flop called She's Having A Baby (10.20) described by the leading American movie guide as a comedy drama which 'grows monotonous after a while'. BBC2 offers Fritz Lang's 1948 pot boiler The Secret Beyond The Door about an heiress who marries a millionaire and suspects she may become his victim. James Agee said: 'It's a hopeless job and a worthless movie' (11.20). Channel 4 goes even further back to dig out a Boris Karloff horror movie from 1936: The Walking Dead(12.05). Sounds like a night when you pays your money and goes out to dinner.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Nationalists proclaim new Croatian state NATIONALIST Croat leaders in Bosnia-Hercegovina at the weekend proclaimed an independent Croatian state, in a move which could undermine international attempts to end the bloodshed in the former Yugoslav republic. The creation of the state, to be known as Herceg-Bosnia, is in line with a secret pact between Serbia and Croatia to divide Bosnia. Militant Serb leaders from Bosnia yesterday welcomed the proclamation, Belgrade Radio reported. The proclamation was made by Mr Mate Boban, a leading politician of the Bosnian Croatian Democratic Union, sister-party of the ruling party in Croatia. Earlier this year, he took part in secret talks with Serbian leaders on plans to divide the republic between Croatia and Serbia. Sarajevo Radio reported the Croatian flag will fly in the territory and the Croatian dinar be used, but did not detail the exact relationship with Croatia. Herceg-Bosnia is thought to cover about one-third of Bosnia, from Neum, on the Adriatic, through Kiseljak to Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern border with Croatia. It includes territory with concentrations of ethnic Croats, who make up 17 per cent of Bosnia's 4.35m population. Croat forces, backed by Zagreb, have launched an offensive in the south of the republic, gaining control of Mostar, capital-designate of the new Croatian state. The Croat proclamation follows a similar one on April 7 of a Serbian state covering 65 per cent of Bosnian territory. Serb forces control over half Bosnia, and for three months have besieged Sarajevo, trying to partition the Bosnian capital. Creation of such states would be at the expense of Bosnia's Moslems, who at 44 per cent of the population are the largest ethnic group. In Sarajevo, Gen Satish Nambiar, commander of the UN peace-keeping force, held separate talks with Bosnia's national leaders. Anti-aircraft fire eased after weekend clashes threatened to imperil an airlift of relief supplies to the capital. Sixteen more aircraft arrived yesterday, bringing the weekend total to 28.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE WASN'T JUST FOR FUN  </P> <P> I really get irritated by statements like the one made by (the Irvine Co.'s  Larry Thomas, May 7) when he said that they only invite supervisors' aides  because "it's fun" to participate in yacht cruises, etc.  </P> <P> If Thomas does it for fun, why didn't he invite me? Why didn't he give that  money to the United Way, Girl Scouts or an old folks' home? Why didn't he  sponsor some dancers at a Cinco de Mayo festival?  </P> <P> Obviously because none of the aforementioned people are in a position to give  something back. Thomas fully expects a reward, maybe not a tangible one, tit  for tat, but a reward in some way, shape or form.  </P> <P> The irritating part of it is that he expects people to believe him. Does he  really think we are that stupid?  </P> <P> Let's call it a bribe because that's all it is. A legal one perhaps, but a  bribe nonetheless, and the results are the same as with an illegal bribe. You  give me something, I'll give you something.  </P> <P> When bribes are given to elected representatives or their staff, it's wrong,  it's a circumvention of the elective process and it should be illegal.  </P> <P> Either Thomas is very naive or he thinks I am very stupid. Either way, his  statement was very irritating. Why doesn't he come out and say the truth. "We  do it because it's good for business and we can get away with it."  </P> <P> FRANK D.

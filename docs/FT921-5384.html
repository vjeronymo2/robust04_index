			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Company in US lures Russian computer expert Sun Microsystems, the US computer company, has become one of the first Western companies to tap the wealth of scientific talent in the former Soviet Union by signing a research agreement with one of Russia's top computer experts. Sun, a specialist in computer work stations, said yesterday that Mr Boris Babayan and some 50 colleagues at the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology in Moscow would carry out research on behalf of the company. Mr Babayan is credited with creating the supercomputers used by the Soviet space programme and by the Soviet military to design nuclear weapons. The California-based company said it had not hired Mr Babayan, who would continue to work for the institute, but had provided him with a 'grant ' and workstations. Sun appears to be getting the services of the Russian scientists very cheaply.</p>

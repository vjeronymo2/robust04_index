			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A NIFTY PLACE TO HORSE AROUND  </P> <P> First there's the aroma from the bales of hay stacked in the parking lot. Then  you get a whiff of the leather boots and saddles when you walk through the  front door.  </P> <P> Whether you grew up on a ranch or just watch a lot of Western movies, Mary's  Tack and Feed store will bring a rush of nostalgia.  </P> <P> This is a place where you can outfit yourself for riding to the hounds, take a  saunter through the Old West -- or just look around at what may be the best  collection of leathers, brass, jodhpurs and blue jeans anywhere in the world.  </P> <P> Mary Hammond started the store in 1963 in a former hamburger stand. Then, 14  years ago, she sold it to Mike and Saleta Mosley. Ever since, the small store  at Via De La Valle and El Camino Real on the edge of Del Mar has grown with the  North County population. In 1985, the Mosleys built a new and larger store  across the street from the original tack shop.  </P> <P> Today, Mary's is believed to be one of the largest tack and feed stores in the  country, attracting customers from all over the U.S. as well as Mexico and  South America. Because of the large volume of business, including telephone and  mail orders, the Mosleys are computerizing the business and creating a  catalogue division.  </P> <P> The store is in an area that was part of Del Mar's first ranch; for years  farmers grew beans on the land. Today, the area is a hub for everything  equestrian. The Rancho Santa Fe Polo Club is across the street, All Creatures  animal hospital is next door, and the recently completed Showpark Riding Club  borders to the south.  </P> <P> But you don't have to own a horse or like riding to get a kick out of this  mercantile establishment. It's full of gadgets and special equipment, live farm  animals and pet supplies, books, pictures and video tapes. Blankets hang from  the rafters, reins are draped on the walls, and finches and cockatiels chatter  busily in an alcove.  </P> <P> Melanie Klika, who manages the store, points out that there is both rhyme and  reason to the store's layout. Outside are the roomy pipe and wire cages for dog  runs, keeping exotic birds outside, and sheltering other critters. That's also  where the big trucks pull up to deliver hay, grain, straw and other bulk  supplies for stables. Those big plastic tubs, explained one worker, actually  are watering troughs.  </P> <P> There are always a lot of kids around Mary's -- probably because of the  collection of exotic animals. Black Polish roosters with white ruffled  headdress prance around a shaded cage while next door geese tend a nest of eggs  in a mound of straw.  </P> <P> "We used to have a lot more animals," Mike Mosley explained, "but people don't  buy them anymore. People don't keep chickens (or peacocks or goats) in the back  yard."  </P> <P> Also, Mosley said, the outer yard of the store isn't fenced, and the animals  become easy pickings. One night several expensive wood ducks disappeared,  probably to become a gourmet dinner somewhere.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Klika said, the store is browser-friendly, and the bulletin board  by the front door proves it. There, people list saddles, horse blankets, horses  and pups and other goods for sale.  </P> <P> The interior of the store would seem like a jumble of merchandise, if it  weren't for Klika's guiding hand. The downstairs is devoted to English riding  supplies, including everything for jumping, show horses and polo riding. That's  where riders get fitted for tall black boots and little velvet-covered safety  helmets. Upstairs is the realm of the Western rider, where supplies even  include silver saddle and bridle decorations to dress a pony for a parade.  </P> <P> Outfitting a new horse with basic riding gear can be as exciting as buying a  new personal wardrobe, and costs about the same. For the basics, including a  saddle, the minimum expenditure is about $750, Klika said. But the higher  possibilities are almost limitless.  </P> <P> "A new saddle may be $400," she said, "but then you can go as high as you want,  on up to $2,000."  </P> <P> Though Mary's is only about a mile from the Del Mar Race Track, the store  doesn't cater to the racing trade at all. "The suppliers travel with the race  circuit," Mosley said. "They have trailers with supplies for racing, and when  Del Mar is done, they move on to another race track."  </P> <P> The 32 employees at Mary's must be knowledgeable about such things as how to  tighten a stirrup and which crop is appropriate for riding and which is used in  the exercise ring. Klika tries to hire people who have had experience with  horsemanship and husbandry, but even so, training is necessary to keep up with  the latest products and technology.  </P> <P> Klika herself has been at the store for almost nine years. Formerly, she worked  as an assistant news photographer at Channel 8. She'd always loved riding and  horses, and decided to make a career change into something related to her  hobby. Since that time, Klika has gradually moved from living in the city to  her own ranch in Julian.  </P> <P> She doesn't mind the commute to her job, though.  </P> <P> Both she and Mosley say the best part of the business is not the horses but the  people -- customers who have been coming to the store since the start of the  business and have become friends. "I've seen kids grow up with the shop," Klika  said.  </P></p>

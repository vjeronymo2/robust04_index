			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television How low can BBC1 sink? It screens a new cringe show today in which a search will be made for 'Britain's most useless woman'. What disgraceful male chauvinist piggishness ..Whoops] Sorry, it actually says 'Britain's most useless man', so that's all right. Called The Opposite Sex the programme is produced and presented by Chris Tarrant, star 12 years ago of 'OTT', which stood for 'Over The Top' where people were covered in custard and so on. It was scrapped by Bob Phillis, then head of Central TV, now Deputy Director-General of the BBC. Today's show is largely devoted to couples 'airing their dirty laundry in public' (8.30). The 40-minute drama 'Low Level Panic' in the BBC2 series Stages stars Charlotte Coleman as one of three flatmates who spend much of the time in their bathroom (9.25). Desmond Morris ends his series about The Human Animal with a programme on playfulness (9.30 BBC1). That is followed by two more repeats from the ATV stockpile: Roger Moore and Tony Curtis as The Persuaders and Richard Bradford in Man In A Suitcase (10.20).</p>

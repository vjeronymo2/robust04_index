			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Ukraine shivers as energy dwindles Ukraine's rapidly dwindling energy supplies have prompted the prime minister, Mr Yefim Zviagilsky, to call for an 'economic state of emergency' to force energy saving measures. The energy ministry has warned that Ukraine has reserves for just one month. If nothing was done to help import gas and oil, the ministry said, Ukraine 'could expect an Armenian winter' - referring to last winter when Armenians lived without heat and electricity during their war with Azerbaijan. Ukrainian enterprises have already been asked to reduce the gas they use by 30 per cent, and some factories have been ordered to halve their energy consumption. Bankrupt Ukraine, reliant on Russia for about 90 per cent of its oil and gas, owes its eastern neighbour about Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) for energy. Negotiations to swap debt for Ukraine's share of the Black Sea fleet have stalled and the republic has no money for energy shipments. According to the energy ministry Dollars 300m worth of oil and gas is needed immediately, and it is urging the government to resume negotiations with Russia for special winter deliveries. It calculates that Dollars 9bn worth of oil and gas will be needed to get through 1994 without factory closures. Russia has been raising energy prices in an effort to stop its subsiding of former Soviet republics. It currently charges Ukraine about 70 per cent of world prices - in roubles, rather than Ukraine's currency, which has lost more than 80 per cent of its value in the past three months. But the Ukrainian economy has been too weak to absorb these price shocks. Kiev subsidises electricity for the domestic market by about 90 per cent, and is thus unable to cover the cost of energy imports with receipts from its sale. Instead, the republic's leaders have used export earnings from agriculture and metals. But their recent currency control policies have discouraged official exports, leaving state coffers empty. Ukraine is only earning Dollars 15m a week, and it needs around Dollars 20m a day for energy. Ukraine's domestic energy sector provides about half the country's needs, but is experiencing difficulties. Nuclear power stations are plagued by shortages of fuel and safety concerns. Coal mines are nearly exhausted and are controlled by politically active unions who frequently strike. The energy crisis is now dominating parliament, and has prompted a special energy producers' congress and an emergency cabinet meeting on the subject. Some argue that the government needs to issue more credits, but as the parliamentary chairman, Mr Ivan Plyshch, points out: 'If you want paper, the so-called legal currency, I can give the order for the printing presses to start running right away. But that would only add to hyperinflation.' Ironically, the energy crunch is forcing Kiev's Soviet-style leaders to contemplate the previously unthinkable: closing down inefficient industries. 'Since we can't stop heating homes or supplying agriculture with fuel, we must close down a number of high-energy-use enterprises,' said Mr Vilen Semenyuk, energy minister. 'The only other choice is to get more fuel.' Meanwhile, with temperatures touching minus 20'C, Ukrainians are adjusting to power cuts and colder homes and offices in the worst winter for 50 years.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / EC VAT transition plan The EC Commission is to try to simplify the transitional system for collecting and accounting for value added tax and excise duties in the single European market, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The system, which comes into force from next January 1, is designed to adapt current VAT procedures to the abolition of border controls. It has been widely criticised for imposing new administrative burdens on European business. But Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC tax commissioner, said yesterday Brussels would publish a new directive aimed at eliminating certain technical difficulties with the system. The directive will tackle VAT problems which might arise from 'triangular trade' in the EC. For example, a Belgian company ordering Spanish goods for delivery to a French subsidiary will not have to register for VAT in France. Instead the French subsidiary will be directly liable. The transitional system should be replaced with a definitive scheme from January 1997.</p>

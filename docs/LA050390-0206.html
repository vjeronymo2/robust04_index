			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> $112,347 ON ITS WAY FOR MEASLES FIGHT  </P> <P> The California Department of Health Services released $1.2 million in emergency  funds Wednesday to deal with what health officials say is the worst measles  epidemic in the state in two decades.  </P> <P> Among the hardest hit by the epidemic have been Los Angeles and Orange  counties, which will receive $300,000 and $112,347 respectively.  </P> <P> California health officials said the state death toll from measles for the  first four months of this year has already surpassed the number of deaths due  to measles for all of 1989. Measles has claimed 30 lives -- two in Orange  County -- so far this year, contrasted with 20 the year before, health  officials said.  </P> <P> There were 2,269 cases of the disease reported from January through April this  year; for all of last year 3,048 cases were reported. Toddlers and other young  children are most often the victims of the disease, officials said.  </P> <P> "It's quite serious," said Jaime Arteaga, a spokesman for the California  Department of Health Services. "It's because the children have not been  immunized. We're seeing a lot of cases among lower-income and migrant  children."  </P> <P> Twenty jurisdictions throughout the state will divide the funding, which is  expected to reach local health agencies within the next two or three weeks. The  money may be used to pay for increasing immunization services by expanding  clinic staffs, hours of operation and locations of service. Funding may also be  used to provide transportation to and from the clinics.  </P> <P> The aid is being provided from the state's Special Needs and Priorities --  commonly known as SNAP -- funds, money that is left over from the fiscal year  and made available for health emergencies.  </P> <P> Despite a shortage of vaccine earlier this year, health officials said they are  confident there will be enough through the end of the year. Merck, Sharp &amp;  Dohme, the manufacturer of the vaccine, has assured the state that the company  "will meet all anticipated demands through 1990," Arteaga said. ROSE ELLEN  O'CONNOR  </P></p>

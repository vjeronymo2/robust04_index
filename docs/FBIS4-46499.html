			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Reznik report: "Explosion After Explosion. Pacific </F> Fleet Protests Against Its Commander's Dismissal"]    [Text] Maritime Kray -- This is the second week running  that there has been a sound of firing amid a range of hills near  the Maritime Kray village of Novonezhino, where the Pacific  Fleet Air Force arsenal is located. The sound is made by  engineers collecting and destroying the missiles, bombs,  mortars, and shells that were dispersed in the wake of the 14  May explosion.... Things are worryingly deserted for many  kilometers all around -- there are deserted houses with broken  windows, militia cordons....  <H5>  In Defense of the Admiral </H5>   At the same time, the Pacific Fleet is being rocked by other  explosions covering ships, combined units, and ground, air  force, and hydrographical services over a huge area --  explosions of protest against the dismissal of Admiral Georgiy  Gurinov, commander of the Pacific Fleet. Telegrams and letters  are being sent to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev from officers' collectives appealing for  the decision to remove their commander to be reviewed. This is  a hitherto unheard-of phenomenon in military circles. Petitions  have been fearlessly signed by all 142 of the Fleet's admirals  and staff officers, officers' assemblies at the Admiral Makarov  Naval College, and around 3,500 officers, ensigns, and sailors  in the nuclear submarine fleet.... Veterans from the Pacific  Fleet and the city of Vladivostok have come to the commander's  support, along with the Council of Soldiers' and Sailors'  Mothers....    Grachev's telegram to the Pacific Fleet stated that Adm.  Gurinov had been dismissed for "...serious shortcomings in his  organizational activity relating to leadership of the Fleet."  The accusation was formulated in the relatively classic way --  it can be used to remove any commander, including a flag  officer. And at any time, if we proceed on the Dostoyevskiyan  basis that "...absolutely anyone can be blamed for anything."  Just how far does Gurinov's guilt square with this very severe  punishment? Why have Pacific Fleet sailors been taking a moral  stand in defending their senior admiral en masse -- going  against the unwritten list of bans that prevents people speaking  up for their commander before his superiors?    In order to understand this, we need to compare the  situation  in the Pacific Fleet a year ago, before Gurinov arrived, with  the way things are now.  <H5>  Difficult Inheritance </H5>   Last May, when IZVESTIYA was introducing Adm. Gurinov to  readers as the Pacific Fleet Commander, we noted that he was  inheriting a lot of naval problems. We need only recall the  monstrous neglect and complete chaos at the Fleet's training  schools on Russkiy Island, where four sailors died of  starvation, cold, maltreatment, and illness. The then command  was very much involved in commerce. Pacific Fleet auxiliaries  suddenly turned up off foreign shores in the hands of very  dubious firms. The Fleet was constantly rocked by accidents and  people would be killed. The combat training indicators were  very low....    The Pacific Fleet is the kind of cumbersome organization  that  takes years to get to know and get to grips with its problems.  Gurinov managed to change a lot in one year. This is not my  opinion -- it is the view of prestigious military and naval  specialists (around 100 of them) who, on the instructions of the  Defense Ministry and the Naval High Command, recently carried  out comprehensive checks of all the local services and combined  units. Speaking at the time at a press conference on the results  of the checks, Igor Kasatonov, Deputy Commander in Chief of the  Navy, made a high assessment of the Fleet's combat readiness,  had some warm words to say about its commander, and referred  approvingly to the morale climate in combined and other units....    Military matters are a subtle area -- they are not something  you discuss with "all and sundry." But here is, for us, an  important and accurate piece of information -- under Adm.  Gurinov's command the Pacific Fleet significantly improved all  the main objective indicators of its activity (its  operational-tactical and headquarters training), strengthened  military discipline, reduced its accident rate.... Ships that  had been languishing offshore finally put to sea, and the combat  training plan was completely fulfilled.    We would note that the current command is steering the Fleet  through the turbulent maelstroms and deadly shoals of our common  life -- which is by no means improving. We should ponder on the  fact that since the start of the year the Pacific Fleet has not  been allocated even 25 percent of the minimum amount of  appropriations it had requested. There is not even enough money  to pay wages. There are no funds to deliver provisions and fuel  to remote Fleet centers scattered around the coastline and  islands. Ships return from combat standby duty and the crews  should be sent on leave, but it is impossible -- there is no  money to buy tickets from Aeroflot. Housing construction for  officers has virtually ground to a halt -- in May, for instance,  only 350 million rubles [R] of the R18.5 billion required for  these purposes were allocated....    Despite these and many other circumstances beyond its  control, the Pacific Fleet is, to use military language,  "fulfilling its mission" and carrying out its difficult job,  which has now lost all its romance.    So what exactly happened between April and early May to make  Pavel Grachev suddenly describe the Pacific Fleet as the worst  in the Armed Forces and call its commander unsuitable? That is  a puzzle not only to the men of the Pacific Fleet. Why, they  ask, are some people keeping their commands when performance and  morale are plummeting, while others lose their jobs at a time  when, despite everything, they have the situation "under  control"?    Since not the slightest attempt was made to offer a reason  for the Pacific Fleet commander's removal, this gave rise to a  lot of assumptions. The usual intrigues -- including military  intrigues -- are suspected in Moscow's corridors of power. But  more often people say that the reason for the admiral's  dismissal is connected with the explosions at the Novonezhino  arsenals.  <H5>  Special Danger Zone </H5>   Every morning I turn on the radio in suspense to hear what  has blown up where. If there is no such report, I breathe  easier -- we have gotten away with it. But in general, there  are so many accidents, particularly here in the Far East, that  it sometimes seems as though they are being churned out by some  diabolical factory with a view to depriving us of our spiritual  peace. It would be better not to know what kind of dangerous  stuff is hidden away from view in the harmless-sounding  "prohibited areas" that are scattered across all parts of the  Far East, even to be found in cities shaded by nearby woods.  About a year ago a retired military man who had "nothing to  lose" -- since he was emigrating that very day to live in one of  our nearest-neighbor countries -- came into the IZVESTIYA  correspondents' center and said that there was a chemical  weapons arsenal in Khabarovsk behind a green-shaded corner as  you turn toward the Krasnaya stream. One faulty bomb is all it  would take to do away with this city of 700,000.    We who live here would like to know how reliably these most  dangerous weapons are guarded and by whom. But unfortunately,  when we are talking about arms, particularly of such a dangerous  type, social forces become socially impotent. We find ourselves  in servile dependence on Defense Ministry generals and we are  forced to reassure ourselves with the mantra: "They have a  clearer picture." Admittedly, in this instance the people of  Khabarovsk can be reassured: In preparing this article, I  phoned Lieutenant General Valeriy Samsonov, chief of staff of  the Far East Military District, who told me that the chemical  weapons arsenal had been removed from Khabarovsk. But how many  other arsenals are left?    The military told me that, when the thousands of tonnes of  bombs went off at Novonezhino, they prayed that the missile fuel  dumps nearby would not go up by accident or (it does not bear  thinking about!) some smoldering rocket would not fly off to  Bolshoy Kamen and hit a submarine with a nuclear reactor. As is  now clear, the sheer chance that the explosions in Vladivostok  and Novonezhino happened on the same day -- 14 May -- two years  apart is seen by many people as neatly preordained, and even the  possibility of sabotage is not being ruled out. Our usual lack  of organization has been evident in our investigation into the  cause of this latest disaster. But more of this later; for now  we will try to see how many weapons and munitions have been  amassed in the Pacific Fleet alone, who guards them, and in what  way.    I have obtained the document -- a submission from the  Military Prosecutor's Office -- "On Eradicating Violations of  Legislation on the Storage of Weapons, Ammunition, and  Explosives." This is the fruit of a two-month (February-March  last year) investigation into the Pacific Fleet's arsenals  carried out not only by prosecution personnel but also by  specialists from the Navy High Command's Missile and Artillery  Armaments Directorate. Here are some selected extracts from the  document:    "...The bulk of the arms checked do not accord with the  requirements of the guidance document on ensuring the  safekeeping of weapons and ammunition. The premises in which  they are stored are not made of reinforced concrete or of brick  with reinforced concrete roofs and floors. Many dumps are too  full and the ammunition is not stacked safely. Appropriations  for the construction of new dumps are not being allocated. Not  a single paragraph of the long-term plan for the construction of  technical security facilities in 1991-1995 has been carried out.  As a result, most of the installations checked have homemade  alarm systems which cannot provide reliable security. Almost  half of the wooden boxes in which the weapons and ammunition are  stored are unsuitable, stacks of shells of different calibers  have collapsed, shells are scattered around and many of them are  rusty, yet they are not being written off or destroyed...."    We would note in passing that these outrages were happening  before Adm. Gurinov even arrived to command the Fleet, so that  according to normal logic he should not be held responsible for  them. As a rule, the arsenals were replenished irrespective of  the real needs of the Pacific Fleet or of what its commanders  wanted. There are plenty of examples of this, but we will take  the most immediate -- the Novonezhino arsenal. Rear Admiral  German Ugryumov, Pacific Fleet chief of military  counterintelligence, told me that at the time of the explosion  around 2,000 standard carloads of aviation ammunition of various  yields and calibers had built up there -- almost three times  more than the potential storage norm. A considerable proportion  of this dangerous cargo was dispatched here, on the orders of  the Defense Ministry leadership, from...the Baltic. Maybe the  shores of the Pacific were in particular need of bombs,  missiles, and shells that were superfluous to the Baltic? It  turns out that they were transported across the entire country  so as to be...destroyed here. It is ideas like that, not a lack  of ideas, that constitute real stupidity.    Ammunition to be recycled accounted for more than 70 percent  of what was stored in the Novonezhino dumps. How much is at  other dumps? This is a big secret, but people in the know have  told me that Defense Ministry officials have long regarded the  Russian Far East as a huge dump for radioactive material and  explosives. The local authorities are stubbornly trying to  ensure the adoption of a national program for the destruction of  unnecessary armaments. The government assures us that there are  no funds available at the moment, while...throwing away much  bigger sums on endlessly "overcoming obstacles." For instance,  Svetlana Parinov, chairman of the Maritime Kray Economics and  Planning Committee, reported that the Novonezhino explosion  would cost the treasury at least R31 billion. This amount does  not include the losses suffered by the Fleet. Add to this the  colossal expenditure on the clear-up operations after the  explosions at the Vladivostok arsenal two years ago and  innumerable "trivial" accidents of which Russian readers are no  longer informed because they are considered so routine....    Who has worked out how much money will be needed to guard  and  maintain "dead" -- decommissioned -- nuclear submarines? Their  missile launchers are removed, but their nuclear reactors remain  in place. These need to be constantly monitored by highly  skilled specialists in order to prevent a disaster. These craft  have been waiting to be recycled for years, and they are being  joined by new submarines all the time.... Their crews,  disbanded on paper, have been forced to continue their now  simply stupid, although extremely responsible service.    If such fabulous expenditure is to be avoided, the  government  should clearly come up with the funds to set up facilities to  destroy unnecessary arms. But clearly we should start by  organizing reliable security at the arsenals. The way this is  currently organized is graphically visible from the same  prosecution submission:    "...Weapons and ammunition dumps in the Pacific Fleet are  mainly guarded by squads of paramilitary security force riflemen  which, owing to their low pay, are not fully staffed and  experience considerable manpower turnover. Absences without  leave and drunkenness are widespread among the security  staff...."    Now let us imagine the old men and women compelled out of  great necessity (who would agree to guard weapons dumps far from  home, without any uniforms or normal food, for a miserable  salary?) to guard things on which not only human life but the  continued presence on the map of entire cities depends. And  this is happening at a time when criminal structures are doing  everything to get their hands on weapons.  <H5>  The Boys Wanted a Little Silver... </H5>   Let us return to the Novonezhino explosion. It is now clear  that it was not the result of an agricultural fire, as all the  press had initially reported. The accident was caused by two  sailors from the arsenal's security subunit. The motives and  circumstances of the incident were set out in such a  contradictory way by the newspapers that I turned for the most  accurate information to Boris Larichev, Pacific Fleet deputy  military prosecutor, who is conducting the criminal case. Here  is what he said:    "That day Seamen D. and A. were not on patrol. D. had heard  that aircraft missile battery units contained silver, and, after  he had whispered the information to his comrades, they  infiltrated the dump. They found the missile stacks and, not  knowing where the battery units were located, started unscrewing  something with a bayonet. This turned out to be a tracking  flare -- it ignites when the missile is fired and burns for  around 20-25 seconds. Ignition can be triggered by friction or  a blow, which is what happened -- D.'s blade cut through the  foil covering the tracking flare and it ignited right in D.'s  hand. The sailor was burned, and then the whole rack caught  fire. The guys were scared, ran to the guardhouse, and then  took cover with the entire guard behind some mounds...."    This is what the Fleet got from these stupid young men who  had reinforced their untoward tendencies at vocational and  technical college. Now they face Article 251 "footnote" of the  Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "violation of the  regulations governing the handling of weapons and items and  substances posing a heightened danger to those in the  vicinity...." This article provides for terms of imprisonment  ranging from three to 15 years. The courts will probably  consider the fact that, thank God, nobody died during the  explosions to be an extenuating circumstance. This time we got  away with it.    Now let us enquire just what sort of order reigns in that  security detachment if the sailors could "fumble about" in the  arsenal entirely unmolested. The fact is that there was hardly  any security provided at all for a huge number of terrible  weapons. There were only 16 guards on duty instead of the 64  there should have been. No observation was being carried out  from guard towers and no checks were being done at checkpoints.  Contrary to regulations, these measures were replaced by  patrols of sailors armed only with bayonets around the four-km  perimeter of the arsenal. Yet it was storing not just aviation  ammunition but various small arms, which are so attractive to  the criminal world and those connected with it. Here at the  Novonezhino dumps forged documents had recently been used to  steal 41 Kalashnikov assault rifles, 31 Makarov pistols, 140  grenades, and over 20,000 rounds.... The crime was committed  with the participation of Major Votinov, former chief of the  arsenal, and other officers and staff from law-enforcement  organs. These weapons are now being confiscated from the mafia  and hired killers....    The Fleet and the people of the Far East know that Gurinov  had begun to seriously restore order at Pacific Fleet arsenals.  He issued a stern order to shoot to kill anyone who attempted  to infiltrate military arms dumps. The decision to dismiss him  leaves people confused and bitter.</p>

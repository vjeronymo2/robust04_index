			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Contracting out behind Capita's advance to Pounds 4.41m CAPITA GROUP, a provider of services to the public sector, yesterday reported a greater than expected increase in profits and earnings per share as it continued to enjoy the fruits of government contracting out. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 4.41m on sales up 34 per cent at Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 24.7m). Earnings per share rose 23 per cent to 19.3p (15.7p) and, as forecast at the interim stage, the total dividend is raised 17 per cent to 6.3p with a proposed final of 4.2p. A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. 'We are currently looking at a significant volume of new business opportunities,' said Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive. 'The organic opportunities are enormous.' Most of the growth came from the outsourcing division, launched in 1989, where sales expanded 59 per cent to Pounds 17.8m, although pre-tax profits rose only 25 per cent to Pounds 2.45m. Sales in the advisory business, the original Capita activity, grew by 13 per cent but profits were up 31 per cent at Pounds 1.95m. Mr Aldridge said that the most significant growth would come from the outsourcing of contracts from the 540 local authorities, less than 10 per cent of which were currently contracting out. At the end of the year, Capita had cash balances of Pounds 9.6m and no net borrowings, which, Mr Aldridge said, was a benefit when marketing to local authorities. The group had invested heavily during the year on the computer services division which resulted in the group spending Pounds 500,000 more than budgeted on sales and marketing. This had helped win additional contracts, the cost of which had been taken during the year but the benefit from which had hardly contributed to 1992 profits. COMMENT With the government determined to farm out large amounts of white collar work to the private sector, Capita is successfully mining a seam that a few years ago was almost non-existent. Without too much hyperbole, the potential markets can be measured in many billions of pounds, leaving Capita with the enviable problem of choosing where to deploy its growing but still limited resources. What is more, Capita's ability to generate sales from new products, like the collection of local taxes, should not be under-estimated. That said, much of this promise is already in the price after a strong run. Forecasts for this year of pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.5m, or earnings of 23.5p, anticipate contracts about to be announced and put the group on a prospective earnings multiple of 19. That is demanding but fair.</p>

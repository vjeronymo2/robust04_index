			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEADLY FORCE SETS OFF INVESTIGATION, LONG PROCESS OF SECOND-GUESSING  </P> <P> The decision to use deadly force is often made in a millisecond, but the  investigations and legal reviews on the shooting can often run into years.  </P> <P> Although the process varies throughout the state, in Orange County it is  standard practice that the district attorney's office investigates each case in  which a police officer fires his or her weapon in anger or in self-defense.  </P> <P> Officials defend this procedure as a way of avoiding criticism that comes when  police agencies investigate their officers, hoping that the use of an  independent, outside agency such as the district attorney's office will put  more faith into the outcome of the investigation.  </P> <P> "Law enforcement enjoys autonomy and traditionally is uneasy about other  agencies coming in and looking at the use of force," said Loren W. DuChesne,  head of investigations for the district attorney's office. "This way there is  more credibility in the result. That is what everyone -- the family, the police  agency, everyone -- is interested in. This offers less a chance for the  appearance of bias and favoritism."  </P> <P> According to DuChesne, 17 investigators are on 24-hour call to respond to any  police shooting and often arrive just minutes after the incident. The  investigators immediately begin questioning witnesses and gathering the  evidence, calling in a mobile crime-scene van to help in the investigation, and  set a time when the officer can be debriefed at length as to exactly what  happened.  </P> <P> In the interim, the officer is often put with a support partner who comforts  him during the initial stages of the investigation. When his gun is taken by  DuChesne's investigators as evidence, the police department replaces it with  another weapon.  </P> <P> While DuChesne's shooting team conducts its investigation, a number of other  things are happening simultaneously. A parallel investigation by the police  agency may be under way, not into the shooting itself but into other  circumstances surrounding the incident, such as if the suspect had been dealing  narcotics or was suspected of another crime.  </P> <P> In addition, some police unions and associations have standing policies that if  an officer feels the need, he can call an association attorney to represent him  immediately at the scene of the shooting.  </P> <P> "We only do it if we are asked," said Don Blankenship, president of the Santa  Ana Police Benevolent Assn. "Having the lawyer there doesn't constitute an  adversarial role. He is there to make sure all the officer's rights are being  afforded and he (the officer) is thinking clearly before he writes his report  or gives any statements."  </P> <P> After collecting evidence and interviewing the officer, DuChesne's  investigators then compile a report on the shooting, which is sent to a  coroner's review board consisting of a toxicologist, an investigator, a lawyer  from the district attorney's office, expert consultants and a representative of  the police department.  </P> <P> The final report is sent to a deputy district attorney, who then rules on the  case.  </P> <P> The investigation into the shooting can be a long one, taking four to five  months before a case is finally resolved.  </P> <P> "There is probably no case more difficult than a serious injury or death at the  hands of a police officer," DuChesne said. "Every jail death and shooting can  be expected to make the front page. That is the kind of media attention you can  expect. There is a tremendous amount of pressure on the officers and this  office.  </P> <P> "Nothing is second-guessed and scrutinized as much as a jail death or an  officer-involved shooting. What we do is eventually opened to the most  detailed, microscopic scrutiny. We take all these cases very seriously."  </P> <P> Often, DuChesne said, the officer who fired the gun may be one of the last  persons interviewed.  </P> <P> "You make sure the officer is capable of being interviewed," he said. "Is he  coherent? You allow him to call his family. You keep him busy. You give him a  support partner. You have to remain cognizant that he is undergoing a very  stressful situation.  </P> <P> "These are stressful interviews," DuChesne said, "because perhaps for the first  time the cop is on the other side. They are apprehensive. They are very  uncomfortable."  </P> <P> In his 11 years as head of investigations for the district attorney's office,  DuChesne said that only once was a law-enforcement officer prosecuted, and that  was for the non-fatal beating of a jail inmate.  </P> <P> Two other times the cases were so difficult to decide that they went to a grand  jury, and in both of those cases the officers were cleared of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think it speaks well for Orange County law enforcement," he  said. "But there is never a simple cut-and-dried case of law enforcement's use  of force. At some point in time you are going to have an issue. Somewhere there  is going to be a controversy about what happened."  </P></p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Market spirits buoyed by good inflation figure The good news on inflation in March came as a relief to markets that had been disappointed by the February figures. Not only did the headline and underlying rates fall, but analysts believe that the core measure of inflation, used by the Bank of England, also declined. The Bank's inflation measure, known as RPI (Y), excludes the effects of tax as well as mortgage interest payments. Although the Bank only publishes the measure every quarter, Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, calculates that the rate fell to 2.1 per cent in March, from 2.5 per cent in February. Food prices rose by 0.6 per cent between February and March, according to the Central Statistical Office, but the annual rate of growth in food prices dropped back to 0.2 per cent, the lowest since May 1983. Increases in seasonal food prices were offset by a low rate of growth in non-seasonal food. Two areas  - household goods and clothing and footwear  - continued to show rebounds from the January sales. Together with food, these components contributed 0.25 percentage points to the RPI's 0.3 per cent monthly in-crease. Price falls were recorded in a couple of areas: household services, where the main influence was British Telecommunication's abolition of the morning peak-time rate; and personal goods and services, where the chief cause of the fall was a decline in the price of spectacles. Inflation is likely to rise next month as a host of special factors affect the index. The imposition of value added tax on fuel will add about 0.37 per cent to the RPI. The Central Statistical Office does not at present intend to take account of customers who pre-paid fuel bills to avoid VAT. The reduction in mortgage interest relief will add 0.24 per cent to the RPI, although not to the underlying rate. Council tax bills were 9 per cent lower than poll tax bills, a factor which knocked 0.3 per cent off the index in April 1993. The benefit of that change will drop out of the annual comparison, and this year's increase of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent will add a further 0.1 per cent. However, April 1993's excise duty increases, which pushed up the RPI by 0.5 per cent, will also drop out of the annual figures. The cumulative effect of these measures will add around 0.5 per cent to the index. However, since core measures of inflation may have slowed since April 1993, the headline rate may not jump by the same amount. Greenwell Montagu is expecting the headline rate to rise to 2.6 per cent while Goldman Sachs thinks it will increase to 2.7 per cent.</p>

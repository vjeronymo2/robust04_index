			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tubmanburg, Liberia, March 28 (AFP) -- At least 80  people died in three days of fighting between rival clans of the  United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] in  this town 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Monrovia.    The town was quiet Monday [28 March] following the clashes  between Krahns and Mandingos which erupted Friday and raged  around the headquarters of ULIMO, one of Liberia's armed  factions. Some sporadic automatic weapons fire was audible from  the bush nearby around mid-day. Forces loyal to ULIMO leader  Alhaji Koromah had regained control of the town after Krahns,  loyal to ULIMO military commander General Roosevelt Johnson,  seized control from Kromah's Mandingo supporters following a  dawn attack on Friday.    The final toll of the fighting could be much higher, with  many decomposing bodies uncounted and strewing the streets of  the town centre and outlying districts.    The Krahns and Mandingos are the two major ethnic groups  within ULIMO.    Earlier this month a series of violent incidents between  ULIMO members of the two rival clans left around 200 dead.</p>

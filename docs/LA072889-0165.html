			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 'I GOT HIM,' GEISHA SAYS OF UNO EXIT  </P> <P> The former geisha whose tales of infidelity brought down Japan's prime minister  said today she cried tears of happiness when she saw Sosuke Uno announce his  resignation on nationwide television this week.  </P> <P> "Victory at last," was Mitsuko Nakanishi's first reaction when Uno told the  nation Monday he would resign. "Tears came running down. I felt like an athlete  who just won a game."  </P> <P> Uno, 66, who served only seven weeks as prime minister, was unable to put to  rest Nakanishi's allegations he paid her $21,000 for a four-month, extramarital  affair.  </P> <P> "If I had not spoken out, he would still be prime minister today," Nakanishi,  40, said in her first interview with a foreign correspondent since Uno's  resignation announcement.  </P> <P> "I set out to get him and I got him," said Nakanishi.  </P></p>

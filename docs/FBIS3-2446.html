			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The  most-urgently-needed human right is economic development,  according to Puncog and Gyainzim, deputies from Tibet to the  National People's Congress (NPC).    Puncog, of the Monba nationality, and Gyainzim, of the Lhoba  nationality, are here to attend the Second Plenary Session of  the NPC, China's legislature.    People of the Monba nationality live in Lebu in the depths  of  the Himalayas, while Lhoba people have their home in Medog  County, known as an "isolated island on the Qinghai-Tibet  plateau."    In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Puncog said, "in old  Tibet, we Monba and Lhoba people lived in harsh conditions and  had no right whatsoever."    The parliament of the old Tibetan local government held a  session every year, but "we Monba and Lhoba people were never  invited to attend," he recalled.    People of the two ethnic minorities were liberated after  democratic reforms were carried out in Tibet in 1959.    The two peoples were recognized by the central government as  minority nationalities enjoying the same rights as other  nationalities in China, he said. "As a result, we Monba and  Lhoba people have become masters of the country together with  people of the other 54 nationalities."    "The NPC has deputies from Monba and Lhoba people. We can  now participate in the running and discussing of state affairs  -- something unimaginable under the rule of the old Tibetan  local government," he said.    Gyainzim said that, in old Tibet, the Monba and Lhoba people  had absolutely nothing to do with state affairs.    "But now, as NPC deputies, we can say what our compatriots  want to say to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and  the State Council," he said.    During the First NPC Session held a year ago, President  Jiang  Zemin visited the Tibet delegation and inquired about the  living conditions of the Monba and Lhoba people, he recalled.    The two NPC deputies also noted that people of the two  minority nationalities are now becoming increasingly prosperous.    For example, the population of Lhoba people has more than  doubled in Medog county over the past four decades, Gyainzim  said.    In old Tibet, there was not a single doctor or nurse in  either Medog or Lebu, he recalled.    But now, hospitals have been built there and doctors are  available in every township inhabited by the Monba and Lhoba  people.    Previously, Monba and Lhoba people were all illiterates, he  said. Now, a public primary school has been set up in Lebu and  non-government-run primary schools have opened in four townships.    According to the two deputies, Monba and Lhoba people now  all  learn the Tibetan language. They have their own college  students, technicians, teachers and doctors.    "The government has done everything in its power to help us  ethnic minority people living in border areas become  prosperous," Gyainzim said.    Medog County used to be the only county in China without  access to roads, he said. To date, the state has spent 37  million yuan building a road leading to Medog.    Many workers gave their lives while building the road, he  said, adding that the road opened to traffic earlier this year.    The per-capita annual income in medog reached nearly 800  yuan  in 1993, up from just 100 yuan in the 1950s.    Puncog said that the Lebu area has scored even faster  economic growth in recent years.    The per-capita annual income there exceeded 1,000 yuan last  year, up from 90 yuan before 1959.    Savings deposits in the four townships inhabited by the  Monba  people totaled 450,000 yuan at the end of 1993, he said.    In old tibet, most Monba and Lhoba people lived in adobes  worse than cattle pens in shape, he said, adding that most of  them now live in new houses.    The government has earmarked 700,000 yuan to assist Monba  people in Lebu in improving their housing conditions. As a  result, 120 of the 144 Monba families have moved into new homes,  he said.    The rapid progress made by Monba and Lhoba people in recent  years serves as a good answer to the question of whether Tibet  has human rights, they noted.</p>

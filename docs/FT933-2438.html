			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / China hint of Atlanta Olympics boycott A TOP Chinese official warned yesterday that his country might boycott the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta unless Beijing was chosen to host the Games in 2000. As delegates gathered in Monaco for the annual meeting of the International Olympic Committee, which will decide among five contenders on Thursday, Mr Zhang Baifa, chief executive of the Beijing Olympic bid committee, said that in his view a boycott was possible because of political interference by the US House of Representatives, which voted in July to oppose China's bid on human rights grounds. In Beijing, however, an official said those comments were 'definitely not the position' of the Chinese committee. Mr Zhang's remarks, which he confirmed to Reuter in Monte Carlo, were made in an Australian television interview to be screened today. Odds on Sydney to host the Games shortened yesterday, with William Hill, the London bookmaker, offering 11-8 compared with 11-4. Beijing remains the favourite at 8-11, with Berlin at 5-1, Manchester at 7-1 and Istanbul the outsider at 100-1. Berlin's already battered cause was weakened by midweek bomb explosions which damaged premises of those sponsoring the city's campaign - some in Berlin oppose the bid on grounds of expense. The chances of Amsterdam as a 1986 candidate were irreparably damaged by protesters throwing paint and flour bombs at the Olympic elite as they entered meetings. It seems likely that the majority of African IOC members will support Beijing. Beijing may pay for fast pace, Weekend, Page XV</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 22 SAPA -- All prisoners will be  allowed to vote in the April election, the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] decided on Tuesday [22 March]. The  decision was taken in the light of widespread prisoner  dissatisfaction with not being allowed to vote and the  subsequent riots at prisons countrywide.    A joint TEC, Independent Electoral Commission and government  team was established to finalise the details.    The TEC decision reversed a decision last week not to allow  prisoners who were jailed without the option of a fine to vote  in spite of the Independent Electoral Commission advising that  discriminating against some prisoners would create logistical  difficulties.    African National Congress delegate Cyril Ramaphosa warned of  many more deaths unless all prisoners were given the vote. He  said 23 prisoners had already died.    Earlier in the day, about 50 members of the South African  Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights protested outside the  TEC building against the TEC's opposition to prisoners voting.    The TEC resolution was possible because the Democratic Party  reversed its opposition on practical grounds.    Government representative Roelf Meyer and Ciskei's Mickey  Webb reserved their positions but did not oppose the resolution.</p>

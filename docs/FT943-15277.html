			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / G7 leaders welcome Russia as full partner: Summit issues upbeat message on prospects for lasting growth The Group of Seven leading industrial democracies yesterday drew a line under the cold war era, embracing Russian president Boris Yeltsin as an equal partner in their annual review of international relations. The leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, together with the president of the European Commission, also sent a message of heightened optimism that their countries are back on a path of sustained, low inflationary growth. In spite of recent financial market turbulence over a weakening dollar, the Group of Seven abstained from commenting or offering the US currency overt support. However, G7 finance ministers stressed their belief that the dollar's fall was not warranted by economic fundamentals. Mr Yeltsin's full participation at yesterday's 'political G8' meeting and his agreement to a joint statement covering international flash points was hailed by fellow leaders as a real achievement. Mr Yeltsin said the recognition of Russia as a democratic state was the most important aspect of the summit for him. On Bosnia, the most delicate issue for the G8, Mr Yeltsin joined in warning the warring factions to agree to the latest peace plan by July 19. According to his G7 partners, Mr Yeltsin accepted that Russia would exert maximum pressure on the Serbs, its traditional allies. But the Russian president fiercely defended his country's sovereign interests in what has been described as the world's most exclusive club. Speaking after the conference and bilateral talks with US President Bill Clinton, Mr Yeltsin called for the lifting of restrictions against Russian exports. 'I threw off the red cloak a good three years ago,' he said, reminding his audience that Russia should no longer be treated as a communist state. Symbolising the new relationship with the industrialised nations, this year's summit was notable for the absence of any demand for economic hand-outs from the west. Instead, Mr Yeltsin persuaded the G7 that sharply lower inflation and greatly reduced budget deficits showed the Russian economy was finally responding to his reform efforts. For their part, the G7 painted an upbeat picture of their own economic prospects. 'They're talking about the G7 having a 2.5 per cent growth in its GDP' this year, said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary. 'That's sure a lot better than the 1 per cent we saw last year.' However, the economic summit recognised that improved growth alone would not cut the 24m unemployed in the G7 countries and the seven leaders adopted a programme of structural economic reforms to boost employment. These emphasised life-time education and retraining, reduction of barriers to employment, encouragement of new technology and freer trade. President Clinton failed to win a consensus for an early push on further trade liberalisation in such areas as investment, technical standards and telecommunications. However, the other main contentious issue was solved. After difficult negotiations among officials, the G7 countries agreed to offer Ukraine an initial payment of up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 131.5m) to shut down the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear plant on safety grounds.

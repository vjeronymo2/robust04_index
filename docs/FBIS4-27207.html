			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Who deleted a description of  a 20 million yen loan to the wife of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  from his 1993 asset disclosure report remains a mystery, the  Foreign Ministry and his financial secretaries said Tuesday [31  May].    Hata submitted to news organizations his fiscal 1994 asset  report that revived the deleted description of the 20 million  yen loan to his wife Yasuko from her father.    Hata's political office said although it incorporated the  description of the loan in last September's report, someone  removed the account from the photocopies of the report later  distributed to the mass media.    "We do not know why that description was deleted from the  copies of the report distributed to the press," said an official  at the political office.    The office said Yasuko borrowed the money to finance part of  the construction cost of Hata's private residence in Tokyo's  Setagaya ward.    The deletion called into question political ethics of the  premier who has been dubbed "Mr. Political Reform" since the  days when Hata was a legislator of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), political analysts said.    Hata's financial aide, Akira Makabe, told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE,  "I put the account of the loan onto the report after hearing its  explanation from the premier's wife and then I handed it over to  Mr. Yoichi Nishizawa, who was then serving as the political  secretary to then Foreign Minister Hata."    Makabe gave KYODO a photocopy of the duplicate copy of the  report carrying the description of the loan, which he said has  been kept at the office.    However, Nishizawa told KYODO, "although I certainly  received  the report from Mr. Makabe, I do not remember whether it carried  the description in question or not."    "I handed over the report to the ministry bureaucracy  without  tampering with it," he said.    The Foreign Ministry's General Affairs Division said the  report was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office after it was  ckecked by the Ministry's Personnel Division.    When the Prime Minister's Office distributed the photocopies  of the report to reporters at the press club covering the  premier's official residence, the submitted report's column for  loans and debts was blank, the division said.    The analysts said the description was possibly deleted by  either Hata's secretaries or bureaucrats, or the description  that was nonexistent on the initially compiled report was later  incorporated by someone.    Both Makabe and Nishizawa admitted it is hard to believe  that  bureaucrats deleted the description.    Meanwhile, Makabe acknowledged deleting another description  of a separate 50 million yen loan from the premier's 1993 asset  disclosure report.    The description was revived in this year's report.    The aide said Hata borrowed 50 million yen from Hachijuni  Bank in his constituency of Nagano Prefecture last June 25 by  pledging his 261-square-meter residence in Ueda, Nagano, as  collateral.    Hata needed the money to shoulder mandatory contributions to  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which he and his colleagues  founded last June after defecting from the LDP, he said.    The money was channeled to the party from Hata's own  fundraising organization, Shinwa-kai, to which Hata loaned the  50 million yen, the money he had borrowed from Hachijuni Bank.    Makabe told KYODO, "I decided not to put the description of  the loan onto the report with much hesitancy, as I thought  Hata's borrowing the money is almost tantamount to the  Shinwa-kai's borrowing the money.    "I should have incorporated the description of the loan onto  the report, as it is the money borrowed by Hata," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political commentary" by Shim'on Schiffer: "PLO's </F> Achievement"]    [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat can enter another  achievement in the log of his long voyage toward independence  for his Palestinian people.    The Oslo agreement formulators never even dared put the  possibility of foreign observers in the territories in writing.  It was taboo as far as Israel was concerned. And yet now  Israel has consented, for the first time, to the deployment of  an international force in the territories, and it does not  matter that it is called "temporary international presence."    Since 1967, Israel has refused, in one way or another, all  Palestinian demands raised through UN-endorsed resolutions to  hand the territories over to international custody. Now the  demand has been accepted as the interim stage en route to the  territories transfer to the Palestinians. The gain, therefore,  is now all 'Arafat's.    As for the opponents to the agreement with the PLO, they  can,  if they like, direct their complaints to Dr. Barukh Goldstein.  This was his present to them. The Hebron massacre accelerated  proceedings designed to sever and separate Israelis from  Palestinians.    'Arafat conceded nothing in the negotiations conducted after  the Hebron massacre: Contrary to reports about the  Palestinians' waiving the deployment of Palestinian policemen in  Hebron, they did not give in even on this issue. 'Arafat had no  use for a Palestinian police that was subordinate to Israeli  command. He was afraid -- with reason, from his viewpoint --  that the Palestinian public would perceive such policemen as  collaborators with the occupation regime. Thus the force of  several dozens Norwegians, to which Israel had agreed, became a  160-member observer force with a freedom of action in Hebron.    The second Cairo agreement, which was signed yesterday by  Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th, concurs with what any reader of  the Oslo agreement has always known -- that Israel is going to  surrender the territories it took in 1967. The Oslo agreement  has been described as vague and ambiguous in many spheres; the  second Cairo agreement elucidates the issues for those who are  still in the dark as to Israel's destination.    This agreement will also have a political ramification:  Please note that within a year, Israel will have gained many  enemies in Norway, Denmark, and Italy, three currently friendly  countries. The dispatch of observers from these countries to  Hebron is the surest way to turn the amicable relations with  people from these countries into hostility and resentment.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Vauxhall strike talks continue NEGOTIATIONS were contin-uing last night to try to avert a strike ballot over pay at Vauxhall. Union officials were threatening to call on the motor company's 9,000 manual workers to vote in support of industrial action if they did not receive a substantial pay offer. The management has proposed a two-year deal with a 2.1 per cent wage rise next month and a further 2.6 per cent increase in November next year. Union negotiators insist the company has the financial strength for a one-year pay deal of 6 per cent or more. Vauxhall argues that falling demand for car sales in continental Europe has halted its recovery in recent months. This has led to cuts in output at the company's Luton and Ellesmere Port plants. However, high profits and substantial productivity improvements have helped Vauxhall to weather the worst of the recession.</p>

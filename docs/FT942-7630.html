			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / France and Balladur, on recovery road: David Buchan on clear signs of an economic and popularity pick-up Mr Edouard Balladur now has something more sustaining to buoy him up than the traditional bark cigarettes and fermented manioc he had to smoke and drink last weekend with French Guyana Indians on an improbable European election swing through France's territories in the New World. On his return he found confirmation both of the recent recovery in his popularity in a Journal du Dimanche poll - which showed 47 per cent of French people were 'satisfied' with him as prime minister as against 44 per cent who were 'discontented' - and of the recent pick-up in the French economy. The lesson which Mr Balladur will almost certainly draw from this is that his best bet for the presidential election next year is to sit tight politically, avoid a repeat of his controversial education and labour market reforms of earlier this spring, and count on economic recovery to continue steadily into 1995. Insee, the government statistics agency, said last week it had enough evidence in from industrialists' order books and investment intentions, and from consumers' car and house purchases, to predict a 0.9 per cent growth in the first half of this year. Even in the unlikely event that the recovery flattened out entirely in the second half of the year, the 'carry-over' effect of this spring recovery would still give the country year-on-year average growth of 1.3 per cent over 1993. Insee provided still greater psychological comfort by scrapping its gloomy forecast of last Christmas that France's record 12.2 per cent jobless rate would be half a percentage point higher still by mid-1994. The agency noted that the service sector in France was at last performing as in most other advanced post-industrial societies by hiring enough people to absorb job losses in manufacturing and newcomers on to the labour market. Non-agricultural employment rose by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. There are other signs that French companies and households are shaking off their hesitancy about the future. After cutting spending on new plant and equipment by 17 per cent last year, company managers have told Insee and the Bank of France in repeated surveys that this year they intend to increase investment by up to 2 per cent globally. They need to do this - not to expand capacity (only 80.6 per cent of which was used in the first quarter of this year) but to modernise it. Low domestic inflation and demand, coupled with improved terms of trade, more than offset last year's 5 per cent appreciation of the franc against the weighted average of the currencies of its six leading European partners, and gave France a FFr90bn (Pounds 10.5bn) trade surplus in 1993. But as Europe came off the top of the German reunification boom, capital spending fell successively in France in 1991-93. 'Only a powerful revival in investment', a recent Paribas bank report claimed, 'is capable of enabling France to hang on to the benefits of the structural improvement in its trade balance.' Few French companies will need to go to the banks to fund new investment. Their rate of self-financing has risen from 95.6 per cent of their needs in 1991 to 121 per cent last year. As in the case of companies, it has not been chiefly shortage of cash or credit that has inhibited French households from spending more. Most indeed are net creditors, a fact that perversely puts less rather than more money in their hands as banks cut rates and so reduce their interest income. It is fear of unemployment that has so depressed household consumption. By allowing companies to keep real wages virtually static and by forcing the government to raise more money to pay for high social security expenditure, the jobs crisis has meant little rise in disposable income. People have also been putting more of it into 'precautionary saving'. This is why the Insee judgment that unemployment may now have stabilised may be important in persuading the French to save less and spend more. In response to specific government incentives, they are already spending more on new cars and houses this year. But the economics ministry is forecasting a more general improvement, with a 0.8 per cent rise in household consumption largely funded out of a 0.6 per cent drop in the savings rate this year. For a steady recovery of its economy, France needs steadiness abroad and at home, but the second condition is nearly impossible to guarantee in the run-up to the presidential contest next May. Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader and presidential contender, predicted last week that Mr Balladur would 'take no more risks, after his frightful climbdowns' earlier this year on education and labour reforms. That is probably true, though last week the government quietly liberalised the rules on Sunday opening hours for shops. However, at the very least, the prime minister will have to settle divisions within his own conservative majority over whether to use any elbow room in the 1995 budget for election-year income tax cuts or for less glamorous reductions in social welfare charges. Waiting to exploit any internal government arguments, too, is Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR Gaullist leader, who may not now wait much longer to announce his claim on the Elysee.</p>

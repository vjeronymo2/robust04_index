			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Drugs groups face call to cut prices by 2.5% DRUGS GROUPS expect to be told today that prices paid by the UK government will be cut across the board by 2.5 per cent. The price cut will be part of a package aimed at controlling the National Health Service drugs bill while encouraging the industry, one of the UK's top exporting sectors. Executives of drugs companies will be told the details of the package this afternoon. They must agree its terms before the measures can be implemented. The new package, which has involved renegotiating the voluntary agreement overseeing industry profits - the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme - is understood to be mostly favourable to the industry. The development follows the announcement yesterday by a big manufacturer that it had slashed the UK price of one of its best-selling medicines to avoid being put on an NHS blacklist. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American pharmaceuticals group, also said it would think twice before launching certain drugs in the UK in future. The moves in the UK are the latest in a series of measures by governments around the world to control spending on medicines. Price cuts have been introduced this year in Italy and Germany, where drugs sales fell 1.8 per cent and 11 per cent respectively during the first five months of the year. In the US, Mrs Hillary Clinton is leading a task force preparing health reforms, due to be released next month. RPR cut the UK price of its drug, a sleeping pill called Zimovane, from 98p to 16p per tablet. The medicine generated sales last year of Pounds 10m, compared with the group's UK prescription medicines turnover of Pounds 90m. The price cut takes effect from October 1. The company said the UK department of health was threatening to put the drug on a blacklist of products which could not be prescribed on the NHS if its price was not cut. The Department of Health is negotiating with the industry over blacklists for 10 therapeutic categories. Dr Ian Hindmarsh, professor of human psycho-pharmacology at the University of Surrey, said the introduction of blacklists could threaten patients' lives because old but cheap treatments with serious side effects would be prescribed in preference to newer, safer, but more expensive drugs. UK pharmaceuticals stocks fell on the news of RPR's price cut as the market expected other companies to follow suit. Glaxo, the company most exposed to the blacklists, closed down 12 1/2 p at 516 1/2 p. SmithKline Beecham, the UK healthcare group, dropped 11p to 438p, while Wellcome fell 22p to 654p and Zeneca, the recently floated ICI bioscience business, dropped 6p to 650p. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said RPR's Zimovane was not a typical example because its price was so far out of line with other products. But it accepted that other manufacturers would need to cut prices to avoid the blacklists. London stocks, Page 32</p>

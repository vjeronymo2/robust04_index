Tang held the first meeting this afternoon with Chiao  Jen-ho,  vice-chairman and secretary general of SEF, who arrived in  Beijing yesterday. Their meeting lasted two hours.    The two organizations also agreed that issues concerning  economic exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan  Strait should be put on the agenda, tang said at a press  conference right after his meeting with Chiao.    According to Tang, they reached understanding on two  important issues. First, being two authorized non-governmental  organizations, the two organs will continue to insist on the  unofficial nature of their agreements. Secondly, neither side  should force upon the other its political viewpoint through  discussions of such issues as "repatriation of hijackers", in  other words, political viewpoint of one side should not be  included in agreements of the two sides.    He said that the understanding would contribute to the  discussion of the issue of the repatriation of hijackers.    Both sides regarded the framework for a repatriation  agreement the two organizations reached in Taipei as a positive  beginning. The remaining issue of literal expression should be  resolved on its basis, Tang said.    "We should avoid sensitive political issues and search for  methods of literal expression acceptable to both sides," Tang  said.    He said that some progress has been made on the issue during  their previous talks in Xiamen and Taipei last year. He  believed that it is absolutely possible to solve the divergence  on the issue with efforts from both sides.    Tang said that ARATS, as a non-governmental organization,  was  not empowered to discuss such political issues as "judicial  administration right" and such issues should be avoided in the  discussions.    Tang said that avoiding the issue is not a matter of  disrespect, because he is not authorized to discuss the issue.    Now that both sides should avoid sensitive political issues  in discussing routine affairs, legal issues no doubt should not  be excluded, Tang said.    He said that the two organs have decided to set up two  groups  to discuss routine affairs and some issues concerning economic  exchanges.    According to Tang Shubei, the Chinese Mainland has drafted a  law to protect Taiwan investment, which will be submitted to the  National People's Congress for deliberation.    "We hope that Taiwan may consider the opinions of the  mainland on the basis of mutual benefit," Tang said.    Tang said that Taiwan should cancel restrictions on making  investment in the mainland and open its market for manufactured  or partially-manufactured goods of the mainland and the labor  market.    Tang said that the possibility of a non-governmental  agreement on such issues between ARATS and SEF is not excluded.</p>

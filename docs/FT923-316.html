			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian bank at centre of stake sale speculation BANCO Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector bank, yesterday had its second brush with Consob, the country's stock market watchdog, after continuing speculation about the sale of a significant stake by one of the bank's biggest shareholders. The bank has still not formally admitted that a group of four co-operative banks from the Veneto region, which together form one of the five members of the shareholder 'pool' which controls the bank, is planning to pull out. The disposal could upset the balance within the pool, which includes Gemina, the investment company dominated by Fiat, and Credit Agricole of France. Each of the five main shareholders has 12 to 13 per cent of the bank and have right of first refusal should a pool member choose to sell. Speculation of a sale by the Veneto banks have been circulating for weeks, but have been consistently denied by Ambroveneto. Meanwhile, the Veneto banks themselves have refused to comment. However, Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, recently confirmed indirectly he had been made aware of their intentions. Mr Bazoli is believed to be in contact with other big shareholders about revising the pool. Matters are complicated by the high price the Veneto banks are believed to be seeking for their stake. While their 13.6 per cent holding could be appealing to several of the current pact members, the cost is a marked disincentive. Last week, Mr Antonio Pedone, the chairman of Crediop, a pool member, indicated his interest in the stake. Crediop was bought last year by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, which may see the stake as an indirect way of widening its branch network. Credit Agricole could also be a buyer, though an expansion of its stake may be subject to informal approval from the Bank of Italy.</p>

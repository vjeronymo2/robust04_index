			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Samper, sole presidential candidate for the  Liberal Party, received 1,245,000 votes, approximately 50  percent, in the primary according to the most recent figures  from the Registrar's Office. Raul Gutierrez has talked with him  about the vice presidency, the Liberal Party leadership, and the  government.    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] Will you replace former  President Turbay in the party's national leadership?    [Samper] This depends on Dr. Turbay. I have said he played a  very satisfactory role in the management of the primary, as  indicated by Sunday's results. His staying in office will  depend on his own decision.    [Gutierrez] Will Ministers Villegas and Santos be included  in  the campaign team?    [Samper] If they would like to cooperate with me, they will  be welcome in the campaign. I would appreciate their effort  very much.    [Gutierrez] How will you play the vice presidency card?    [Samper] I will select the person I think can take my place  according to the Constitution in case of a necessary absence.    [Gutierrez] Lleras de la Fuente or Pedro Gomez?    [Samper] There is a list of names on which I am working.    [Gutierrez] How will you reconciliate yourself with your  adversaries of yesterday?    [Samper] With programs. I think the idea is not to reach  bureaucratic agreements, rather, to identify ourselves with a  subject that became the common denominator in our  campaign--social policy.    [Gutierrez] Don't you think the high rate of abstentionism  poses a risk when you run against Pastrana in May?    [Samper] No, because abstentionism is not caused by  Pastrana,  rather, objective factors that we will naturally have to correct  gradually.    [Gutierrez] What did the government do for your campaign for  your candidacy to be successful?    [Samper] Nothing, except remain neutral. I did the rest.  [end recording]</p>

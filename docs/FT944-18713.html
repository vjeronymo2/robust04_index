			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Germ war ban talks planned Negotiations on measures to strengthen the 1972 treaty which outlaws biological weapons will start next January, treaty members decided at the weekend. After two weeks of difficult talks in Geneva, some 80 governments agreed to establish an ad hoc group to draft proposals on verification, anti-cheating measures and other compliance issues. But industrialised and developing countries could not agree on how quickly to advance. The industrialised countries want the group, open to all 131 treaty members, to push on with a draft protocol for approval at the next treaty review conference in 1996. But some developing countries want to proceed more cautiously. The stage is set for arduous negotiations when the group convenes in January.</p>

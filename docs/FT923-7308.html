			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick news hits sector INSURANCE broker Sedgwick opened 15 lower and kept falling as the group's second-half profits came below the market's worst expectations. The shares, finally 34 down at 110p, were the most heavily traded in the London market with turnover of 9.1m. The figures prompted sharp downgrades by analysts and led to a slide across the remainder of the sector. The group reduced its dividend to 3p from 4p and announced a profit of Pounds 51.7m. Analysts had expected a dividend cut and also bad news from the US but said the real surprise was that revenues were under pressure right across the board. Ms Karen Neale of Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut her full-year estimate to Pounds 52m from Pounds 82.4m and said the stock remained a sell at its current low level. Mr Simon Willis of County NatWest was slightly more optimistic, going for Pounds 60m and arguing that the shares were a hold around the 110p mark. In the rest of the sector, Willis Corroon, which is heavily exposed to the US, fell 14 to 177p; CE Heath, whose dividend is believed to be vulnerable, lost 24 to 268p; and Steel Burrill Jones shed 16 to 179p. Carlton firmer Optimism for the video arm of Carlton Communications, the television production and services group, was highlighted by one securities house and the shares bucked the market to close 7 higher at 584p. Hoare Govett pointed out an article in the trade press which said that the video of the film Batman Returns, to be marketed by Carlton, will be released early next month and thus boost this year's profits. The video of the previous film achieved one of the most successful market results on record. The Batman Returns video is to go on direct sale immediately, rather than following the traditional route of first appearing in video hire shops. This indicates that profits for Carlton will not be diluted. Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings, which dropped 13 to 105p with 4.2m shares changing hands, proved to be one of the chief sufferers from the nervousness in the market caused by the dividend cut by insurance broker Sedgwick. The fear that Hillsdown's dividend was in danger further undermined the stock. However, most houses have been predicting a small increase, and few seem willing to change their stance as yet. BZW said: 'There is over-anxiety on the dividend, which was to be expected in any high-yielding stock after the Sedgwick cut. The cover remains good and we believe the dividend will be slightly increased.' Hillsdown was also troubled by other concerns yesterday. A surplus of stock, which had followed downgrades from BZW on Monday and James Capel and Smith New Court last week, had already put marketmakers under pressure to mark down the price. There was also a belief in some quarters that Hillsdown will leave the FT-SE 100 Index list at the next review. Dividend worries elsewhere in the market rebounded to the favour of the water and electricity sectors, where the dividend growth is seen as safe because of company commitments and high levels of cover respectively. Of the main movers yesterday, Anglian Water rose 10 to 425p, Welsh 6 to 434p and Yorkshire 7 to 449p. Among the Recs, Norweb gained 11 to 349p, Yorkshire 10 to 354p and Southern 8 to 315p. News that SmithKline Beecham is to create a partnership with US group Marion Merrell Dow for the development and marketing of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products failed to have a strong impact on the shares. The 'A' stock bounced on the news but then slid back to close a net 7 off at 455p. Vodafone weakened 8 to 320p as Smith New Court issued a sell note, arguing that profits looked vulnerable to new competition. Mining group RTZ was a penny firmer at 527p after copper prices surged on investment fund buying and technical reasons. A research note from County NatWest describing an eventual merger of Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle as 'inevitable' met with some investor interest, according to County, but little in the way of buying. In a weak breweries sector, Whitbread 'A' fell 12 to 396p and S &amp; N 6 to 438p. An upbeat trading statement from Argyll held the shares steady at 331p. A 1m-share cross at 166p unhinged William Low, off 9 at 172p. Dividend concern left Sears 3 1/2 cheaper at 65 1/2 p. The hotel sector took another beating as investors continued to sell. A large seller in Forte pulled the shares 6 lower to 128p with 3.4m traded, while a similar move in beleaguered Queens Moat Houses knocked the stock down 4 to 48p. Ladbroke fell 6 1/2 to 151p. Friendless theme park operator Euro Disney dropped 38 to 860p. Granada added 3 at 231p on BSkyB optimism. Rank Organisation's poor run extended into a second day, the shares failing to find a floor and losing 15 to 523p. Paper and packaging groups Bunzl and David S. Smith showed signs of life as Credit Lyonnais Laing told clients the shares were oversold. Smith jumped 9 to 256p and Bunzl firmed 2 to 93p. Vague talk of financial worries at Eurotunnel was heard and the shares slipped 12 to 349p. Financial worries also depressed Davies &amp; Newman, which shed a further 3 to 18p. A squeeze in Kwik-Fit, the car repair group, caused the shares to bounce 7 1/2 to 105 1/2 p. Press comment on British Aerospace, following Monday's resignation of the chairman of the property division, left the shares 8 lighter at 200p in reasonable trade of 2.8m. Motor distributor Quicks bucked the market trend, firming 2 to 121p after the company reported a jump in interim profits from Pounds 328,000 to Pounds 1.1m and a 75 per cent increase in the dividend to 1.75p. Bargain hunting sent Whessoe climbing 6 to 139p. Shortage of stock in BET left the business services group 2 higher at 120p. Conglomerate Williams Holdings eased 7 to 242p on profit-taking. A 5 per cent improvement in interim profits to Dollars 17.2m (Pounds 9m) at Micro Focus saw the shares improve 92 to 1545p. Nervous trading in BICC ahead of today's interim statement left the stock 5 down at 262p. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Joel Kibazo, Christopher Price.

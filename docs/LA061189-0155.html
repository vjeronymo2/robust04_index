			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SOVIET CONGRESS HAILED FOR BRINGING POLITICS TO THE PEOPLE  </P> <P> Often tumultuous, sometimes dramatic and occasionally boring, the initial  session of the Soviet Union's new national assembly, the Congress of People's  Deputies, launched the country on what its leaders promise will be the road to  democracy.  </P> <P> For the first time, popularly elected representatives had an open national  forum to debate the country's problems and to propose solutions with the  expectation that in future sessions they will be able to approve specific  action, and the 2,250 deputies took full advantage of the opportunity.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev described the creation of the congress and its  first session as "the most outstanding event in the entire history of the  Soviet state," a major achievement for perestroika, his program of political,  economic and social reforms, and as a step forward toward "people's power."  </P> <P> The session was "a unique opportunity," Gorbachev said, "to get a clear notion  of the real state of things, achievements and shortcomings in our life, because  of various negative phenomena," and then to discuss the reforms necessary for  improvement.  </P> <P> "Listening to the acute, at times sharp and emotional speeches of the deputies,  one became aware again and again of the burden of problems, a huge burden, and  of the fact that the main and most important work is yet ahead," the Soviet  leader said.  </P> <P> Radical changes consequently will be needed in the country's political  structure and in the character of its economic system, Gorbachev said,  describing the debates as a watershed for the Soviet Union and part of "a  powerful democratic stream that is gaining momentum." Even Gorbachev's critics  -- both those who thought that he had yet to recognize "the sovereignty of the  people" and those who believed that he had yielded far too much of the  Communist Party's power -- agreed on the historic nature of the congress in  opening political decision-making to the people.  </P> <P> The major decisions on resolving the country's problems were left for the  542-member Supreme Soviet, the new, full-time legislature elected from among  the deputies, and the streamlined and rejuvenated government announced here on  Saturday by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.  </P> <P> What the congress had done through its debates was to begin the development of  a parliamentary system, a process that most modern nations undertook decades if  not centuries ago but that was halted here after the Bolshevik Revolution in  1917 as the party developed a monopoly on power and concentrated it in the  hands of its leadership.  </P> <P> What was most important in resuming this historical process was the ability of  deputies to speak openly and freely on behalf of their constituents, with the  expectation that they would not only be heard but would be able to effect  change.  </P> <P> "We are witnessing the birth of a nation," Yuri Feofanov, a political  commentator for the newspaper Izvestia, said as the congress' inaugural session  drew to a close last week. "Or, to be more precise, the rebirth of a nation."  </P> <P> Although the party's determination to remain the leading force in Soviet  society was evident as Gorbachev guided the session as the chairman of the  congress, it had taken a major step toward fulfilling its commitment, made a  year ago at a special party conference, to share power, and in doing so, to  transform the country's monolithic political structure.  </P> <P> For the first time in Soviet history, democratically elected representatives of  the people were able to raise issues publicly that, while crucial to the  nation's fate, were "forbidden areas" before -- military affairs, foreign  policy, the security services, the privileges of party officials, corruption in  the leadership.  </P> <P> They went even beyond these sensitive issues, common enough in most Western  parliaments, to criticize the nature of the Soviet political system, to  question the way in which the Soviet Union was formed and thus its legitimacy  as a state, to argue for such fundamental changes that some deputies  effectively were proposing an end to socialism as it had been defined here over  seven decades.  </P> <P> And with popular mandates won in the first contested elections since the  earliest days of the Soviet state, they insisted on broad and urgent changes  with a vigor that stunned even themselves.  </P> <P> Those who believed that the congress would be five or six days of heartfelt but  predictable speeches by selected deputies were shocked as one deputy after  another, many coming from quite remote areas, strode to the rostrum to indict  the country's leadership for past mistakes, to plunge into yet another  "forbidden area," to challenge other speakers or simply to raise an issue,  however mundane, that the deputy's voters considered their most pressing  concern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Different Shock  </P> <P> A different sort of shock was felt by the party's strong conservative wing,  which was offended by the sharp assertiveness of liberal deputies, by the  criticism of much of what they had held so firmly for so long and by the cut  and thrust of the debate.  </P> <P> Alternative programs were outlined by liberal deputies, answers were demanded  to questions that no one dared ask here a year ago, Gorbachev's nominees for  key posts found themselves sharply scrutinized rather than applauded into new  jobs. And Gorbachev himself was confronted repeatedly with the challenge that  he was concentrating too much power in his own hands.  </P> <P> After years of political passivity in which the party leadership's decisions  were accepted without question, political divisions quickly emerged among the  deputies -- and could form the basis for competition between rival candidates  in future elections as well as the development of voting blocs in the congress  and the Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> On the left, there is now an alliance among the liberal "Moscow Group," the  nationalist delegations from the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania, the southern republics of Armenia and Georgia and radicals from  across the country, with a conservative wing coalescing on the right around the  party apparatus, the military and deputies from Central Asia.  </P> <P> But in the center there is a broad, moderate middle quite willing to follow  Gorbachev's lead.  </P> <P> "The merit of our congress was that on the basis of a broad debate, we got a  fuller notion of the real processes taking place in the life of the country and  in the attitudes of the people," Gorbachev said, summing up the session.  </P> <P> That is what parliaments do, but it is something from which the old Soviet  legislature was virtually barred as it gathered twice a year, two days each  time, to enact into law without debate the decisions of the party leadership.  </P> <P> "Will we ever become a great parliament like the British Westminster or the  American Congress?" one deputy asked during the final hours of debate last  week.  </P> <P> "That is hard to say. It depends on us, how we shape this new institution, this  Congress of People's Deputies. But we can say already that we are something  entirely new in the history of the Soviet Union."  </P></p>

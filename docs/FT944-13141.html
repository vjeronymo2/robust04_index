			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher gold prices help lift Placer Dome 38% Higher gold prices and reduced exploration costs helped boost third-quarter earnings at Placer Dome, the international mining group, by 38 per cent. But the Vancouver-based company's share of output from its 13 mines was 4 per cent lower in the first nine months than a year earlier, and it warned that total 1994 production will be about 100,000oz short of its 1.8m oz target. Third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 18m, or 8 cents a share, from Dollars 13m, or 6 cents. Sales revenues dipped to Dollars 210m from Dollars 219m, but investment income climbed to Dollars 17m from Dollars 10m. Cash production costs rose to Dollars 196 per ounce from Dollars 184. Placer earlier announced a 1 cent increase in its fourth-quarter dividend to 7.5 cents a share. The slip in production was largely due to lower average grades and to operating disruptions at the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea and the Golden Sunlight mine in the US. Ground movement has halted operations at Golden Sunlight since mid-June, and production is not expected to restart until early next year. However, Placer said it still expects to reach its long-term annual production target of 2.5m oz by the end of the decade. Much of the increase will probably come from its 70 per cent-owned Las Cristinas property in Venezuela. Las Cristinas' annual production is projected at 380,000 oz at an initial cash cost of Dollars 210 per oz. The mine's capital cost is expected to reach Dollars 400m. Placer said it expects to add reserves at five existing mines. In addition, it plans drilling programmes next year on 20 properties in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, the US and Venezuela. Other exploration opportunities are being sought in India, the Commonwealth of Independent States and south-east Asia.</p>

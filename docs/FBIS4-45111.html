			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "PPP Compromised Our Nuclear Program"] </F>   [Text] Mr. Nawaz Sharif, president of the Muslim League  Party and the opposition leader, has expressed his fears about  the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government's negotiations with  the United States and the real results of them. He expressed  concern about the so-called "quiet diplomacy," saying that in  the context of Pakistan's nuclear program, the whole nation  should be worried about this kind of diplomacy, because our  national security could be jeopardized by such quiet diplomacy.  According to him, there is nationwide consensus about our  nuclear program, and the PPP will not get permission from the  people to negate this national agreement. The basis of this  consensus among the people is that our nuclear program is  actually a "holy keepsake" and a very powerful tool to stop  external aggression. He said that Pakistan has repeatedly  insisted that the nuclear program should be seen within the  framework of the whole region, and that a consistent attitude  should be developed about it. Now these inspections,  verifications, and quiet diplomacy all mean that our nuclear  program is being curtailed, and our present national consensus  is being ignored. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demanded that the PPP  government issue a clear statement about the nuclear program and  remove the impression that this government is trying to extend  its political control and is bent upon jeopardizing our national  interest and security (THE NEWS daily, 16 April 1994).    In our opinion, Mr. Nawaz Sharif's demand that the PPP  government clarify its policy is meaningless. The PPP  government's clear expression of Pakistan's nuclear program is  in the joint statement that was issued at the end of U. S.  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit to Pakistan.  Its text was published in the newspaper. In the fourth paragraph  of the joint communique it is stated: "Both governments support  efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  and the missiles used for launching these. In this context, we  agree to take the initiative in stopping all production of  destructive weapons and ballistic missiles in South Asia,  limiting them, and finally stopping their production totally."    This statement makes clear in unambiguous words that the PPP  government has agreed in principle with the US government to  stop Pakistan's nuclear program in three phases. This was a fear  which now has become true. It is equivalent to selling our  national interests based on the whole nation's agreement in the  hands of the United States. The whole nation should express  opposition to it in one voice.    We should ask Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: In south Asia,  India has not supported the idea of stopping the proliferation  of nuclear weapons and production of missiles. Thus, why did the  government of Pakistan support it, and who gave it permission?  Did Parliament give her [Bhutto] this right? Did she get a  mandate from the people by holding a referendum? How did she get  such a right to personally make this decision? How could she  unilaterally agree, without getting India's support, that the  production and proliferation of nuclear missiles will first be  capped, later limited, and then fully stopped? How did this  emerge as a national position? If this decision was not made in  an authoritative national body, then how did the prime minister  get the right to announce such an agreement in a joint  communique? As the leader of the Parliament of a democratic  country and as its prime minister, she must get permission and  approval from Parliament for her decision. She is not the queen  of a kingdom who can decide the fate of her nation by herself.    The joint communique issued at the end of Mr. Talbott's  visit  to Pakistan has no legal position, and it was announced without  any constitutional right. We would tell the opposition leaders  to understand the importance of this crisis properly and to  demand that a Parliament session be called, and that the  Parliament force the prime minister to take back this joint  communique and disassociate herself from this agreement.  Otherwise, all of the opposition should walk out of Parliament  to protest against this insult to Parliament, so that the  government will be forced to retract this wrong statement and  will not make any plans to sign any agreements as part of its  quiet diplomacy. If the opposition ignores the seriousness of  this situation, then Pakistan's nuclear program will be  sacrificed on the U. S. altar. All political parties outside the  government should unite to form a joint position on  it.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT LINE KEEPS TRACK OF WILDFLOWERS IN BLOOM  </P> <P> Wildflowers are starting to bloom earlier this year thanks to winter rains and  recent high temperatures, according to the Theodore Payne Foundation, a  nonprofit organization that perpetuates native California flora. The  foundation's hot line -- (818) 768-3533 -- informs which flowers are blooming  and where they may be seen. The message is updated each Thursday through May  31.  </P></p>

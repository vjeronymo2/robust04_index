			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barrs claim majority backing for campaign Nicholas and Robert Barr, the brothers who are attempting to unseat their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, yesterday claimed that the holders of more than 50 per cent of the voting shares were backing their campaign. The brothers said they had majority support among ordinary shareholders for their attempts to take control of the board and change strategy at the motor distribution and leisure group. Mr Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman who owns 16 per cent of voting shares, is one of those who has pledged support. Nicholas and Robert are the sons of Mr Stuart Barr, the managing director who died two years ago. They speak for nearly 30 per cent of the group's voting shares. However, the Barr &amp; Wallace board launched a counter attack yesterday by proposing to enfranchise the company's non-voting shares, owned mainly by institutions. Ironically, enfranchisement has been one of the rebels' principal proposals. The board said that a vote on enfranchisement would take place before an EGM called by the Barr brothers. The brothers demanded the EGM last week to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. Malcolm Barr said: 'Enfranchisement is such an important issue in terms of increasing shareholder value and future progress of the group that it merits being voted on in its own right.' The board is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue to ordinary shareholders to compensate them for the loss of voting control. It also intends to maintain the final dividend on the enlarged share capital. A circular is to be sent to shareholders no later than October 28, with a meeting expected by mid-November. The Barr brothers plan to split the group's motor and leisure divisions and reduce central overheads. 'We felt for some time that the two divisions did not have anything in common and gained no strategic benefit by being linked to each other,' said Nicholas Barr, who was development director of the Barr &amp; Wallace motor division until his resignation in September last year. 'I got a lot of personal pent-up frustration by seeing the group spend money on hotels and not being able to develop the motor business. 'We also believe there are potentially more effective ways to use the company's capital than buying property assets. The board has failed to find sensible niche markets to bolt on to the leisure activities.' The board counters the brothers' arguments by pointing to a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the six months to June. Pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 928,000 on turnover up 15 per cent to Pounds 124m. Mr Small and Mr Parker were appointed in May. Since then operations disposed of include Trust Leasing, sold to Robert Barr for Pounds 2.15m in July.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Europe baulks at Hollywood's onslaught - Solution of audiovisual row may be in sight FEW areas of the world trade talks in Geneva have aroused as much public passion as US demands for more access to the European market for films and television programmes. European film makers and broadcasters claim that Hollywood is intent on the destruction of their industry and, with it, Europe's cultural identity. Americans counter with accusations of censorship and cultural elitism. Yet in the shadow of this war of words, US and European Community negotiators appear to be groping towards a solution acceptable to both sides. Although the details have not been worked out (and could still sink the deal), the basic idea is to preserve existing protection for the European audiovisual sector while preventing restrictions being tightened in the future. The chances of a deal came a little closer on Monday when, at the EC foreign ministers' meeting, France appeared to drop earlier objections to making audiovisual services part of any Uruguay Round accord. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, has consistently argued that including the sector in the world trade talks would give the EC greater protection against unilateral action by the US to force further market-opening moves. Although 116 nations are taking part in the Round, which is due to end on December 15, the audiovisual issue is essentially a bilateral argument between the US and EC. At its centre are longstanding US objections to the European Community's 1989 broadcasting directive, which from 1981 has required EC-based television channels to allot at least half their broadcasting time to European-made programmes 'wherever practicable' (not counting news, sport, games or advertising). Washington is also unhappy about subsidies for European film makers, especially as US movies contribute a big chunk of the funding through a film levy. In France, the only EC nation which still has a sizeable domestic film industry, subsidies of all descriptions run to FFr2.1bn (Pounds 240m) a year. The European audiovisual industry believes that this support is essential to counter competition from cheap US imports, which have already recouped their costs in the huge domestic market. Even so, sales of US films and television programmes to Europe have soared in recent years. In 1991, US productions accounted for 81 per cent of EC cinema screenings, over 70 per cent of European box-office takings, and 54 per cent of all dramas and comedies broadcast on television. US audiovisual exports to the EC were Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.4bn) last year, against a paltry Dollars 288m in European sales to the US. Washington is evidently in no position to complain that it has insufficient access to the European market. US negotiators even concede that films and television programmes may require different treatment from trade in goods or other services such as insurance or accountancy. But, at the same time, they want assurances that no new restrictions will be imposed on European sales of what is now America's second largest export industry (after aircraft). The US film and television industry has a turnover of more than Dollars 40bn a year, directly or indirectly supports 5m jobs and has a 40 per cent share of the rapidly expanding world market. The EC proposal, now being drafted, aims to secure special protection for audiovisual services in recognition of their 'cultural specificity'. The Community's schedule of initial commitments under the framework services agreement, setting out what it is and is not prepared to do in opening services markets to foreign competition, will preserve existing broadcasting controls and film subsidy arrangements. In the short term the EC would seem to be in a strong position, especially as the US has lost part of its negotiating credibility by deciding to remove ocean-going shipping from its own services schedule. Japan and some other nations such as Mexico favour the US stance, but the EC has solid backing from most of the rest of western Europe, Canada, Australia and India. In the longer run, however, Europe may lose the battle of the quotas to the new technologies. Before long European consumers will have hundreds of domestic and foreign channels to choose from on satellite and cable. At the same time financial and creative links between Hollywood and Europe are steadily increasing. If filling quotas in the future will be difficult, policing them may be well nigh impossible.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 307 of the MPRSA allows NOAA to assess civil penalties as high as $100,000 for each violation. In addition, monies collected under the MPRSA are available for use by the National Marine Sanctuary Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MBTA would not allow any taking of migratory birds in the sanctuary, thus providing even stronger prohibition than sanctuary status can provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See above response. Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of migratory birds within the Sanctuary. Including a prohibition on ``taking'' marine birds in the Sanctuary regulations allows such violations to be subject to the civil penalties authorized by the MPRSA which far exceed those authorized by the MBTA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prohibit all takings of marine mammals and seabirds, regardless of military or fishing exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of marine mammals and seabirds in or above the Sanctuary except as authorized by the NMFS or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of the MMPA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1361  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the ESA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the MBTA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 703  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA, and MBTA, to the extent that they apply. Exemptions include a limited five-year incidental take of marine mammals provided by interim regulations promulgated pursuant to the MMPA, which are in effect until October, 1993. The ESA also has a limited incidental take exemption. See 16 U.S.C. section 1539(a)(2)B(i). NMFS, in conjunction with environmental groups and the fishing industry, is developing a permanent management regime to be implemented upon expiration of the MMPA interim regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If in the future NOAA determines that the existing regulations promulgated under MMPA, ESA, MBTA or any other state or Federal statute are not adequate to ensure the coordinated and comprehensive management of marine mammals and seabirds, changes to the Sanctuary regulations would be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the MPRSA, NEPA and APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Exclude from [takings] prohibition birds considered game.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The only birds &sect;925.5(a)(6) prohibits the taking of are seabirds_seabirds are not considered game species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 925.5(a)(6) of the proposed regulations would prohibit the taking of marine mammals or seabirds unless affirmatively permitted by regulations promulgated under authority of the ESA, MMPA, or MBTA. Because these regulations do not expressly permit any takings by treaty Indians, the proposed sanctuary regulations would effectively prohibit the Makah Tribe from exercising their treaty rights to take marine mammals. The proposed regulations would also hinder the tribe's ability to exercise its fishing rights by precluding fisheries which result in the incidental taking of marine mammals and seabirds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DEIS/MP offers no conservation justification for imposing restrictions on the taking of marine mammals and seabirds which go beyond the restrictions imposed by the ESA and MMPA. The DEIS/MP concedes that the purpose of the proposed sanctuary regulations is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to protect particular species from extinction. According to the DEIS, the purpose of these additional prohibitions in the proposed regulations is to ``extend protection for sanctuary resources on an environmentally holistic basis.'' This goal does not permit infringement of treaty rights. Therefore, the regulations should be amended by adding ``or in accordance with any treaty to which the United States is a party.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulatory prohibitions do not abrogate or obstruct any rights under an existing treaty. The regulations have been changed by adding ``or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA, to the extent that they apply.'' The treaty between the Makah Tribe and the United States explicitly assures the ``right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing at usual accustomed grounds and stations.'' (Article 4, Treaty of Neah Bay, 1855).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incidental takes of marine mammals can legally occur under permit and exemption provisions of the MMPA. Currently, Washington coastal tribes apply for and receive exemption certificates from NMFS for the incidental taking of marine mammals during fishing. Fees for this exemption are waived for tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, tribes cannot be denied entry into any fishery based on the likelihood or occurrence of seabird or marine mammal takings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Change the wording of the regulation to read ``as authorized or permitted by NMFS or [the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] USFWS under the authority of the MMPA and ESA.'' NMFS suggests that the preamble and/or regulations clarify that Sanctuary permits will not be required for activities authorized or permitted by NMFS or USFWS under MMPA or ESA. Such clarification would relieve many concerns over the possibility of overlapping and potentially duplicative permitting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

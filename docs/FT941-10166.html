			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger EU banana quota sought Guatemala will today lead a delegation of four Latin American countries to Brussels to propose a way of ending the current stalemate in a row over the European Union's banana regime. The European Commission's deadline for the Latin Americans to accept a proposal for an increase to 2.1m tonnes in their ceiling for deliveries to the Dollars 2.7bn EU banana market runs out tomorrow. A report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade condemning EU arrangements with African, Caribbean and Pacific producers over bananas under the Lome convention will also be circulated on Friday. A condition of the commission's offer is that the Latin Americans drop their complaint to Gatt. Guatemala's proposal calls for an increase in access for the Latin Americans to about 2.5m tonnes - this would be included in an overall quota for all non-EU bananas of 3.2m tonnes. Within that ceiling, the Guatemalans suggest a single tariff to apply to ACP and the so-called dollar bananas from Latin America. Higher tariffs would be payable on imports above that level with the revenue raised from the tariffs going as direct aid to ACP countries. The proposal also calls for the abolition of the licensing system. The proposal is backed by Panama, Honduras and Ecuador, which is the biggest Latin American exporter of bananas to the EU, but is not a member of Gatt. It lacks the key support of Colombia and Costa Rica, which are large exporters and, as members of Gatt, carry more political clout with the EU.</p>

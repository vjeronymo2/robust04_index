			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> TWO SUNSET TEAMS FACE WILD-CARD TESTS  </P> <P> For the second consecutive season, it appears the Sunset League was the  toughest boys' volleyball league in Orange County.  </P> <P> Three teams from the Sunset -- Huntington Beach, Edison and Marina -- were  ranked among the top six in Orange County by the end of the regular season, and  all three were ranked among the top eight in the 4-A.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach (14-1) won the league championship and is waiting for Friday's  first round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs. But the league's other  quality teams, Edison (14-2) and Marina (11-4), must play tonight in a 4-A  wild-card round that features eight matches.  </P> <P> Edison, the Sunset's No. 2 team and the only team to beat Huntington Beach, is  at home against Culver City (13-7), which finished third in the Ocean League.  That's a little more impressive when you consider that the No. 1 team from the  Ocean League also is the top-seeded team in the 4-A, Mira Costa (18-0).  </P> <P> Marina, which split games with Edison, travels to play the Ocean League's No. 2  team, North Torrance (13-3). Marina already has proven it can win big matches,  as in its four-game defeat of then-undefeated and top-ranked Laguna Beach two  weeks ago.  </P> <P> In other 4-A wild-card matches: Torrance (9-5) at University (11-3); Capistrano  Valley (7-9) at Woodbridge (10-5); Newport Harbor (9-5) at Rolling Hills  (14-2), and Irvine (7-9) at home against Laguna Hills (7-8), with the winner  getting the dubious honor of playing No. 1 Mira Costa in the first round.  </P> <P> In 3-A wild-card games involving county teams, Mater Dei (14-3) is at home  against Lakewood (13-4) and Pacifica (11-9) plays at Esperanza (12-4).

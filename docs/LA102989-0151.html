			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> 'VOLUNTEERS' RETURN TO GARDEN YEAR AFTER YEAR;  </P> <P> FLOWERS: CALIFORNIA POPPIES AND OTHER SELF-SEEDING PLANTS WILL POP UP WITHOUT  WORK, BUT NOT ALL TYPES MAY FIT THE DESIRED COLOR SCHEME.  </P> <P> Every spring, clusters of California poppies slip into the corners of my garden  near the rock walls or between the stepping stones. Their tiny carrot tops  quickly grow into clumps of copious blooms that any flower grower would  normally prize.  </P> <P> But their powerful orange hue often sabotages my planned color scheme, and  their assertive growth obstructs my garden paths. Yet, it's difficult to refuse  these eager volunteers. They're beautiful, they're easy to grow and they're  free.  </P> <P> I've learned over the years to cope with, and indeed encourage, many  self-seeding flowers, particularly those that retain their best  characteristics. Some volunteers, through open-garden pollination and lack of  selection, become lanky, like coreopsis, or lose their color range, like  larkspur. Others, apparently because they are not hybrids, return year after  year looking exactly like their parents.  </P> <P> My favorite garden volunteers are gaillardia and rudbeckia. These flowers, with  their Indian reds and blazing golds, epitomize California summer gardening.  Unlike English gardens bathed in filtered light and washed by almost daily  showers, where muted colors and restrained plantings dominate, our gardens are  soaked in brilliant sunshine under cloudless blue skies.  </P> <P> California gardens look insipid, even wimpy, without strong color; and these  two flowers, both natives of the Americas, are soures of bold and brash hues.  </P> <P> I planted Gaillardia pulchella from seed many years ago, and now it returns  every year, even though I dig up the area. This gaillardia produces 2-inch  barn-red blooms with petals tipped in gold.  </P> <P> Its sister plant G. grandiflora has somewhat larger blooms. Mine are a  wonderful gold with red tips. Gaillardia seedlings are easy to identify in the  spring; their hairy leaves are light green and slightly toothed. They thrive in  ordinary well-drained soil and get along nicely on sparse water rations.  </P> <P> Complementing the reds and golds of gaillardia flowers is Rudbeckia hirta,  commonly called black-eyed Susan or gloriosa daisy. The large cone-centered  flowers in the picture are descendants of double gloriosa daisies planted in my  garden more than eight years ago. Some are still double, although others have  reverted to single status -- which is fine with me because the singles tend to  stand up better when the wind blows.  </P> <P> Other volunteer rudbeckias in my garden were originally planted as species  forms of R. hirta. The 2-inch gold blooms appear on rounded 18-inch plants, and  because of their symmetrical shape and their ability to remain upstanding, I'm  beginning to like them better than the larger gloriosa daisies.  </P> <P> Poppies are reliable self-seeders, returning year after year to gardens they  like. California poppies have to be introduced only once; after that, they  produce seeds that are determined to germinate and perpetuate themselves  seemingly ever after. By the way, they bear more flowers if they're not overfed  or overwatered.  </P> <P> Shirley poppies are also prodigious seed makers, but the lovely, frilly flowers  from seed packets result from careful selection and crossbreeding. In the  garden, without that purposeful selection, succeeding year's crops become less  varied and less fancy. Still, Shirley poppies are always pretty, their  volunteers always welcome.  </P> <P> Other annuals eager to make repeat performances are alyssum, cosmos, gilia,  scabiosa, forget-me-nots, summer chrysanthemums, strawflowers, and linaria.  </P> <P> A few perennials grow easily from their own seeds without a gardener's  attention. In my garden, I continually find baby statice (Limonium perezii)  plants coming up. When they're small, it's easy to transplant them to the right  spot or to grow them in a flat for later use.  </P> <P> Rose campion (Lynchnis coronaria), its silver foliage contrasting with stunning  ruby-colored flowers, delivers babies by the dozen, some so determined to live  that they dangle from rock walls, daring me to remove them. Columbine and  foxglove volunteers abound, as do dusty miller plantlets. As a bonus, all these  plants are fairly drought-tolerant.  </P> <P> To encourage volunteer plants, here are some tips. Let some flowers go to seed;  don't pick them all for bouquets and don't be too fastidious in cleaning up the  garden. To ensure a big return from likely volunteers, shake the dried seed  capsules from the plants when you're pulling them up at this time of the year.  </P> <P> Don't cultivate too heavily. I must admit, however, that I dig up most of my  garden every year, and the volunteers return regardless.  </P> <P> Learn to recognize the seedlings of the good guys. Actually, it may be easier  at first to learn to distinguish the bad guys. Normally, a garden has only a  few kinds of weeds. If you can identify them when they are small, you can  remove them, watching the other seedlings to see what develops. In time, you'll  know all the good plants in their seedling forms.  </P> <P> If I let my Scot's genes and instincts take over, I could grow an entire garden  using just volunteers and perhaps some divisions from overgrown perennials.  </P> <P> Guffey tends a prize-winning flower garden in Malibu.  </P></p>

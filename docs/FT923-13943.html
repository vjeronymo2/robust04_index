			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: RCP set to renew credit facility early ROCKEFELLER Center Properties (RCP), the largest real estate investment trust in the US, is close to negotiating an early renewal of its Dollars 200m letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank. RCP, however, denied reports that it was seeking a complete restructuring of its Dollars 865m debt, which consists of two Dollars 200m commercial paper programmes, two series of debentures and bank borrowings. Mr Edward Fontaine, chief executive of RCP, said yesterday that there had been a 'continued effort by management to look at ways of refinancing existing debt that is more reflective of current conditions in this market'. RCP's main asset is a Dollars 1.3bn convertible mortgage on land under the original 12 buildings of the Rockefeller Centre, and the New York commercial property market has been in a prolonged slump since 1990 because of overcapacity and a severe local recession. Mr Fontaine said RCP had been in regular talks with Credit Suisse, and hoped to shortly agree new terms for the letter of credit facility, which was originally due for renewal in May 1993.</p>

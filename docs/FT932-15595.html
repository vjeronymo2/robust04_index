			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Can your stocks rise in the east? - Serious Money WILL THE motto of the 21st century be 'go east, young man'? A fortnight ago, this column suggested that emerging stock markets and European bonds were two of the more interesting investment areas at the moment. My reasoning was really more a process of elimination than anything more sophisticated. But the entertaining fund management market double act, Tim Guinness and Howard Flight of Guinness Flight, have an interesting argument that enthusiasm for bonds and the Far Eastern markets are subtly linked. Their case is that the high cost economies of the West are losing out to the low cost economies of the Far East. As the West purchases its exports and sources its manufacturing in the East, this results in low inflation - good for bonds - and high Far Eastern economic growth - good for equities in that region. Like any good fund management group, the pair believe they have the answer: a Hong Kong fund. The Hong Kong market is the entry point into China, which has around a fifth of the world's population and an economy growing at 9 per cent per year. The World Bank has forecast that China will be the world's largest economy by 2003. Hong Kong is on a price-earnings ratio of just 12.5, well below the ratings awarded to other emerging markets. Thus, Guinness Flight argues, this is an opportunity to invest in a large emerging economy on a cheap rating and they are discounting the initial charge on the fund to persuade investors to take the leap. It is a good story, but one should mention the other side. The Hong Kong market is highly volatile and has enjoyed a very sharp rise since the panic caused by Tiananmen Square. With all the current political tension, there is always the risk of a setback and a big question mark hangs over the colony's future after 1997. Although China's economy is growing fast, it still, as a nominally communist country, does not have the same accounting standards or business practices as in developed markets. On the level of individual stocks - even when channelled via Hong Kong - it is hard to be sure exactly what you are buying. So this is definitely a risk area of investment - not the first home for your redundancy money. It is really for those who are prepared to invest on a 10 year basis - and then only with a limited portion of their portfolio. And of course, one could be convinced by the case for Hong Kong, without being sure that Guinness Flight is the right firm to manage it. Its offshore fund is small at Dollars 3.2m and lacks a long-term record - although its 1992 performance did feature in a Best of the Best table in the US-based Barrons magazine. In my view, large investors might well consider having a portion (no more than 5 per cent) of their portfolios in Hong Kong; small investors should stick to the regional funds with a wider geographical spread. ***** Now the first quarter is over, readers might like an update on the O'Higgins Theory, which we featured at the start of the year. This was developed by a US fund manager called Michael O'Higgins and involved selecting the ten highest yielding stocks in the Dow Industrial index, and selecting from those the five with the lowest nominal prices. You buy those five, hold them for a year, and then repeat the process. He had shown this to be a means of beating the Dow Index over the long term. I found the theory appeared to work for the FT-30 Index, with a portfolio of the five stocks easily beating the All-Share over the period 1979-92. So, with risk warnings, I reported that, on January 2, the stocks selected by the theory were Blue Circle, British Gas, Forte, Hanson, Lucas. To date, the news has been quite good. Datastream figures show that, as of yesterday, the O'Higgins portfolio has beaten the All-Share in purely capital terms. The bad news is that neither return is very exciting - 2.1 per cent from the portfolio against 1.6 per cent from the All-Share. Of course, if you repeated the process now, the theory might throw up different stocks, so the above list is certainly not a recommendation. But the article provoked so much reader response that I shall try to monitor the portfolio's progress during the year. ***** Finally, a note on Personal Equity Plan charges. Hoare Govett has produced a guide to single company Peps, the kind that allows you to invest Pounds 3,000 in a stock on top of your general Pep allowance. The Budget change in Advance Corporation Tax reduced the tax break of Peps for basic rate investors. Hoare Govett says for a company yielding 4 per cent, the annual tax benefit of a single company Pep to a basic rate taxpayer has fallen from Pounds 14.38 to Pounds 6.38. This allows for an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent plus VAT. But if the share yields below 2.9 per cent, the tax saving is wiped out altogether. And even at 4 per cent the tax break could be lost if the manager imposes any kind of annual charge. Higher rate taxpayers and those who regularly pay capital gains tax should still be well ahead.</p>

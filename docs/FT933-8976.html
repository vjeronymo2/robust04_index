			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: JFB still suffering from lack of orders JOHNSON &amp; FIRTH Brown, the specialist engineering group, yesterday issued a profits warning citing the absence of any recovery in its order books. The announcement prompted a slide in the share price which finished 7 1/2 p lower at 40 1/2 p, with almost 5.8m shares changing hands. When the group announced its interim results in early June, Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, cautioned that a stronger order book, especially from larger customers, had failed to materialise. At that stage he said that a number of important potential orders in the light engineering division had again been deferred. Yesterday the group said that since then, despite earlier signs of a general economic recovery and expectations that it would feed through to JFB by the second half, 'the order book has not only failed to strengthen, but is currently at lower levels across almost the whole of the group than a few months ago.' At the monthly board meeting yesterday it was noted that even if orders were now to improve it would be too late to have much effect on this financial year ending September 30. 'Consequently, although the group continues to trade profitably, the directors now expect the results for the six months to end-September 1993 to be below those in the first half of this financial year.' In the first half JFB blamed continued price competition for a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 3.32m) on increased sales of Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 60.3m). The interim dividend was maintained at 1p. The decision on the final would be made in December, taking into account the view of the next financial year at the time. Sterling's devaluation had been expected to help the group combat some fierce overseas price cutting, but German competitors had reacted by reducing their prices by a further 15 per cent.</p>

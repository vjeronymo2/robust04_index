			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Loans fall signals deeper gloom FURTHER signs that the recession may be deepening came with news yesterday that individuals and companies made a net repayment of loans to banks and building societies last month, the first such event since records started 28 years ago. The repayment, announced by the Bank of England yesterday, came to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 700m. The news, together with weak figures for growth of the money supply, adds to pressure for more cuts in interest rates to expand the economy. Other data from the Bank indicate that it, together with foreign central banks, bought about Pounds 12.7bn in sterling on September 16 - Black Wednesday - in a vain effort to lift the pound before the UK was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. That number is consistent with market estimates that total intervention on Black Wednesday was between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 20bn. Yesterday's numbers do not include sterling purchases by the Bank using foreign currency reserves lent to the UK authorities by foreign central banks which have not yet been repaid. In the year to September 30, M0, which mainly comprises cash and notes in circulation, increased by 2.1 per cent compared with the previous 12 months. The figure is roughly at the centre of the Treasury's target range of 0 per cent to 4 per cent and underlines the lack of inflationary pressures. Growth in M4, a broader measure of the money supply, which also takes in bank and building society deposits, was similarly subdued. Between the same two 12-month periods, M4 expanded by 5.1 per cent, after growth of a revised 5.5 per cent in the year to the end of August. In the 12 months to the end of August, M0 expanded by a revised 2.4 per cent. After changing its methods of making seasonal adjustments, the Bank altered its previous assertion that individuals and companies made a repayment of Pounds 500m to banks and building societies in March this year. It is now recorded as a seasonally adjusted increase in loans of Pounds 974m. The weak growth in the money supply last month may have been influenced by the large intervention operations by the Bank of England and other European central banks on Black Wednesday, draining cash from the UK banking system. Backing up the indications of low economic demand, the British Bankers' Association said the big commercial banks received repayments from companies and consumers in September of nearly Pounds 1bn at an underlying level, the first such repayment since March.</p>

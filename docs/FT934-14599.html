			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool ahead 27% to Dollars 70m WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday unveiled a 27 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings, helped by strong results from the company's European business. The US company turned in net earnings of Dollars 70m, or 96 cents a share, against Dollars 55m, or 78 cents, in the same period last year on revenues which were flat at Dollars 1.91bn. Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said the company's operating performance in each of its four global regions 'met or exceeded our high expectations for them'. In North America, the company said revenues and earnings were 'better than an outstanding third-quarter 1992,' although revenues rose faster than operating profits. Profits growth was dampened by the new accounting standards for post-retirement benefits, a charge relating to ending distributor agreements and the impact of a weakening Canadian dollar. Industry shipments were up more than 10 per cent in the quarter and were expected to be up between 3 per cent and 4 per cent for the year. In Europe, the company had record operating earnings in spite of a sluggish environment. Whirlpool said its unit shipments were higher, its costs were significantly lower and its compressor business had a strong performance. Whirlpool expects European industry shipments to be down by about 2 per cent for the year. Other overseas operations saw strong growth. Excluding Brazil, Latin American shipments and revenues were about double. In Asia, unit shipment and revenues rose more than 30 per cent in the quarter but profitability declined, because of planned spending linked to expansion in the region. For the nine months, Whirlpool suffered a net loss of Dollars 18m, or 27 cents, including special charges. Stripping out these charges, earnings for the period would have totalled Dollars 202m, or Dollars 2.81. A year earlier, Whirlpool had net earnings of Dollars 143m, or Dollars 2.03.</p>

He also said that "a U.S. decision and U.S. brutality  are behind the massacre committed by Israel against our people  in the south." He said that "those killing our kinfolk and  cities will drink from the same cup and will suffer the effects  of this experience, because it is not that we like to kill  children, women, and the elderly, as they did, but because we  could reach these results when the tragedy develops into more  than one people's revolution and more than one state of  bereavement."    He added: "We understand that a war might move to stir up a  problem with troops here and there, and we understand that some  civilians can be killed when there is a state of war, but we  cannot -- in the context of any political, religious, or  cultural position -- understand why civilians, in particular  children returning from schools, should be bombarded with a  brutal mentality that can aim its shells against people working  in their schools, markets, and homes, especially in areas where  there are no military personnel or posts at all."    He said: "That illegitimate state is a state of massacres  that murders children, women, and the elderly; blows up hotels,  churches, and mosques; and kills Muslim and Christian worshipers  in cold blood." Fadlallah wondered: "If the children killed  while returning from their schools and the innocent people  killed while at their homes or on their way to work were Jews,  would the United States have kept silent? Would Europe have  kept silent? Would that world, which calls itself civilized and  developed, have kept silent? Or would it have instigated the  entire world against what it terms extremists, fanatics, and  savages.... We have not heard a single word from the arrogant  world or an official word from Lebanon. Are they all frightened  to condemn Israel?... [It seems that] what is required is for  everyone to give Israel everything in order to risk the peace,  as U.S. President (Bill Clinton) says."    He said: "When we look at all this spite and all these  missiles launched against civilians, we see the U.S. decision,  U.S. brutality, U.S. terrorism, and U.S. arrogance, joined from  time to time by British and French arrogance." Addressing  citizens, he said: "Store all this inside you and teach your  children that the United States is the cause of all your  problems, as it is the one which gives the enemy all the means  of power and obstructs any condemnation of him." He added: "It  is the mujahidin who represent Lebanon's strength and freedom,  not those who engage in internal sectarian predicaments and  massacres."</p>

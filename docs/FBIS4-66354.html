			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Long Wenbin [7893 2429 1755] and Zhao </F> Wei: "Accelerating Hydropower Cascade Development, Establishing  a Southern Electric Power Corridor, Hydropower Construction in  Southwest Will Provide a Powerful Motive Force for Economic  Takeoff on the Southeast Coast"]    [Text] Southwest China, crisscrossed by rivers, is the  region of China with the most abundant hydropower resources. It  has 194,000MW of developable hydropower, equal to 51.7 percent  of China's total hydropower. Currently, six of the 12 key  cascade development base areas being built through State plans  are located in southwest China's Jinsha Jiang, Yalong Jiang,  Dadu He, Lancang Jiang, Wu Jiang, and Hongshui He river basins.    With major efforts by the State to provide support, energy  resource development in southwest China, which has mainly  involved hydropower, has entered the best period in the last  decade. According to incomplete statistics, Yunnan, Guizhou, and  Sichuan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region invested  16 billion yuan in capital during the Seventh 5-Year Plan alone  in electric power construction, more than four times greater  than the total amount invested during the Sixth 5-Year Plan,  adding 6,000MW in new generating capacity. As we enter the  Eighth 5-Year Plan, the pace of construction has been further  accelerated. During the past two years the primary grids  completed 5.86 billion yuan in electric power construction  investments and added 2,430MW in installed generating capacity.  At the end of 1992, these three provinces and one autonomous  region had a total installed electric power generating capacity  of 20,155MW, including an installed hydropower generating  capacity of 9,640MW. Sichuan Province, which has developed at a  rapid pace, increased its total installed electric power  generating capacity from 4,624MW in 1985 to 9,565MW in 1992,  more than doubling it.    The deployment of energy resource development in the vast  southwest China region is focused on cascade development of six  large river basins. In plans for the trunks, 65 large and  medium-sized hydropower stations have been designed with a total  installed generating capacity scale of 120,000MW, including 11  that have been completed or are now under construction with a  total installed generating capacity of 10,810MW and annual power  output of 51.92 billion kWh. According to the Ninth 5-Year Plan,  another seven large hydropower stations with a total installed  generating capacity of almost 20,000MW will be built in  succession. Electric power experts predict that by the end of  this century, the installed hydropower generating capacity in  southwest China will increase substantially and form China's  biggest hydropower base area cluster in these six large basins.    As hydropower energy resource base area construction is  developed, southwest China's electric power industry, which had  been backward for a long time, has begun to enter the  development phase of large power grids, large power plants,  large generators, high voltages, and high automation levels. In  the early 1980s, southwest China had only two large hydropower  stations bigger than 500MW, but today we have now completed or  are in the process of building five hydropower stations at  Ertan, Manwan, Yantan, and Tianshengqiao First Cascade and  Second Cascade, all of which have installed generating  capacities greater than 1,200MW. This is particularly true of  Ertan Power Station in Sichuan, which has a total installed  generating capacity of 3,300MW and six generators that will  generate 17 billion kWh of electricity annually, the most  electricity generated among the hydropower projects under  construction in China in these three indicators.    Since 1992, we have installed three 500 kV power  transmission  and transformation lines, the largest in China in terms of  capacity, between Guiyang and Tianshengqiao, Manwan and Kunming,  and Tianshengqiao and Foshan in Guangdong, which is an  indication that a preliminary key electric power facility  linking south China and southwest China has been completed.</p>

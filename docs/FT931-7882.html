			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (2): How a speech poisoned the atmosphere ANYONE who has spoken at a conference remembers the disasters. The one lodged in my memory is being hustled out of a hotel rear entrance to avoid being attacked by aggrieved supermarket managers. Having discussed speech-making with Ms Cristina Stuart, managing director of Speakeasy, who teaches people how to address meetings, I think I know now why my mishap occurred. I was in too much of a hurry. The supermarket managers' conference was an angry occasion even before I got there. It was a time when hardly a week went by without a food poisoning scare. Mrs Edwina Currie had just resigned from the UK government over her remarks about salmonella and eggs. The supermarket managers felt besieged and misunderstood. They had no doubt who was to blame for inflaming the situation: the press. Asked to speak about the press and food retailers, I arrived just a few minutes before my alloted starting time. Had I known how aggrieved the meeting already was, I might have started off by acknowledging that the supermarkets' job was a difficult one. I might have conceded that public expect- ations were, to some degree, unrealistic, driven by a desire for preservative-free food which lasts forever, before pointing out that press interest in the subject was good and proper in a democratic society. Instead of which, I launched straight into a defence of newspapers' screaming- headline treatment of salmonella and other issues, pointing out that journalists had families just like everyone else and did not want to see them poisoned. I looked out at rows of set, sullen faces, but it was too late to change tack. When I finally sat down, the nervous chair- woman asked for any questions, thanked me for coming before anyone had a chance to raise a hand, told the assembled throng that tea was waiting outside the conference hall, offered me none, and showed me the way out. It is, says, Ms Stuart, a good idea to arrive at the conference venue early, stand up on the stage, look out at the empty seats and imagine them filled. The more you feel at ease, the more naturally you will speak. And she could have added, if you sit and listen to the speeches before your turn comes, you will have a chance to assess the nature and mood of your audience and have a better idea of how to get your message across. At least the supermarket managers were sufficiently angry to pay attention. The problem with most conference speeches is that hardly anyone listens to them. This is not because the acoustics are poor but because most conference audiences spend their day in a semi-comatose state. I have never entirely understood why this should be so. Some conference speakers are dull, but even the mildly interesting ones manage to lose their audiences after the first few sentences. Mr Lee Bowman, chairman of the Kingstree Group, which also teaches people how to speak in public, says the reason conference audiences fall asleep is that nothing is expected of them. In everyday conversation, the person doing the speaking does not set the pace; it is the person being addressed who determines how quickly the speaker talks, when he or she pauses, speeds up, slows down, goes back to explain and so on. If we are talking to someone, they tell us by nodding that they have understood, by looking puzzled that they have not, by appearing bored that we should get a move on. The larger the group, the more diffuse these signals. And at most conferences the speaker has no idea at all what the audience thinks because the lights are dimmed. The darkness is a signal to the audience that no-one is going to disturb their peace. They are not going to be asked to participate. If they thought they were, their interest would be unflagging. Anyone who has been to a live performance by Dame Edna Everage, the cross- dressing Australian raconteur, recalls the fear of having questions directed at them and the schadenfreude when she picks on someone else. Ms Stuart tries to involve her audiences whenever she can. For the novice speaker, there is the danger of losing one's thread and not being able to find it again. But an audience asked to contribute seldom sleeps. The other soporific factor at conferences is the slide show. No conference speaker arrives these days without a large selection of slides. The first one might show the speaker's company logo. Subsequent ones might show an entire balance sheet or a statement encapsulating the company's strategy: Target the Ketchup-Flavoured Yoghurt-Eating Sector. Slides seldom leave any impression. The only mildly entertaining feature of a conference slide show is when one appears upside-down. The problem with 'visual aids' is that while watching them the audience is not listening to the speaker. You cannot look and listen at the same time. Ms Stuart likens it to trying to read the newspaper while listening to the radio. Neither makes much impression. The experts advise selective use of visual aids. For most of the speech, the screen should be blank. When something does appear on the screen, the speaker should pause, allowing the audience to take in the image. The slide itself should be memorable; a cartoon makes a bigger impression than a set of figures, or a screen filled with words. The most important barrier to audience attention is that the speaker's personality does not come through. Most speakers are too nervous. They speak too quickly. Many have written out every word of their speech, which they then proceed to read. There is a vast difference, however, between the written and spoken word. Most written speeches sound tedious when read aloud. Mr Bowman says speakers should try to treat their speeches as enlarged conversations. If you have a prepared text, depart from it, adding personal asides and reminiscences. Your audience will appreciate it, even if the note-taking journalists do not.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Twelve men in search of a common meaning: At Edinburgh, EC leaders face the daunting task of clarifying the concept of subsidiarity The European Community's leaders will try once again at this week's Edinburgh summit to make sense of subsidiarity, the idea enshrined in the Maastricht treaty that Brussels should not interfere in matters best left to member states. A year ago, subsidiarity seemed an elixir for all the Community's ills. Back in 1989, when Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, was seeking to exorcise Lady (then Mrs) Thatcher's nightmare vision of a 'European super-state', he invoked it as the means to reconcile 'what for many appears to be irreconcilable: the emergence of a united Europe and loyalty to one's homeland; the need for a European power capable of tackling the problems of our age and the absolute necessity to preserve our roots'. The history of the term should have made us suspicious from the start. For subsidiarity is a chameleon, changing its colour to suit the beholder. To the Vatican in the 1930s, it meant keeping Mussolini's fascist tentacles out of Italian education. For postwar Germany, the term helped provide a justification for a federal division of powers between Bonn and the lander. Subsidiarity is really no more than shorthand for two platitudes as old as politics itself: that political authority should be exercised at the level most appropriate to the function in question; and that government of any kind should supplement, not replace, action by individuals and families. Turning those maxims into a constitutional principle regulating the Community's authority was always bound to cause trouble. It came at Maastricht. The formula agreed in Article 3b conflates a hotchpotch of vague and conflicting meanings. One sentence permits Brussels to do whatever is 'necessary' to achieve any of the treaty's widely-drawn objectives (eg: 'to promote economic and social progress'); another states that, in areas of shared competence, Community action will be tolerable only if a specific policy goal cannot be 'sufficiently achieved' by member states. In the latter case, Brussels may act if it believes it can do better 'by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action'. Since the treaty does not demarcate areas of 'exclusive' and 'shared' powers, the scope of subsidiarity is left as unclear as its definition. Even if it were clear, there is no agreement on whether it is applicable at all in areas of exclusive competence, such as agriculture, where the treaties oblige the Community to act. The British government asserts that it is; the Commission that it is not. As Lord Mackenzie-Stuart, former president of the European Court, writes in a foreword to our study of the issue published today*: 'The paragraph on subsidiarity is a disgraceful piece of sloppy draftsmanship, so bad that one is forced to assume it must be deliberate.' Deliberate or not, the ambiguity has enabled every Community politician to claim it for his own. Mr Major hails subsidiarity as a triumph for decentralisation, even a licence to repatriate existing Community activities. The poorer states invoke it to support an extension of Community policies, often travelling under catchphrases such as 'cohesion', which will enable them to obtain budgetary transfers - transfers they are clamouring to increase. As for the Commission, its latest document on the subject asserts that 'the subsidiarity principle regulates the exercise of powers rather than the conferment of powers'. This is a pointless distinction for those large fields of potential Community competence agreed at Maastricht, within which subsidiarity was intended to act as an effective check. Or rather, its only point is that it gives an initial presumption that the Community may act, fortified by the document's insistence on subsidiarity going hand-in-hand with the principle of 'proportionality' - more Euro-jargon, meaning: 'don't use a sledge-hammer to crack a nut'. By that interpretation, subsidiarity is largely about the management of Community action. Since Article 3b will be justiciable, all this promises to turn the European Court of Justice into a cockpit of controversy, forced to reach political decisions on political criteria. Are standardised speed limits, environmental impact assessments and a waste land fill directive 'necessary' to fulfil the Community's obligations? Can protection for animals in zoos, or harmonisation of company law, be 'sufficiently achieved' by member states, or do the 'scale or effects' justify intervention from Brussels? The judges may soon have to decide. Despite this farrago, Article 3b - and subsidiarity - are here to stay. Renegotiation would be too dire a prospect for the EC's leaders to contemplate. So what is to be done? For subsidiarity to have any chance of providing an effective basis on which to arbitrate between conflicting views of the Community interest, the minimum task at Edinburgh is to improve Article 3b in three ways: by defining it less ambiguously, by clarifying its scope (what it should apply to), and by giving it teeth with a 'subsidiarity veto'. Definition. The words 'scale or effects' need to be defined more closely. Commission initiatives should be limited to proposals on policies which, if left to member states, would have appreciable cross-border consequences, or to policies which can be shown to achieve significant overall economies of scale. To focus attention on this subsidiarity test, and provide a basis for adjudication by the Court should it be sought, the Commission should be required to justify its proposals in those terms, and the Council of Ministers should append a subsidiarity statement to all legislation it enacts. Scope. Subsidiarity, however defined, should apply to existing Community policies, and to action proposed within areas currently held to be the exclusive competence of the Community. Subsidiarity veto. Where any two member states believe a proposed measure is incompatible with subsidiarity as defined above, they should be able to exercise a suspensory veto - that is, a power to refer for further consideration on grounds of subsidiarity any proposal for a period of up to two years. 'Strange fate for a word to have a use before a meaning,' remarked Mr Francois-Xavier Ortoli, a former Commission president, recently. If subsidiarity does not acquire an agreed meaning soon, it will be of little use, and much danger, in the times of adversity already engulfing the EC. * Subsidiarity: No Panacea, European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA.

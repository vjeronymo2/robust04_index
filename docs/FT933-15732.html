			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: German bonds rise on hopes of further interest rate cut REVITALISED hopes of a further German interest rate cut before the Bundesbank policymaking council goes into recess at the end of the month sent German government bonds higher yesterday. Enthusiasm had dampened in early trading on news that the coupon on the new 10-year Treuhand bond was set at 6 5/8 per cent, disappointing market expectations of a 6 3/4 per cent coupon. However, September bund futures shot forward on rate cut hopes in late trading to close 0.21 higher at 93.38. The hopes were fuelled by a statement from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, that inflation in the past quarter was only 2.7 per cent. That figure approaches the Bundesbank target of 2 per cent and leaves room for a further easing. Traders and economists are speculating that the Bundesbank will not ease at the next council meeting on July 15 but will cut at the last one on July 29. UK GILTS rose again in response to a strong pound, the German rate cut optimism and the fundamental attractions of the UK government bond market. Any German easing will leave more room for manoeuvre in the UK and investors still like the UK's appeal of low inflationary prospects coupled with slow growth. However, the currency was the main reason behind yesterday's rise as overseas investors acted on the further strength of the pound against the D-Mark. Long gilt futures for September lifted a further  1/8 to 107 13/16 . The rapid rise in gilt prices (and fall in yields) has taken some economists by surprise. Mr Julian Callow, economist with Kleinwort Benson, said that at 7.55 per cent the yield on 10-year issues had almost reached his forecast for the end of the year. FRENCH government bonds were also pulled higher by the prospect of a German easing and received an added impetus from a stronger franc. Technical buying gave the September 10-year future added support and it closed half a point higher at 119.60. The Balladur privatisation bond issue appears to be subscribed beyond the FFr40bn target initially announced, AP-DJ reports from Paris. Bankers handling the issue could not confirm a figure of FFr80bn but some observers indicated that the number was not far-fetched. The subscription period runs until July 10. The bonds carry a 6 per cent coupon and can be converted to shares in privatised companies. They also carry assorted tax benefits. ITALIAN debt drifted back as investors took profits after a recent strong rally. The BTP 10-year futures contract for September slipped a quarter point to 103.89. However, fundamental sentiment was good and operators who took profits found eager buyers at lower levels. Dealers said few investors were seriously worried ahead of yesterday evening's vote of confidence in the government of Mr Carlo Ciampi. Several economists believe the BNTP contract which has risen from 93.90 at the start of April could gain a further two points if the Bank of Italy continues to make substantial cuts in its discount rate. PORTUGUESE bonds fell from early highs on profit-taking, and dealers said recent price rises had been overdone. Some banks with excess funds were still attracted to the good rate on fixed rate bonds compared to the 10.25 per cent central bank rate for mopping up liquidity, they added. THE US Treasury market reopened after the long holiday weekend in a broadly positive mood, with longer-dated prices posting solid gains in the morning, before an afternoon bout of inflation-related worries dampened spirits and sent prices broadly lower. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off  7/32 at 105 23/32 , yielding 6.6676 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  5/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.992 per cent. Treasuries opened firmer, buoyed by overnight buying in foreign markets and by reports that the Federal Reserve, in the wake of last week's unexpected poor employment figures, was ready to return the bias on its monetary policy to a neutral stance, away from the tightening bias adopted two months ago. In late morning trading, however, shorter-dated securities fell back from their early gains, as a slight surge in commodities prices prompted selling at the short end. In the afternoon, longer-dated securities were hit by concerns about inflation linked to a 5.12 rise in the Commodity Research Bureau Index to 217.22.

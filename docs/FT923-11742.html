			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hoesch advances 40% in first half HOESCH, the German steel and engineering company soon to be absorbed by the Krupp group, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in profits for the first half of 1992. The company, which gave no further details, also confirmed that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman, is to resign at the end of this month. The improvement suggests the steel market is enjoying at least a partial recovery from the price slump which was the main cause of a 66 per cent drop in profits in the first six months of 1991. The announcement indicates earnings of around DM196m (Dollars 132.4m) for the first six months of 1992, against DM140m in the comparable part of 1991 and DM412m in 1990. Further information is expected at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 27, when final formalities of the takeover by Krupp will be approved. The assembly follows the regular annual meeting last month which overturned a voting rights limit, introduced into the group's constitution supposedly to protect Hoesch from predators, but which proved ineffective against Krupp's determined assault. Mr Neukirchen, who took charge at Hoesch in August 1991, first threatened to resign last October when Krupp announced it had bought 24.9 per cent of Hoesch's stock. Mr Neukirchen, who had been negotiating over possible 'collaboration' with Krupp, unaware of the buying operation, said he would quit if Hoesch lost its independence. Krupp has since enlarged its stake to 62 per cent. The merger of the two businesses, which is to be backdated to January 1, will be effectively complete after next week's meeting. The new group, to be called Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch Krupp, will have annual sales of around DM30bn and employ almost 100,000.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Malaysia enjoys frantic trading activity - Investor interest has mainly concentrated on second-line stocks Brokers forced to sleep in the office at night as they battle with the paperwork of millions of share transactions; helicopters chartered to fly scrip in from various parts of the country: the pace is frantic on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. In terms of trading volume Kuala Lumpur has outperformed New York on several recent days. Whereas a year ago about 30m shares were being traded daily, by the middle of this week daily volume was more than 1bn units valued at nearly MDollars 2.5bn (Dollars 950m). Market values are considerably higher in New York, but daily trading volume is only in the 250m to 300m shares area. Malaysian share prices are also at peak levels, but they have experienced a far more modest rise. Against a figure of 644 at the end of last year, the KLSE composite index yesterday hit an all-time closing high of 660.73 against a previous peak of 660.35 last November 5. Tenaga Nasional and Telekom, the partially privatised electricity and telecommunications utilities, together account for nearly 40 per cent of market capitalisation. But trading in these stocks has been light: instead investors have been trading unprecedented volumes of secondary stocks. For instance, Idris Hydraulic, a financial and property holding company, has seen its share value leap by 300 per cent. Malaysia is embarking on a number of large infrastructure projects, including the construction of another international airport outside Kuala Lumpur, new sewage systems and power generation facilities. There have been strong rumours that Idris, said to be politically well connected, might be awarded work on some of these lucrative projects. Renong is a larger company than Idris with interests in construction, manufacturing and financial services. It, too, is believed to have substantial political connections, serving in the past as the investment vehicle of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). There are rumours that Renong might also be awarded valuable government contracts and trading in its shares has likewise been exceptionally heavy. Officials insist that the present frenzied activity, which began more than a week ago, is a reflection of the country's buoyant economy. In each of the past five years Malaysia has achieved growth rates of more than 8 per cent and while some slowdown is evident, most analysts predict 1993 GDP growth of between 7 and 8 per cent. But there are plenty of sceptics. 'The fundamentals of the economy are not that much different from a year ago - if anything things are not looking so good now,' said one broker. 'There's really no logical reason for all this activity. It's just that people have suddenly decided to indulge in an orgy of speculative buying and selling.' Malaysia's sound economic performance of recent years has encouraged record levels of foreign capital inflow and analysts say that the liquidity rich banking system has been an important factor in encouraging market activity. Kuala Lumpur has also been influenced by the generally bullish sentiment in other regional markets, particularly Hong Kong and Tokyo. In turn the performance of the exchange has been the main factor behind the recent rise in Singapore, with Malaysian-related stocks being the main focus of attention. Concern has been expressed about Kuala Lumpur's ability to cope with the present trading volumes. In early 1990 the exchange could not cope with a sudden surge in volume and MDollars 250m worth of share certificates went missing. The incident took several months to sort out and raised questions about the exchange's management. Hence the warning from Mr Salleh Majid, the exchange's general manager, for brokers not to trade beyond their financial and physical capabilities. There have been allegations that well organised syndicates involving speculators from Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore have been launching raids on individual stocks to ramp up the market. The exchange says that it is closely monitoring the market and that, so far, it has found no evidence of manipulation. Most brokers feel that while the present trading surge is unlikely to last many more days, the market will probably consolidate rather than experience a steep rise or fall. 'We know it can't go on like this,' said one weary broker. 'But it's fun to think that, for a few days at least, little Kuala Lumpur has been outgunning New York.'</p>

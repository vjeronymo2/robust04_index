			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ghassan al-Khatib, a member of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, in Jerusalem, by  Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue  From Afar" program--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Al-Miliji] The visit to the United States by  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has triggered Arab  reaction. How do the Palestinians view the visit and where do  they stand on the results that have appeared?    [Al-Khatib] First, not all the results of the visit have  appeared. It is clear that some issues were discussed but not  publicized. The two sides announced that they agreed on several  issues, which have not been publicized fully. So it is hard to  make a final judgment on the outcome of the visit. The results  announced so far fall short of meeting the minimum demands or  needs that the Palestinian leadership put forward as urgent  prerequisites for resuming negotiations and guaranteeing their  success should they be resumed soon. [passage omitted]    The U.S. Government has unfortunately failed to cooperate in  convincing Israel to respond to these demands. Hence, the  Israelis are not serious and the U.S. stance backs them.    [Al-Miliji] You said that the Palestinian leadership  conveyed  these demands. Were they conveyed during the visit to Tunisia  by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?    [Al-Khatib] These demands were conveyed earlier, through the  Palestinian delegation that visited Washington.    [Al-Miliji] The delegation that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat led?    [Al-Khatib] Yes. The day after the massacre a meeting was  held between Dr. 'Urayqat and representatives of the U.S. State  Department. The demands were conveyed during that meeting.  They were also conveyed to Dennis Ross, during his visit to  Tunisia, and were directly conveyed to Rabin more than once.    [Al-Miliji] Has the Palestinian leadership received no  response?    [Al-Khatib] It received a reply from Rabin saying that the  demands concerning settlement cannot be met because this would  violate the Oslo agreement. He added that the Israeli  Government would take a set of measures to curb the settlers'  terrorist activity. These measures were announced later  following a meeting of the Israeli inner cabinet.    [Al-Miliji] What about the U.S. response?    [Al-Khatib] There is no direct or material U.S. response.  The  U.S. Administration has shown no understanding of these demands.  But there was no direct rejection.    [Al-Miliji] Some believe the PLO can resume the peace  negotiations and submit these demands for discussion at the  negotiating table. What do you think?    [Al-Khatib] I do not believe this approach will work. To  return to negotiations without defining the basics that take  note of the recent tragic experience will again involve us in  negotiations that waste time uselessly. To make the resumption  of talks feasible, the bases of the negotiations must be amended  so that the issues pertaining to settlements can be addressed.    [Al-Miliji] We now turn to another topic, that is, honorable  Jerusalem and the U.S. President's remarks that viewed it as the  united capital of Israel. This is the first time a U.S.  President has made such a statement. Do the Palestinians have  an official stance on that statement?    [Al-Khatib] Certainly. First, it constitutes a backing down  on the previous U.S. stance. In the context of preparations for  talks, as well as during the talks, the U.S. stance provided for  postponing discussion of the issue of Jerusalem until the final  stage. Second, this stance violates and is inconsistent with  the UN Security Council resolutions and international  legitimacy. We have recently noticed that the United States has  tended to take Israel's side. We believe that this complicates  rather than facilitates negotiations. We believe there should  be critical reaction, not only by the Palestinians, but also by  the Arab and Muslim parties, since Jerusalem concerns all Arab  and Muslim brothers.    [Al-Miliji] We thank Ghassan al-Khatib.    [Al-Khatib] Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS BILL INTENDED TO FREE JAILED MOTHER  </P> <P> The Senate late Thursday approved a measure designed to free imprisoned plastic  surgeon Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who has been in jail for two years because she  hid her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, and refuses to produce her for  unsupervised visits with her father.  </P> <P> Morgan has charged her former husband, oral surgeon Dr. Eric Foretich, with  sexually abusing the child, a charge that he has vehemently denied.  </P> <P> The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent just before midnight.  </P> <P> The bill would place a 12-month limit on civil contempt jailings in child  custody cases in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. It would apply  retroactively to Morgan, who has been held in a Washington jail since Aug. 28,  1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> House OKd Similar Bill  </P> <P> The House passed a similar bill in June, but it would limit all contempt  jailings in the District of Columbia to 18 months. A House-Senate conference  committee must resolve differences between the two versions before a bill can  be signed by President Bush.  </P> <P> "The purpose of civil contempt is not to punish but to coerce compliance with  the court's order," Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), sponsor of the Senate bill,  said on the Senate floor before the vote.  </P> <P> "Once it is clear that the civil contempt sanction will not coerce a  recalcitrant individual, that sanction must be removed," Hatch said. "The  failure to do so constitutes a deprivation of liberty or property without due  process."  </P> <P> Foretich, however, called the congressional action "a repudiation and a  disenfranchisement of both my daughter and me." He said his goal was not to  keep his former wife in jail but to get Hilary back.  </P> <P> Last month, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals, Washington's  highest court, ruled that Morgan was being held in prison unlawfully. But the  panel's decision to free her was stayed pending a hearing by the full court,  scheduled for Sept. 20. It was unclear if the oral arguments will still take  place as scheduled in light of the congressional action.  </P></p>

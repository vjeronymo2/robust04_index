			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRO-LIFE, PRO-CHOICE  </P> <P> In response to the letter from Ruth Sultzbach on the abortion debate (Orange  County section, March 12), I must agree with her claim that pro-lifers are  anti-choice. Anti-choice out of necessity, to give the unborn a chance to make  future choices and decisions in their own lives.  </P> <P> If Sultzbach is intellectually honest and really wants to "get our terms  straight," then she must realize that pro-choice compels a no-choice on the  life in the unborn.  </P> <P> In her letter, Ruth Sultzbach complains of the "cruel harassment of each woman  entering the clinic." So be it. The "cruel harassment" of the women pales in  comparison to the flesh-tearing treatment of the never-to-be-born baby  resulting from "pro-choicers' " actions.  </P> <P> Sultzbach argues that pro-lifers seek to destroy the abortion-seeking woman's  right to life, and her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness." What  pro-choice proponents fail to realize, or naively try to ignore, is the cause  and effect of decisions and actions.  </P> <P> In short, the decisions and actions taken resulted in the creation of life.  Taking that life, regardless of how it is packaged, is killing.  </P> <P> Back to Sultzbach's original argument: Yes, let's "get our terms straight."  Pro-choicers are pro-killers.  </P> <P> STAN GOULD  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

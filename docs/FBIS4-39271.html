			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valentyn </F> Landyk by UKRINFORM correspondent Volodymyr Yeremenko; place and  date not given: "The Cabinet of Ministers Knows How To Extricate  Ukraine From the Crisis"]    [Text] It appears that the government of Ukraine has  finally found that the main link, more specifically, the several  links, that may be pulled to draw the whole chain -- to  stabilize Ukraine's economy. This enabled Vice Prime Minister  Valentyn Landyk to state, in an exclusive interview with a  UKRINFORM correspondent, that the situation in the country will  change radically in the next year or two owing to the extensive  work on restructuring the economy.    The adoption by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers at the  beginning of May of the decree "On Urgent Measures for  Overcoming the Payments Crisis and Normalizing the Work of  Enterprises" was the first step on that road.    [Landyk] We must clearly specify what is meant. Today, the  mutual insolvency of enterprises in Ukraine has reached 60  trillion karbovantsi [K]. The same situation also prevails in  Russia. Payments are not transferred either there or to us.  Production has been stopped again. All this time, a specific  experiment was conducted: Every time a certain sum of money was  injected, in other words, [monetary] emission was resorted to,  the enterprises worked for two, three, or four months and...  stopped again.    [Yeremenko] In other words, they simply worked to fill  warehouses and produced and stored products that nobody needed,  and that was the end of it?    [Landyk] Precisely. That is why, at the end of December and  in January, we were faced with a dilemma: Whether to administer  yet another monetary injection and raise prices by between three  and five times or stop everything and say: "Well, enough is  enough, let us address the problem in terms of the economy."    [Yeremenko] However, how, being totally insolvent, can one  extricate oneself from the standstill?    [Landyk] There are two ways. Either monetary emission,  which does not suit us, or an economic stimulation of  production. We have analyzed the lists of all enterprises in  order to see which of them (a) need to be taken under control,  (b) whose products are in demand, and (c) only work to fill  warehouses. The picture is appalling: Today, in Ukraine, the  products of just 30 percent of enterprises are in demand. That  is why the task is to assist those enterprises that manufacture  competitive products.    [Yeremenko] And close down the rest and throw the people  into the street?    [Landyk] No, it is also necessary to help them, but in the  following way: To completely reprofile them and to change their  production. Today, it is necessary to adopt a clear-cut system:  At the beginning or at the end of the year, the marketing  departments must travel through Ukraine, Russia, Belarus,  Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Poland, and Hungary and present their  products, advertise them, and conclude contracts. Following  that, all efforts must be focused on manufacturing those  products for which there are contracts. Unless we realize this,  we will not be able to get things going. In this connection, I  believe that about 50 percent of directors need to be replaced.    Nobody speaks of "creating" unemployment and throwing  everybody into the street. This is incorrect and not normal.  We must try and keep all those enterprises that are needed for  the functioning of the economy of the sovereign Ukraine. Even  if, for example, 1,000 people work there, it is necessary to  have them employed. Once there is work, wages, and deductions  to the budget, the social sphere will function. There will be  economic turnover. We envisaged this in our program. It is  also necessary to prepare documents, so that, starting from tiny  steps, we could gradually raise the economy.    [Yeremenko] How and on what principles? For example, there  has long been talk that profits and not incomes need to be  taxed. This is what is done everywhere in the world.    [Landyk] That profit must be taxed is not subject to any  doubt. Drafts of corresponding decrees will be submitted to the  Supreme Council for consideration in the very near future.    It is necessary to reduce the value-added tax, which  presently constitutes 28 percent. I think that 20 percent will  do. Moreover, we must look into the future, since there are  different enterprises: For some of them, 20 percent may be  assigned, whereas for others, 10 percent will be more than  enough. In other words, there must be a differential approach.  It is essential that people should be able to buy goods.  Especially consumer goods. In some places, the excise duty  needs to be reduced. Taxes should not render production  inexpedient. Some people claim that the cancellation of taxes  or excise duty will lead to a decrease of contributions to the  budget. However, this is not so. If goods are selling, the  state will also benefit from this. If there is stagnation, then  there will be no value-added tax, sales tax, or excise duty.    [Yeremenko] Such a situation prevailed in the Zaporizhzhya  production association Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant. The prices  of automobiles far exceeded K100 million. Mainly due to the  exorbitant taxes, which rose above 65 percent of the automobile  prices. As a consequence, nobody bought the cars and the  warehouses became filled with automobiles. It was only after  the administration managed to have the excise duty reduced and  the prices lowered that the cars began to sell. Prior to that,  the plant had stood idle for two weeks. Now, there is money,  and production has been resumed.    [Landyk] Here, the general director of the Zaporizhzhya  Automobile Plant, Stepan Kravchun, showed perseverance and an  ability to convince. The Cabinet of Ministers decided to help.  The machine builders benefited from that, as well as the  country's economy in general. Over this period of time, more  cars have been sold than in the preceding three and a half  months.    Proceeding from the same circumstances, we decided to reduce  the rates of the excise duty, in particular, on vodka, to 80  percent, various types of wine to 10 percent, cigarettes to 40  percent, color television sets to 10 percent, and to cancel the  excise duty on black-and-white television sets and unprocessed  alcohol. It is perfectly obvious that the state must hold the  monopoly on the manufacture and sale of wine, vodka, and  cigarettes. This is what is done in the majority of countries  of the world, including highly developed ones, and this brings  them large profits.    [Yeremenko] All the more so since, even before, such a  monopoly used to be one of the main sources of profit in our  country.    [Landyk] Yes, but then some people started hollering: This  is illegal and contrary to market principles, let us open  everything and import everything. It is not a matter of this  being in line with the market or against the market. One must  also know what the market is all about. The state, which  manufactures alcohol that used to satisfy the needs of the  entire Soviet Union in this sphere, must now import alcohol and  not protect the interests of its own producers.    However, the problem does not only lie in such a monopoly  and  not only in whether we should import or export alcohol, wine, or  vodka. Our export-import policy is generally wrong and turned  upside down. In addition to taxes on profits, the producer in  Ukraine is so burdened by such obstacles created by licensing  that he is actually rendered helpless.    With regard to exports, we also have everything clearly  specified. First, we will lower the prime cost of the output,  as also the rates of various taxes. At the same time, imports  will be regulated. It is necessary to protect our own  producers. In this manner, we will emerge from the crisis.  This may be called nonmarket methods. However, today, we must  try to rescue our producers in every possible way and to prevent  mass unemployment. When we emerge from the crisis, we will see  what to do next. We have clearly adopted a course toward  liberalizing exports and regulating imports. However, this does  not apply to the CIS states.    [Yeremenko] Incidentally, about the CIS. It looks like the  Commonwealth countries fail to trigger this mechanism. In this  country, debates are in progress on whether Ukraine should be a  member of the CIS (Ukraine is one of its three founders) or  whether it should abandon the Commonwealth. Nor is there a  common attitude toward the fact that, after the dispute that  lasted more than a year, Ukraine became an associated member of  the CIS economic union. Many people express their fear that this  may become a new channel for colonizing Ukraine and for  enslaving it.    [Landyk] Before answering this question, I want to focus on  the European Economic Union. Why are the highly developed  European countries uniting? In order not to admit us to that  market. Moreover, in order to win over the market of the former  USSR by joint efforts. Nobody is afraid of anything there.  Work on introducing the single monetary unit -- the ECU -- is  under way.    That is why we must also unite in order to protect our own  market. Here, I do not only see an economic union of the  countries of the former Soviet Union, but also of Eastern  European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Hungary, former Yugoslavia, and so on. It is our market, a  market where our products may be in demand. We may sell our  products in Russia and Russia in Ukraine. There is no other way.  Our export potential is not that high and it mainly applies to  raw materials. If we take our machinery, we do not,  unfortunately, have much competitive equipment.    It is, therefore, meaningless to give up this market. It  will be occupied by others. I believe that Ukraine's joining  the economic union of the CIS countries is an important step.  It is shear nonsense to say that we may be drawn into  something. There is no bondage of any kind. Frankly speaking,  an associated member is in an even more advantageous situation  that an effective one, as we have the right of choice, after  all: We may or we may not take part in implementing a  particular project. There is more freedom and room for  maneuver. Besides, we will restore, stage by stage,  technological ties and establish new ones.    [Yeremenko] So far, just the first step has been made.    [Landyk] It is also essential to elaborate an extremely  complex mechanism and prepare a number of accords. We have  already signed one -- on the creation of a free-trade zone. We  are now discussing the need to proceed, stage by stage, to an  economic and customs union. Altogether, 35 accords must be  prepared.    One can say that integration is a trend prevailing in the  world, and we must integrate at least within the framework of  former structures, but on a qualitatively new principle, which  will be mutual advantage and not mutual dependence.    [Yeremenko] All of these are global problems. What is being  done specifically for every person and for every citizen of  Ukraine?    [Landyk] First of all, it is planned to conduct indexation  of minimal wages and provide purpose-oriented support for  low-income families. It is envisaged that the state will pay  for the increase in the number of working positions. It does  not matter what form of ownership a particular enterprise has.  If it functions and creates working places, it will also  receive subsidies. This is the mechanism of state stimulation.  Well, we are also coming closer to a monetary reform, which is  inevitable. In the first stage, this is the ban on the  circulation of foreign currencies in Ukraine already this year.  In the second stage, the hryvnya will be introduced.    [Yeremenko] How much time will it take to implement the  program?    [Landyk] Here is the forecast: If all of these decisions  are fulfilled and if we establish new economic ties and maintain  the already existing ones, it will take at least two years.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SAY THEY WON'T CUT JEWISH EMIGRATION  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, backing away from a threat to  curtail Jewish emigration, told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that  Moscow will continue its liberal departure policy, a senior State Department  official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The official said Baker questioned Shevardnadze closely about Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's statements to a Washington press conference Sunday that  his government would rethink its emigration policy unless Israel guaranteed  that Soviet Jews would not be settled in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze asserted that Soviet policy is unchanged "and they are committed  to that," said the official, who spoke to reporters aboard Baker's Air Force  jet transport just before it left Copenhagen for Turnberry, Scotland. The  secretary of state is attending a North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign  ministers meeting there today and Friday.  </P> <P> Baker met Shevardnadze for two hours Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The official refused to amplify on the cryptic account that Baker and  Shevardnadze presented after the meeting concerning their talks on German  reunification, perhaps the most vexing issue on the superpower agenda. But he  volunteered a full account of the exchange on Soviet Jewish emigration.  </P> <P> Although the United States shares Soviet objections to Jewish settlement in the  West Bank and Gaza territories that Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle  East War, Baker told Shevardnadze that Washington cannot support renewed  restrictions on Soviet Jewish emigration, the official said.  </P> <P> "He (Baker) wanted to make it very clear that if there is any move in that  direction, it would have very serious consequences," the official said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev set off alarm bells Sunday when he said that unless the Jerusalem  government agreed to prevent Soviet Jews from settling in the occupied  territories, "we must give further thought to it in terms of what we do issuing  permits for exit."  </P> <P> Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government replied that less than 1%  of the Soviet Jewish immigrants coming to Israel settle in the West Bank or  Gaza. An Israeli spokesman said Arab governments have focused on settlement in  the occupied territories as a pretext for opposing all emigration to Israel.  </P> <P> At his press conference, Gorbachev said he had been "bombarded" by Arab  criticism for permitting Soviet citizens to swell the ranks of Jewish settlers  in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> "One thing is very clear -- they are sensitive to Arab criticism," the U.S.  official said Wednesday of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze told Baker that Gorbachev's remarks were not intended to signal a  reversal of policy, although the Soviet president hoped to "demonstrate their  (Moscow's) concern to the Israelis."  </P> <P> The official reported that Shevardnadze said he is prepared for face-to-face  talks with Israeli officials on the issue. Gorbachev told reporters in  Minneapolis on Sunday that "the time has not yet come" when he would be willing  to visit Israel.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's press conference remarks took on an added significance because  President Bush, who was seated next to him, did not object to the Soviet  president's threats.  </P> <P> Bush had earlier urged Israel to end all settlement activity in the occupied  territories. Washington has long considered the settlements to be an obstacle  to Middle East peace.  </P> <P> The official said the U.S. government supports unrestricted emigration by  Soviet citizens, although "we draw a distinction between Soviet Jews going to  Israel and to the territories."  </P> <P> Baker was in Copenhagen to address a meeting of the 35-nation Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), often called the Helsinki process  because the conference first met more than 15 years ago in the Finnish capital.  </P> <P> Although Baker called for steps to strengthen CSCE, he made clear that  Washington does not share a growing European fascination with turning the  organization into a Continent-wide security organ that could replace both NATO  and the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze suggested just such a role for CSCE in his speech to the  conference Tuesday. Some Western European nations, although they do not go that  far, have also talked of enlarging the security component of CSCE, one of the  few organizations that successfully straddled the ideological division of the  Cold War. The United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania are  members of CSCE.  </P> <P> "NATO will continue to serve as the indispensable guarantor of peace -- and  therefore the ultimate guardian of democracy and prosperity," Baker said. "The  alliance will work to lock in stabilizing arms control agreements, to reshape  its defense strategy to meet fundamentally changed conditions and to build  bridges of political cooperation to the newly emerging democracies of the East.  </P> <P> "As we leave the Cold War behind us, we confront again many age-old national,  religious and ethnic conflicts that have so sorrowed our common civilization,"  he added. "CSCE, NATO, and the (European Community) and democratic institutions  of Europe must now play a greater part in deepening and broadening European  unity. We must ensure that these organizations continue to complement and  reinforce one another."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Baker told reporters he will brief his fellow NATO foreign ministers  on a Soviet proposal for some sort of agreement between NATO and the Warsaw  Pact that Moscow has said might remove Soviet objections to a united Germany  holding full membership in NATO.  </P> <P> Baker said that although the Soviets raised the issue in the Washington summit,  they have not yet worked out all of the details.  </P> <P> "They continue to flesh out the idea, and they will be in touch with us," he  said.  </P> <P> The NATO foreign ministers meeting is expected to complete plans for an  alliance summit conference in London next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Israel, which expects up to 150,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants to arrive this  year, denies that it has a policy of settling them in the occupied territories.  But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says that because Israel is a democracy, its  citizens are free to live wherever they wish, including the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.  </P></p>

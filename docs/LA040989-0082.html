			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICKENBACKER GUITARS ARE HIP -- AGAIN  </P> <P> It was 1964, the movie theater was showing "A Hard Day's Night," and five young  Los Angeles rockers strained to read the names on the guitars the Beatles were  playing.  </P> <P> "George Harrison had a Rickenbacker," recalled Roger McGuinn, who still  remembers every guitar in the movie. A few days later, McGuinn traded in his  folk guitar for a gleaming new Rickenbacker electric.  </P> <P> In fact, he played it the next year on the Byrds' first hit record.  </P> <P> Long since out of fashion, Rickenbackers are suddenly the rage again. With a  reputation for expensive quality -- a sort of guitar version of the BMW --  they're big with yuppies and with foreign buyers these days.  </P> <P> Until the Beatles, Rickenbacker was just another guitar maker with an unlikely  home in conservative Orange County. The company -- once an innovator -- became  too conservative, even stodgy, some critics say. Rickenbacker, they contend,  wasn't adroit enough to adapt to changes in taste and technology in the 1970s  and the invasion of foreign-made instruments.  </P> <P> Rickenbacker didn't really seem to care about selling a million guitars or  becoming a giant like Fender or Gibson, so it has maintained its reputation for  quality. And, unlike other U.S. guitar makers, it has refused to move its  manufacturing overseas.  </P> <P> After making guitars for nearly 60 years, Rickenbacker has yet to hit sales of  $10 million a year, or about what three busy T.G.I. Friday-type restaurants  would do.  </P> <P> Now the nondescript factory in Santa Ana is swamped with orders for the first  time since the 1960s, and Rickenbacker is wrestling with problems it hasn't had  since then: How to make all those guitars without getting sloppy and tarnishing  its reputation as a small, quality manufacture.  </P> <P> The people who buy Rickenbackers may be dentists and lawyers now, but they were  adolescents in the 1960s when the Beatles, the Byrds and the Who played  Rickenbackers.  </P> <P> "A lot of the British rock groups in the '60s used them, and nostalgia's a big  part of their appeal now," said Richard R. Smith, a guitar collector and author  of Rickenbacker's official history.  </P> <P> The guitars' sound is so distinct that guitar players can often instantly  identify one on a record. And even non-experts know there's something different  about the sharp, scratchy guitar on the first few seconds of the Beatles'  "Ticket to Ride," or the 12-string guitar that sounds like chimes on the Byrds'  first hit, "Mr. Tambourine Man."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Convinced Guitar Was a Fad  </P> <P> The guitars' unusually high, clear, jangly tone also makes them popular now  with younger bands evoking a 1960s sound.  </P> <P> Adolph Rickenbacker was a Swiss immigrant who patented the first solid-body  electric guitar in 1935, the forerunner of today's electric guitars. The  company was named to capitalize on the fame of World War I flying ace Eddie  Rickenbacker, said to be a distant relative.  </P> <P> By the time Adolph Rickenbacker was ready to retire, he was convinced the  electric guitar was a fad. He sold the company in 1953 to F. C. Hall, a  distributor of radio parts who moved it from Los Angeles to be near his home in  Orange County.  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, when an obscure young British rocker named John Lennon  bought one, Rickenbacker was almost as well-known for its older Hawaiian  guitars, which were played on the guitarist's lap.  </P> <P> "When the Beatles came along, we went from selling thousands of guitars a year  to tens of thousands," said John Hall, 38, son of F. C. Hall and now  Rickenbacker's president.  </P> <P> "The Beatles," said Hall, "put the company on the map."  </P> <P> The guitars sold well even though they cost more than $300, by no means cheap  then.  </P> <P> But by the end of the 1960s, the first Rickenbacker boom was over. The Beatles  had broken up, and most rock had assumed a bluesier, grittier sound. Guitar  players emerged from anonymity, and every kid wanted the same kind of guitar  his idol played, or at least one that looked like it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tried 'Dirtier Sound'  </P> <P> The new stars of the guitar -- such as Eric Clapton -- usually played a Gibson  Les Paul, which could get the rougher sound.  </P> <P> With Fender's Stratocaster -- played by another innovative musician, Jimi  Hendrix -- Gibsons were guitars to have in the 1970s. Their sales soared;  Rickenbacker sales went off a cliff.  </P> <P> The company tried to change the guitars, but it was never really able to.  </P> <P> "We tried to put in a dirtier sound," said Hall, who bought the company from  his father four years ago. "It didn't really work."  </P> <P> By the mid-1970s, things weren't going too well for the rest of the U.S. guitar  industry, either. Sales of electric and "folk" guitars and other fretted  instruments had jumped from 400,000 in 1960 -- before folk music and rock hit  it big -- to 2.5 million in 1972. But the manufacturers would never again sell  that many.  </P> <P> Why? Well, the baby boomers started to age, and there were fewer teen-agers to  buy guitars. The late 1970s were rather directionless musically; sales of  records also suffered. By the 1980s, video games and other distractions  competed for kids' attention. By 1987, the latest available figures, sales of  new guitars had dipped to 1.2 million.  </P> <P> Not only was the boom over, but first the Japanese and then the Koreans had  ridden it right into the U.S. guitar market.  </P> <P> Now guitars manufactured abroad dominate what was once an industry as unique to  the United States as rock 'n' roll. Of the 1.2 million fretted instruments sold  last year in the United States, just 123,000 were made in America.  </P> <P> Even some of the bigger and more prestigious U.S. companies have moved much of  their manufacturing offshore to cut costs. Fender, for instance, now makes 40%  of its guitars abroad, and once quit manufacturing in the United States  altogether.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unknowledgeable Executives  </P> <P> Some legendary names in the guitar business got hurt by imports, weak  management and bad moves. Most had been bought by bigger companies dazzled by  the glamour of the business. The cash that the new parent companies brought to  the table sometimes helped soften the blow from imports. But, some critics say,  the new owners often didn't know much about the business and hadn't the  faintest idea how to compete with the imports.  </P> <P> "Some of them had a succession of executives who didn't know how to tune a  guitar," said George Gruhn, a Nashville dealer in vintage guitars who has  written extensively about the industry. "The Japanese often showed a better  knowledge of the American market than the Americans did."  </P> <P> In 1987, for instance, all guitar manufacturers foreign and domestic shipped  only $328 million worth of guitars at retail in the United States. By contrast,  computer makers shipped $3.9 billion worth of home computers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Similar Looks  </P> <P> Rickenbacker is small even by the standards of this matchbox-sized industry.  What saved the company in the 1970s was its basses. As the guitars became  unfashionable, the basses just as suddenly became hip. They were prized for  their own bright, clear sound. It lifted the instrument out of the rhythm  section in some groups -- such as the art rock combo Yes, whose bassist played  a Rickenbacker -- and made the bass another solo instrument.  </P> <P> When the guitars began to come back a few years ago, it wasn't terribly  surprising that they still looked pretty much the same as they did 25 years  ago, since a large part of their appeal is based on nostalgia. And they still  make the same limited -- though distinct -- range of sounds.  </P> <P> Nostalgia is not cheap: A new Rickenbacker starts at around $500 and goes up to  $2,700. That's without an amplifier or a case, both essential to the complete  rock 'n' roller. And it's by no means the most expensive guitar these days.  </P> <P> A Jackson -- a rakish semi-custom guitar often painted in garish reds or blues  -- starts at $1,500 and goes up to $3,000. It's the guitar of choice for heavy  metal bands these days.  </P> <P> Compared to the heavy metal types, a Rickenbacker is quieter and often older  professional rockers who tend to play Rickenbackers, such as Tom Petty and  Jackson Browne. Some newer groups are playing them too, including REM and the  Bangles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's on MTV? It's Hot  </P> <P> But the guitar market is fickle. Doc Pittillo, a Costa Mesa guitar repairman,  said, "What's really hot is usually what the kids saw on MTV last week. That's  why I'm in business."  </P> <P> What happens when the Rickenbacker fad wanes again, as some experts say it  surely must?  </P> <P> The younger Hall seems more willing to change with the times, to some extent. A  guitar player, unlike his father, and a friend to some of his more renowned  customers like McGuinn, Hall has mostly tinkered with a few changes in the  company's marketing strategy.  </P> <P> Of new models, however, there are few, and critics say the company could get  caught flat-footed when fashion and technology change again. The last new  guitars came out four years ago and aren't selling particularly well compared  to the more classic models because -- in a classic Catch 22 -- the new models  "don't look like Rickenbackers," said Hall. The company is working on some new  guitars it will unveil this year.  </P> <P> In marketing its guitars, Rickenbacker has finally deigned to use one of the  oldest ploys in the guitar industry: Get a famous guitar player to endorse your  product. But Rickenbacker's pitch is still largely nostalgic: Its deals are  with older rockers such as the Byrds' McGuinn and Pete Townshend of the Who.  Rickenbacker is selling new models of the guitars McGuinn and Townshend played  in the 1960s and making them only in limited editions so it can charge more.  </P> <P> The company has also taken to sticking "Made in America" labels on its guitars.  That's mostly for foreign buyers. It doesn't really make much difference to the  U.S. mass market now that guitars from abroad are as good as most U.S. guitars.  The international market is important to Rickenbacker: Almost half the 10,000  guitars the company says it usually makes each year are sold abroad.  </P> <P> There's also a plan to manufacture better and more expensive amplifiers, which  the company has been making for an indifferent public for 60 years.  </P> <P> Otherwise, Rickenbacker still sticks stubbornly to a nondescript section of  Santa Ana -- almost in the shadow of several sparkling new glass office towers  -- where it employs 100 to make guitars largely by hand.  </P> <P> There are no plans to make the guitars abroad, and Hall says little will change  at its tiny plant, where blocks of dull, beige Eastern Rock Maple enter only to  emerge six weeks later as burnished art objects. "My name's not Rickenbacker,"  said Hall, "but I act like it is."  </P></p>

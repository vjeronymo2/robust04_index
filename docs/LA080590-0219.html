			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON COUNCIL TO SPELL OUT PARK USES  </P> <P> As part of the city's plans to develop unused portions of Huntington Central  Park, the City Council on Monday will define the specific uses for a complex of  sports and recreation buildings planned for a 5-acre area.  </P> <P> Jim Engle, the city's acting community services director, is proposing that the  section of the park be used for a swimming pool complex, a gymnastics center  and a recreation center that would include a multipurpose gymnasium.  </P> <P> Council members have already set aside the land and have discussed Engle's  proposed uses for the area, but have yet to determine exactly what facilities  should be built there.  </P> <P> In previous discussions of that issue, the council has been divided. Their main  disagreement has been whether the gymnastics facility should be designated  specifically for a single private organization or focus on being a public  facility. Council members have also discussed whether the gymnastics center  should be integrated into the recreation center.  </P> <P> As proposed, the swimming complex could accommodate all levels of swimming  competition and lessons.  </P> <P> The recreation center would include indoor facilities for basketball,  volleyball and other sports, as well as board games and other activities.  </P> <P> The gymnastics center would be a separate facility solely designated for  gymnastics training and competition.  </P> <P> The proposed developments would be part of a 21-acre section of the park west  of Golden West Street that the council plans to build into a sports and  recreation hub for northwest Orange County.  </P> <P> The 5-acre area borders the southern edge of a 16-acre site at Talbert Avenue  designated for a lighted complex of youth baseball, soccer and football fields.  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: How the foot-soldiers are faring in the trenches IF LABOUR pulls up short of the number of seats it needs on Thursday it may regret not earmarking more resources for north-west England, a region containing the highest concentration of marginals outside London. In other critical regions - the Midlands and the capital itself - Mr Neil Kinnock's party appears to have outfought the Tories at grassroots level, maximising its chances of making critical gains. But in the seats around Liverpool and Manchester, it is the Conservatives who have had the edge. Although Labour - as elsewhere - has come out on top in the window-poster war, the Tories have assembled the slicker machine, the better local organisation and - after a slow start - the more copiously distributed leaflets and other promotional material. The Tories have also performed well in the relatively low-key campaign being fought in the south-west, where their position as the party with the bulk of the seats meant that they entered the fray with well-equipped offices and full-time agents in the vast majority of constituencies. In Scotland it is the Scottish National party which has most impressed, with the best efforts of its rivals confined to marginals. Although it has fewer public-relations professionals, the SNP has appeared to campaign more efficiently and enthusiastically than the other leading parties, perhaps because its resources are concentrated in one region and its tactics do not have to be co-ordinated with headquarters in London. The Tories and Labour alike have proved slovenly in safe seats. Far fewer Conservative volunteers have come forward in Labour strongholds than in previous elections, sapping morale and reducing the party to mailing leaflets instead of knocking on doors. Throughout the country, the Liberal Democrats have concentrated their limited firepower on seats which they have a real prospect of winning or face a fight to hold. In these, the party has supplemented its traditional strength on the ground with the application of computer technology. It has few resources to lavish on constituencies where it is not in the frame. The rigour of its targeting is reflected in the party's organisation in the north-east, where there are few seats on its target list and Mrs Frances Foote Wood, an unpaid regional secretary turned campaign organiser, is putting in a gruelling succession of 20-hour days from her County Durham home. The successful Labour campaigns in London and the Midlands have at least two important characteristics in common. First, both were exceptionally quick off the mark. While the Conservatives set about organising their leaflets and posters after the starting pistol had been fired, Labour was one step ahead - its leaflets printed, its posters ready for display. Second, both have exploited the computer and communications technology at their disposal to maximum effect. The El-Pak software package, developed by the boffins at Walworth Road, has helped constituency officers to get the most out of their growing battery of machines. Computers have proved particularly helpful in processing canvass returns and swiftly churning out supplementary leaflets and circulars. Labour's London campaign has also been noteworthy for the unprecedented degree of central co-ordination. Operating from premises at the seedier end of Islington, the well-staffed regional office has concentrated resources singlemindedly on the 30 or so most marginal of the capital's 84 constituencies. Under complex 'twinning' arrangements, helpers from safe seats have been channelled into marginals where their efforts are most needed. The sense of common purpose appears to have been strong enough to prevent complaints from those left out in the cold as a result; team spirit has been fostered since last spring by summoning the agents of marginal constituencies to bi-weekly meetings and occasional residential weekends. These tactics have received short shrift from Conservative Central Office, which argues that Labour has conceded defeat in London by admitting there are 'vast swathes' of the capital that it cannot win. However, if Labour picks up the bulk of those seats it has targeted, it may force a rethink of Tory strategy - to plug away doggedly in all constituencies - for future contests. In the Midlands, aspects of the Conservative campaign have appeared surprisingly inept, as if three terms of continuous power had bred complacency in the party's constituency offices. For the most part, the battle is being fought much as it was in the previous three elections. Computers are not widely used and morale appears low. Party workers have been perturbed that daily themes put out by Central Office bear little relation to the concerns of voters as expressed to candidates on the ground. In some Tory-held constituencies, the quality of campaign leaflets has been amateurish compared with the efforts of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Surprising too has been the scruffiness of some Conservative candidates on the hustings when set against the sharp image of their Labour opponents. Contrast this with the position in the key marginals in the north-west of England, where the Tories seem more generously funded than their main rivals, and to be better off in terms of premises, computers, faxes and telephone lines. Highly marginal Tory-held Wallasey provides perhaps the starkest contrast in the preparation of the two leading parties. Here, while the Conservatives devoted the weeks before the campaign to compiling invaluable computerised canvass returns, Labour was held back at the start by difficulties in selecting a candidate. In spite of this, recent polls have indicated that Labour is on course to secure the small swing needed to take the seat. In the north-west, as elsewhere, the most effective teams from all the parties are aiming for a complete canvass of marginals. The very best then go for a secondary canvass, targeting undecideds and homes that were missed the first time. The true significance of such details will become clear only on Thursday. On the evidence of the polls, few voters have been persuaded to alter their views during the campaign. But, given the closeness of the election, the effectiveness of local campaigning may prove decisive. Both Labour and the Conservatives may live to regret their shortcomings in some of the marginals.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Dutch paper group falls 10% BUHRMANN-Tetterode, the Dutch graphic paper, office supplies and packaging group, said net profit fell by 10 per cent in the 1991 first quarter. It cautioned that the trend in profits was not expected to show an improvement later in the year. The company, which does not publish specific first-quarter figures for profit or sales, said the decline in early 1991 came despite a 10.7 per cent increase in turnover. The sales rise was due entirely to acquisitions made in 1990. The lack of organic growth meant Buhrmann-Tetterode was unable to offset increases in costs caused by inflation. In 1990, Buhrmann-Tetterode posted net profit of Fl 260.3m (Dollars 133.5m) on normal business operations, up 11.4 per cent on 1989.</p>

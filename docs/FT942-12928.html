			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo held to 9% growth Poor results from PepsiCo's drinks and restaurants divisions led to a slowdown in earnings growth from 12 per cent last year to 9 per cent in this year's first quarter, the company reported yesterday. Net income rose to Dollars 282.8m from Dollars 260.4m before a Dollars 55.3m charge for accounting changes, on turnover up 13 per cent at Dollars 5.73bn. Earnings per share, excluding accounting changes, were 9 per cent ahead at 35 cents. On the drinks side, world-wide revenues increased by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, but operating profits fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 177.1m. International growth in drinks profits was driven by strong concentrate volume, improved results in Spain and an initial shipment of Stolichnaya vodka to Grand Metropolitan under a new distribution agreement. Worldwide restaurant sales grew 14 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn, but this division saw a 14 per cent fall in operating profits to Dollars 125.3m. Pizza Hut suffered an 18 per cent decline, hit by lower profits in the US because of price competition and lower sales, while price competition and higher chicken costs cut Kentucky Fried Chicken profits 23 per cent. The best performance came from snack foods, where sales rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn and operating profits rose by 24 per cent to Dollars 270.5m. New products and strong volume growth in the US and overseas helped produce the gains.</p>

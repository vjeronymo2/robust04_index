			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Disadvantages of a Manchester games should also be evaluated Sir, I was pleased to note that Manchester's bid to stage the Olympics in the year 2000 has received such extensive and serious coverage by your paper. However, your survey (June 23), along with so much of the up-beat media coverage, may be creating a climate of optimism about the games that cannot be wholly justified. The technique used for arriving at the estimates of expenditure, income and employment is widely used but there can only be confidence in such estimates under the most rigorous conditions. It is unwise to assume that anything like the figures quoted will result. Most jobs will, of course, exist only during the pre-Olympic period and the Olympics itself. Of more significance is the long-term aspect of the games. Spending and jobs in construction are costs and are only a benefit if there is a 'pay-off'. At least two weeks of (hopefully) profitable activity will result from Olympic construction activity. After that, experience elsewhere suggests little can be guaranteed and indeed gives cause for pessimism. If it proves impossible to operate the sporting facilities profitably after the games then the operation will have been more cost than benefit, regardless of any short-term generation of spending and job creation. If the legacy is under-used, unprofitable facilities then the whole exercise will have been no more than short-term opportunism. The cost may, of course, be felt to be justified if there is significant inward investment in other industries and a long-term increase in tourism, though these are by no means certain and would be difficult to attribute directly to the Olympics anyway. Disadvantages of the games are rarely touched upon and need to be incorporated into an evaluation of the net impact of the games. It is incumbent upon the media to encourage moderation in expectations of the benefits of the games otherwise the claims will ultimately serve to create only disappointment among the people of Manchester and the north-west.

			<p>BFN     [Text] China intends to purchase more goods from Malaysia,  especially commodities such as processed palm oil and crude  petroleum as well as food products. China's State Planning  Commission Vice Chairman, Encik [Mr.] Gan Ziyu said China would  like to improve its imports from Malaysia because the momentum  for the economic growth of 9 percent in China is still high. He  told newsmen this after calling on Deputy Minister of  International Trade and Industry, Encik Chua Jui Meng in Kuala  Lumpur.    China is also interested to import the commodities and food  products through more direct trade with Malaysia. At the same  time, it plans to improve its exports of edible oils, textile  machinery, and fabrics to Malaysia.    Gan said China's exports to Malaysia in 1993 increased by 21  percent over the previous year while at the same time its  imports rose by 30 percent. Bilateral trade between Malaysia  and China grew by 500 percent between 1985 and 1993. Malaysia's  exports of commodities such as processed palm oil, crude  petroleum, natural rubber and cacao made up 78 percent of total  exports to China.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Coats/Tootal Shareholders in Coats Viyella and Tootal must be getting fed up. Their investments have badly underperformed in recent years and the market for UK textiles is as tough as anyone can remember. Yet far from knuckling down to sort out their problems, the two companies are bogged down in a bitter takeover battle which could become self destructive. That said, Coats' improved offer has been cleverly pitched, even if it is not exactly a knock-out blow. It still falls short of what Tootal believes it is worth on the basis of the sector's average multiple. But then the offer of shares and cash is not bad when you bear in mind that it represents 10 and a half times Tootal's own earnings forecast just two months into its financial year. No-one is saying that Tootal cannot meet that forecast, but there must be question marks over the 25 per cent tax charge in the longer term. The offer is also substantially in excess of net asset value, which will surely be noted by those who have suffered the successive disappointments of the last decade. There is a dilemma, though, even for those who decide that the price is right. There should be no earnings dilution in the combined group, but the balance sheet will end up looking stretched. A large goodwill write-off implies that gearing (counting the preference shares as debt) could be of the order of 75 per cent. That does not leave much room for manoeuvre if the upturn disappoints and the US dollar goes the wrong way.</p>

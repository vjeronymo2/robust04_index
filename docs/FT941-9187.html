			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: Use the system, win shelf space - Not all companies find the Japanese market daunting. Michiyo Nakamoto talks to two that have cracked it The failure of last weekend's trade talks in Washington will only confirm impressions that the Japanese market is a hard one for foreign companies to crack. Countless explanations, from the complexities of the Japanese distribution system to the peculiarities of Japanese corporate purchasing practices - which are often dictated by business ties rather than price - have been given. One US argument is that the Japanese somehow behave differently from people in other industrialised nations. But foreign success stories suggest that while the differences are real, the system does not necessarily work against foreign companies per se. On the contrary, success is often linked to a company's ability to use the system to its advantage. Warner-Lambert, the consumer products group, and Borden, which has a well-known ice cream brand in Japan, are two US examples. Warner-Lambert's Schick brand of razor blades has a 70 per cent share of Japan's market for wet shave products - as opposed to dry, electric shavers  -despite competition from two Japanese brands. It has been more successful in Japan than Gillette, which it lags in the US and many other markets. What helped Schick to build such a strong position? Ken Hill, marketing director of the consumer health products group at Warner-Lambert in Tokyo, points to a solid understanding of the country's distribution system, a focus on Japan as a priority market and aggressive marketing support. On the first point, Warner-Lambert was fortunate in its tie-up with Hattori Seiko, its Japanese distributor, through which it began selling Schick razor blades in Japan in 1960. Hattori Seiko handles all importation, warehousing, distribution. It also handled selling until last year when Warner-Lambert set up its own sales force. Understanding the complex distribution system with its layers of wholesalers, and having the patience to deal with it, are crucial in Japan because it is difficult to get products on to shelves by directly approaching the retailer. The system has considerable disadvantages. The number of wholesalers pushes the retail price up several times against that in the US and often a listing fee must be paid to ensure retailers make a profit. The system also complicates communication between manufacturer and retailer. 'It was almost like Hattori Seiko was considered the maker of Schick,' Hill says. Nevertheless the tie-up proved invaluable for Schick in dealing with the distribution system and motivating wholesalers and it got the company's products on to shelves. The second key to Warner-Lambert's success was its policy of positioning Japan as a priority market and introducing the latest technology there, in many cases earlier than its competitors. For example, Schick brought stainless steel blades to Japan when its Japanese competitors were still selling carbon blades. Strict attention was paid to packaging to ensure it would be acceptable in a country where presentation is important. But high-quality products and mindful distributors need to be supported with aggressive marketing, Hill says. Hiroya Yano, representative director, chairman and CEO of Borden Japan, agrees. His parent company's losses may be mounting in the US but the appearance of Borden's Lady Borden brand of ice creams in almost every supermarket in Japan is testimony to the company's success in that market. Like Warner-Lambert, Borden initially had a tie-up with a Japanese partner, Meiji Milk Products. The 20-year partnership ended in 1990 when the US company decided it needed a marketing and sales force that could respond quickly and flexibly in Japan's increasingly competitive ice cream market. It set up its own sales and marketing team and launched a strategy to sell its traditional Lady Borden brand ice creams at competitive prices and to position a new brand, Classy, in the premium ice cream category. While the decision to discount the traditional brand paid off, increasing the sales by about 30 per cent compared with a year ago, Borden's strategy was really tested with the introduction of the Classy brand, which is sold at convenience stores. Under Yano's direction, the company adopted an aggressive marketing strategy, using a popular and controversial actress in its advertising and making sure that it won over retailers and wholesalers to its plan even before the product was ready to go on shelves. 'There is an iron rule to success in Japan,' Yano says. High-quality products at affordable prices must be backed by a strong marketing plan. The ingredients to successful marketing, he says, are aggressive advertising and close co-operation with wholesalers and retailers. Intensive advertising, Japanese style, is essential not only to reach the consumer but also to convince the wholesaler and the retail buyers that it is worth carrying a specific product. In launching Classy, Borden hired actress Rie Miyazawa, who was in the news at the time because of a broken engagement with a famous sumo wrestler, at considerable expense. It also secured a substantial number of advertising slots in the media. The investment paid off. It made an impression on consumers and convinced wholesalers and retailers that Borden was serious about Classy, Yano says. The company had aimed for shelf space in 15,000 convenience stores but was able to secure space in 32,000. Securing shelf space is a particular challenge in Japan where each product is listed precisely, competition is stiff and aggressive retailers may drop products in three months, Yano says. Equally important is bringing wholesalers and retailers into the marketing plan early on. Months before Classy's launch, Yano visited convenience stores to talk to buyers. 'If you do that buyers give you advice, you develop a relationship and the shelf space is there before you ask for it,' he says.</p>

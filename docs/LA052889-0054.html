			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> Regarding Nikki Finke's article on Willie Bogan, this story casts a refreshing  glow on the idea of equality by focusing on Bogan's accomplishments and outlook  rather than his race. Perhaps a few students ditching class during the Los  Angeles teachers' strike will pick up the View section and learn from Bogan's  example. He is an inspiration to young people of all ethnic backgrounds.  Journalism is greatly enhanced by both the content and style of this piece.  </P> <P> SHARI EPSTEIN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH, EAST SHIVER -- BUT ALASKA WARMS UP  </P> <P> A cold air mass drove temperatures to record lows Sunday in 11 Southern and  Eastern states, while parts of normally frigid Alaska welcomed a virtual heat  wave.  </P> <P> The thermometer hit 54 at Yakutat, beginning what the National Weather Service  predicted would be several days of record-breaking high temperatures in  southern Alaska.  </P> <P> Record lows were recorded from Pennsylvania south to Apalachicola, Fla., where  the mercury dipped to 43. Elkins, W. Va., experienced a record low of 16  degrees, Sunday's frostiest temperature in the Lower 48 states.  </P> <P> Low temperature marks were also set in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, South  Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia and Mississippi. The weather service  blamed the unseasonable chill on a large dome of cold air centered over  Kentucky.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan's Rice Retailers  Association moved Wednesday [22 June] to virtually boycott Thai  rice which is unpopular among Japanese consumers.    The group submitted a petition to the Food Agency to allow  it  to buy Thai rice from wholesalers according to their needs,  agency sources said.    The Food Agency will decide on its attitude to the rice  retailer's petition after examining the rice sales situation in  June, an agency official said.    Thai rice is unpopular on the domestic market chiefly  because  its grain type is not suitable for traditional Japanese meals.    The sources quoted the head of the nationwide rice  retailers'  group as saying retailers have been piling up stocks of unsold  Thai rice and do not have any solution on how to reduce them.    Japan broke a longstanding rice import ban this year to make  up for supply shortages caused by a poor domestic harvest last  year due to a cool, rainy summer.    On Tuesday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister  Mutsuki Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a  total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be  concluded.    China was the biggest exporter with 1.07 million tons,  followed by Thailand with 753,000 tons, the United States with  537,000 tons and Australia with 183,000 tons.    The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and  directly  supervises imports and distribution, has instructed wholesalers  to sell domestic rice and foreign rice in a set at a certain  proportion.    In the case of Thai rice, the ratio was 20 percent a set  when  imported rice was put on market in March. The ratio was then  reduced to 10 percent in May.    However, according to retailers, consumers often leave Thai  rice at the shops even though they have paid for a whole set.    There have been resales of Thai rice on an unauthorized  market at lower prices -- often below 50 yen per kilogram, which  is cheaper than one quarter of the government-set price, the  retailers said.    There are even supermarkets offering Thai rice for free to  consumers, or groups of people planning to donate it to  countries with food shortages, they said.</p>

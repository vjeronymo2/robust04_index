			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Civil servants are urged to reject deal MORE than 1,000 civil servants could get pay rises of about 25 per cent under the terms of an offer made yesterday to middle-ranking staff. The NUCPS civil-service union said it would recommend that members reject the offer, worth 4.5 per cent on the pay bill. A significant minority of staff would receive only the 4.1 per cent cost-of-living element. Most would receive around 4.4 per cent, including performance-related pay. The substantial rises for 1,000 civil servants - all executive officers at the bottom of their grades, earning between Pounds 7,854 and Pounds 8,180 - include compensation for loss of annual increases guaranteed under the current pay structure. The union will debate whether to call for an industrial action ballot, including strikes, at its conference on May 12.</p>

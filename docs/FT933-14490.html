			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Good try, but could do better: Can Tecs shift their strategy from skills training to economic regeneration? The chief executive of the Training and Enterprise Council looked pensive as she listened to a succession of government ministers last week spelling out what they expected Tecs to deliver. It was a long list: what part, for example, could Tecs play in improving educational standards? How should they transform the skills of the workforce, or help companies to improve their competitiveness? 'We have only existed for three years and we are getting better all the time,' said Mrs Olivia Grant, chief executive of Tyneside Tec. 'It is not that we are not eager and willing to do more - but it is a hell of a task they are asking of us.' The event was the third annual conference, in Birmingham, of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales. It was attended by more than a thousand Tec directors and a drove of ministers. Mr John Major, the prime minister, then in Tokyo, sent a video message. Tecs were set up in 1991 as the government's main response to mounting anxiety about the UK's industrial competitiveness and the inadequate skills of its workforce. They represent the government's most radical experiment in public-private partnership. Funding for the Tecs, whose boards are dominated by senior business executives, will be Pounds 2.3bn this year. Their brief at inception was to run government programmes for the unemployed more efficiently (any efficiency savings can be used to re-invest in local projects), and to become involved in their local economies. They would assess and address local skills needs and set priorities for economic development with other agencies such as local authorities. The idea was to help bolster the wider economy by tackling skills and enterprise issues at local level. That was the mission. Government league tables, to be released next week, will show that a growing number of Tecs are having a small, but significant impact on what have long been seen as deep structural problems in the British education and training systems. The tables will show that Tecs - albeit with widely differing performances - are getting better at placing young people in training schemes, where they are gaining better qualifications than in the past; they are equipping more unemployed adults with vocational qualifications; and they are encouraging more companies to train workers to match their business requirements. But there have been frustrations for the Tecs. The government, their main customer, concerned at rising unemployment, has forced them to concentrate most of their efforts on improving the two main training programmes for young people and the adult unemployed. This meant they were unable to tackle effectively the broader part of the brief - promoting enterprise. But last week at the Tec conference the government reaffirmed its original mandate to Tecs - much to their delight. Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, made it explicit that he wanted them to live up to all of their name. 'I want the enterprise objectives of Tecs to come to the fore,' said Mr Hunt, who has told his civil servants that the employment department is an economic - as distinct from a social welfare - department. The Tecs should do this by building on what they had already achieved in local enterprise projects and skills training. For the past 18 months or so there has been a mounting campaign among the 1,000-odd Tecs directors about their enterprise role - that part of the brief that persuaded business leaders such as Sir Alistair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel, to join Tec boards. Their argument is simple: it is no good concentrating on training unemployed people for jobs when there are so few jobs to go round. Thus the balance of the Tecs' work should logically shift from training to enterprise: this would embrace initiatives from promoting inward investment to setting up soft loans for companies. The Tecs are aware this part of task will be tough. 'Enterprise is a difficult word,' said Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of Tec chairmen which represents common Tec concerns to the government. 'It means lots of different things, from supporting businesses small and large, to the whole of economic regeneration. Tecs must also be part of and party to setting local economic strategies.' Mr Michael Hanson, chief executive of South Thames Tec, said: 'If you took everything that was said at the conference by both the government and Tecs you would think we were the salvation of the nation.' The government must help, said Mr Hanson, by first putting its own house in order. Government departments had to have clear and co-ordinated objectives and relationships with Tecs. Further, Tecs want greater clarity about the way they fit in with other government schemes, such as the new Urban Regeneration Agency, set up to try to improve the use of derelict land. Mr Hanson said: 'We are important but we can only be one of a number of contributors to a larger effort. There are no magic buttons. But the government must play an active part. It could for example help us persuade our prospective partners that being involved with us is worthwhile.' There is further support for the importance of the government's co-ordinating role in a study by Mr Bob Bennett, senior lecturer in geography at the London School of Economics, to be published this autumn. Mr Bennett points to the Tecs' new 'one-stop shops' as one of their most successful business advice projects. The brainchild of Mr Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry, these pull together under one roof a wide spectrum of business aid agencies, including Tecs, chambers of commerce and local enterprise agencies. However, Mr Bennett says the Tecs' record of promoting enterprise and economic development is patchy. A big problem, according to Mr Bennett - a strong advocate of Tecs merging with chambers of commerce - is the government's current weighting of Tec budgets towards train-ing. Tecs made clear to Mr Hunt last week they wanted the balance of funding to be reviewed, and they presented him with a list of demands to promote enterprise, including tax relief for companies pursuing best training practice, and more flexibility in their own budgets to plug skills gaps and encourage local employment. Funding is critical to their progress, but Tecs are showing they are able to work as effective local catalysts. They have the remit to bring organisations together, and to identify areas where they can best make a contribution. Examples of Tecs working along these lines include: Lincolnshire Tec, which is working in partnership with its county and district councils on inward investment. They have jointly set up a free-phone service for inquiries from potential investors. The Tec can also offer investors training tailored to their needs. Northumberland Tec identified a need for low-cost loans to local business. It helped set up new venture capital arrangements with local banks. Leeds Tec identified a need for more cost-effective training among local printing companies. The Tec brought together a group of companies and contributed to the cost of training equipment to be used jointly. Such collaboration is rare among competing companies. Mr Hunt believes that is 'just the sort of catalysts Tecs can be'. But does it add up to a strategy? Mr Richard Guy, chief executive of South and East Cheshire Tec, said: 'Each Tec has a different local plan but generally they are around the broad themes of helping individual businesses to start up and grow, improve their skills base and promote inward investment along with other partners. 'That is set down as a local strategy. But, if you added them all together, that adds up to an industrial strategy.' But Tecs need the government's help to turn that into a national strategy, engaging all its departments in a common cause. As Britain emerges from recession, the urgency and scale of the task still facing the Tecs and government is underlined by a recent study by the International Institute of Management Development of the extent to which education and training in 22 developed countries was meeting the needs of a competitive economy: the UK ranked 20th.</p>

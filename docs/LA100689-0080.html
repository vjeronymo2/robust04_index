			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YALE, SWARTHMORE RANKED NO. 1 BY NEWS MAGAZINE  </P> <P> Yale University and Swarthmore College were named America's best undergraduate  schools for the second straight year, according to U.S. News and World Report  rankings released Thursday.  </P> <P> Yale was tabbed as best national university in the third annual assessment by  the magazine, followed by Princeton, Harvard, Caltech, Duke and Stanford.  Swarthmore won honors as best national liberal arts college, ahead of Amherst,  Williams, Pomona, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley.  </P> <P> Interestingly, the top schools were the alma maters of the 1988 presidential  candidates -- George Bush graduated from Yale and Michael Dukakis received his  undergraduate degree from Swarthmore.  </P> <P> In new categories, Harvey Mudd College, which along with Pomona College is part  of the Claremont Colleges, was tabbed as the best school specializing in  engineering and Babson College in Massachusetts won honors as the best business  speciality school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UC System  </P> <P> In the national university category, the UC system did well. UC Berkeley was  ranked 13th and UCLA 16th. Plus, UC San Diego was included in a list of  "up-and-coming" schools selected by college presidents and administrators,  along with Arizona State, Carnegie-Mellon, Emory, Rutgers and the University of  Arizona.  </P> <P> San Diego State was named as one of the rising regional colleges and  universities in the West, as were University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Western  Washington University.  </P> <P> The schools were ranked on the basis of five categories: quality of student  body -- based on SAT scores and the ratio of students accepted to total  applicants, faculty quality, academic reputation, financial resources and  ability to retain and graduate students.  </P> <P> The magazine said it used statistical measures for each category except  academic reputation, which was determined by polling college presidents, deans  of academic affairs and deans of admissions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regional Colleges  </P> <P> The best regional university or college in the West was Trinity in Texas, the  poll said, followed by University of Redlands, Santa Clara University, Loyola  Marymount University in Los Angeles, University of San Diego, San Francisco  State, Whittier College, University of Puget Sound, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,  University of the Pacific in Stockton, University of Portland, Humboldt State,  Cal State Fresno, Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., and Cal State  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Topping the list for best regional liberal arts colleges were Southwestern  University in Texas, Evergreen State College in Washington, Pacific University  in Oregon, Mt. St. Mary's College in Los Angeles and Texas Lutheran College.  </P> <P> Among the 204 national universities, Yale won top honors even though it did not  finish first in any of the five specific categories.  </P> <P> Harvard came in first for academic reputation and student selectivity, while  Brown won top honors for student retention, Caltech for faculty quality and  Princeton for financial resources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TOP 25  </P> <P>  U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the schools based on quality of student  body and faculty, financial resources, ability to retain and to graduate  students and reputation for academic excellence. Statistical measures and a  survey of college leaders were used in determining the rankings.  </P> <P> RANK AND SCHOOL  </P> <P> 1. Yale Univ. (Conn.)  </P> <P> 2. Princeton Univ. (N.J.)  </P> <P> 3.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greece is doing a lot more than it makes public on  the Skopje issue, and this is a basic principle of its foreign  policy. This statement was made today in Thessaloniki by  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos. Asked to comment on  information regarding the increased U.S. presence in Skopje,  Venizelos said:    [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I do not want to comment on  this possibility. I would instead like to remind you of the  government's basic statement of last Friday [11 February]: that  there are limits to Greece's patience in awaiting practical  indications that Skopje has accepted its conditions, and these  limits are being reached. No one should underestimate this  message, which has many addressees.    [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any  conciliatory signs from Skopje since the government's statement?    [Venizelos] There was a letter from [Macedonian President  Kiro] Gligorov to U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday --  Thursday night -- which had provocative contents for Greece.    [Correspondent] And the dialogue?    [Venizelos] The dialogue will depend on practical signs of  Skopje accepting Greece's conditions. I repeat that Greece can  only participate in a dialogue following specific and practical  signs that Skopje has accepted its conditions. This position  remains absolutely and firmly in effect.

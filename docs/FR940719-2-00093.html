The period of Federal support should not exceed 3 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory General Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended for approval by the peer review group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposed notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 29, 1993 at 58 FR 50943. Two comments were received prior to the end of the comment period. The comments will be discussed below. Comments on issues that were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent suggested that ``significant increase in the rate'' should be defined as a 25 percent increase rather than a 50 percent increase as was proposed, because a large program would have a difficult time showing a 50 percent increase. The definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' will remain at 50 percent because a program is required to meet only one of the two criteria in the statutory preference in order to receive the funding preference. If a large program can demonstrate that 30 percent of the graduates have been placed in medically underserved communities (``high rate''), the application can receive the funding preference without any increase in the rate of placing students in medically underserved communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respondent also recommended deletion of the requirement that 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year should be working in these settings to receive the preference based on ``significant increase in the rate,'' because the statute does not require this provision. The 15 percent requirement is intended to emphasize provision of substantial care in medically underserved communities and will be retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed and are presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 30 percent of graduates in academic year 1991&hyph;92 or academic year 1992&hyph;93, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If additional programmatic information is needed, please contact:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Thomas P.

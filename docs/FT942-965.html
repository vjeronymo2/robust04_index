			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Fine food in an awkward shape - Eating Out Hilaire, London SW7, currently embodies a lot of what is good and a little of what is awkward about London restaurants today. The good stems directly from Bryan Webb, an extremely talented Welsh chef, and his enthusiastic young staff. This is obvious from a quick glance at the menu. The tempting list for lunch (Pounds 12.50 for two courses) included choriso and chick pea broth, char-grilled tuna with French beans and black olives or a pigeon breast with wild mushrooms as first courses. Breast of free-range chicken with potato pancake and tarragon, grilled fillets of Dover sole with a beurre blanc and braised pork cheeks with mashed potato were three of the nine main courses on offer. Dinner is more expensive. Three such intricate dishes as griddled scallops with a vegetable relish, a rib eye of beef with shallot and tarragon butter and a white and dark chocolate terrine may add up to over Pounds 30. Hilaire has managed to stay busy in the evenings with a keenly priced four course fixed menu at Pounds 25.50 and, after 9.30 in the evening, a two course post-theatre supper menu at Pounds 16 (the Albert Hall is within walking distance). The wine list is well chosen, fairly priced and includes three pages of half bottles. When Hilaire does disappoint it is entirely due to its physical structure. Many London restaurants do not have the advantage, like their counterparts in New York or Paris, of being situated on the ground floor of buildings along wide boulevards or avenues. Instead they are in narrow buildings, former townhouses, with small frontages (Hilaire's is only 4 metres wide but it can seat 50). Tables are of necessity quite close together and kitchens are situated on a different floor. At Hilaire try to book for the ground floor but not too close to the door if there is a strong wind blowing. Downstairs can be claustrophic with two tables in what were coal holes - but it is a particularly useful size for a small corporate dinner party. Webb's cooking is equally impressive on either floor. Hilaire, 68, Old Brompton Road, London SW7 3LQ, tel 071 584 8993. Open Mon-Fri for lunch and dinner, Saturday dinner. Nearest Tube South Kensington. Opposite Christie's, South Kensington and close to the Victoria and Albert, National History and Science Museums.</p>

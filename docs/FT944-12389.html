			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Economic watch: Finnish unemployment rises Finnish unemployment rose to 17.7 per cent in September from 17.1 per cent in August, breaking a downward trend which has seen joblessness fall from a peak of more than 20 per cent at the start of the year. The figures confirm the recovery in the economy after three years of recession, but emphasise the gulf between the booming export sector and the still sluggish domestic economy. Industrial employment is rising, but the situation has yet to improve in the retail, construction and service sectors. Finland has experienced one of Europe's worst unemployment crises because of the loss of vital trade with the former Soviet Union, the bursting of a huge 1980s credit boom and international recession. However, the situation has helped to keep the lid on inflation. The Bank of Finland said yesterday there were no signs that core inflation would be above the target level of 2 per cent, but uncertainties, including autumn pay talks, meant no easing of monetary policy was possible. Denmark's current account surplus for July fell very slightly to DKr2.60bn (Pounds 271m) compared with a surplus of DKr2.56bn a year earlier. In August, the current account surplus also declined slightly to DKr4.1bn from DKR4.3bn for the same month last year. Romanian industrial output in September rose 2.8 per cent after falling 1.4 per cent in August. It rose 6.0 per cent year-on-year.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Clarke nudges interest rates The change in UK base rate announced by the Bank of England yesterday came as a surprise, the surprise being not so much the fact of a cut, as its small size. This was the first quarter-point cut since April 1985. What does such fine-tuning of interest rates mean and does it make any sense? The justification for the small change in the base rate of interest was provided by the Bank's inflation report, published - not coincidentally - on the day the cut was announced. It has three main messages: first, inflation has turned out significantly lower than forecast last November, partly because of large reductions in food prices; second, underlying inflation is projected to stabilise at about 2-3 per cent from the middle of this year, well below the forecasts made last November; but, third, 'the risks to the central projection for inflation are asymmetric - a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a further fall'. If lower-than-expected inflation was thought to justify yesterday's reduction in base rates, the relatively high risk of an unfavourable future outcome justified only a small one. In response, the authorities decided to do something, but not much. With base rates down to levels last seen very briefly in 1977, the chancellor also argues that 'it is right to reduce the magnitude of interest rate changes'. Yesterday's quarter-point reduction is, for example, proportionately equivalent to a half-point cut with base rates at 11 per cent. It will also generate a reduction of some 10 per cent in the short-term real rate of interest. While small, therefore, the cut is not absurdly small. For all that, the move is mainly symbolic. The authorities have decided to adopt the monetary policy equivalent of the lifting of the governor's eye-brows. Mr Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve demonstrated only last Friday the effectiveness of an intrinsically trivial change in interest rates, at least when it comes from a respected institution and signals the turn in the interest rate cycle. But what does this particular change symbolise? One part of the answer is that Mr Kenneth Clarke is fairly content with the economy's likely performance. Another part is that the authorities believe they can fine-tune monetary policy in response to emerging news about both inflation and economic activity. The criticism of the fine-tuning is that it assumes an implausible amount of knowledge. The criticism of what Mr Clarke calls prudence is more serious. It is that this is just another word for complacency. The Bank's inflation report shows that employees' expectations of inflation have been running considerably above actual inflation and wage settlements. This means that they have been forced by high unemployment to accept lower than desired wage increases. Since unemployment remains high, pay inflation may fall further. Moreover, retail price inflation is forecast by the Bank to turn out lower than employees expect, even with the tax increases in the pipeline. The economy may also slow. As the report points out, if real disposable income were to stagnate over the next two years, a growth rate of 2 1/2 per cent a year in real consumption would require a decline in the personal savings ratio to 6 per cent, a level last seen in 1988. Given the tax increases in prospect, such stagnation in real disposable incomes is conceivable. How likely then is the steep decline in the savings rate, particularly given the still exceptionally high ratios of personal debt to income? In short, the Bank could still be too pessimistic on inflation, which might fall faster than forecast, partly because of current capacity under-utilisation and partly because of slow growth in demand. If so, the chancellor may find himself making several of these quarter-point cuts. Politically, this would give him more days on which to announce good news. Economically, such fine-tuning has little to recommend it. But provided the chancellor responds swiftly to developments, it need not do much harm either.</p>

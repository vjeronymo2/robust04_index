This was the assurance given by MNLF  Chairman Nur Misuari to Senator Santanina Rasul during their  dialogue earlier.    The apprehension that the term of office of ARMM officials  would be affected stemmed from Misuari's call for the  establishment of a provisional government in Mindanao. ARMM  officials, headed by the regional governor, have a three-year  term of office.</p>

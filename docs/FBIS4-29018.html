			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States have shifted into top gear to conduct joint  intelligence surveillance of North Korean military activities,  sources at the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.    The allied forces took the action after determining that the  chances of an unexpected military provocation by North Korea are  high following its withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency, the sources said.    The United States is expected to increase the intensity of a  draft resolution on U.N. sanctions against North Korea.  Pyongyang has said it would regard the imposition of sanctions  as an act of war.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said last week that South  Korean and U.S. military forces have completed preparations for  three possible stages -- the beginning of sanctions, limited  North Korean provocations and an all-out war.    The intelligence surveillance operation would go into full  operation if and when sanctions were imposed, Yi said.    At present, the United States and South Korea have deployed  U-2R reconnaissance aircraft, E-3C early warning planes, KH-9  spy satellites and all other possible means to monitor North  Korean movements around the clock while thoroughly analyzing the  pictures and information gathered, the sources said.    Washington has already sent military analysts and  intelligence officials to South Korea to support the operation,  they added.    The South Korean military, meanwhile, is rechecking its  decision- making system in order to meet possible limited  provocations by North Korea, and strengthening the defense of  public and government buildings and facilities and military  command posts that could be targeted in a North Korean attack,  they said.</p>

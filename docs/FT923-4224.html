			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ASW dives into Pounds 2m loss and cuts interim by 33% PRESSURE FROM continental European steel producers forced ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group, into pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.1m and a 33 per cent dividend reduction in the first half. Its share price yesterday fell 2p to a new low of 60p. Mr Paul Rich, managing director, said operating margins had fallen by Pounds 30 per tonne in the last two years and were now at levels prevailing a decade ago, a situation that implied 'negative price inflation in spades. 'Producers' balance sheets are becoming worse and worse in Europe,' he said. 'I don't see how this can continue much longer. There are cash losses on other operations in Europe which may force the issue.' Losses in the six months ended June 30 turned round from a profit of Pounds 8.1m. Sales were down Pounds 15.7m at Pounds 190.5m. Losses per share came out at 4.2p (earnings 6.9p) and the interim dividend is cut from 4.5p to 3p. ASW is one of Europe's lowest cost steel producers and has been among a number of UK-based steel and steel casting companies lobbying for measures to cut overcapacity. During the period the group swung from a postion of net cash to net debt of Pounds 18m after acquisitions. Despite the losses the group said the ASW steel businesses remained profitable activities. Volumes had been maintained in flat markets. 'What we have to do is to return the margins,' said Mr Rich. 'Its ironical that we are saying if we can have 1982 margins we would be very happy indeed.'</p>

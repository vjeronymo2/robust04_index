			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GMF offers Fnac stake options THE future of Fnac became clearer yesterday when GMF, the French insurance company said Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the water and energy group, would be granted an option to buy a controlling stake in the French retailer. Credit Lyonnais and Compagnie Generale des Eaux have the option, until October 11, to acquire 54.78 per cent of the shares in Fnac at FFr2,928 per share. This values Fnac at FFr2.4bn (Dollars 444m). Fnac's shares, which have climbed sharply from a level of about FFr2,200 two weeks ago, were suspended yesterday at FFr3,208. Analysts in Paris said that the deal was a financial transaction to provide capital for GMF, a mutual insurance company, and to maintain French ownership of Fnac. They said that the October deadline gave GMF the opportunity to find alternative sources of capital and maintain control of the group. GMF has been seeking fresh capital as a result of losses in a property venture in the Dutch Antilles and in its travel insurance business. Pressure on GMF to sell part or all of its 80 per cent stake in Fnac has prompted interest from several European retailing groups, including Berthelsmann of Germany and Printemps of France. 'Fnac is a attractive asset,' said Mr Anthony West, retail analyst at Enskilda Research in Paris. 'It has had a chequered history in terms of ownership, but has a strong position in urban retailing and is a dominant force in the French records and books market.' Fnac reported sales of about FFr6.96bn in the first three-quarters of its financial year, an increase of 7.9 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Net profits for the year to the end of August are expected to increase by about 11 per cent to FFr92m. Credit Lyonnais has acquired the option to buy the majority of the 54.8 per cent of the shares through Altus, a financial subsidiary. Compagnie Generale des Eaux is taking the option to buy the shares through Immobiliere Phoenix, a property subsidiary. French takeover law states that if the two companies take up their options to buy the controlling stake in Fnac, they must extend the offer to minority shareholders in the company.</p>

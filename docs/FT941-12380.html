			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Local government reorganisation in England The first plans for local government reorganisation in England will reach parliament next month, at the start of a process which will last into next year, John Authers writes. Mr Michael Heseltine, as environment secretary, devised the review system to ensure a consensus for all proposals. But it also provides opponents with frequent opportunities to block reforms. Mr John Gummer, the current environment secretary, cannot present any restructuring plans to parliament unless they have first been recommended by the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham. Sir John's review is working on a county-by-county basis and has so far presented formal plans for only 10 counties. The remainder do not have to be completed until the end of this year. Mr Gummer then has limited powers to amend plans by altering boundaries, but if he wishes to make more drastic alterations, such as changing the total number of councils, he must send the proposals back to Sir John. Once Mr Gummer has approved a plan, orders for each county must go before parliament to be debated and approved by both houses. If any are voted down, the status quo will continue for them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Won] </F>   [Text] American-Based Chinese poet Bei Ling arrived in  Hong Kong last night after having been allegedly forced by  Shenzhen police to go through a designated exit checkpoint.    Bei, 34, who had been subjected to daily interrogations by  Shenzhen security from Saturday to Tuesday for publishing an  "illegal journal", originally wanted to leave the special  economic zone through the Huanggang border checkpoint.    However, Chinese immigration officials at Huanggang, which  is  one of only a few exit points commonly used by foreigners, held  him up for 1 1/2 hours before "suggesting" that he use the Lowu  exit.    Bei, a green card-holder who has been resident in the United  States since late 1988, was suspected by State Security of  liaising with pro-democracy activists since his return to China  last December. One thousand copies of the magazine he founded,  Tendency Quarterly, which were printed in Shenzhen had been  seized by the, authorities.    From 5 pm to 6.30 pm at Huanggang, official used several  reasons to stop him leaving, he said. "I showed them  [officials] my air tickets back to the States, but they claimed  there was something wrong with them.    "They also suggested Hong Kong officials on the other side  might not let me in."    After repeated arguments, one officer left the immigration  counter and made a phone call, after which he suggested that Bei  use the Lowu checkpoint.    At the immigration counter at Lowu, Bei said the officer had  prolonged the processing by making numerous checks in his  computer and putting down his particulars by hand. The poet  claimed his picture was also taken. The immigration official  then took a look at the clock on the wall and then waved him  past.    "I suspect they [Shenzhen security] wanted me to leave  through Lowu because they have the personnel and equipment there  to make the proper recording," Bei said.    It was almost 8 pm when he arrived in Hong Kong.    After boarding a Kowloon-bound train, Bei said: "I'm really  tired but I feel very peaceful here.    "I don't understand why the Chinese Government gave me so  much trouble this time," he said. "My magazine is just about  culture and literature, not politics."    Although he encountered a lot of trouble on his first trip  back to China. Bei said he hoped he could return some day.    Bei will stay in Hong Kong until the end of this month, when  he will go to Taiwan to promote the magazine before returning to  the U.S.</p>

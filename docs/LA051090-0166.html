			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EYE PROBLEMS CLOUD PRYOR'S COMEBACK;  </P> <P> BOXING: WISCONSIN AGREES TO SANCTION BOUT EVEN THOUGH FORMER CHAMPION HAS  UNDERGONE SURGERY FOR A DETACHED RETINA AND HAS CATARACTS IN HIS LEFT EYE.  </P> <P> Former junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor, his career shadowed by serious  eye and drug problems, said Wednesday he has no fear of losing his sight if he  returns to the ring next week to fight Daryl Jones.  </P> <P> But boxing officials in states which had refused Pryor a license because he had  undergone surgery for a detached retina and has cataracts clouding his left eye  criticized Wisconsin's decision to let him fight.  </P> <P> "In Pryor's case, if you go into the ring with one eye, you'd better be  prepared to get a guide dog," said Don Muse, assistant executive director of  the California State Athletic Commission.  </P> <P> "We won't even let fighters fight here with detached retinas. Not too long ago,  we blocked an exhibition bout by Sugar Ray Leonard at a shopping center because  he had a detached retina."  </P> <P> But Pryor, a junior welterweight champion from 1980-85 before his career was  scuttled by drug problems, said he proved in a December exhibition against  former Olympian Howard Davis that he is ready to return to the ring.  </P> <P> "Howard Davis has the fastest hands in boxing. It proved that I can see and I'm  ready to fight," said Pryor, who had planned to face Hector Comacho in Las  Vegas for a much larger payday.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed I got turned down in Vegas," said Pryor, who hasn't fought  since beating Herminio Morales with a third-round knockout in December of 1988.  "Wisconsin spelled out the difference between a fighter having a handicap and  being disabled. I think Vegas should take that into consideration."  </P> <P> Randy Gordon, chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, said he would  start sending faxes to Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson to stop the fight that is  scheduled for May 16 at the Masonic Temple in Madison. Pryor is under  suspension in New York until he passes an eye test.  </P> <P> "Without sounding hysterical, I believe that we the commission and the media  almost have to appeal to the governor of Wisconsin for a stay of execution for  Aaron Pryor," Gordon said.  </P> <P> "This is bad for boxing and bad for the state of Wisconsin," said Dr. James  Nave, chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission which voted 4-1 last  month not to allow Pryor to box in that state. "We spent a tremendous amount of  time researching this case and I don't think Wisconsin looked at what we  researched before coming to our decision."  </P> <P> The Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing granted Pryor a license  after he signed a statement that he understood the risks, and he absolved the  state of any liability if he's hurt.  </P> <P> The state of Wisconsin considers his cataracts a condition of handicap rather  than a medical condition, and the state has strict laws against discrimination  against the handicapped. Pryor underwent testing by a physician and an  ophthamologist in Wisconsin before getting approval on Monday to box.  </P> <P> Marlene Cummings, secretary of regulation licensing, said Wednesday that Dr.  Suresh Chandra, a Madison ophthamologist, examined Pryor and reported that  "there is some impairment."  </P> <P> "But he is not legally blind. He said the choice should be Aaron's and it was  his choice to make," Cummings said Wednesday. "We've followed Dr. Chandra's  advice.  </P> <P> "Wisconsin has a pretty strong anti-discrimination law. He clearly has a  disability. Some people say you must protect some people from themselves. I've  seen him spar, jump rope and shoot baskets. Our concern was that if he took the  risk, he'd be aware of the risk. Dr. Chandra talked with him for two hours  about it."  </P> <P> But Gordon said Cummings wasn't qualified to determine if Pryor can box.  </P> <P> "She doesn't know a left hook from a fish hook. And she went out to the gym and  took a look at him and saw him spar. Is that cause enough to give a man who is  under medical suspension a license?"  </P> <P> Pryor said the detached retina and cataracts were in the left eye and that his  right eye was 20-20.  </P> <P> "I had my doctor and five other doctors say they are good to fight," Pryor  said. "I'm fighting this for $4,000 or $5,000 and I could have signed against  Camacho for half a million dollars. I have been preparing for Camacho for five  months.  </P> <P> "I think there are some political things involved."  </P> <P> Last January, Pryor filed a motion in Hamilton County Municipal Court in  Cincinnati saying he should receive treatment for drug dependency rather than a  conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia.  </P> <P> He was arrested last September in Cincinnati by police who said they found a  pipe that could be used to smoke crack cocaine in Pryor's car.  </P> <P> Pryor said Wednesday he is a drug free and completed a month-long  rehabilitation program in February.  </P> <P> "I'm in decent shape but my nerves are bad because people are trying to tell me  what to do," he said.  </P> <P> Pryor (37-1) won the WBA junior welterweight title in 1980, knocking out  Antonio Cervantes. He defended his title seven times, twice beating Alexis  Arguello.  </P> <P> There is controversy over Jones' record. One boxing service lists it at 13-12,  while matchmaker Stan Johnson says it is 26-7.  </P></p>

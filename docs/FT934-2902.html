			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / China doubts hit Hong Kong credit rating Hong Kong's most prestigious borrower, the Mass Transit Railway Corp (MTRC), yesterday had its credit rating cut because of concerns over political stability in China and their possible impact on the colony. The decision by Moody's Investor Service to cut the MTRC's rating to A1 from Aa2 drew swift criticism from the corporation and its sole shareholder, the Hong Kong government. But the downgrading of the MTRC's debt, and the official publication of Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation, had little effect on stock market sentiment yesterday. Strong foreign buying pushed the Hang Seng Index to a record close of 10,228.11 - up 237.85, or 2.38 per cent, on the day. Chief among the complaints of the government was Moody's questioning of the robustness of the Hong Kong dollar's link with the dollar. Moody's said that China was likely to go through periods of political uncertainty in the future and this could affect political stability in Hong Kong. 'The Hong Kong dollar remains vulnerable to such political crises,' it said. In September 1983, in response to financial uncertainty caused by deteriorating Anglo-Chinese relations, the Hong Kong dollar was fixed at HKDollars 7.8 to USDollars 1. The government said the link had ensured currency stability for the past 10 years. During that time the Hong Kong dollar had withstood shocks induced by the 1987 crash in world share prices, the June 1989 Tiananmen 'event' in Beijing and the 1991 Gulf War. 'We have extremely strong backing for the Hong Kong currency, including (accumulated reserves) which stood at HKDollars 287bn at the end of 1992 - among the largest in the world,' the government said. Mr Roger Moss, MTRC finance director, said Moody's assessment was a misreading of the protections afforded to Hong Kong by the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. They give the MTRC's 'creditors considerable insulation from Chinese sovereign risk,' he said. At the end of June, the MTRC's outstanding debt amounted to HKDollars 18.8bn, against shareholders' funds of HKDollars 8.2bn.</p>

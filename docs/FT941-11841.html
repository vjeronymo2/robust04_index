			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: Big ears This one will be a real test for marketing ingenuity. Tore Haugen - a Norwegian forestry worker - is trying to wow visitors to the Lillehammer Winter Olympics by selling them ear-rings made from dried elk excrement. 'They're dark brown, oval-shaped and no two are alike,' he says. 'They don't smell at all.' He dries the droppings in a microwave; whacks on four coats of lacquer; fits a silver clasp; and charges Dollars 13. Haugen reckons they will be especially successful with people 'who come from countries where there are no elks'. Naturally, Tore, naturally.</p>

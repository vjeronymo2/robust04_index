			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are revising this final rule to state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that deficiencies are considered to be corrected when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey team revisit confirms that they have been corrected,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or when a facility provides evidence satisfactory to HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State survey agency, which can be verified without an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site visit, that the deficiencies have been corrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the revisit or before the credible evidence was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted. In addition, sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act allow for lifting the denial of payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions when the facility achieves substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. (Please see the discussion regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance under the comments pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.454 in this final rule, Duration of remedies.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters suggested that, instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denying payment for all new Medicare and/or Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions when warranted, we impose a ban on all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions to a facility, regardless of the source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment. They said that if we use this remedy, we should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pair it with a directed plan of correction requiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to take steps to restore capacity to provide a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of NF/SNF services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept this suggestion since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act does not give us the authority to regulate payments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be made to facilities by private paying residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters suggested that we add to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;488.217 (a)(2) and (b)(2) a sentence stating, ``No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive payments will be made when a ban on all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions is lifted.'' The rationale is that, if facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> know they will receive payments later, they may admit those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents they choose and thus cover the short term cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow problem. They say that this would lessen the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the sanction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree in principle, and, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification, we are revising the suggested sentence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state, at &sect;488.417(e), that no retroactive payments will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made for any new admissions to the facility for the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the date the remedy was imposed and the date that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State determines that the facility achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.417(a)(1)(i) be revised to state that HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State may impose a denial of payment for new admissions if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency remains uncorrected after 90 calendar days (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to within) of the last day of survey identifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency. As worded in the proposed rule, the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction would have been imposed if a deficiency had existed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at any time during the 90 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the intent of the comment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although we are no longer referring to 90 days but to 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months as the Act does, we are making this revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Please note that the proposed &sect;488.217(a)(1)(i) is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated as &sect;488.417(b)(1).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that HCFA deny payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all new admissions after the second consecutive survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which documents that substandard care is being provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rationale is that this would be more in keeping with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of remedies, that is, encouraging rapid compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the program requirements. Another commenter suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that denial of payment for new admissions be a mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy when there are widespread substandard quality of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations or when there is a pattern of substandard quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of care violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR  </P> <P> Bail was drastically reduced Monday for the mother of twin boys who allegedly  were abused and molested by her boyfriend and left abandoned at a hotel in Del  Mar.  </P> <P> Dorothy DeSimone, 25, will be sentenced June 19 for child endangerment, but her  attorney, Kirk Migdal, persuaded a judge to lower her bail from $100,000 to  $5,000.  </P> <P> Migdal said the higher bail was unwarranted because of a sentencing agreement  in which the district attorney's office will not be asking for a prison  sentence. The defense attorney promised that his client will show up for  sentencing if her bail was lowered to $2,000 or $5,000.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the preliminary hearing of co-defendant Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, of  Oceanside is set for June 16. McCoy has pleaded not guilty to charges that he  abused, molested and abandoned the boys, now 3, at the Del Mar Inn on March 25.  </P> <P> DeSimone was arrested March 28 when she showed up at Children's Hospital to  inquire about her children, who are now in a foster home.  </P></p>

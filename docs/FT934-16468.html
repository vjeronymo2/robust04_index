			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Daimler shares take a back seat to sports car AIDED by helicopters, fire trucks, jet engines and a prototype sports car, Daimler-Benz - Germany's biggest industrial group - made a splashy debut on the New York stock exchange yesterday. Amid a scrum of German and US television camera crews and journalists, Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler's managing board, pledged to boost US ownership of its stock to 10 per cent of the total. Currently, only 3 per cent is in US hands. Daimler is the first German company to obtain a full listing on US equity markets. In an important compromise earlier this year, it agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to produce its accounts according to US standards, paving the way for the listing. The NYSE has been trying for years to attract more foreign companies to its market, especially from Germany. Both Daimler and the exchange marked the debut in some style. Outside the NYSE's imposing entrance on Broad Street, Daimler products were on display - a BK117 'Whirly Angel' helicopter, a shiny red S-class convertible Mercedes, a Freightliner fire truck and models of Eurofighter jets, high-speed trains and Ariane space rockets. NYSE traders stopping for a cigarette break, office workers and tourists all took time to admire the goods. Star attraction was a sleek, metallic-blue prototype sports coupe. 'No drooling on the car please,' shouted one gruff-voiced trader. Back inside the exchange, Mr Reuter was explaining why Daimler was bringing its stock to New York. He pointed out that the group employs 13,000 people at its US operations, which generate 17 per cent of worldwide sales. Last week the Mercedes-Benz car division announced plans to build a plant in Alabama. Meanwhile, the shares - traded like most foreign stock on the NYSE as American Depositary Receipts (each ADR represents one-tenth of a Daimler share) - opened in a flurry at Dollars 47, but slipped back to Dollars 46-5/8. The people gawking at the Mercedes cars were oblivious, however. 'Let's go off in it, just you and me, baby,' said one man to his girlfriend as they stood over the red convertible. 'Nah,' she replied, 'I'm taking the helicopter.' Lex, Page 22; Kaufhof ADRs, Page 28</p>

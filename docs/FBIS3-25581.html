Linscott] </F>   [Text] Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of kwaZulu says  he is not dismayed by the prospect of losing office by staying  out of the April election. Interviewed at Ulundi, he said he  would continue the political struggle using his traditional  power base as chief adviser to King Goodwill Zwelithini.    "My leadership was not built up by the homelands policy.  I'll be part of the struggle -- my king, myself and my people."  He was not prepared to speculate as to tactics. But he said  the outlook was bleak.    The mood of people on the ground was ugly -- "I've never  known it like this before" -- and it could get worse and become  difficult to control. He said he was not responsible for  keeping the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] out of the election --  it had been forced on him by the Government and the ANC [African  National Congress], which refused to consider federation as an  option.    The logical next phase was the king's demand for the  restoration of the Zulu sovereignty of 1834. "When they  rejected the federal option and could not accept our amendments,  I was disarmed in my relationship with the King. There was  nothing I could say to him. I had not delivered on self-rule."    He said it was pointless to participate in elections for a  non-federal dispensation, something he had worked for for 20  years. The Buthelezi Commission and the kwaZulu/Natal Indaba  [meeting] had been rejected. And the IFP's contribution to  constitutional negotiations had been rejected. In 1910 the  whites were fooled. They were bluffed by Smuts that they were  going to get a federation, but in the end there was no  federation. We're not prepared to walk that road. I can  understand that whites are concerned at us staying out of  elections but they have to appreciate that for my people it is  nothing new. We never had the vote before. Nothing much has  changed.    "I don't know why the Government and the ANC reject  federalism. It is a democratic way to protect the interests of  regions and minorities. What's wrong with the system in  countries like the United States, Germany, Canada and Australia?"    He denied being a secessionist. "I refused to take  independence because although we went into Union kicking and  screaming, history has made us South Africans. We don't want to  be deprived of that."    The king's stand had been forced by events, he said. It was  now out of his own hands as chief minister. Asked whether it  was feasible for elections to be held in Natal/kwaZulu without  IFP participation, and whether a subsequent government could be  effective, Buthelezi declined to speculate. "That is their  problem, not mine."</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (15): Slow birth of a watchdog - Tighter share dealing rules are coming - and not before time FOREIGNERS who live in Germany often complain that there are too many rules, rules which prevent you walking across the road when you want, or going shopping after 2pm on Saturday afternoons, or playing records at lunchtimes or after 10pm at night. In the financial services sector, the complaint from foreign investors is paradoxically just the opposite - that there are not enough rules. In the German securities business, almost anything goes, a fact which Anglo-Americans used to highly regulated domestic financial markets tend to find disconcerting. This unteutonic state of rulelessness is set to change. Barring unforseen mishaps, the German parliament will next year ratify the so-called Second Financial Markets Enhancement Act, designed to fill the gaps in Germany's investor protection environment. As Horst Kohler, former state secretary in the German ministry of finance, acknowledged when he introduced the draft of the new law in January this year, the regulatory environment is not up to international standards, to the detriment of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial services centre. 'This is a breakthrough for Finanzplatz Germany's international competitive position,' he said at the time, 'and it should secure jobs and income in this fast-growing sector.' The most important provisions of the law are as follows: creation of a federal regulatory body for the securities industry. This Bundesamt fur das Wertpapierwesen will employ at least 100 people. The new body will be the German equivalent of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the powerful watchdog of the US securities markets. insider dealing will become a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment or heavy fines. Financiers claim insider dealing is no more prevalent in Germany than in the UK or the US, but a series of scandals has highlighted the lack of such a law in Germany. a set of new rules designed to encourage disclosure and transparency on the German equity markets. These include a requirement for all price sensitive information to be published without undue delay. Companies will have to notify the German SEC about such announcements so the new authority can decide whether the companies' shares should be suspended. Companies will be obliged to disclose share-stakes when they reach or cross 5, 10, 25, 50 or 75 per cent. At present notification is only required when a shareholding reaches or crosses 25 or 50 per cent. a set of rules of conduct for participants in the securities markets. This will define professionals' obligations to their clients. The new law stops short of introducing a Takeover Code - although leading bankers such as Rolf Breuer of the Deutsche Bank have started to call for this too - but it will mean major changes for Finanzplatz Germany. 'As soon as we in Germany really start to take the problem of insider dealing seriously,' commented Gerd Hausler, head of the Main Credit Department at the Bundesbank reflecting on the implications of the draft law soon after it was published, 'many German market players who are not acquainted with the standard 'rules of ethics' abroad will experience something of a culture shock, not least because of our extremely passive attitude over recent years.' In alluding to Germany's 'extremely passive attitude', Hausler put his finger on a puzzling issue: if reform is recognised as being so important, why does it take so long for it to be implemented? The draft law was first floated in January, 1992; it took another year before the draft appeared; it will not be enacted until the middle of next year; the German SEC is unlikely to be up and running until 1995. The lack of any sense of urgency is more pronounced in another, related area: the reform of Germany's stock-market structure. It took decades of squabbling between the country's eight regional exchanges before they could bury their mutual rivalries deep enough to create the Deutsche Borse - the German stock-exchange - at the beginning of the current year. The slow pace of change suggests Germany is not unhappy with its financial services sector, even if in some areas - for example regulation or market fragmentation - the Finanzplatz is behind international standards. This is understandable. The commercial banking sector - divided into private commercial banks, state-sector banks and co-operative banks - is thriving. Banks are weathering the current recession in Germany far better than their peers in other countries. Moreover, the Bundesbank's staunch defence of the value of the D-mark over decades has turned the national currency into the world's second largest reserve currency. The Bundesbank has repressed innovation in the German financial markets  - by blocking money-market funds, or holding out against derivatives or commercial paper until very recently - but this has been in the name of monetary stability. Many Germans feel that this has been a far greater asset for the country than a UK- or US-style financial services sector. Indeed, many Germans tend to assume that thriving, innovative financial markets - as in the UK or the US - go hand in hand with a weak economy. The fact that there are only 665 or so quoted companies in Germany, that the stock-market plays only a limited role in the country's economic life, is viewed as a structural strength rather than the opposite. For as long as Germany has had the most dynamic manufacturing economy in Europe, there has been little need to challenge this assumption. The current recession, coupled with the costs of reunification, has changed this: Germany's traditional capital account surplus has swung into a deficit and companies are realising that they will be competing with the cash-hungry state for capital throughout the 1990s. The source of capital at the margin is the foreign investor, whose needs have to be taken more seriously. Hence Germany has accepted the need for new securities market legislation.</p>

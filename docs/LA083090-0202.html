			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PARKS FIT ONLY FOR MOUNTAIN GOATS  </P> <P> It's hard to play baseball on a slope, but that hasn't mattered much when you  consider Orange County's pathetic approach to securing parklands from  developers. The Board of Supervisors has a regrettable record of allowing  developers to set aside unusable land for parks, or to pay fees that are far  less than needed to develop adequate recreation facilities.  </P> <P> While Orange County does have several large regional parks, many new  developments have been short-changed on neighborhood parks. For example,  recently incorporated Laguna Niguel has turned away dozens of Little League  players for lack of practice fields.  </P> <P> The problem is that flat, well-located land is also best for building houses.  And that's how the developers who are well-connected politically in Orange  County make their profits.  </P> <P> Under state law, cities and counties can require developers to donate parklands  in return for permission to build houses. Orange County's quota is 2.5 acres of  parkland per 1,000 new residents. Twenty-six of the county's 29 cities -- all  but Fountain Valley, Orange and Villa Park -- have similar requirements. But  county records show that, all too often, developers have been allowed to  satisfy quotas with brushland or steep slopes, or by paying in-lieu fees far  below what it costs to purchase parkland.  </P> <P> Over the years, the county has raised in-lieu fees to respond to rising land  costs, which in some areas have shot up to $1 million or more per acre. But  over time, there has been a tragic and permanent loss of parklands.  </P> <P> Some recently incorporated cities are organizing to prevent further loss. They  would do well to follow the model of Anaheim, which refuses to give park credit  for land with a slope of 20% or more. There, city residents turn out in force  when the City Council makes parkland decisions.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors should implement recommendations made by the county  Environmental Management Agency to raise the park-dedication requirement to 3  acres per 1,000 residents, and force more developers to donate usable land  instead of in-lieu fees.  </P> <P> Maybe things aren't what they once were in San Diego, where a development firm  was allowed to count back yards as part of its parks requirement. But  irreversible decisions have been made in Orange County that have left  communities without adequate, usable parks. This deplorable record must be  corrected so that baseball and other recreational activities can be played on  level fields.  </P></p>

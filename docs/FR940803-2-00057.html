Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Improving women's employment opportunities and other employment related equity and social issues that promote women in the work force has been the driving force of the Women's Bureau since its inception in 1920. Within the Department of Labor, the Director serves as the policy advisor on women's issues to the Secretary and DOL agencies charged with improving the economic and workplace life of American workers. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Employment and Training Administration and the Bureau co-administer the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act (NEW), with the Bureau having responsibility for the demonstration program grants to States to promote higher wages for women through NTO job training and placement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Grant Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The demonstration program grants are authorized under the NEW Act, Public Law 102&hyph;235, signed December 1991, effective July 1992. NEW amends the JTPA and, by reference, as subsequently amended by the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NEW demonstration program grant awards are funded from Title IV of JTPA. (JTPA discretionary money is transferred to the Women's Bureau.) The funding is set at $1.5 million, annually, to make no more than six (6) awards for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> First (1992) and Second (1993) Year NEW Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The first year of competition (Fiscal Year 1992) began September 1992 with the publication of the Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 92&hyph;01 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Thirty-eight proposals were received in response to the SGA. Both a WB/ETA technical review panel and an OASAM Office of Procurement Services cost review panel evaluated all proposals and was the basis for funding recommendations to the Secretary. On January 19, 1993, grants were awarded to the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second year of competition (Fiscal Year 1993) began in May 1993 with the publication of the Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;03 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UK press release from the Department of Trade and Industry: </F> "Department of Trade and Industry Cuts Red Tape for Computer  Exporters"]    [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry has introduced  an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) which will cut red tape  faced by computer exporters.    Reflecting relaxations on export controls agreed by the  Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM)  earlier this month, the new licence will allow - subject to some  conditions - the export of certain computers and signal  processing equipment without the need to apply for individual  export licences. The new licence comes into force immediately,  however existing licenses are still valid for export.    Now exporters will be required to include with the official  documentation for Customs a note stating that `the goods are  being exported under the Open General Export Licence  (Computers)'. They should keep records of all goods exported  under the licence and must, before or within 30 days of the  first use of the Licence, give the Secretary of State their  details and an address where the records can be inspected.    The two types of goods which will now be eligible for the  OGEL are: digital computers whose composite theoretical  performance (CTP) is no more than 67 million theoretical  operations per second (Mtops); and signal processing or image  enhancement equipment with a CTP of no more than 40 Mtops.    The OGEL also contains provisions imposing certain  conditions  on use of the licence relating to the non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction. Destinations to which the OGEL does  not apply are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Serbia,  Montenegro, the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia and  those areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the  Bosnian Serb forces.  <H5>  Note for Editors </H5>   The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) was established in 1950 as a non-Treaty based regime  which operates informally through a number of committees  supported by a permanent secretariat based in Paris. It operates  on the basis of consensus and has traditionally been a forum  where NATA allies, with Japan and Australia, review the scope of  multilateral controls on the exports of sensitive dual-use,  military and nuclear equipment and technology.    The recent relaxation of these export controls has been  brought about by agreement reached within COCOM in response to  changing strategic concerns and advances in technology.</p>

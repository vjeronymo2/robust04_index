			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The advantages of light microcopy are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large base of published information against which to check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis and analytical technique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, IR analysis, DTA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> etc. are inappropriate where the material is not known to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be fibrous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and can be performed on-site if a suitably equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscope is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disadvantages are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present may be seen. This is a problem for very low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos concentrations where agglomerations or large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bundles of fibers may not be present to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification by inference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the part of the microscopist. An analyst is only as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful as his mental catalog of images. Therefore, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by experience. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineralogical training of the analyst is very important.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. This may lead to sampling bias and false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results (high or low). This is especially true if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample is severely inhomogeneous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers so identification cannot be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.4. Method Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1.4.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This method can be used for determination of asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been adequately determined, although for selected samples, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit is very low, depending on the number of particles examined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For mostly homogeneous, finely divided samples, with no difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrous interferences, the detection limit is below 1%. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhomogeneous samples (most samples), the detection limit remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undefined. NIST has conducted proficiency testing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported statistically with an average, control limits, etc., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially in the low concentration range. It is suspected that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is significant bias in the low range especially near 1%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA tried to remedy this by requiring a mandatory point counting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme for samples less than 10%. The point counting procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is tedious, and may introduce significant biases of its own. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not been incorporated into this method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1.4.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine in commercial products where asbestos was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberately added because the amount is usually more than a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. An analyst's results can be ``calibrated'' against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known amounts added by the manufacturer. For geological samples,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degree of homogeneity affects the precision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1.4.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when it is present. For this reason, the analyst must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location and identification of asbestos in samples. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually accomplished through substantial on-the-job training as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as formal education in mineralogy and microscopy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.5. Interferences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the microscope can be considered an interference for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos. There are literally hundreds of interferences in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplaces. The techniques described in this method are normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to eliminate the interferences. An analyst's success  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in eliminating the interferences depends on proper training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serpentines and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only common fibrous mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral antigorite occurs in a fibril habit with morphology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole minerals consist of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> score of different minerals of which only five are regulated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite asbestos,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tremolite asbestos and actinolite asbestos. These are the only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their fibrous properties; however, the rest can and do occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasionally in asbestiform habit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the related mineral interferences, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minerals common in building material may present a problem for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> talc fibers or ribbons, wollastonite, perlite, attapulgite, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other fibrous materials commonly present in workplaces are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiberglass, mineral wool, ceramic wool, refractory ceramic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic fibers, graphite or carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers, cellulose (paper or wood) fibers, metal fibers, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interference. The analyst may not be able to easily extract the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers from the matrix in order to use the method. Where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible, remove the matrix before the analysis, taking careful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix materials are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and epoxy. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase contrast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's ability to deal with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these materials increases with experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land area of the United States is composed of minerals which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of asbestos is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations in which environmental exposure can be severe such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Serpentine Hills of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the home. Asbestos abatement workers are the most current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segment of the population to have occupational exposure to great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of asbestos. If the material is undisturbed, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. Exposure occurs when the asbestos-containing material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is abraded or otherwise disturbed during maintenance operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or some other activity. Approximately 95% of the asbestos in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place in the United States is chrysotile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tremolite and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tremolite is found in extremely small amounts in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chrysotile deposits. Actinolite exposure is probably greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from environmental sources, but has been identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been certified as asbestos-free.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

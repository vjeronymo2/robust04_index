			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Qantas considers stake in carrier QANTAS Airways, Australia's government-owned international carrier, yesterday said it was considering bidding for a significant stake in Australian Airlines, the domestic carrier which is to be privatised next year. Mr John Ward, chief executive, said Qantas would file an expression of interest with the government's airline sales task force on Thursday, the deadline for indicative offers. However, Mr Ward said Qantas had not finally decided to bid for Australian, and indicated the airline also planned to discuss a possible operating agreement with Ansett Australia, the domestic carrier jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation. He said Qantas's preference was for a significant holding in Australian, but it would be unable to judge whether to bid for a controlling stake until the next stage of the sale, when the government would discuss detailed options with bidders. Qantas had been barred from discussions with Australian, Ansett and other airlines since an information memorandum on Australian Airlines was circulated by the government shortly before Christmas. However, the government announced in February that a ban on cross-shareholdings between Qantas and the domestic airlines would be lifted as part of a proposed second stage of deregulation in the Australian aviation market.</p>

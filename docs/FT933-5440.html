			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Consumer spending rises particularly on leisure and travel - appears to have increased more strongly last year than previously believed. The latest annual survey of family expenditure by the Central Statistical Office finds that spending by the average household grew by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 271.83 a week, faster than the 3.7 per cent rise in the retail prices index last year. The increase, which follows a 1 per cent drop in the real value of household spending in 1991, far outstripped the 1.4 per cent growth in average gross family income to Pounds 343 per week last year. In 1991, family income rose 4.8 per cent. The fastest growth in spending last year was for fares and travel, which increased 29 per cent to Pounds 7.20 a week. Some of that may have been due to higher public transport charges. The next largest rise, 24 per cent, was for leisure services such as holidays, hotels, sports events and theatres, on which the average household spent Pounds 27.56 a week. However, spending on cinema admissions stagnated, apparently reflecting the continued growth in the popularity of home video entertainment. The proportion of households receiving cable television increased to 9 per cent from 6 per cent in 1991, while 69 per cent own video recorders, up from 65 per cent. Home computer ownership rose slightly to almost one-in-five households. But the survey found evidence of cutbacks on other types of non-essential spending, often by more affluent families. Households with weekly incomes of more than Pounds 800 - the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population - reduced their alcoholic drinks bill from Pounds 27.99 to Pounds 25.72 a week. The wealthiest families also spent slightly less last year on household services such as insurance, telephones, domestic help and laundry. But spending on these items by other income groups was higher than in 1991 and more than doubled in the poorest households. Motoring was another target of economies. Though average motoring expenditure rose, slightly fewer households reported owning a car. The number of households with second homes also fell slightly from the previous year. By contrast, spending on household goods, notably furniture and soft furnishings, rose sharply in both the highest and the lowest income groups. The average household also appears to have become more generous, making Pounds 7.37 a week in charitable and other donations, twice the 1991 level. Perhaps that was because some did better on the football pools, which paid out 4p for every 58p received - slightly better odds than the previous year. Though households spent only 80p a week to repay debt, their average weekly savings and investments rose to Pounds 6.18 from Pounds 4.49. The only big item showing a fall in overall spending was housing. However, the CSO said last year's figures were not comparable with those for 1991 because it had changed its method of calculating housing expenditure. Average weekly household expenditure ranged from Pounds 334 in south-east England to Pounds 235 in the north. The survey was based on a sample of more than 7,000 households in all parts of the country. The CSO cautioned that sampling error meant that the accuracy of its figures for different categories of spending varied considerably. Family Spending: A report on the 1992 Family Expenditure Survey.

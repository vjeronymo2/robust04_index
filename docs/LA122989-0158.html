			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> $500 MILLION PLEDGED FOR POLAND  </P> <P> Industrial nations have finalized an emergency "bridge" loan for Poland of $500  million to help cushion the blow of a tough economic austerity program, the  U.S. Treasury said today.  </P> <P> The United States, as announced by President Bush on Dec. 13, will provide $200  million of the money, which will tide Poland over until it receives a  longer-term loan from the International Monetary Fund.  </P> <P> Final agreement on the bridge loan, of which about $225 million will be  released initially, became possible after Poland signed a letter of intent with  the IMF last weekend, spelling out what steps it would take in return for a  $710-million loan.  </P> <P> IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus called Poland's economic program a  courageous attempt to tackle tremendous challenges.  </P></p>

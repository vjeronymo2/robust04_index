			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> EX-PRESIDENT FORD HAS SURGERY ON KNEE INJURED IN FOOTBALL DAYS  </P> <P> Former President Gerald R. Ford underwent surgery today to repair the left knee  injured during his days playing football more than half a century ago, a  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Ford, 76, went into surgery about 9 a.m. at Eisenhower Medical Center, said  Penny Circle, Ford's chief of staff.  </P> <P> The procedure, performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Murphy, was expected  to take about two hours, she said.  </P> <P> After a four- or five-day hospital stay, Ford is expected to spend another four  to five weeks on crutches while his leg heals, she said.  </P> <P> Ford agreed to have the elective surgery because "he's had continuing problems"  with his left knee, problems that dated back to injuries he received when he  played center for Grand Rapids' South High School and University of Michigan,  where he earned All-America honors, Circle said.  </P></p>

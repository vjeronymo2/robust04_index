			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Specified Method Applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(2) provides that an adjustment will be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer satisfies the specified method requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) and the documentation requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(iii). A taxpayer will meet the specified method requirement if the taxpayer selects and applies a method specified in the section 482 regulations in a reasonable manner. A method is a specified method if it is described in the regulations under section 482. With respect to transfers of tangible property, these methods currently include the comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost-plus method, and comparable profits method. With respect to transfers of intangible property these methods currently include the comparable uncontrolled transactions method and comparable profits method. A bona fide cost sharing arrangement under &sect;1.482&hyph;2A(d)(4) is considered a specified method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unspecified methods are methods other than specified methods. The profit split method, under &sect;1.482&hyph;6 of the proposed regulations and qualified cost sharing arrangements, under &sect;1.482&hyph;2(g) of the proposed regulations, will become specified methods if and when regulations describing those methods are finalized. A taxpayer will ordinarily not be considered to have applied an unspecified method merely because it failed to make an adjustment in the application of a specified method. However, the failure to make adjustments is relevant to the reasonableness of the application of that method. The selection and application of a method are reasonable only if, given the available data and the potentially available methods, the taxpayer reasonably concluded that the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in &sect;1.482&hyph;1T(b)(2)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specified method standard differs from the more likely than not be sustained on the merits standard set forth in proposed regulations issued on January 21, 1993. This change reflects the amendments made by section 13236 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) to section 6662(e), under which a section 482 adjustment is to be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer reasonably applied one of the specified section 482 methods (and satisfied the documentation requirements described below). In selecting the method to apply, a taxpayer should select the specified method that is most appropriate under the facts and circumstances. Thus, the taxpayer must reasonably conclude that its application of the transfer pricing method chosen will provide the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the facts and circumstances of the transaction under review. The application of a specified method will not satisfy this standard if the taxpayer concluded, or should have concluded, that a reasonable application of another specified method would provide a more accurate arm's length result than the method chosen. For example, a taxpayer might not satisfy this standard if the taxpayer applied the comparable profits method to determine its prices but the taxpayer had data relating to a comparable uncontrolled transaction involving substantially similar conditions. Given the guidance set forth in the section 482 regulations and the existence of closely comparable data, a conclusion that a different analysis would provide a more accurate measure of an arm's length result, ordinarily would not be reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A taxpayer's analysis of its transfer prices must include the most current data that is available at the time that the taxpayer files its tax return. These regulations require that taxpayers perform a reasonably thorough search for data. However, this data may not reflect transactions in the current taxable year. Accordingly, it may be necessary for taxpayers to make compensating adjustments to reflect changes in the data between the time that prices were set for the year and the time that the return is filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations discuss several nonexclusive factors that are to be taken into account in determining whether the taxpayer reasonably concluded that its application of the method selected would provide the most accurate measure of an arm's length result. The first factor is that a taxpayer's experience and knowledge in transfer pricing will be relevant in determining how thorough and precise the taxpayer's analysis must be. In assessing the experience and knowledge of the taxpayer, the experience and knowledge of the controlled group is taken into account, rather than the experience and knowledge of any member of the controlled group. Thus, the larger and more sophisticated a controlled group of corporations, the more thorough and precise its analysis should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second factor is the extent to which sufficient accurate data is available to apply a method reasonably. A taxpayer is obligated to engage in a reasonably thorough search for comparable transactions and other data necessary to apply the methods under section 482. A factor to consider in determining whether a search for data is reasonably thorough is the cost of searching for the data in relation to the dollar amount of the intercompany transaction in question. For example, a taxpayer need not obtain data regarding a comparable uncontrolled transaction if the intercompany transaction had a value of $50,000 and the search for and analysis of the data will cost $25,000. Alternatively, if necessary to reasonably apply a specified method, it ordinarily would be reasonable to expect that a taxpayer would incur a similar expense to search for and analyze data if the taxpayer is engaged in intercompany transactions with a dollar amount of $250 million. If a taxpayer's analysis neglected data that it would have been expected to obtain under the above criteria, then the analysis would not be considered reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third factor is the extent to which a taxpayer follows the relevant requirements set forth in regulations under section 482. Furthermore, in applying the selected method, the extent to which the taxpayer makes all the adjustments necessary to reasonably conclude that its application of the method chosen would provide the most accurate measure of an arm's length result will be taken into account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth factor is the extent to which the taxpayer relied on the advice of a qualified professional. The extent to which reliance is appropriate will depend on the qualifications of the professional and the quality of the study or other advice that is rendered, rather than the relationship that the professional has to the taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Tin mine confident as DTI cuts funds Cornwall's last tin mining company, Carnon Consolidated, said yesterday that it hoped to continue operating in spite of reports that the government is to end vital financial support. According to a leaked letter from Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, the government has decided not to extend any further loans to the company beyond the Pounds 23.4m advanced already. The letter says that the DTI has decided that the project is 'in jeopardy' and that Carnon has been unable to adjust its costs to the low price of tin. Carnon's directors told the DTI in November that they needed Pounds 200,000 before the end of January to keep going. However, the company said yesterday that the tin price had strengthened and it was confident it could operate profitably. The DTI declined to comment on the leaked letter. Carnon, based near Truro, employs 250 people, and another 250 jobs depend on its supplying companies. According to the Sainsbury letter, the DTI is concerned about the unemployment and possible environmental harm. One of Carnon's earlier abandoned mines, Wheal Jane, leaked two years ago, polluting the Falmouth Estuary. Mr Matthew Taylor, local Liberal Democrat MP, said the government should learn from Wheal Jane, where they saved a small sum of money by letting the mine close, only to spend a large sum on unemployment pay and environmental clean-up.</p>

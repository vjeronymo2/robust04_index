			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Kurds take campaign to streets of Europe THE assaults by radical Kurdish groups on Turkish diplomats and commercial offices in Europe yesterday marked a new phase in Turkey's eight-year separatist rebellion. Just three months ago there was real expectation of a breakthrough to peace in the bloody struggle. When the Kurdish separatist leader Apo Abdullah Ocalan called a unilateral ceasefire on March 20, Kurdish exiles in Europe, many deeply opposed to Apo's radical form of Marxism, applauded the move. The Turkish press, usually nationalistic on the Kurdish issue, urged the government to do respond. Western governments waited expectantly. Now, the violent incidents across Europe have come at the same time as reports of a big army operation against camps of the rebel Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in mountains near the Iraqi border. The army offensive follows the massacre in Bingol of 33 unarmed Turkish conscripts, who were dragged from a bus and shot. The army operation, unlike many earlier hardline responses, appears to be endorsed by a public opinion outraged by the attack, which in effect derailed the real progress that had been made. It is hard to see how the government in Ankara could have acted differently. Diplomats say the attacks around Bingol have been particularly vicious. The massacre was seen as final evidence that from his headquarters in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon Apo no longer has real control over his field commanders. The interior minister Ismet Sezgin had earlier announced that villagers were to be allowed to re-adopt their original Kurdish names - a further concession to cultural rights of the Kurdish minority. The attack took place on the evening that the national security council approved a limited amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms. The decree was immediately revoked. The violence unleashed yesterday reflects the underlying frustration of many Kurdish groups at the breakdown of the initiative begun with the ceasefire. At the same time events have conspired against those in the Turkish administration committed to reform. In retrospect, the death of President Turgut Ozal in April is now seen as a turning point. He was perhaps the only Turkish politician courageous enough to adopt the sort of liberal policies needed to win over moderate Kurds and undermine the rural support of the PKK. During his presidency, Kurdish newspapers were allowed and a privately run Kurdish cultural institute was set up. However, any further moves, such as allowing Kurdish-language television or even the teaching of Kurdish in schools have been blocked. The question of Kurdish-medium schools is not even on the horizon and political parties appealing to nationalist or separatist ideologies remain banned. Mr Ozal's death and the political uncertainty that followed undercut the momentum for a settlement. And President Suleyman Demirel has never had the vision to see his way past the nationalist opponents of Kurdish reform. The PKK has already warned that it will attack Turkish tourist targets, a threat so far not carried out. But yesterday's incidents show the Kurds want to attract European attention to their cause.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL CRITICIZED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times quotes Councilman Hal Bernson as saying that Mayor  Bradley is "sticking his nose in my district" by condemning the restrictions  placed on the design of a Granada Hills mosque. Councilman Bernson has once  again displayed the incredible arrogance that has come to characterize his  entire term of office.  </P> <P> It doesn't take a constitutional scholar to see that there is a very good  likelihood that the City Council has infringed upon the religious freedom of  the Muslim community by dictating the design of their place of worship.  </P> <P> I was taught to believe that every American has the right to choose his or her  own religion and not to be persecuted for that choice.  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley has done the right thing by asking the Cultural Affairs  Commission to get in on the act. With their help in developing guidelines for  designing religious buildings, perhaps events such as this will not occur  again.  </P> <P> As a resident of Bernson's district, I apologize to the members of the Islamic  Center of Northridge for the insolence and lack of sensitivity displayed by our  councilman. Although you may have disagreements with your neighbors in Granada  Hills, I am sure you can work these out over time.  </P> <P> We do not persecute people because of their religious beliefs in this country,  in spite of what Hal Bernson might think.  </P> <P> WALTER N. PRINCE  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

They are also hindering and  disturbing smooth and secure transportation as well as local  tranquility.    At about 1600 on 2 March, Maung Tar Htay, the 19-year-old  son  of U Aye Myint Lwin of the village of Kyaukpya, Kyaikto  Township, stepped on an antipersonnel mine laid by members of  the Karen armed organization in the jungle while he was  returning to Kyaukpya from the fields. He lost his toes in the  accident. The responsible personnel took him to Kyaikto  Hospital for treatment.</p>

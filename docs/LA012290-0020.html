			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> JOCKEYS GIVE CANANI 1-2 FINISH  </P> <P> Corey Black and Jorge Velasquez, old pals from their expatriate riding days in  Paris, convened a personal reunion at Santa Anita Sunday on the winning end of  the $173,100 San Marcos Handicap.  </P> <P> Black, riding the French horse Putting, hung a half-length decision on  Velasquez, aboard the English horse Colway Rally, while up in the press box  trainer Julio Canani quietly savored his 1-2 sweep of the 1 1/4-mile turf  event.  </P> <P> "I didn't even have to root," the Peruvian trainer said. "I was two lengths in  front of the field."  </P> <P> Actually, it was four lengths back at the finish to the third horse, favored  Live the Dream, who may have been the unluckiest of several unlucky horses in  the field of 13.  </P> <P> "My trip? A trifle horrendous," said Live the Dream's jockey, Chris McCarron,  in his best Trevor Denman accent. "One horse came up on my inside, eliminating  a lot of options, and then the horse I was following got stopped."  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay, who was trying to make second choice Wretham his fifth winner of  the day, would not be outdone by McCarron's horror stories.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of horses in there that didn't belong," Pincay said after  Wretham weaved his way home ninth. "I had no place to run from the five-eighths  to the wire."  </P> <P> Black, on the other hand, had no complaints.  </P> <P> "I had a perfect trip," said the 21-year-old Black, who won the San Fernando  Stakes the previous Sunday. "Once I got my horse covered up, he relaxed great.  After that, it was just a matter of asking him to run."  </P> <P> Black perfected his skills in "covering up" his horses -- placing them behind  the opposition to conserve their energies -- during a spring and summer of  riding in France in 1987. In 1986 the native of Westminster was California's  leading apprentice.  </P> <P> During that same summer of '87, Velasquez also was riding regularly in France.  At the age of 41 and entering the twilight of his career, the former national  champion was treating himself to one last international lark.  </P> <P> "I remember riding against Corey a lot over there," Velasquez said after the  San Marcos. "He beat me a couple of close ones, too."  </P> <P> The irony was not lost on Black.  </P> <P> "How about that, Jorgie!" Black said when he returned to the jocks' room. "Two  European horses and a couple of old European riders."  </P> <P> Velasquez grinned and shook his head.  </P> <P> "You've got to quit picking on me," Velasquez told Black. "I'm old enough to be  your dad."  </P> <P> Not only did Black and Putting beat Velasquez for first money, they may have  compromised his early position in the race as well.  </P> <P> At the start Colway Rally stumbled and found himself at the back of the field  as they made their way down the hillside onto the main course.  </P> <P> "I wanted him behind horses," Velasquez said. "But not quite that far behind.  Luckily, I was able to get a good position.  </P> <P> "Then, all of a sudden everybody got off the rail," the rider added. "My horse  saw daylight and took off.'  </P> <P> The last horse to angle away from the rail was Putting, and Black was delighted  when he saw Colway Rally pull Velasquez to the lead. After that, things went  smoothly for the winner. At the head of the stretch, longshot Two Moccasins  politely faded away to give Putting a clean run at the leader.  </P> <P> Canani, who broke a frustrating three-month stakes drought with his sweep,  credited the addition of blinkers to Putting's equipment for the victory.  Putting had not won in nearly two years, while turning in respectable races to  such top horses as Great Communicator, Pranke and Lively One.  </P> <P> In his most recent start, Putting was beaten by a nose by Splendor Catch in a  Jan. 4 allowance race at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> "That was his last chance," Canani said. "I hadn't put blinkers on him before  because he had been running good, even without winning. But he was cheating on  me. The other day he had the length of the stretch to go by that other horse."  </P> <P> At the same time, Canani is convinced Colway Rally deserves the benefit of the  doubt. The 6-year-old son of Final Straw cut a chunk out of a front foot when  he stumbled and still ended up finishing second for the third time in three  North American races.  </P> <P> "You wait and see," Canani vowed. "He's going to turn out to be a nice horse  around here."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Putting, owned by Jay Goldinger of Beverly Hills, paid $19 to win. Canani's  third San Marcos starter, Prince Ruffian, finished sixth. . . . Laffit Pincay  won four straight races Sunday, beginning in the second with Zoe Akins and  ending with Sam McGee in the fifth. . . . Wayne Lukas won two races Sunday to  move into a tie at the top of the trainer standings with Brian Mayberry. Lukas  provided Pincay with Autumn Beauty, a half-brother to 1979 Del Mar Futurity  winner The Carpenter, and then snapped Pincay's win streak with Blushing John's  half-brother Five on Five in the sixth race.  </P> <P> Assyrian Pirate put himself in the picture for the top 3-year-old races of the  meeting with a four-length victory in the 1 1/16-mile seventh race. The  California-bred son of Pirate's Bounty is trained by Lewis Cenicola. . . .  Champion mare Bayakoa moved a step closer to her 1990 debut with an effortless  seven-furlong workout Sunday morning, timed in 1:27. Trainer Ron McAnally will  nominate the Argentine mare to the Feb. 4 Santa Maria Handicap. . . . Two local  Derby candidates also worked Sunday. Sunny Slope Stakes winner Pleasant Tap  went a mile in 1:40 and Hollywood Juvenile Championship winner Magical Mile  went a half-mile in :48 1/5.  </P></p>

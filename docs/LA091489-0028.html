			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> An "obsessed fan" was ordered Wednesday to stay at least 200 yards from the  home of 17-year-old pop star Tiffany. A Superior Court commissioner issued the  restraining order against Jeff Deane Turner, 35, after Tiffany said she became  upset and feared for her safety when she learned he had obtained her address.  Tiffany said Turner kissed her and put his arm round her at a concert. "He has  sent me numerous letters, one of which says that God wants us to be together,"  she said. In addition to keeping his distance, Turner was ordered not to  telephone Tiffany, whose full name is Tiffany Darwish, and not to send her  presents. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

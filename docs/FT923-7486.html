			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK dividends The Bank of England may be gratified to see the stream of maintained and cut dividends emerging from the interim results season. Its latest bulletin contains a veiled criticism of companies for raising pay-outs last year while profits were falling. One concern for investors must be that this dividend growth was only delivered at the expense of investment in productive capacity. At 1.7 times, prospective dividend cover for the market as a whole is running well below the long-term average of 2.5 times, and perhaps 10 per cent below the trough of the last recession. Rebuilding cover will probably limit the scope for dividend growth during the upturn. However, a glance down the list of FT-SE companies shows the serious problem to be concentrated in specific sectors. While overall investment by industry fell sharply last year, it still remained respectable by historic standards. This underlines that there is only a direct trade-off between paying a dividend and making an investment where no other form of finance is available. Yet the market for corporate funding is far from perfect. The Bank is surely right to point out that the longer recovery is delayed, the more likely it becomes that capital equipment will be scrapped. After all, the depressing feature of the interim results season so far is not the level of reported earnings, but some extraordinarily gloomy statements on the trading outlook. The decision to increase dividends last year was a rational response to what looked like a short-term cyclical downturn. But if the market is facing something more serious, this year's decisions will need to be different.</p>

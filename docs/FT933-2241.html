			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / No reason for a warm glow: A look at UK efforts to meet Rio Summit commitments on global warming The UK's progress on meeting targets on global warming will come under the spotlight this week in Manchester at a grandly titled 'Partnerships for Change' forum. The forum is the initiative of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who offered to hold the event for more than 350 environmental pressure groups at last year's Rio Earth Summit. But government officials are wondering whether the guests will bite the hand that feeds them: the meeting will draw attention to whether the UK can meet the Rio targets on global warming at an awkward point in the development of its environmental policy. Under particular scrutiny is the UK's strategy for meeting the Rio commitment to cut emissions of gases which might cause global warming. Although scientists may take decades to establish whether warming is occuring, governments decided at Rio that the threat was so great that immediate action was necessary. Mr Major has called global warming one of Britain's environmental priorities. At Rio, Britain promised to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the main 'greenhouse' gases, to 1990 levels by 2000. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, this means a cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected levels of emissions, or about 6 per cent. In the past six months the government has published several accounts of how it will make those cuts (see table). But environmentalists - many of them in Manchester today - argue that the government's explanations are inadequate. Tory backbenchers, mindful of the party conference in three weeks, also fear that the proposals are a political minefield. According to the government's latest plan, measures announced in the March Budget - the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and increased road and petrol taxes - will cut emissions by 3mtC, by reducing consumption. But some economists and environmentalists argue that these taxes will not have have much impact on emissions because people's use of transport and household energy is relatively insensitive to price. 'VAT is blunt and its application will produce little by way of a demand response,' says Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, a forecasting group. In addition, the VAT move has provoked the summer's biggest political storm. Road and car lobby groups have also warned the government that plans to raise vehicle tax will be unpopular. In spite of these concerns the government is likely to press ahead with these revenue-raising measures because of its Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. Environmentalists have also questioned the likely effectiveness of the Energy Saving Trust, a newly-formed partnership between government and the utilities designed to encourage households to save energy. Headed by Lord John Moore, a former cabinet minister, the trust's brief is to deliver a quarter of the Rio target cuts in emissions. But the trust has had a slow start. In the current year it is likely to invest only a few million pounds in energy-saving projects such as encouraging householders to install more efficient boilers. According to government estimates, the trust needs to invest some Pounds 450m a year in such projects to achieve its share of the carbon emission cuts. The trust's director, Mr Eoin Lees, acknowledges that it 'will be something of a challenge' to expand the trust's annual investments to the level stated by the government by 2000. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the London-based Association for the Conservation of Energy, puts it more bluntly: 'It is hard to see how the trust is on course to achieve a fraction of the targets the government has set.' However, if the trust is successful, it also could, paradoxically, stir up more political trouble: for the cost of its investments will be passed on to all households - including those which have not benefitted from its projects  -as an extra charge on their gas and electricity bills. The government says that if the trust invests the Pounds 450m annually needed to meet the emission targets, the result could be an increase in domestic energy bills of some 4 per cent - on top of the VAT on domestic fuel that is causing such political uproar. This calculation has attracted less attention than the VAT move, but it nevertheless contains the seeds of future trouble. Besides these central planks of its carbon-saving plans, the government hopes that four smaller schemes will collectively save an extra 1mtC - one tenth of the Rio target. The four initiatives are a change in UK regulations on new buildings to encourage better insulation, government backing for a small increase in the share of electricity generated by solar, wind and wave power, and two EC projects known as EMAS and SAVE, which are designed to promote 'green' management and energy efficiency respectively. Together, these measures - the Budget proposals, the Energy Saving Trust and the four smaller schemes - should, the government says, save more than 6.5 mtC in total, two-thirds of the Rio target. Environmentalists, already sceptical of these proposals, were even more startled in July when the prime minister asserted that 'our plans are now complete'. The remaining one-third of the Rio target, he said, would be met by enhanced energy efficiency in business, households and transport, though he refused to spell out the measures. Mr Major's statement raises more questions than it answers. In particular, steadily rising volumes of road traffic - and the government's programme to build more roads - threaten to increase carbon emissions. The government has said it will not address the issues raised by its critics until the end of the year, when it will publish a full and detailed explanation of how it will meet the Rio targets. Does it matter if the government's plans to cut carbon emissions are inadequate? It has invested much of its environmental reputation in publishing a credible plan. Without such a plan the UK government would, in effect, be excluded from the growing debate about whether global warming should be combatted through investment in energy schemes in developing countries, rather than in industrialised ones. However, as far as meeting the Rio 2000 target is concerned, the government may find that recession and the decline of the coal industry cut emissions more effectively than its disparate collection of small carbon-saving schemes. The DTI's forecast that a 10mtC cut is needed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels was based on the assumption of an annual growth in gross domestic product of 2.5 per cent between 1990 and 2000. However, in 1991 GDP fell by 2.3 per cent, and in 1992 by 0.4 per cent, and economists now predict only a sluggish recovery over the next few years. The UK may therefore not need to cut 10mtC to bring emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000. At the same time, the electricity industry may switch more quickly to gas-fired power stations than is assumed in the DTI models. Gas emits less carbon than coal-burning stations, so this will help. So as far as meeting the letter of the Rio targets goes, the government's task may be easier than it first thought, which could compensate for weaknesses in its carbon-saving plans. But what happens beyond 2000? Ministers have acknowledged that although the Rio target is commonly described as 'stabilisation', emissions are likely to rise sharply after that year as the economy continues to grow. If government critics are right, and the UK's schemes to cut carbon emissions are ineffectual, then the country will be poorly placed to tackle those long-term trends. That will be true even if it manages, by virtue of a sluggish economy, to meet the Rio targets by 2000.  ------------------------------------------ BREAKDOWN OF GOVERNMENT PLANS FOR CUTTING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS  ------------------------------------------                                       MtC**                                       saved  ------------------------------------------ VAT on fuel                             1.5 Higher road taxes                       1.5 Energy Saving Trust                     2.5 New building regulations  EC schemes (EMAS, SAVE)  more renewable energy                  1.0 More energy efficiency  in business, transport  and households*                        3.5  ------------------------------------------ Total                                  10.0  ------------------------------------------ ** million tonnes carbon * including installation of 'combined heat and power' generators to supply electricity and heating to blocks of flats, hospitals and businesses  ------------------------------------------</p>

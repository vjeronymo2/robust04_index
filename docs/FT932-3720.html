			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Dollar rates fall DEALERS in Eurodollar interest rate markets took the view that the Federal Reserve would not lean towards tightening monetary policy after US producer prices figures for May turned out to be lower than expected, writes James Blitz. The producer prices index showed that US factory gate prices were unchanged on the month, compared to a 0.6 per cent rise in April. However, the market will wait for next week's figures for consumer price inflation before making its final judgement. In recent weeks, there has been speculation that the Fed might lean towards tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. But the sluggishness of the US recovery ensures that this will probably not be the case for some time yet. In the Eurodollar cash market, 3-month offered rates dropped from 3 7/16 per cent to 3 3/8 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract closed 7 basis points higher at 96.42. At this level, it is assuming that 3-month money will be at 3.58 per cent in the autumn. Sterling markets were more-or-less unchanged yesterday, with dealers continuing to take the view that another base rate cut was far less likely following Mr Norman Lamont's attack on politically-inspired rate cuts this week. The September short sterling contract closed up 2 basis points on the day at 94.16, pricing 3-month money in the autumn at 5.84 per cent. In the cash market, interest rates closed a little firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, despite the small daily shortage of Pounds 400m forecast by the Bank of England. The overnight rate of lending was seen as low as 4 1/2 per cent. European markets were mostly unchanged after a week which saw a downward revision of forecasts of German interest rate cuts. Three month D-Marks closed at 7.57 per cent yesterday, while 3 month French francs closed at around 7.25 per cent. There is some speculation, however, that France and other European countries might take the advantage of a weak D-Mark to ease monetary policy again next week. The French franc has performed well in recent days, staying mostly on the strong side of FFr3.37 to the D-Mark. Spain could also reduce interest rates for the first time after Mr Felipe Gonzalez's victory in the general election.</p>

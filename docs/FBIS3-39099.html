			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Clark, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today that  Russian concern about possible airstrikes against Serbian  positions around Sarajevo was "perfectly understandable."    Mr Rifkind's comments came ahead of the Prime Minister's  visit to Moscow on Tuesday [15 February] when Mr Major is  expected to discuss the Bosnian situation with Russian leader Mr  Yeltsin.    The Defence Secretary, speaking in Edinburgh, said: "The  Russian government has of course been very supportive of the UN  and supported the Security Council resolution last year under  which the possibility of air strikes is being organised.    "It's perfectly understandable there should be some concern.  Everybody is concerned about the use of force."    Mr Rifkind emphasised his confidence in Lieutenant General  Sir Michael Rose, the UN force commander who is seeking to  implement the ceasefire. He also said that the role of UN  commanders on the ground would be extremely important in any  decision to launch air strikes because of the risk to UN forces  and aid workers.    It was not unusual that there were differing degrees of  support for international action, he added.    The important point was that the Security Council took a  decision some months ago and the latest resolution on air  strikes was based on that.    "In any account I am sure the views of all the nations  concerned will continue to be considered," said Mr Rifkind.    The Defence Secretary was guest of honour at the official  opening of a new 1 million pound headquarters of the Scottish  Yeomanry, a new Territorial Army unit created 15 months ago for  the role of light reconnaisance and home defence.</p>

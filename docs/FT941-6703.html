			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Legacy of apartheid may bless its creator: Patti Waldmeir tries to fathom why some blacks may vote for the National party President FW de Klerk is driven out of coloured townships by stones and bullets; constitution minister Roelf Meyer has goat's bile poured over his head in an African ritual - all part of the National party's quest to persuade the victims of apartheid, South Africa's non-white voters, to support their erstwhile oppressors in all-race elections in April. However immoral or impossible this may seem to outsiders, South African politicians know that it is a real prospect. The NP seems assured of significant support in coloured and Indian communities; and even among black Africans, it could partly contain the expected landslide for the African National Congress. The party's biggest campaign handicap - apartheid - could yet prove its greatest strength. For apartheid set out to divide South Africa by race and tribe, and to breed in blacks a sense of inferiority which fosters subservience; and it is exactly that legacy of racism, ethnicity and dependency which seems to motivate non-whites to vote NP. Most coloured voters say they will vote NP because they 'do not like blacks'; black NP supporters cite tribalism as a reason for opposing the ANC, which they claim is dominated by the Xhosa tribe; both say they do not believe blacks are capable of running a sophisticated economy. Even in modern, urban, ethnically-mixed Soweto, the National party can tap a deep vein of tribalism and inverted racism. Mr David Chuenyane, the NP's chief black organiser, relies heavily on ethnic scare stories, such as his claim that ANC officials in the civil service are sacking any public servant who is not a Xhosa (even though there are no ANC officials in top positions yet and no such sackings have been reported). He doubts the ability of blacks to run the South African economy: 'The whites are the brains behind the economy,' he says, noting that 'the blacks did provide the labour'. He fears affirmative action because 'I have seen in the African states what it has done', saying blacks are not used to handling large sums of money and implying that corruption will be the inevitable result. Mr Chuenyane candidly admits that his relationship with the NP is opportunistic: 'I saw an opportunity in the NP and I said: the NP is stranded, they need somebody black.' And anyway, he adds, when he returned from decades in exile with the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, there were no good positions going in the ANC. So, he is asked, you sold yourself to the highest bidder? 'It does look like that,' he says, with hardly a hint of embarrassment. Mr Chuenyane is almost certain to be elected as a member of parliament, given that he is seventh on the NP's election list for the region around Johannesburg. But his evident opportunism - and the shady personal history of some other black NP candidates, including two notorious 'warlords' from the western Cape - does little to inspire confidence among the electorate. This may matter little. Blacks are not so much voting for the NP as against the ANC. This is clear from the numerous hangers-on at the party's unmarked Soweto offices (on the floor above the ANC office). Asked why blacks should vote NP, Rocks Mseleku, a young NP organiser, tries a number of replies: 'People join for the love of the party'; 'because the party is open to blacks'; 'because they have changed their logo'. He denies receiving payment as an organiser. But all organisers are paid, he is told. 'I don't take it like that,' he says, adding that he receives R2,000 (Pounds 386) a month, twice his previous salary, as 'compensation'. Apart from paid officials, it is hard to find anyone in Soweto who admits supporting the NP. Mr Chuenyane insists that public meetings are held almost every weekend and house-to-house canvassing is constant. But when Soweto NP information officer Vronda Banda takes a group of journalists out canvassing, he goes only to the home of his parents, and to his friend Rocks Mashinini, who refuses to shake his hand, and says his life is endangered by the visit. 'The NP is the party of the oppressor, it's the party that tortured you,' says Mr Mashinini, who like Mr Banda was once a member of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation). So far the party's attempts to create a new non-racial identity have elicited either outrage or humour. When the long-suffering Mr Meyer went to Soweto the weekend before last to be 'introduced to the ancestors' it was hard not to laugh. Comments Weekly Mail columnist Bafana Khumalo: 'Oh, it's tough being a New Age Nationalist. To make it big these days you have to humour the natives, whether it's shouting 'viva' at their meetings or listening to them when they start their African gobbledegook.' But it is the NP that could laugh last. Mr Chuenyane says 5 per cent would be a good showing in Soweto (where there are perhaps 1.5m voters); opinion polls show 1 per cent black support nationwide, but political intimidation may render them unreliable. The NP says it is aiming at nurses, teachers, civil servants, professionals  -people with mortgages and a fear of victimisation. But it seems certain that much NP support will come instead from the less educated, older, more traditional residents such as Godfrey Mthembu, NP Soweto organiser: 'I know I can never be over the white man. I know I need him. If I break my leg, without his medicine I'm crippled for life.' That was, after all, the message of apartheid. Indeed, South Africa's first all-race poll may serve to reveal, through the support the NP gets among blacks, just how successful apartheid was.</p>

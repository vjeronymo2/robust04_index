			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time the taxa is listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these species at this time. Because the 10 plants face numerous anthropogenic threats (see Factors A and E in ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'') and the 10 plants occur predominantly on private land, the publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would make these plants more vulnerable to incidents of vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to the decline of these species and increase enforcement problems. The listing of these species under the Act publicizes the rarity of these plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers or collectors of rare plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection of the habitat of these species will be addressed through the section 7 consultation and section 4 recovery processes. The Service believes that Federal involvement in the areas where these plants occur can be identified without the designation of critical habitat. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these plants is not prudent at this time, because such designation would likely increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal activities potentially affecting 1 or more of the 10 plants include mining, grazing authorizations, and issuance of special use permits and rights-of-ways. Populations of 7 of the 10 plants occur on Federal lands. Approximately 70 percent of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carpenteria californica,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> half the populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarkia springvillensis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and one population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calyptridium pulchellum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occur on lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Approximately one-third of the populations of Allium tuolumnense, one-seventh the populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verbena californica,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> one-half the populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mimulus shevockii,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and one population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Navarretia setiloba  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occur on lands managed by the BLM. These agencies would be required to confer with the Service if any activities authorized, funded, or carried out by these two agencies would likely jeopardize the continued existence of these species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Federal agencies that may become involved as a result of this proposed rule include the Veterans Administration through their Federal mortgage programs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (Federal Home Administration loans), and the Federal Highways Administration through the construction of roads and highways. Since at least three of these plants exist in or near stream beds, perennial streams or drainages, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may become involved through jurisdiction of section 404 of the Clean Water Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing these 10 plants would provide for the development of recovery plans. Such plans would bring together both State and Federal efforts for conservation of the plants. The plans would establish a framework for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plans would set recovery priorities and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It also would describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve conservation and survival of these 10 plants. Additionally, pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Service would be able to grant funds to affected States for management actions promoting the protection and recovery of these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

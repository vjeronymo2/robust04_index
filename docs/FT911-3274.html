			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / New World Order requires wider and deeper EC: Danish foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen explains his vision of the Community's future THE New Europe in the New World Order: that is the issue which the foreign ministers of the Twelve will discuss at their meeting in Luxembourg this weekend. It is a much more precise description than talking about the establishment of a political union in Europe. We should not underestimate the magnitude of our job. And for one simple reason: the political and economic landscape in Europe has undergone significant changes. After the Gulf war it has become clear that the threats to our societies have diversified. We should no longer pay attention to the developments in the Soviet Union only. Crises in the Near and Middle East, mass-migration, world poverty and threats against the environment should be added to the list. Denmark considers the European Community to be the most important block on which to build our New Europe. It has a true magnetic pull. It is based on law. It is based on sound principles: basically shifting coalitions between member states - which make the national interests converge. Not a small achievement, considering Europe's past. At the inter-governmental conferences (IGC) we now have to sketch out a way towards an economic and monetary union (Emu) and towards a political union. Denmark has tabled proposals which show a way forward. Our goal is to widen and deepen the Community. We want to enlarge it with new member states: the Efta (European Free Trade Association) countries and countries in central and eastern Europe. We also want to strike a balance between growing internationalisation and regionalism. We want to shape a new relationship between the over-regulated society and market forces. Originally, the European Community was set up in order to promote and enhance French/German reconciliation. The goals were political, the means economic. History forces us to redress the former equation. We have to discuss how to handle the questions of a common foreign and security policy, of the European pillar in the defence of Europe. In essence, it is necessary to strike a proper balance between the European Community, WEU (Western European Union) and Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). It is the Danish view that the common foreign and security policy should in principle extend to all aspects where unanimity can be achieved among the member states. Military co-operation proper should be undertaken within existing alliance structures with member states' present defence commitments being honoured. Member states should unanimously establish the common foreign and security policy. Denmark and the UK share the view that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, one thing will remain certain: without Nato, European defence arrangements would lack credibility, nor would they inspire confidence in the remaining part of Europe. The strength of the security glue, which for 40 years has kept western Europe together, is being reduced. That is why we consider it a major goal to avoid a re-nationalisation of defence policies in the new European Architecture. Europe's voice in the New World Order should be strengthened - economically, politically and defence-wise. If we fail and leave a disproportion between Europe's economic strength and its political resourcefulness, we would also leave a Europe on dangerous tracks. The days are gone when it really made sense to talk about autonomy and sovereignty. The issue before us is about pooling resources. By strengthening international co-operation you necessarily limit your room for manoeuvre - but also for making mistakes. To drive my point home: an economic and monetary union makes it impossible for a member state to pursue a high inflationary policy coupled with successive devaluations. We consider Emu a necessity. To some extent it is a natural consequence of the liberalisation of capital movements. We want to go ahead with the project after sufficient economic convergence has taken place, primarily because you can reap all the benefits only in the third phase. Second, because we want to have a say in the decisions which, in any case, set the framework for our own national policies. What does Europe really need then? We need the right blend of visions and ideas - of prudence and pragmatism. Ideas should be far-reaching, but not out of step with reality. Otherwise they could backfire and create a credibility problem. It may seem odd to hear such words from a Danish foreign minister. After all, we have for some years been seen as footdraggers in the Community. But we have reversed our policy. I admit it without hesitation. We have learned some lessons, and we consider it imperative to strengthen the Community in order to create our New Europe in the New World Order.</p>

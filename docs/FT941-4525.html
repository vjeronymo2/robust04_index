			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (9): An end to disparate systems - Integrated control / An integrated package can provide the route to a common source of information for the the company Of the 260 employees at plastics manufacturer EVC compounds, 150 or so use the Movex software installed in 1992. 'We had disparate systems, functional, but not integrated,' says Chris Droogan, commercial services director. 'If I asked for the sales figures, I'd get two or three answers - close, but not the same.' The company looked at a number of specialist manufacturing packages with financial systems as part of the solution. Swayed by the 'comfort factor' of seeing the software operating in a sister organisation, EVC became something of a pioneer for the AS400-based Movex software in the UK. Now Droogan can point to a 50 per cent reduction in working capital, stock reduced by 40 per cent, an IT budget that has been halved and an installation managed by two IT staff. 'We can target our attention on problems and areas of opportunity' says Droogan. 'Movex was the vehicle for change. We are now recognised as being able to deliver a high standard of customer service. The financial director has a better grip of financials: the level of control, speed, and quality of information has markedly improved.'

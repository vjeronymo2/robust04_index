			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / France's man of the moment: Ian Davidson on Europe If the French love a good anniversary, it is less for the warm pleasure of recollection than for the fierce passion of reliving old battles. In 1989 the celebration of the bicentenary demonstrated that the revolution is still not over, whatever the historians may say. Last year the centenary of the birth of Charles de Gaulle showed that the founder of the Fifth Republic can still provoke controversy from beyond the grave. This week, on Friday, we have the 10th anniversary of Francois Mitterrand's first presidential election victory; and much of the French political establishment is in a froth about it, either to celebrate or to denounce this decade of socialist government. Now 10 years in power is a long time for one man, as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's claque never ceased to remind us. But when it's over, it's over, and in the meantime it is an unremarkable span when measured against the tides of history. So it may seem disproportionate to speak of President Mitterrand's decade in the same breath as the centenary of de Gaulle or the bicentenary of the French Revolution. But there are two reasons why it may not be far-fetched. The first is that Mr Mitterrand has steadily grown in stature on the French national stage, and it has now become quite normal in France to measure him against de Gaulle. Indeed, a recent best-selling assessment of Mr Mitterrand was explicitly constructed as a point-by-point comparison between him and de Gaulle, and by no means always to Mr Mitterrand's disadvantage. Moreover, it is a measure of Mr Mitterrand's charisma that the opposition parties virtually never criticise him in person, an immunity which owes more to his acquired authority than to the eminence of his presidential office. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the opposition Gaullist RPR party, may denounce the socialists as 'evil-doers, incapable, immoral and intolerant', but he is careful not to name Mr Mitterrand in his denunciation. Mr Mitterrand's supporters would claim that he has already made a contribution to French history which is, in its own way, every bit as important as anything achieved by de Gaulle; and a contribution to European history which is far greater; and they may be right on both counts. After the humiliations of the Second World War, de Gaulle restored self-confidence in the arrogant diplomacy of the nation-state; after the switchbacks of the Fourth Republic, he restored belief in the reliability of strong government. But the flaw in the Gaullist legacy is its anachronism: having reached its apogee in the 19th century, the arrogance of the nation-state is out of date in the modern world. Moreover, the kind of strong government de Gaulle could deliver was too long on drama and too short on democratic sensitivity; he seized power through a virtual coup, and he was driven off by popular rejection. For journalists, de Gaulle was a delight; the combination of an international naughty boy, who was both a master of the theatrical coup and a master of the French language, was irresistible. But it wouldn't do for very long, and indeed it didn't. Outwardly, Mr Mitterrand has continued to drape himself in the Gaullist flag; he told the nation after the Gulf war that France had lived up to her 'rank' in the world. But his real attainments have been the exact opposite of the ambitions of de Gaulle, and they are likely to prove more durable. The first of these attainments is that he has presided over the conversion of the French people, both to an acceptance of the market economy, and to the overriding need for rigorous and stable economic management. Considering his heritage, this is extraordinary; he came to power with a policy combining Colbertism with socialism, and the mixture quickly proved lethal. His conversion to a different economic rulebook has achieved a result which eluded his conservative predecessors, including de Gaulle: the whole world now believes in a strong and stable franc. To make that other cross-reference, between Mr Mitterrand's 10 years in power and the French Revolution, may seem contrived; and Mr Mitterrand himself went through acrobatic contortions during the bicentenary celebrations to sanitise the historical record, as if five years of chaos and slaughter could be reduced to its immaculate prologue, the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Yet there are points of contrast, like the abolition of the death penalty in 1981, which are not irrelevant. Moreover, on the European scene the comparison is striking and far-reaching. The French Revolution led to the mobilisation of the nation in arms, for the conquest of Europe and the invasion of Russia. But the Napoleonic model of heroic action, which has lent such a frisson to national pride, is now in the final stages of being comprehensively junked (despite the Gulf war), in favour of an integrationist model which is civilian, law-based and democratic. Of course, this is not just Mr Mitterrand's doing: manifestly he is one of the moving spirits in the current acceleration of the European Community, but others had the idea before him, and others are vital to the process today. But that's just the point: this is a new model, which is just as revolutionary as the French Revolution, and a good deal more durable. Europe's integration process has been going on for longer, more consistently, and more constructively, than all the zig-zags, constitutions, communes and dictatorships which lay between the fall of the Bastille and the fall of Napoleon. In that sense the Mitterrand decade is shorthand for a sweeping transformation of the facts and assumptions of international life, such as has rarely taken place in history. In 1981 we had martial law in Poland and the Russians in Afghanistan; in 1991 we have the gradual implosion of the Soviet empire and the negotiation of treaties on economic and political union in western Europe. Put it this way: if you had to identify the past decade with one person, which are the other candidates? Would it be Reagan? Or Thatcher? Or Gorbachev?</p>

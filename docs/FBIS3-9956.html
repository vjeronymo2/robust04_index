			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Members of the political  opposition and Peruvian legal experts today termed as a "farce"  the military trial against nine of 11 Army officers involved in  the killing of 10 civilians.    The complaining parties stated their disagreement with the  imposed sentences by saying the investigations in this case were  neither thorough nor impartial, that the trial was not, in their  opinion, "trustworthy," and that its objective was "to shield"  Armed Forces and military intelligence top commanders .    The Military Court of the Supreme Council of Military  Justice  delivered sentences yesterday ranging from one to 20 years in  prison against the individuals accused of kidnapping and  murdering a professor and nine students of a Lima university  named La Cantuta.    The event, which occurred early 18 July 1992, generated a  confrontation between the political opposition and the Armed  Forces, whose top commander, Nicolas Hermoza, went as far as  warning he "would not tolerate" any campaign of discredit  against the military institution.    Army Commander Hermoza and Presidential Adviser Vladimiro  Montesinom, a member of the National Intelligence Service, have  been accused by General Rodolfo Robles, who is self-exiled in  Argentina for directing "death squadrons." The two have been  accused of being involved in the La Cantuta case.    Saul Cuadros, one of the attorneys of relatives of the  civilian victims, has said: "Everything indicates the  government has politicized the objective of the process so that  in a not too distant future the convicts may benefit from an  amnesty or a pardon." Cuadros said during the trial, which was  held behind closed doors and under strict security measures at  the Simon Bolivar Barracks of Lima's Pueblo Libre District, no  evidence was presented and no witness was called to the stand.    Enrique Bernales, a former UN Human Rights Commission  relator, has affirmed no investigation has been carried out and  that the quick sentencing indicates "everything was ready  beforehand." He said the sentences were passed before the case  was transferred to the military. The ruling came only 48 hours  after the files on the case were received, and "it is impossible  to read such a voluminous file in such a short period."    The government representatives have praised the military  judges, though, noting the sentences are a "very good example"  for the Andean country.    Carlos Torres, first vice president of the Peruvian  Congress,  has said the sentences have no precedent "in the legal history  of Peru or Latin America."    President Alberto Fujimori has termed the sentences "drastic  and exemplary," and he discarded the possibility of any member  of the Armed Forces Command being involved in the death of the  10 civilians, as relatives of the victims, the political  opposition, and the independent media have charged.    Legislator Gloria Helfer, of the Democratic Left Movement,  commenting on what Torres has said, stated the military court  "can break any fast-reading world record after having read and  analyzed a file containing thousands of pages."    Roger Caceres, former president of the Legislative Branch  human rights commission, has said: "Sooner or later, the La  Cantuta case will have to be reassessed in a legal and moral  framework that is impartial and just."    Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who  has visited Lima to inaugurate the first Latin American Rural  Organizations Congress on 21 February, called for a more  exemplary punishment for the military personnel and for the  trial to be directed toward a civilian court.    The military court sentenced Majors Santiago Martin Rivas  and  Carlos Pichilingue Guevara to 20 years in prison. They were  found guilty of being the direct authors of the crime and of  having acted on their own, without the knowledge of the Armed  Forces command staff.    To justify the transfer of the "La Cantuta" case to the  military courts, Colonel Raul Talledo, the military prosecutor,  has said the crime had been committed while on duty in an area  that was in a state of emergency due to the political violence.    During the trial, which lasted three days, the military  court  also sentenced noncommissioned officers Julio Chuqui Aguirre,  Jesus Sosa Saavedra, Nelson Carbajal Garcia, and Pedro Suppo  Sanchez to 15 years in prison.    General Juan Rivero Lazo, who was director of Army  intelligence when the military personnel raided "La Cantuta"  University in eastern Lima, was sentenced to five years in  prison, and Colonel Federico Navarro to two years. Both were  found guilty of negligence.    Captain Jose Velarde Astete was given a year, the lowest  sentence, as it was considered his participation in the crime  had been minimal.    Furthermore, the military court absolved Col. Manuel Guzman  Calderon and reserved its sentence on Lieutenant Aquilino  Portella, who was tried in absence because he escaped to a  foreign country.</p>

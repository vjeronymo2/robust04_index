			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Digital decoders for Canal Plus Canal Plus, the French pay-TV company, has moved nearer the launch of multimedia services by placing orders for digital decoders for satellite broadcast transmissions. The company has ordered decoders from five manufacturers - Philips, Pioneer, Sony, Thomson-TCE and Eurodec, an affiliate of Canal Plus which manufacturers the current decoders. The digital decoders, which will be introduced in June next year, will be used for the usual TV and video inputs and will also be compatible with personal computers and telephones, enabling Canal Plus to offer interactive services. According to Canal Plus, its so-called Digital Project, which will offer interactive services, will be launched in the last quarter of next year. The company has declined to give details of the project, but analysts expect it to include games and video on demand. It will also allow multiplexing, by which a variety of programmes and services can be offered on the same channel. Canal Plus has already reserved transmitters on the Astra1E and Astra1F satellites for the launch of its digital services.</p>

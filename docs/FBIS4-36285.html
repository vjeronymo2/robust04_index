			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the  Presidential Council, said that stopping the war is the thing  that stops danger. As long as there is a war existing there are  dangers existent and the main loser is the Yemeni people. He  clarified that our infrastructure is subjected to destruction  and that those who are imposing war on us now have no cause,  emphasizing that we have a cause for which we are struggling and  that we are owners of the right. This came in a press interview  held by the AL-KHALIJ newspaper of the United Arab Emirates with  Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the Presidential Council,  and published in its issue dated 5 June.    He clarified that what is going on in Yemen today is not a  Yemeni issue only. The project that collided with the unity  project and spoiled it is another project connected to many  projects and how can we explain that Iran was displeased by the  UN Security Council's resolution concerning Yemen? He added  that the issue now is the issue of the Gulf states, the  stability of the people, and the interests of these countries.  Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid went on to say: The others are trying to  impose the Gulf crisis on us, but [words indistinct] its  expansion to another region in the south of the Arabian  Peninsula.    In his reply to a question about published information  mentioning that there are Jordanian airplanes which are  providing Sanaa with weapons and ammunition, Mr. 'Ali Salim  al-Bid said: Yes, there is information about this matter. In  the beginning I did not believe it, but when we followed up the  matter we got sure about it. I did not expect this stand from  Jordan. It is me who went to King Husayn to help us in reaching  a solution and mediation. I had not expected this. I had not  wanted King Husayn's stand to be heard, but this is their state  policy. This is their own concern.    About the relations of the Democratic Republic of Yemen with  the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the  chairman of the Presidential Council said: We created here a  state which wants stability. I consider it in the first defense  line of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. We are seeking  stability and he who seeks stability continues as a defense line  for all those who seek stability anywhere.</p>

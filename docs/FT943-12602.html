			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Books: Gown v town - Fiction HUNGRY GENERATIONS by John Wain Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 378 pages CATALYSTS by Stanley Middleton Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 266 pages When John Wain died in May, aged 69, he had been working on his trilogy of novels set in Oxford for the past decade. Parts one and two, Where The Rivers Meet and Comedies, appeared in 1988 and 1992. Posthumous publication of Hungry Generations completes the work; it is built around the lives of two brothers, the sons of an Oxford publican. One is a skilled worker at the Morris factory at Cowley, and the other a history don at an imaginary college called Episcopus. Where Rivers Meet is the over-all title. Not only does Oxford stand at the confluence of the Thames and the Cherwell, it also has two distinct faces, as a centre of industry and of learning, both of which are contained in the work. There is rather more of gown than of town in this final volume. Events are seen through the mind of the academic brother Peter Leonard. By 1948, when it starts, he has reached the age of 38, and he remains in Oxford teaching history until the crunch-year of 1956 with news of the Suez adventure, and the march of Soviet troops into Hungary, reaching him as the story ends. It was a conscious gamble by the novelist to stake everything on Oxford. It has been done to death in detective fiction and often used by serious novelists such as Compton Mackenzie, Waugh and Murdoch who have looked back to their time there as an essential element in a larger work - Sinister Street, Brideshead Revisited, The Book and The Brotherhood. But to find it treated by a novelist as the summation of a lifetime's experience is unique. Wain leaves one in no doubt as to his deep affection for the city in spite of the spoilations of Billy Morris, as the hero's father calls Lord Nuffield. His clever son, historian of the 18th century, shares Wain's insatiable curiosity about everything from the mating habits of the sparrows on the college lawn, to the construction of the P3 MG racing-car and the sex theories of Wilhelm Reich. Their main function seems to be to distract the reader from the hard core of pain that might otherwise make the book unbearable to read. Pessimism about human possibility is the dominant mood. There is the long agony of Leonard's divorce and humiliating return to live like a single man in college; the pain of trying to reconcile the bitter after-taste of his first marriage with the domestic bliss of his second (a cloying note); the pain of the death of his son in a motor-racing accident and the series of disasters that befall other members of the senior common room. The hero is Wain's alter ego, the Oxford don that Wain never became. Teaching and research was a way of life he firmly rejected when he resigned his lectureship at Reading in 1955 after the success of Hurry On Down. Wain could then have become a leading journalist critic in London. But he did not want to be that either. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; after a year he resigned that too. Instead he went to live near Oxford. It was a quiet, industrious and inevitably insecure existence, but it enabled him to do his own thing, which was to write novels and poetry. With Catalysts Stanley Middleton shows that he belongs to that small number of novelists able to integrate convincing accounts of musical performance into the texture of a novel of contemporary life. They include Proust, EM Forster, Aldous Huxley and JB Priestley. Here we are with the elderly music teacher at a school in the Midlands. His son is a cellist of renown whose mistress is an opera star. There are several fine descriptions of them in action in a novel that shows with great subtlety the way professional life acts as a catalyst upon private life. It does this just as much in the unglamorous professions of the other main characters - accountancy and English teaching. This quintet weave in and out of each others' lives in a novel that is not so much written as delicately scored. Middleton, joint Booker Prize-winner, is a master-technician of the form. His latest piece of work will give much pleasure to its connoisseurs.</p>

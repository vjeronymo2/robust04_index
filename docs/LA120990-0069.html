			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CATS HAVE RAVE REACTIONS TO VIDEO OF CAVORTING BIRDS  </P> <P> Steve Malarkey was a disgruntled computer technician looking for a career  change when his cat leaped forward with an idea.  </P> <P> "I was sitting in front of the TV with my wife, watching a National Geographic  special on birds of the Cayman Islands or somewhere," he said.  </P> <P> "Our cat, Stick, who never even glanced at TV before, came out of his box like  a shot and sat right in front of the screen, growling and meowing."  </P> <P> Malarkey borrowed a friend's video camera and tripod, scattered birdseed and  popcorn in his wooded back yard and recorded the antics of neighborhood birds,  squirrels and chipmunks that gathered for a noisy feast.  </P> <P> "When I brought the tape back to the house and showed it to Stick, he went  ballistic," Malarkey said. "He was in front of the TV, behind the TV, on top of  the TV, knocking things over and swiping at the screen."  </P> <P> Nice kitty.  </P> <P> Malarkey went into the "cat business" in a big way. His "Video Catnip," a  professional, 25-minute version of the same back yard scene, is one of the  hottest gift items to appear on pet store shelves this Christmas season.  </P> <P> Malarkey says he's sold 7,000 copies since his video hit the market in  September, 1989, most of them in the last couple of months. Fewer than 10 tapes  have been returned on behalf of dissatisfied feline viewers, he said.  </P> <P> Human viewers might find "Video Catnip" boring after a while. There's just so  much excitement in watching a pair of blue jays squabbling or a squirrel  snitching a peanut from a bowl.  </P> <P> But Malarkey, who recently moved from this Washington suburb to Morgantown,  W.Va., says it's the purr-fect stocking stuffer for the indoor cat who has  everything.  </P> <P> "Steven Spielberg it ain't," he said, "but we haven't gotten any complaints yet  from the cats."  </P> <P> The tape, which retails for $19.95, promises "some cat-a-clysmic fun with no  paws in the action." It starts with this warning:  </P> <P> "While watching this video, your cat may become excited and attempt to get  inside your television set to get at the birds. . . . We strongly suggest that  you remove all breakables from on top or around your TV set. No kitting."  </P> <P> The live action is divided into segments titled "Cheep Thrills," "Mews and  Feather Report" and "A Stalk in the Park," which features plenty of close-up  shots of kitty's favorite creatures cavorting on the TV screen.  </P> <P> Can cats really "see" a TV video?  </P> <P> Veterinarians agree with Malarkey that although cats don't discern shapes and  colors as distinctly as humans, they are acutely aware of moving figures and  sounds that excite them.  </P></p>

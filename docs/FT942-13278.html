			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Lloyds' High Court hurdle - The legal obstacles before the UK bank's plans to take over the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Before Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society gets the green light there are several regulatory hurdles it must clear. The most immediate and arguably the stiffest test will come in the High Court on May 23. At issue will be whether Lloyds, as parent of the subsidiary which will run the C&amp;G if the deal goes through, is entitled to make cash payments to C&amp;G's members and whether payments can be made to anyone who has not been an investing member of the society for at least two years. The Building Societies Commission, regulator of the UK's 84 societies, will argue that Lloyds is prevented from making cash payments by the terms of the 1986 Building Societies Act. But it is widely accepted that the legislation is unclear on the issue of third-party payments. Defeat for C&amp;G would mean Lloyds has to think again. The bank has indicated that it may try to pay C&amp;G members in preference shares if barred from making cash payments. The act does not prevent payments in the form of shares. Victory, on the other hand, could open the way for a number of takeovers in the industry. The issue of cash inducements has been causing problems since 1989 when the commission issued guidance notes suggesting that the scope for making cash payments to a society's members during a takeover was severely limited. The guidance notes say the 1986 act provides that the agreement for transferring ownership of a society 'may include provision for part of the funds of the society or its successor company to be distributed among members of the society'. The successor company to C&amp;G under the Lloyds bid would be the C&amp;G subsidiary of the bank. However, any distribution of funds to a society's members 'shall only be made to those members who held shares in the society throughout the period of two years which expired with the qualifying day (for payments)'. According to the commission no distribution of funds can be made to shareholding members of less than two years' standing and not at all to a society's borrowing members. The notes go on to say that the 'funds' to be distributed must be the funds of the society or the successor company. If funds were made available for the transfer by a parent company they would be reflected as a liability in the successor company's balance sheet and so become part of its funds. So it is not possible to circumvent the two-year shareholder qualification in the act by a third party or parent company such as Lloyds making the cash payments to C&amp;G's members. C&amp;G's lawyers, City solicitors Slaughter and May, will argue that the act says nothing specific about the role of third parties in making cash payments as part of a takeover deal and that the commission's guidance on this point is open to doubt. Slaughters claims that most building society and banking lawyers feel the act is badly drafted and unclear in a number of areas and needs clarifying. The Treasury has already started a review of the 1986 act which is looking at issues such as mergers and acquisitions, but any reform of the legislation is likely to come too late for Lloyds. The commission does not dispute that the act is poorly drafted, but insists nevertheless that Parliament clearly intended the two-year shareholder rule to apply across the board in order to prevent speculative outflows of a society's funds. If all shareholders were entitled to cash payments, speculators might be tempted to seek profits by investing heavily on a market rumour of a takeover. Not all lawyers are convinced by this line of argument. Mr Peter Holland, partner of City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, says that while there clearly is a need to try to prevent speculative outflows of society funds, it is difficult to see that a society would be weakened if the payment is made by a third party. But as about 60 per cent to 80 per cent of shareholders in most building societies would qualify for cash payments as two-year shareholders, why is it necessary to offer cash inducements to anyone outside that group? Lloyds is offering all savers 10 per cent of the balance in their account on March 31, 1994 and voting members - those with Pounds 100 or more in Cheltenham Gold, London Share, Instant 7 or Tessa accounts on December 31, 1993 - an extra Pounds 500 for each account up to a maximum Pounds 10,000 per account. Borrowers will also get Pounds 500 per property and holders of permanent interest-bearing shares Pounds 500 per holding. The main reason for such generous inducements, says Mr Holland, is that without them it would be very hard for the bid to secure the necessary support from shareholders. The 1986 act sets a severe threshold on the approval a transfer has to be given by a society's members. A society's shareholding members must approve the transfer by special resolution, that is with a 75 per cent majority of those voting on the basis of one member one vote. In addition, the resolution has to be passed by not less than 50 per cent of all members qualified to vote; or by shareholders representing not less than 90 per cent of the total value of the shares held by voting members. This means either 50 per cent in number of the members or the holders of 90 per cent on value of the shares must vote in favour of the resolution for it to pass. In a regular company takeover acceptances can build up over a period of time; but a building society takeover must secure all votes in favour on one 'voting date'. The borrowing members must also approve the transfer. With voting procedures like this it is easy to see why building society takeovers are not for the faint-hearted, says Mr Holland. The general opinion in the City is that without generous cash inducements the chances of securing the required vote on the day are remote. The High Court action between the commission and C&amp;G is therefore crucial to the Lloyds bid. Few lawyers are prepared to bet on the outcome, but there is a feeling that cash payments should be approved because in the C&amp;G deal's particular circumstances there is little chance of speculative outflows of the society's money. The City sees the commission's action in this case as meaning it is opposed to the conversion or takeover of societies. But most lawyers acknowledge that as there is doubt on the issue of cash payments, the commission is right to test the legislation in the courts. Mr Holland says that it is understandable that the commission should not want to approve a transfer outside the terms of the act. During the Abbey National flotation in 1988 a number of members' groups lobbied against the conversion and there are bound to be some C&amp;G members who say they are not going to be 'bribed' into accepting the Lloyds deal. The problem therefore is not that the commission is opposed to the conversion or transfer of societies, but that the legislation needs clarifying. This is clearly an issue that the Treasury's review of the 1986 act must look at whatever the outcome of next month's court case.</p>

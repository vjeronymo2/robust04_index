			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Week Ahead: Thorn is aiming to make sweet music Analysts on Tuesday will be examining with interest the results from Thorn EMI. This will be the first time the music and rental group has reported on a first quarter. Music accounts for nearly two-thirds of Thorn's profits, and operating figures of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m are being forecast for the division out of total overall profits of between Pounds 67m and Pounds 77m. A goodwill write-down on the sale of some non-core assets should bring in pre-tax profits around the Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m mark. Thorn's rental business, which includes Rumbelows in the UK and Rent-A-Centre in the US, should chip in with operating profits of around Pounds 25m. Interim pre-tax profits at Kerry, the Irish meat, dairy and food ingredients group, are expected to be up about 10 per cent to IPounds 15m when its six months' results to June 30 are announced on Wednesday. Lower margins in the dairy and red meat divisions are expected to be more than offset by continuing strong growth in the group's expanding food ingredients and food divisions, according to Dublin analysts. The continuing rationalisation and re-structuring of Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, is expected to pay off on Tuesday with first-half profits ahead 42 per cent to Pounds 10m (Pounds 7m). Its re-focused UK operations are also likely to make a healthy contribution, although demand remains patchy in the US and flat in continental Europe. Marley, the building materials group, is expected on Wednesday to report a sharp increase in first-half profits following exceptional gains from the sale of its French roof tile subsidiary and increased volumes in the UK market. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 26m (Pounds 13.2m), with the disposal of Alsace-based Bisch contributing about Pounds 8m to the total. Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property group, is expected on Wednesday to announce interims of around Pounds 31m for the first half of 1994, up from Pounds 28.8m. The group has made no meaningful asset disposals during the period, and the performance for the year is likely to reflect improving occupancy levels and the phasing-out of incentives for rental agreement. The Telegraph, reporting on Wednesday, is expected to make first-half profits of about Pounds 34m-Pounds 35m, up from last time's Pounds 28m. The continuing price war with The Times (and, latterly, the Independent), affected only nine days of the half; thus, it should not have dented the predictions. After an 18 per cent advertising revenue growth in the first quarter, the second saw some slippage although 1993's second quarter had been robust. Analysts are asking if future advertising growth will balance the inevitable circulation revenue shortfall. Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the composite insurance companies, is expected to post pre-tax profits of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m when it reports interims on Thursday. The company revealed profits of Pounds 65m at the same stage last year. Like its competitors - three of which reported better than expected first-half profits earlier this month - GRE should benefit from the buoyancy of trading conditions in the UK where premium rates increases, more selective underwriting and milder weather are allowing underwriting profits. Problems at a number of its US offices will depress profits at Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, when it reports interims on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are expected to fall to between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m, compared with Pounds 63.1m last year. The group, formed by the merger of Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black in 1990, also has been hit in the US by the defection of a large team of construction insurance specialists to a rival company. A maiden contribution from Securiguard will ensure that Rentokil remains on a strong growth track when it announces interim results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to exceed Pounds 83m for the six months to June, representing a 24 per cent increase. Securiguard should contribute close to Pounds 7m of the additional earnings, but Rentokil's core businesses should continue to show rapid growth. Weir Group announces its interims on Thursday, with Panmure Gordon forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m, up from Pounds 16.7m a year ago (which included a Pounds 2.43m exceptional item for redundancy and reorganisation costs). This would put the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering products group on course to fulfil City estimates of Pounds 40m-Pounds 43m for the full year, compared with Pounds 37.5m in 1993.</p>

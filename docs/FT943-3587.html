			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: US paper group could raise Dollars 700m in sell-off Kimberly-Clark, the US paper group best known for its branded tissue products, plans to dispose of its pulp and newsprint businesses. Analysts said the potential sale or spin-off of the commodity operations could raise as much as Dollars 700m. The company is evaluating the options for divesting a pulp mill in Terrace Bay, Ontario, and its pulp and newsprint mill in Coosa Pines, Alabama. It said it was considering both a sale and an initial public stock offering. Kimberly-Clark's pulp and paper operations supply the company with its raw paper materials. They have been sluggish performers during a prolonged recession in pulp and paper prices, but the pulp and newsprint markets have seen a sharp price rebound. The sale of the Coosa and Terrace Bay operations would enable Kimberly-Clark to focus on global expansion of its consumer products businesses. It is a strong competitor to Procter &amp; Gamble for branded personal paper products in the US, but has a smaller overseas presence. Last year the company formed new subsidiaries or joint ventures to manufacture and market consumer products in Argentina, Venezuela, China, Indonesia, India and the Middle East.</p>

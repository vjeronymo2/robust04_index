			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Upbeat Lion Nathan forecasts record result Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in Australia and New Zealand, has forecast continued profits growth of between 8 and 10 per cent a year. Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, yesterday told the annual meeting the company had started the 1994-95 financial year strongly, with profitability in the first quarter substantially above last year. Pre-tax earnings in the financial year to next August 31 would be a record. However, net earnings were expected to be below the NZDollars 204m (USDollars 129.1m) posted in 1993-94. He said the economic upswing in Australia had meant a significant strengthening in beer consumption over the past six months. The company's market share had stabilised at 44 per cent. Mr Myers said that Lion Nathan had caused the most dynamic improvements in Australian brewing in 200 years, in part by forcing new industrial practices. 'Once Australian breweries were inefficient and rigid: now they are highly efficient. Our breweries are the most productive in the world, and so flexible that most can today brew all our main regional brands.' He found it encouraging that in New Zealand there had been a 1.1 per cent growth in the overall beer market, and volumes had risen by 1.6 per cent. Lion Nathan was making good progress with its plans to build breweries in the main coastal regions of China.</p>

Yasushi Akashi delivered his assessment on a NATO proposal  to  use air power to relieve trapped Canadian UN troops in the  eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla Airport in  Bosnia's northeast.    The UN official, who asked not to be named, said Akashi gave  his report Monday to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  who must authorise any air operations in Bosnia.    Informed sources said Akashi argued against using warplanes  in Srebrenica since the Serbs had given their agreement in  principle to the rotation of the Canadians and only technical  points remained to be resolved.    Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday his  self-proclaimed "parliament" has decided to allow UN troops into  Srebrenica to relieve UN soldiers trapped there for the last six  months.    Diplomats in Geneva said the Serbs were wary of allowing the  rotation to be used as a pretext for strenghtening the UN  military presence in the besieged enclave.    Karadzic, cited by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, said  Dutch UN troops scheduled to replace the Canadians in Srebrenica  would be allowed to go in "as of tomorrow" provided they were  "the same number and with the same weapons."    However, he ruled out any reopening of the Tuzla airport.    Akashi said that the reopening of Tuzla airport, closed sice  May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills, was not  worth the effort since land access to the city was often  possible, the sources said.    They said Akashi further maintained that any air raids could  unleash Serb reprisals against UN troops protecting relief  operations in Bosnia.    Butrus-Ghali met Monday with Akashi and other top aides and  ordered plans drafted to unblock Srebrenica and Tuzla Airport, a  spokeswoman said. But she gave no sign whether he would  authorise NATO air strikes.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit last week  proposed using warplanes in Srebrenica and at Tuzla Airport  after failing to agree on air strikes to end the siege of  Sarajevo as it offered to do in August.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sweet success for Saudi banks - The 1993 reporting season has been jam today, but what of 1994? The first rash of Saudi banks reporting 1993 figures has shown continued buoyancy in what has been one of the Middle East's most profitable banking markets since the Gulf war - but analysts are cautioning that economic pressures on the kingdom are almost certain to trim profits this year. The continued weakness in the oil price - the overwhelming determinant of the Saudi economy's health - has already shrunk economic activity, according to bankers in Riyadh. This, plus the government's attempt to attack its fiscal deficit through a 20 per cent across-the-board cut in public spending, is estimated by some economists in the kingdom to foreshadow shrinkage in the economy of between 5 and 7 per cent for 1994, with attendant effects on bank performance. '1993 will be a nice year to look back on,' said one banking analyst. However, among the first of the kingdom's commercial banks to report 1993 figures, Saudi Hollandi Bank, which is 40 per cent owned by ABN-Amro Bank of the Netherlands, recorded a 34.5 per cent rise in net profits to a record SR180.1m (Dollars 48m). The bank, one of only two of the kingdom's listed commercial banks not to have recapitalised on the Saudi stock market over the past two years, said it would transfer all 1993 earnings into general reserves and pay no dividend. In a statement, the bank said it would set aside SR50m for loan loss reserves. Deposits slipped to SR8.44bn from SR8.48bn. Total assets rose to SR15.1bn from SR13.52bn. Saudi Cairo, meanwhile, announced a 59.4 per cent rise in profits for 1993 to SR214.3m. The figure marks a strong recovery from the bank's struggle with bad debt in the late 1980s - Saudi Cairo recorded no profit in 1991, but wiped out much of its bad debt portfolio with a recapitalisation in 1993, doubling paid-up capital to SR1.2bn with a 6m share offering. The bank, in which Egypt's Banque du Caire holds a 20 per cent stake, said it had allocated SR40m for loan loss provisions in 1993 and will pay a dividend for the first time in nine years. The board recommended a SR120m payout, or SR10 a share. Assets rose to SR15.6bn from SR13.4bn a year earlier. Arab National Bank, which is 40 per cent owned by Arab Bank, the Jordanian pan-Arab bank group, also reported a rise in 1993 profits, up 28.7 per cent to SR495.2m. The board has recommended a dividend of SR337m, a third up on 1992. Loan loss provisions were held at SR62m and assets rose to SR32.41m from SR28.65. Saudi American Bank, in which Citicorp holds a 30 per cent stake, announced a 3.5 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to SR942.2m - a figure in line with analyst's expectations and based, according to the bank, on continued strength in the retail sector. Assets rose to SR39.79bn from SR38.28bn, and deposits were up to SR30.07bn from SR29.06bn. The bank doubled share capital in 1993 to SR1.2bn with a SR600m transfer from reserves. Shareholder funds in 1993 rose to SR3.24bn from SR2.62 after an SR820m increase in general reserves from SR200m. Analysts said Saudi American's more modest proportionate rise in profits reflected both the fact that it has been operating more profitably than most other Saudi banks for longer and that, unlike many of its competitors, it did not inject equity during 1992 or 1993 - something which had offered some other banks the use of essentially zero-cost fresh funds.</p>

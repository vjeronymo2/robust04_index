The Polish president is accompanied by an  official state delegation of advisers and experts. Walesa was  met at the airport by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs, Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs,  Dainis Turlais, the commander of the Defense Forces, and foreign  ambassadors accredited in Latvia. The presidents of the two  countries attended a parade by the Latvian defense forces.    An hour ago at Riga Castle, Walesa and Ulmanis signed a  joint  political declaration on strengthening friendship and  cooperation between Latvia and Poland, a declaration on the  resumption of work of the agreements concluded between Latvia  and Poland between 1922 and 1938--which provides for  reconsideration and assessment of those documents--as well as an  agreement on legal assistance between Latvia and Poland in  civil, family, labor, and criminal cases. These documents were  signed by Latvia's Foreign Minister Andrejevs and Iwo Byczewski,  Polish deputy minister of foreign affairs.</p>

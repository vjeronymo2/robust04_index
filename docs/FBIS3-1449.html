			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Fighting around ULIMO [United Liberation Movement  for Democracy in Liberia] headquarters in Tubmanburg has put the  Liberian peace process in serious jeopardy in the last few days,  with plans to set up a transition council and to demobilize the  warring factions being dealt a serious blow. The fighting  appears to have been between two ULIMO factions -- one under  Alhaji Koromah and supported by the Mandingo people; the other  by Krahns, led by ULIMO's military wing chairman, Roosevelt  Johnson. But there have also been reports that Charles Taylor's  NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces were also  involved in the fighting on Roosevelt Johnson's side. Well,  today we spoke to Roosevelt Johnson himself, and on the line to  Monrovia, Audrie Brown asked him what he knew about the fighting:    [Begin recording] [Johnson] Well, the fighting started early  yesterday morning and died down in the evening.    [Brown] And, how many people were involved in this fighting?    [Johnson] Roughly, 2,000 something men went in to rescue the  people there.    [Brown] Who are the people they went to rescue?    [Johnson] The relatives. The relatives and some other  soldiers that were being held hostage there.    [Brown] What kind of losses did your side sustain?    [Johnson] Well, only two soldiers got wounded on the leg and  they have been treated now in Bong Mines, and a few days ago my  mother was slaughtered together with my two kids and my sister.    [Brown] You lost your mother and your children in this  fighting?    [Johnson] Well, it was not actually in the fighting. They  were coming to Tubmanburg, and they were captured by some of the  Mandingo soldiers and they were slaughtered.    [Brown] So in this fighting your side are, I understand,  Krahn soldiers and you are fighting Mandingos. Why are you  fighting now? What is behind the latest fighting, this fighting  that started on Friday [25 March]?    [Johnson] Well, it is because the Mandingo people, the few  Mandingo people who are loyal to Koromah, continue to kill  innocent people. Once you cannot speak Mandingo, they kill you.    [Brown] So when did they kill innocent people?    [Johnson] They have been killing them for the past three  weeks, because as Koromah said we did not vote for Sheriff to  become chairman on the Council, so that annoyed them and this is  the reason why they have started disarming all other tribes, you  know, within ULIMO, and that's when they started killing.    [Brown] Now, there are reports that you are fighting with  Charles Taylor's NPFL. Can you confirm this?    [Johnson] This is not true. The information is completely  misleading. I have had no connection with Taylor to get men  from Taylor, or whatsoever connection. I don't have any  connection with Taylor. The men that are fighting are purely  ULIMO soldiers, and not only Krahn. What happened we....  [pauses] In the ULIMO we have all tribes there, and those  soldiers that went in were not only Krahn. We have Grebo; we  have Bassa, and other tribes mix with them.    [Brown] So are you in control of Tubmanburg now?    [Johnson] Definitely not. [as heard] Yes. I can tell you  that my men on grounds now in Tubmanburg.    [Brown] If you have captured Tubmanburg, what have you done  with the people who supported Alhaji Koromah who were still  there?    [Johnson] Look, it is not our intention to kill anybody.  Okay? So, even when we are fighting with NPFL, when we capture  the NPFL soldiers we don't kill them. So I don't see why I  should capture anybody from Alhaji Koromah's side and kill them.  But the only thing is we had to move in militarily to bring the  situation under control.    [Brown] So have you taken them prisoner?    [Johnson] Those that I have captured, yes, they are  prisoners.    [Brown] So where do you go from now? You say you have  captured Tubmanburg. Do you now want Alhaji Koromah to step down  as the leader of ULIMO and you be leader or you choose another  leader, or what do you want now?    [Johnson] We will decide that at a later date. We have to  meet our men and listen to them, and listen to their suggestions  before we can make comments on such a thing.    [Brown] So where is Alhaji Koromah now?    [Johnson] I understand he went to Guinea.    [Brown] And the rest of the ULIMO leadership, were they in  Tubmanburg when the fighting started, and have you taken them  prisoner?    [Johnson] They are in hiding. [end recording]</p>

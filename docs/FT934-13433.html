			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Hectic trading in World Bank's first D-Mark issue TRADING in the World Bank's first D-Mark global bond offering got off to a hectic start yesterday as latecomers scrambled to get a piece of the action. The 10-year bonds were priced to yield six basis points over the 6 per cent German government bond due 2003, at the low end of the indicated price range of six to eight basis points. As soon as the bonds were freed to trade, the spread rapidly narrowed to two basis points as dealers tried to execute four or five large buy orders from non-bank clients. However, the spread was expected to widen out as trading settled down. Syndicate managers said the launch of the DM3bn issue had been a success, especially with international investors who regarded the bonds as a good way to play the German bond market without having to buy German government bonds. They added that the liquidity of the issue was still untested. There was some concern in the market that the bonds could become illiquid over time because of the size of the deal and the good interest from retail investors. Two large Eurobond offerings are expected to be launched over the next few weeks from new issuers which intend to become frequent users of the Eurobond market. Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden (UMB) plans to raise Dollars 500m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds in the next few weeks. This will be UMB's first fixed-rate offering in the Eurobond market. The aim of the issue is to increase UMB's profile with international investors so that it can diversify its funding base. UMB raises most of its annual borrowing needs of SKr50bn in the domestic bond market. However, it intends to raise 15 per cent to 20 per cent of this amount in the international bond market in the future. UMB has been encouraged to come to the Eurobond market by the improvement in spreads on Nordic paper over the past few months. Spreads had widened during the region's financial crisis late last year. UMB officials, in London yesterday to talk to investors, declined to comment on pricing. A spread of 60 basis points over US Treasuries has been rumoured but some syndicate managers said a spread at that level would be too tight for a borrower with a single-A rating and a low international profile. Lead manager Nomura said the bonds would not be priced at a level where they would not sell. Instituto Nacional de Industria (Ini), the Spanish state industrial holding company, awarded the mandate for its first Eurobond offering to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint bookrunners. Ini's Dollars 500m issue is likely to have a maturity of five or 10 years and be launched in the second half of November. Among yesterday's issues, GECC became the first issuer, apart from the Asian Development Bank, to return to the dragon bond market with a Dollars 250m offering of three-year bonds. The bonds were priced to yield 18 basis points over underlying US Treasuries.</p>

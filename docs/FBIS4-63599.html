			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul May 23 TASS -- The upcoming Russo-South-Korean  summit will primarily confirm the fact that constructive and  mutually complementing relations of partnership already exist  between our two countries, said South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam in an interview to Russian journalists accredited in  Seoul. The South Korean president spoke in the run up to his  official visit to Moscow scheduled on June 1-4.    He pointed out that thanks to summit talks "the sad past  will  remain in the past" and be replaced by a new epoch of friendship  and cooperation. The two countries have become important  partners in the process of mutual cooperation in various fields,  including economy, culture and security. The president said  that he believes that his forthcoming visit to Russia will  enable to strengthen friendly relations between the two  countries.    Russia plays an important role in South Korea's diplomacy,  politics and security since strengthening ties between the two  countries is necessary for security on the Korean Peninsula,  where confrontation remains since the times of the Cold war, and  for the creation of a basis for Korea's peaceful unification and  ensuring peace in north-east Asia, the Korean president said.    He pointed out that for over 110 years since diplomatic  relations were established in 1884 when a Russo-Korean trade  agreement was signed, there have been many twists in bilateral  relations, but for a short period of time, beginning from 1990,  bilateral relations developed steadily both politically and  economically.    Sharing common values, the two countries are going along the  way of developing new relations of partnership, friendship and  mutual assistance. The president expressed the hope that after  his visit the relations between the two countries will become  stronger. The president went on to say that for economic  cooperation, South Korea and Russia should seek to rely on the  principle of mutually complementing each other as much as  possible. Kim Yong-sam pointed out that an efficient use of  Russia's advanced technologies and natural resources and Korea's  industrial technologies and economic experience will enable the  two countries to strengthen their competitiveness on the  international market.    The Korean president admitted that for various reasons South  Korean businessmen had failed to penetrate into Russia on a  large scale. However, he expressed the hope that his visit  would promote the expansion of Korean investments into Russia,  and in particular, in Russia's Far Eastern regions.    Bilateral trade between Russia and South Korea has been  steadily on the rise since 1992, and this year, the volume of  bilateral trade is expected to reach 2 billion dollars, the  Korean president said. He pointed out that during his meeting  with Boris Yeltsin the two sides will discuss projects for  further development of cooperation, including in such spheres as  environmental protection and construction.</p>

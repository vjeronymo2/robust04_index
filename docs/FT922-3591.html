			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Four convicted in biggest UK insider dealing prosecution FOUR former employees of finan-cial institutions, alleged to have been part of the first insider dealing ring to be prosecuted, were convicted at the Old Bailey yesterday. At the end of the biggest UK insider dealing prosecution, which, with the Department of Trade and Industry investigation which preceded it, is understood to have cost about Pounds 350,000, Judge Laughland spoke of a 'web of illegality'. He said tape recordings of telephone conversations between the four displayed 'greedy cynicism' in 'brazen defiance' of the law passed to inhibit insider dealing. 'You were part of a network of associates who thought it right quite openly to defy the restrictions on the communication of inside information, for your own financial benefit. 'The mischief of your offences is that they are, if uncontrolled, destructive of the confidence which the international financial community reposes in the City.' Damage had been done not only to other investors or potential investors in the City but to the whole financial community and to the public, the judge said. He said Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, had been 'very much at the centre of this web of illegality'. Mr Gray was given concurrent six-month prison sentences, suspended for two years, and fined Pounds 5,000, on each of two convictions of dealing on the basis of price sensitive information. He was conditionally discharged for 12 months on each of five charges of communicating information, to four of which he had pleaded guilty. He was also ordered to pay Pounds 10,000 towards the prosecution costs. Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, was fined Pounds 5,000 on a dealing charge, conditionally discharged for 12 months on a communicating charge and ordered to pay Pounds 5,000 costs. Miss Catherine Rowlands, formerly in Samuel Montagu's corporate finance department, was given a 12-month conditional discharge for a communicating offence. She must pay Pounds 2,000 costs. Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester, convicted on two dealing charges, was fined a total of Pounds 10,000, with Pounds 5,000 costs. The offences related to two takeover bids in 1988. Hawthorn Leslie Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, acquired ECT Cellular and London Car Telephones, and Goodman Fielder Wattie, an Australian company, made a bid, which lapsed, for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK foods group. After the verdicts, Mr Peter Clarke, prosecuting for the DTI, said the case stemmed from an investigation into dealings in shares of Pleasurama, the leisure group, at the time of a bid by Mecca Leisure. During the trial the judge directed the jury to acquit the four, and their original co-defendant, Mr Keith Tondeur, former head of principal trading and sales with Banque Paribas, on seven charges related to dealings in Pleasurama shares.</p>

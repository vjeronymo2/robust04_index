			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Broadcastle hit by exceptional Broadcastle, the USM-quoted financial services group, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 224,000 to Pounds 121,000 for the six months to end-June. The decline, the company said, was the result of reduced interest receivable and an exceptional charge of Pounds 152,000 related to its discontinued recruitment business. At the operating level profits were up 22 per cent from Pounds 224,000 to Pounds 273,000. Earnings came out at 0.29p (1.22p) per share; the interim dividend is doubled to 0.5p. The company also announced proposals to raise some Pounds 1.9m before expenses via a placing and open offer of 7.97m new shares at 24p on a 1-for-4 basis, and a further Pounds 2m by way of a preference issue of 2m shares at Pounds 1 apiece. Broadcastle intends to apply to move to a full listing.</p>

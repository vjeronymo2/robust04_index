			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call upsets MEPC a call for Pounds 221m from MEPC - took the shine off the sector, with the shares sliding in line with MEPC's, which fell 8 to 414p in a volume of 6m. The company's one-for-five at 350p rights move was largely greeted with apathy by a sector which has now seen six major cash calls in three months. Mr Alan Carter at James Capel said: 'We have come so far so fast and I think we are seeing a bit of tiredness setting in now. It is the last of the big rights issues and had been expected.' Cash calls in property since March include Great Portland Estates (Pounds 95m); British Land (Pounds 132m); Hammerson (Pounds 199m); Brixton Estates (Pounds 100.7m) and Slough Estates (Pounds 147.3m). MEPC's rights issue, which one analyst calculated will knock down the company's gearing from about 85 per cent to 70 per cent, is likely to make MEPC a prime candidate for inclusion in the FT-SE 100 when the index is reviewed in September. A debt issue has not been ruled out by the company. Continued profit-taking in the sector also contributed to a downbeat climate which saw British Land give up 8 to 303p. Among other property sector leaders, Brixton Estates lost 6 to 195p and Great Portland retreated 4 to 177p.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Global warming curbs finalised - Environment The Budget has filled in the final piece in the UK's plans for meeting international commitments to curb global warming, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday. Annual 5 per cent real increases on fuel duty are the main measure to help curb emissions of carbon dioxide. The government has also given an extra Pounds 35m for energy efficiency schemes to help pensioners insulate homes - almost doubling such support. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said: 'Increasing fuel duty will be ineffective given that public transport infrastructure is falling apart'. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the Budget was 'better for the environment than expected'. He added that the increase in fuel duty confirmed the UK's decision to go its own way in imposing energy taxes and to oppose co-ordinated European energy taxes. The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in the year 2000 - an estimated cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected levels, or about 6 per cent. The government now expects the annual real increases in fuel duty of 5 per cent to account for a quarter of the target, or 2.5mtC - a rise of 1mtC compared with the spring Budget. Measures to encourage energy saving in the home, including the imposition of VAT on fuel, are expected to save 4mtC. Business are expected to save 2.5mtC through energy conservation, and the public sector a further 1mtC. Mr Yeo said that the home energy savings total had been 'reduced slightly' since the last Budget because of fears that past estimates had double counted potential savings.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: European Motor back in black with Pounds 3.4m EUROPEAN MOTOR Holdings, the fast-growing motor group which has been transformed by Mr Richard Palmer, the former Western Motors managing director, returned to profit last year largely reflecting recent acquisitions. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m in the year to March 31 included a Pounds 2.6m contribution from Wilcomatic, the leading UK supplier of automated vehicle washing machines which was acquired for Pounds 18.4m in May last year, and Pounds 1m from the Mill Garages motor dealership group which was acquired for Pounds 2.7m in July 1992. The pre-tax result came on turnover of Pounds 117.1m and compared with a Pounds 1.5m deficit on sales of Pounds 23.9m for the previous 12 months. Operating profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 600,000 loss) from continuing operations included Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 300,000) from the motor retail division of which Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 300,000) was generated by existing motor dealerships with the remaining Pounds 1.4m coming from dealership acquisitions. Losses on the discontinued Cargo Control Equipment business were partly offset by receipts from the settlement of claims against KPMG Peat Marwick related to businesses acquired and disposed of in earlier years. KPMG denied liability. Net interest costs grew to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 500,000) reflecting a slight increase in year-end net borrowings to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.1m), equivalent to gearing of 34 per cent. Commenting on the results Mr Palmer, chief executive, said substantial progress had been made during the year to improve financial performance and consolidate the acquisitions. He added: 'We expect to continue to improve the levels of profitability within our existing businesses and to expand through organic growth, better utilisation of resources and by acquisition.' Earnings of 7.3p compared with previous losses of 17.6p. Dividends were resumed at the interim stage and a final of 2p makes a 3.5p total.</p>

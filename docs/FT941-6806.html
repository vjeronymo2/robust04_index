			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: UPF to float with Pounds 60m tag United Pressings and Fabrications, the vehicle chassis manufacturer which was sold off by the collapsed Parkfield group in 1990, is to return to the stock market with a flotation valuing it at over Pounds 60m. The company produces chassis frames for car manufacturers including Rolls-Royce, Rover and General Motors. It also makes pressings and assemblies, mainly for the car and domestic appliance industries. UPF reported Pounds 4.2m profit on turnover of Pounds 35m in the year to August 1993, but is anticipating 'significant growth' in the current year. It was bought from Parkfield's receivers in August 1990, in a Pounds 30m management buy-out. Phildrew Ventures, and a number of other venture capital groups, took 80 per cent of the company and the management acquired the remaining 20 per cent. The company subsequently sold off its steel wheel manufacturing subsidiary for Pounds 6.3m and following further restructuring, the management now owns 8 per cent, while Phildrew holds 59 per cent. Thompson Chassis, its most profitable division, has been the sole manufacturer of frame assemblies for Rolls-Royce cars since 1908. It also manufactured Sir Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird, which broke the world land speed record in the 1930s. UPF is aiming to launch its flotation this summer. UBS will act as financial adviser.</p>

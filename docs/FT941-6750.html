			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Senior Arab banker 'quits' Mr Abdulla Saudi, deputy chairman, chief executive officer and president of the Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp, has tendered his resignation from the bank, according to senior banking sources, AP-DJ reports from Manama. The sources said that Mr Saudi offered his resignation to the board at a meeting this month. However, a final decision over the resignation will not be taken until April 3, the date of ABC's annual meeting. The reasons for the resignation were not clear, sources said. However, it follows the freezing, and the unfreezing shortly afterwards, by the US of the assets of Arab Financial Services, in which ABC has a 36 per cent stake and where Mr Saudi is chairman. ABC is the Arab world's biggest bank with reported assets of Dollars 18.43bn at the end of 1993. The Central Bank of Libya, Kuwait's ministry of finance and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority each hold about a 25 per cent stake in ABC. The remaining shares are held by private investors. Mr Saudi declined to confirm that he had tendered his resignation. In the banking community, he is recognised as a main force behind ABC and a key in most of its main decisions. 'There is no management structure that can run the bank without his presence. He is also the senior marketing presence for the bank,' a senior banker said. Mr Saudi has been president and chief executive of ABC since 1980. According to the 1993-1994 Arab Banking &amp; Finance Directory, Mr Saudi has held various banking positions with European and Middle East-based banks, including the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank. He was born in Tripoli, Libya, in 1937, the directory says. He holds directorships at financial institutions in Bahrain, Egypt and Spain, some of them with companies affiliated to ABC. Mr Saudi's resignation follows six weeks when US-denominated assets of Arab Financial Services were frozen by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. It claimed that AFS, which posted total assets of Dollars 312.48m in 1992, was 60 per cent controlled or influenced by Libyan interests. However, on February 2, the US authority released the assets of AFS from sanctions. The change of heart followed a trip to Washington by Mr Abdulla Saif, governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency, and Mr Ibrahim Abdul Karim, Bahrain's finance and national economy minister Bankers in Bahrain had feared that the US action against AFS was a precursor to similar action against ABC because of ABC's close links with AFS. According to sources, Mr Saudi also has tendered his resignation from AFS.</p>

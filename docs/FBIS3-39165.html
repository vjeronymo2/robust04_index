			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "Stalemate in the Talks With Syria </F> on Terrorism" -- all punctuation as published]    [Text] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' conveyed  similar views to Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller during the tripartite summit in Istanbul  on Friday, 4 February. He said: "Yes, we agree that a problem  does not exist at the present time. However, we wish to  consider the future on matters related to the transnational  waters. Our producers and farmers wish to see a document on  that vital matter, which concerns their future..."    The views al-Shar' conveyed merely reiterated Syria's  position. Recalling that Turkish statesmen signed protocols  calling for "an agreement between the two countries on  transnational waters," al- Shar' urged that the two sides move  to hold talks on the matter. Meanwhile, he asked: "Why have  Turkish officials failed to fulfill their promises?"    Likewise, Hikmet Cetin's and Tansu Ciller's views reiterated  Turkey's position. For example, Cetin responded: "We do not  wish to create a problem for Syria on the question of  transnational waters. However, considering the anxiety of our  press, parliament, and people about acts of terrorism and their  conviction that Syria supports terrorist activities, we cannot  conclude an agreement with your country at the present time.  This state of affairs must be removed. No anxiety must exist  over security. Under the existing conditions, concluding an  agreement on transnational waters may be interpreted as a step  linked with terrorist activities. That would be wrong. A  problem does not exist on the supply of transnational waters at  the present time. Why do you not agree to cooperate to remove  our anxiety about terrorist activities?..."    The Syrian foreign minister responded: "Syria does not  support terrorist activities against Turkey. That is  impossible. Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camps do not exist  in the al-Biqa' Valley. We have conferred with Lebanese  officials on that matter. Not a single camp remains.  Furthermore, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in Syria."    An interesting point was that al-Shar' went as far as saying  that "Abdullah Ocalan has several European passports and is able  to use them to freely travel anywhere he wishes."    Cetin insisted that the Turkish side has evidence confirming  that Ocalan is still in Syria. Al-Shar' replied: "That may  have been so in the past. However, he is not in Syria at the  present time. We are committed to the promise we have made. We  cannot be involved in any terrorist activity against Turkey.  How can we support an initiative against Turkey's territorial  integrity when we support Iran's and Iraq's territorial  integrity? That would also affect Syria."    Obviously, Syria has not made a significant change in its  position, regardless of Turkey's persistent diplomacy on  terrorism and high-level U.S. pressure. Syria continues to  demand that past Turkish promises be fulfilled and Ankara,  suspending its past promises, insists that "the question of  security be settled before the question of transnational waters  is resolved.    The only important element in the dialogue between the two  countries is the limited steps Syria has recently taken on the  PKK problem. A high-ranking government official informed us  yesterday: "We have received several reports on that matter. We  are aware that Abdullah Ocalan is in Syria. However, it seems  that his freedom of movement has been considerably reduced."    This was an indication that certain steps have been taken by  Syria on the problem.    The present issue is that the limited measures Damascus has  taken have not been effective enough to convince Turkey to  reconsider its approach on the question of transnational waters.  Syria continues to hide Abdullah Ocalan, who it regards as the  most important trump card in its relations with Turkey.    All this indicates that a stalemate has emerged in the chess  game between the two countries.</p>

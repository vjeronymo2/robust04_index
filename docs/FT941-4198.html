			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Moi climbdown on Leakey Mr Richard Leakey, Kenya's foremost conservationist, was yesterday back in charge of the Kenya Wildlife Service after international pressure for his reinstatement prevailed over a vilification campaign conducted by politicians of the ruling Kanu party. President Daniel arap Moi said he would not accept Mr Leakey's resignation, submitted in January, following accusations of racism, arrogance and corruption by Mr William ole Ntimama, the powerful minister for local government. Diplomats, donors and tour operators warned President Moi that Mr Leakey's departure would do incalculable damage to Kenya's reputation as a world leader in wildlife conservation, which underpins a Dollars 450m-a-year tourist industry. Mr Leakey is said to have placed some tough conditions for his return, including the removal of his fiercest political opponents.</p>

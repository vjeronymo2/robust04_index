			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Growth slows in sale of new cars New car sales in west Europe rose by 3.3 per cent in October year-on-year to 916,700, according to provisional figures from Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The rate of growth has slowed since the early summer, and last month sales were lower than a year ago in eight of the 17 markets. In the first 10 months of the year sales rose by 4.9 per cent to 10.18m with higher sales in 11 markets. The pace of recovery has been slowed by the German market, where October sales are estimated to have fallen by 1 per cent to 250,000. The European market was also hit by a 3 per cent decline in the UK, which had previously played an important role in leading the industry out of recession. However, there was continuing strong growth in France and Spain, where demand has been stimulated by government incentives. There are signs too that the deep recession in the Italian market may be over. Sales rose by an estimated 6.2 per cent in October against a 6.7 per cent decline in the first 10 months. Growth has been strongest this year in the Nordic countries. Sales in the 10 months have risen in Denmark by 73.3 per cent year-on-year, Norway (39.5), Sweden (27.5) and Finland (22.7). Japanese carmakers have lost ground with sales falling by 6.7 per cent in the period. Their share has declined to 11.1 per cent from 12.5 per cent a year ago with their competitiveness under heavy pressure from the strong yen. The Japanese have only small shares, too, in some of the protected markets such as France and Spain, which have shown strongest growth among the big volume markets. The PSA Peugeot Citroen group and Renault have benefited most from rising demand in these two markets and have emerged this year as the fastest growing volume carmakers in west Europe. Peugeot Citroen has increased its sales by 10.1 per cent and has raised its market share to 12.8 per cent from 12.2 per cent a year ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                           January-October 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume     Volume    Share (%)    Share (%)                           (Units)   Change (%) Jan-Oct' 94  Jan-Oct' 93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           10,177,400      +4.9       100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group        1,623,500      +2.9        16.0         16.3  -Volkswagen            1,046,300      +0.3        10.3         10.7  -Audi                    265,200      -0.4         2.6          2.7  -Seat                    260,400     +16.3         2.6          2.3  -Skoda*                   51,700     +15.1         0.5          0.5 General Motors****      1,314,700      +3.6        12.9         13.1  -Opel/Vauxhall         1,255,200      +3.2        12.3         12.5  -Saab**                   42,700     +24.7         0.4          0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen     1,307,500     +10.1        12.8         12.2  -Peugeot                 786,500      +9.4         7.7          7.4  -Citroen                 521,100     +11.1         5.1          4.8 Ford group****          1,212,800      +6.7        11.9         11.7  -Ford                  1,188,300      +6.5        11.7         11.5  -Jaguar                    9,100      -3.7         0.1          0.1 Renault                 1,105,900      +7.6        10.9         10.6 Fiat group********      1,085,600      +5.3        10.7         10.6  -Fiat                    849,300      +9.8         8.3          8.0  -Lancia                  138,200      -4.7         1.4          1.5  -Alfa Romeo               85,600     -15.0         0.8          1.0 BMW group                 659,100      +5.6         6.5          6.4  -BMW                     330,200      +4.1         3.2          3.3  -Rover                   329,000      +7.0         3.2          3.2 Mercedes-Benz             368,200     +25.3         3.6          3.0 Nissan                    335,300      -3.7         3.3          3.6 Toyota                    269,400      -2.8         2.6          2.9 Volvo                     171,300     +19.7         1.7          1.5 Mazda                     154,500      -9.6         1.5          1.8 Honda                     146,600      +5.2         1.4          1.4 Mitsubishi                102,900     -16.4         1.0          1.3 Suzuki                     64,800     -21.3         0.6          0.9 Total Japanese          1,130,200      -6.7        11.1         12.5 MARKETS: Germany                 2,722,500      -0.4        26.8         28.2 United Kingdom          1,710,800      +8.5        16.8         16.3 France                  1,607,900     +13.8        15.8         14.6 Italy                   1,399,000      -6.7        13.7         15.5 Spain                     754,400     +21.8         7.4          6.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ******** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) estimates.

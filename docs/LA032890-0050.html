			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: HE EMBODIES ISLAND'S DEVOTION TO BASEBALL  </P> <P> By a rule of United States immigration authorities, no team in major league  baseball can employ in its minor league system more than 24 foreign players at  the same time.  </P> <P> It isn't spelled out specifically why such a rule has been implemented, but the  general feeling is it is there to protect the American worker.  </P> <P> Just about every big league club has filled its quota, no surprise to Mr. Juan  Samuel of San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic, who informs you that  entertainers from his land alone could occupy all the spots that immigration  permits.  </P> <P> Samuel, known among confederates as "Sammy," rolled out of the Dominican in  1980 to take a place at the Philadelphia farm station in Bend, Ore., where,  unable to read a menu in English, he confesses he ordered fried chicken every  day for five weeks.  </P> <P> Of course, this harks back to the great immigration at the turn of the century,  when Italians and Hungarians debarking ordered corn flakes for the same reason  Samuel ordered fried chicken.  </P> <P> From what you might call a fowl beginning, Samuel would advance to a wage of  roughly $1 million a year, the sum the Dodgers are paying him to play center  field, a location he doesn't relish.  </P> <P> Juan is partial to second base, but agrees to center field because of the  charity in his heart and because the job pays a million bucks.  </P> <P> Besides Samuel, other Dominicans on the Dodgers' big league roster are Alfredo  Griffin, Ramon Martinez, Jose Gonzalez, Jose Offerman and Barulio Castillo.  </P> <P> And only recently, they have dealt off Dominican noblemen Pedro Guerrero,  Alejandro Pena and Mariano Duncan, among others.  </P> <P> "People are a little shocked to see all these players coming out of the  Dominican today," says Samuel, "but it's nothing special. The players have been  there for years. It's only recently (that) clubs have gone after them in a  serious way."  </P> <P> The last time Samuel counted, 20 teams in the majors were running full-scale  programs in the Dominican Republic, mining for talent that comes (a) outside  the draft and (b) cheap.  </P> <P> The year around, in a village called Las Palmas, the Dodgers sponsor a live-in  camp accommodating 70 prospects at a time.  </P> <P> "You would call it costly," Executive Vice President Fred Claire explains,  "until you consider the whole operation runs less a year than the salary of  just one big-time major league player."  </P> <P> Samuel describes his history as garden-variety. He grew up in a family of seven  children, from which the old man, now deceased, fled. The mother operated a  small clothing store from which she earned enough to support her brood in a  three-bedroom house where the four boys occupied one room, the three girls  another and the mother the third.  </P> <P> It wasn't until he came to this country that Juan discovered the luxury of  sleeping alone. At home, the four brothers slept in two beds.  </P> <P> "San Pedro de Macoris is sugar cane country," Samuel says. "And every factory  sponsors a baseball team. The teams play tournaments the year around. And the  kids dream of playing one day in America.  </P> <P> "Personally, I was never connected with sugar cane. I had a gentleman's job in  a pants factory, operating a machine that cut cloth for jeans. Our factory,  too, sponsored a team. I worked the overnight shift from 10 until 6:30 in the  morning. I would sleep, go out and play baseball and report for work."  </P> <P> It develops one day that Samuel, then 18, gets a visit from a Philly scout, who  wants to give him a tryout. "The only trouble," Samuel recalls, "is that he  wants to try me out at 9 in the morning. Without sleep, I was afraid I wouldn't  be sharp, but I didn't want to cancel the tryout for fear I would never get  another. I also was afraid to skip work for fear I would get fired."  </P> <P> The devastating dilemma of this young man is solved by his brother Carlos, a  foreman in the factory.  </P> <P> "Carlos reports me as sick," says Juan.  </P> <P> To condense a long and painful account, the scout signs Samuel, slipping him a  check for $2,500. That was more than he earned at the pants factory in 2 1/2  years.  </P> <P> "My poor mother broke into tears," he says. "She ran to the neighbors, telling  them her son was a success. The whole island is on fire with kids who play  baseball. They play day and night, the year around. The majors now know they  are there. They will take as many as the law allows."  </P> <P> The chronology can be interesting. You never know when yesterday's pants cutter  will be today's center fielder.  </P></p>

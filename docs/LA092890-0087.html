			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRATORIA'S PIZZAS HAVE PLENTY OF PIZAZZ  </P> <P> There's a reason why Carlo and Rita DeDionisio and Luciano Carlucci have called  their restaurant Trattoria de Roma: They are all from Rome.  </P> <P> The food, however, isn't; the origins of these dishes run up and down the  Italian boot from the Alps to Sicily. There's nothing noticeably Roman about  the stretch of Ventura Boulevard just west of Reseda Boulevard either. And this  little place tucked away in a corner of a mini-mall called Topanga Town Plaza  is not really a trattoria. So I feel justified in saying that Trattoria de Roma  has a somewhat misleading name.  </P> <P> The interior features pictures of lots of places in Rome where tourists hang  out (fountain of Trevi, Coliseum, etc.). It is upbeat and breezy, with a flashy  open counter area, glass-topped tables with pastel green tablecloths and plants  in the long window sills. A tape of a tenor singing Puccini seems to play  constantly.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that the lunch menu is short, my favorite dishes here can be  found on it. Something called a mini-pizza eggplant sandwich is a wonderful  surprise, a flying saucer-shaped creation consisting of two cracker-thin crusts  of pizza dough with a filling of diced eggplant and melted mozzarella cheese.  The top is brushed with virgin olive oil and sprinkled with a little rosemary  and the whole thing is cut into fourths. It's simply one of the best lunch  dishes anywhere in the Valley.  </P> <P> Several panini, Italian-style sandwiches, make good lunches too. Al taglio,  with imported cold cuts, would be my choice, but al tonno, an oily tuna  sandwich with lettuce, tomato and onion, is another winner. So is the eggplant  sandwich, a filling concoction of breaded, sauteed eggplant. All are served on  hot crusty loaves of Italian bread.  </P> <P> The dinner menu is more extensive -- but less impressive. Antipasti, often the  best part of an Italian meal, are not taken too seriously here. The house  Caesar is limp, with chopped greens (as opposed to broken ones) and a dressing  that is watery. Bruschetta, ordinarily grilled bread that is brushed with olive  oil and topped with garlic, tomato and basil, is perfunctory, as if a topping  of tomato and basil had simply been dumped onto premade garlic bread. And pasta  e fagioli, the classic Roman bean and pasta soup, was unavailable when I asked  for it. I had to settle for a beanless minestrone instead, a tasty, innocuous  mixture of diced carrot, zucchini and celery in a tarragon-scented tomato  broth.  </P> <P> Pasta and pizza save the day. Pastas are not made here, but the restaurant gets  high marks for its preparation. Penne arrabbiata is delicious -- tubular pasta  in a spicy sauce that brings a flush to your face. The kitchen cooks the pasta  until it is perfectly al dente. Linguini contadina, a lunch dish, is a resonant  combination of garlic, fresh mushrooms and herbs. It is not on the menu at  dinner.  </P> <P> Pizzas are especially good here, 10-inch or 15-inch masterpieces consisting of  a crisp crust and a variety of interesting toppings. Checca -- raw tomato,  mozzarella, basil and garlic -- tastes like what you hope for when you order a  good bruschetta; the flavors are integrated and the combination is  irresistible. Patate, a peasant dish from the north, has cheese, sliced potato  and rosemary, without tomato sauce. And calzone ripieno, a gooey pouch of  ricotta, egg, prosciutto and Parmesan, makes a worthy alternative to the  pizzas.  </P> <P> Secondi piatti, entrees, aren't as compelling as the primi. Saltimbocca, a true  Roman favorite, is prepared without much style. It's sauteed veal with thick  slices of salty prosciutto, in a weak sauce with limp mushrooms and too much  Marsala. Pollo cacciatora, chicken in marinara sauce with black olives and bell  peppers, is insipid; the chicken is overcooked and the olives are from a can.  Try pesce spada (swordfish) instead. It's firm and fine.  </P> <P> Also save room for the big dessert, Rita DeDionisio's special tiramisu. This  dessert, which is often terribly tired, is done with real flair here. It's a  sweet, dense, creamy version loaded with rum, mascarpone and cream. It's a  dessert that Rome would be proud to call its own.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: mini-pizza eggplant sandwich, $5.50; panino al taglio,  $4.50; pizza patate, $6.50 (10 inches), and $11.50 (15 inches); pesce spada,  $13.95; tiramisu, $4.  </P> <P>  Trattoria de Roma, 18607 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana; (818) 343-6942.

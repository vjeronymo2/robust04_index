			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINE YEARS HAVEN'T HEALED LEONARD-DURAN RIFT  </P> <P> There he was at the head table, the fearsome fighter they once called Manos de  Piedra (Hands of Stone). Nowadays, he looks more like Manos de Twinkies.  </P> <P> He sat impassively, elbows on the table, his chin in his hands. Then promoter  Bob Arum introduced his long-time rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, and summoned him to  the microphone.  </P> <P> Roberto Duran actually smiled slightly . . . and vigorously applauded Leonard.  </P> <P> Wait a minute. That's Duran, Roberto Duran, applauding Sugar Ray Leonard? No.  An impostor, surely. Or was it a mirage?  </P> <P> Toward the end, Duran became a little surly, as in the old days. But for a few  seconds, Roberto Duran seemed free of some old demons.  </P> <P> This was at the Golden Nugget Hotel Wednesday, at a news conference to announce  the site of Leonard-Duran III, an event promoter Bob Arum calls "Uno Mas."  </P> <P> It was a party, in a way, to introduce Steve Wynn as the new player in boxing's  big leagues. His gleaming white, high-rise hotel, the Mirage, which has risen  to near-completion next door to Caesars Palace, will hold the fight Dec. 7.  </P> <P> So Leonard and Duran, who began the decade in Montreal with what some call the  best fight of the decade, will finish the 1980s with an overweight Duran  pushing 40 and Leonard in suspect shape after a disappointing performance  against Tommy Hearns in a June draw.  </P> <P> It has been said by nearly everyone in boxing the last few years that once Wynn  opened his hotel and went into the boxing business, he would drive up the site  fees of top boxing shows. But in this case, it didn't happen, all the  principals agreed Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It was not a bidding war at all," said Mike Trainer, Leonard's lawyer and a  co-promoter, with Arum, for Leonard-Duran III.  </P> <P> "We talked to Caesars Palace first, told them what we had in mind, then we  talked to Donald Trump's people (at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J.), and  then Steve flew to Bethesda (Md.) to see me. Steve and I made a deal in about  10 minutes.  </P> <P> "Basically, Steve said, 'How much will it cost me? What's the date?' then, 'OK,  let's do it.' Trump put the same number ($8 million, which Wynn confirmed  Wednesday) on the table. Caesars went under that and was either unable or  unwilling to match it. Caesars also wanted an option on Ray's next fight, which  was unacceptable to us.  </P> <P> "For some reason, Caesars felt Steve was not a threat to them on this fight,  but they were afraid he'd come back in the spring and blow everyone out of the  water and get Ray's next fight."  </P> <P> In the end, Trainer said, the site was Leonard's decision.  </P> <P> "There's a reason for this fight," Leonard said. "Roberto Duran wants to  vindicate himself."  </P> <P> Then Leonard added, with a smile: "And I like the idea of being the first act  at the Mirage."  </P> <P> His first reference was to Leonard-Duran II, the 1980 rematch in New Orleans,  when Duran quit in the middle of the eighth round, saying, "No mas, no mas," to  referee Octavio Meyran.  </P> <P> He has never explained why he quit that night, but Wednesday Duran promised to  fully explain "No mas" immediately after Uno Mas.  </P> <P> "That was the biggest disappointment of my career, and you'll know why (it  happened) after the fight," he told reporters Wednesday, through an  interpreter. Many wanted to know what the 38-year-old Duran weighed. The range  of guesses was from 185 to 205. Whatever, he has to come down several weight  classes.  </P> <P> "My weight is no problem," he said.  </P> <P> He might be right. He was also in the 190- to 200-pound range six weeks before  he fought Iran Barkley last February, somehow got down to 160, and upset  Barkley for what has become a $7.5-million victory.  </P> <P> That's what Duran will make Dec. 7. Then he will have a painful visit to the  Las Vegas office of the IRS. Duran has a back-tax bill of $1.5 million, which  will come off the top of the $7.5 million.  </P> <P> Duran, at the microphone, turned tough. Moments before, Leonard said that he'd  "always" wanted to fight Duran again.  </P> <P> Duran pointed at Leonard and asked: "If you've always wanted to fight me, why  did you wait nine years?"  </P> <P> He also said he would have to knock out Leonard because "the judges like you  here," possibly a reference to the June 12 Leonard-Hearns draw that most  thought Hearns won.  </P> <P> Leonard, 33, who is said to have made $14.2 million from the Hearns fight, will  make about $15 million, according to Trainer. That will put him over $100  million for his career.  </P> <P> Wynn, who said he will hold the fight in a 16,400-seat outdoor arena protected  by wind barriers, said the Mirage will open in late November, about a week  ahead of schedule.  </P></p>

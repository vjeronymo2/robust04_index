			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Azerbaijan's Government and Armed Forces commit  a crime against the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and Armenia  prior to every jubilant occasion or religious festival. Be it a  Christian festival or Nowruz [spring festival] or New Year makes  no difference. The enemy attacked the defense positions around  Tavush in Mardakertskiy Rayon on 26 December. The onslaught was  rebuffed. Azerbaijan lost 42 men in the fighting. Another  attack took place against Askeranskiy Rayon on the same day.  That, too, was rebuffed. Azerbaijan lost 57 fighters in the  clashes.    The enemy resumed its attacks on the defense positions in  Mardakertskiy, Martuninskiy, and Askeranskiy Rayons early on 28  December. The enemy has maintained its onslaught until now.  However, the NKR military units have been able to check the  advancing forces. The HAY LUR NEWS AGENCY has reported that NKR  lost 32 men in the 10-day fighting before 29 December.  Azerbaijan's military forces were forced to retreat after  losing 650 men at the battlefronts.    Foreign mercenaries are fighting among the ranks of  Azerbaijan's military units. They are commanded by generals  from Turkey. However, Azerbaijan's leaders have denied the  presence of Afghan mojahedin in that republic's armed forces.  Nevertheless, REUTER has reported that an airplane has recently  landed in Kabul to return the dead bodies of the Afghan  mojahedin who were killed in the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh.  [passage omitted]    Azerbaijan's leaders have recently moved to find a way to  draw Armenia into the fighting. The Azerbaijani troops have  recently fired on the border towns in Armenia's Idzhevanskiy,  Tavushskiy, Araratskiy, and other rayons with various types of  arms.</p>

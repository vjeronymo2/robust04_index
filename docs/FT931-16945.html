			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / A year of reckoning: Germany's economy will improve in 1993 This will be a year of turnround for German economic policy. The economy will begin to improve, though in a way which may escape the eye of the beholder. Next year will see clear recovery in production and the beginning of improvement in the labour market. Such predictions are in stark contrast to present trends and perceptions. Recent months have confirmed the end of the nearly decade-long German upswing. Only a few can claim to have identified the onset of stagnation in the summer of 1991. Yet everyone identifies the past half year or so with the onset of recession. Production declined significantly, employment began to fall, orders dropped precipitously, investment plans were scaled back and proposals for large job losses were unveiled. In 1992 German business confidence registered a greater decline than in any other postwar recession. Keynes wrote in his General Theory: 'It would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain . . . For this reason the facts of the existing situation enter, in a sense disproportionately, into the formation of our long-term expectations.' This 'Keynesian wisdom' clearly shapes prevailing views about 1993-94 in business and, to a degree, among professional forecasters. Extrapolation of the recent past seems the best guide to the future. There is some justification for this approach when looking at the very near term - the two quarters of winter 1992-93. But the gloomiest predictions that Germany's economy is going down the drain as a result of unification are probably wrong and certainly premature. In support of their claims, pessimists cite several factors. Is it not true that Germans have the highest labour costs, the shortest working hours, the longest holidays, almost the highest business and income taxes, and extreme regulation in labour markets and on the environment? And have they not added to this list of disadvantages a large budget deficit and a highly restrictive monetary policy? The switch away from Germany in recent years in flows of foreign investment underlines just how problematic all these developments have become. But all is not gloom. The most obvious factor which will improve the German economy during the next year or so is the recovery of the world economy - in particular the improvement in the US. There are counter-arguments to this relative optimism. The international recovery will be only modest; it will be concentrated in areas that are not as closely tied to the German market as the EC; and the benefits to Germany will be diminished by the appreciation of the D-Mark, which has reduced export competitiveness. While all these arguments carry some weight, experience has shown that German exports perform best when world trade accelerates. Identifying the reasons for a turnround in German domestic demand is more difficult. Monetary or fiscal stimuli both seem unlikely. In view of the high fiscal deficit, a fiscal stimulus is neither probable nor desirable. In fact, the 1 percentage point increase in VAT which came into effect on January 1 will reduce real disposable income. Monetary policy is still restrictive if judged by the yield curve. This is inverted to a larger degree than ever, with short-term interest rates well above long-term rates. When can the Bundesbank be expected to start significantly easing monetary policy? The central bank will opt for caution in preserving the D-Mark's strength. Therefore it will wait for evidence of wage moderation and fiscal soundness before it takes steps to reduce interest rates. If such evidence takes a long time to emerge, currency speculation could drive the D-Mark unreasonably high, damping business prospects still further. Under such circumstances, inflationary expectations in Germany would collapse, and the traded goods sector would be threatened by structural decline. Such an outcome would be chaotic. It would lead to a rapid fall of German short-term interest rates - but at the expense of a severe European recession. There is, however, a more hopeful scenario. A window of opportunity exists for an organised correction of German economic policy. By now it seems clear that, because of the economic slowdown, wage settlements in 1993 and 1994 will be about half as high as in 1991 and 1992. Real wages will thus be roughly unchanged this year, and show only a modest increase next year. Correcting fiscal policy will be more difficult. A number of steps would satisfy the Bundesbank and also support investment in industry. Among these are a reduction of subsidies to smokestack industries, action to streamline social legislation, and vigorous privatisation. However, political circumstances make these solutions difficult to achieve. The trade unions and the Social Democrat opposition favour tax increases for those in higher income brackets. Ultimately, in view of the budgetary pressures, we are likely to see a rise in either indirect taxes or in general income tax. The former option would have direct inflationary implications; the latter would lower people's motivation to work hard. A reasonable fiscal policy shift will be hard to accomplish, but is not out of reach. A bold government could come up with tough budgetary legislation around the time of the publication of the annual economic report at the end of this month. Emergency action would hold down this year's spending to last year's levels. Under such circumstances the Bundesbank would be in a position to reduce interest rates early in the new year. Germany's European partners would be able to follow suit. This would calm foreign exchange markets. If Germany could organise such a switch in economic policy, 1993 could become a year of hope rather than of frustration. Since lags are huge, however, improvement in the course of the year is likely to be no more than modest. For 1993 as a whole, average GNP is likely to remain at the 1992 level. This could, however, presage a return to reasonably dynamic growth in 1994. At least on the supply-side, the right conditions for such growth are in place. Germany has a well-educated and motivated young labour force. As to investment in Germany, there is reason to rely on the positive impact of Keynes's 'animal spirits'. German unification and the single European market provide, after all, plenty of opportunity for reigniting the imagination and enterprise of German business. But much depends on the right policies in Bonn - and the correct responses in Frankfurt.

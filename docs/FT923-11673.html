			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Coal's sell-off faces pitfalls: Profits disguise questions over contracts ONE British Coal board member said ruefully at lunch: 'Any other company would have been sticking its chest out.' The company yesterday announced a Pounds 170m profit for the year to March, its best yet and a promising prelude to its forthcoming privatisation. But questions, not congratulations, hung in the air at British Coal's headquarters. That Pounds 170m is testimony to the fact that British Coal is now more efficient than ever before. But it was almost all earned from British Coal's contract with the electricity industry, put in place by the government and expiring in March. Moreover, until new contracts are settled in the coming months British Coal's future revenue and profit are uncertain. The message from British Coal yesterday was that this is the last year of big profits. Next year, according to Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, the company will not match this year's big increase. The reason is that the contract with the generators will still be in place. He said yesterday that there might, however, be a 'cliff edge' in the second half of the year if the new contracts with the generators meant that the company had to start closing collieries quickly and writing them off against profits. The company's future would then hinge on the new contracts. British Coal has made an offer to the generators, understood to be based on a price of Pounds 1.50 a unit of energy from coal. It is understood to include a volume of 40m tonnes at the start of the contract, falling perhaps to around 25m over a five-year period. That compares with Pounds 1.85 a unit today and a volume of 65m tonnes. Revenues and profits, as Mr Clarke admitted, will inevitably fall. British Coal can try to squeeze out more costs and boost productivity. This year's profits show big productivity gains, admittedly from a low base. Output per manshift rose 13 per cent over the past year, and so far this year it has risen a further 14.6 per cent. Mr Clarke said there would be additional improvements. Costs - of which the wage bill is the most substantial - fell only a couple of per cent, and there seems little sign that they can be tightened further. The background is that the UK market for coal is shrinking and British Coal's task is being complicated by competing fuels, notably gas. 'The total market for black fuels (coal, heavy fuel oil, and similar products) will be 60m tonnes,' Mr Ken Moses, British Coal's joint deputy chairman said. 'The issue, then, is how will the generators react to that? It is con-ceivable that they could not take a coal contract at all.' In the worst scenario, he said, British Coal might end up supplying only 20m tonnes to the UK electricity market, compared with 65m today. That makes it hard to see why anyone should be interested in buying British Coal when it is privatised some time after the contracts have been signed. Some potential buyers admit they find it hard to value the company. 'I always find British Coal's results very academic,' said the head of one international company's coal division. Its prices and tonnages were artificial, he added. The company had a level of profitability 'you wouldn't expect in the industry', he said. The reason for this was that coal had 'an exceptionally high price that was forced on the customer'. Even so, Mr David McErlain, chairman of Anglo-United, the fuel group, believes the profit has a positive message for potential buyers. 'It's an exceptional performance in the year when they needed it, that is just before privatisation,' he says. 'They deserve enormous credit for that, and they deserve credit for pushing through the colliery closures that helped them achieve it.' While acknowledging that nobody can say what volumes British Coal can sell at what price after March 1993, Mr McErlain believes the profits show that costs can be squeezed out of the business. 'A purchaser will look at the strength of the contract with the generators, and then he'll take his own view on what costs can come out. After that, it's a financial exercise.' Until more details emerge of how the mines will be packaged, most potential bidders are keeping quiet. Peabody, the US coal company which is part of the Hanson group, is thought to be a prime candidate. Hanson was reticent about British Coal's results. 'It is not for us to comment,' Hanson said. 'But we've said that, if the government decided to sell it through a trade sale, we'd have a look at it.' RTZ, the international mining group, said it had no comment. British Coal's Mr Clarke, himself a former chairman of an international mining group, says the company would provide a buyer with a strategic foothold in the UK market, the only relatively open market in Europe and one that may open up further. British Coal's future profit is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that whoever buys the company is unlikely to get it to outperform yesterday's record result.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) HUD will not make a Small Cities grant when it is determined that the grant will only have a minimal or insignificant impact on the grantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Individual grant amounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, HUD may take into account the size of the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant to complete the activities in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Streamlined application requirement for previous applicants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD may provide pursuant to a NOFA that if an applicant notifies HUD in writing within the application period specified in a NOFA that it wishes to be so considered, HUD will consider unfunded applications from the prior round or competition that meet the threshold requirements of the NOFA. For FY 1995 only, unfunded applications from the FY 1994 competition will be automatically reactivated for consideration unless the applicant notifies the Department in writing by the date specified in the FY 1995 NOFA that it does not wish to have the FY 1994 application considered in the FY 1995 competition. The applicant will have the option of withdrawing its application, or amending or supplementing the application for succeeding rounds of competition. If there is no significant change in the application involving new activities or alteration of proposed activities that will significantly change the scope, location or objectives of the proposed activities or beneficiaries, there will be no further citizen participation requirement to keep the application active for succeeding rounds of competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;570.426 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Program income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The provisions of &sect;570.504(b) apply to all program income generated by a specific grant and received prior to grant closeout. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the unit of general local government has another ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, the program income will be considered to be program income of the ongoing grant. The grantee can choose which grant to credit the program income to if it has multiple open CDBG grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the unit of general local government has no open ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of the unit of general local government or its subrecipients which amounts to less than $25,000 per year will not be considered to be program income. When more than $25,000 of program income is generated from one or more closed out grants in a year after closeout, the entire amount of the program income is subject to the requirements of this part. This will be a subject of the closeout agreement described in &sect;570.509(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;570.427 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Program amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD approval of certain program amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grantees shall request prior HUD approval for all program amendments involving new activities or alteration of existing activities that will significantly change the scope, location, or objectives of the approved activities or beneficiaries.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of Supreme Council of Bulgarian Socialist Party </F> and Socialist Deputies," adopted at the Bulgarian Socialist  Party Supreme Council plenum held in Sofia on 21 May]    [Text] The joint meeting of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist  Party] Supreme Council and the Socialist deputies held in Sofia  on 21 May, after analyzing the deepening political crisis  comprehensively, resolved as follows:    1. The BSP Supreme Council and Socialist deputies authorize  the BSP parliamentary group to reach a decision on supporting or  rejecting the vote of confidence that the prime minister has  requested, depending on whether acceptable proposals are made on  changing the government's membership and policies. If no such  proposals are made, there will be no grounds for supporting the  government. In such an event, the only solution will be to hold  free democratic elections as soon as possible.    Our position is dictated by our conclusion that, with its  present membership and activities, the government does not enjoy  the degree of trust needed to resolve the real and grave  problems facing Bulgaria today.    2. The BSP is ready immediately to join bilateral and  multilateral talks under the aegis of the prime minister. The  purpose of these talks would be to try to revise the  unacceptable points in the Council of Ministers's program of 18  May and provide legislative guarantees for carrying out the most  important tasks included in this program.    3. The BSP proposes including the following commitments in a  framework agreement:    -- The Council of Ministers should compensate the  population's incomes, which have fallen drastically as a result  of the price shocks in March and April 1994; it should repeal  the section of Council of Ministers Decree No. 77 that froze the  pay of employees in the state-financed sphere; and it should  immediately reactivate the work of the National Council for  Trilateral Cooperation.    -- The parliamentary groups that support the government  should pass the following legislation: in June 1994, the  changes in the Privatization Act and privatization programs; in  July, the Law on Defense and the Armed Forces; and, before the  end of the summer session, the necessary laws on holding free  democratic elections, as well as continuing work on the bills on  protective bankruptcy and insolvency.    4. The BSP considers that the initiative that the president  of the Republic of Bulgaria took on 20 May 1994 can be discussed  when the constitutional need arises, within the framework of the  mandates held by the parliamentary groups for forming a new  government. The BSP reaffirms its determination not to  participate in any attempts to form within the term of the  present parliament a new government along the lines of political  confrontation, revanchism, or restoration of the old regime.    5. The BSP reaffirms its unchanged position that Bulgaria's  main problems can only be solved by constructive political  dialogue. At the final stage of concluding the agreement on the  foreign debt, any government must win broad parliamentary  consensus, based on an analysis of the internal and external  resources for financing the debt and the country's ability to  bear the burden.    6. The BSP Supreme Council and Parliamentary Union for  Social Democracy [PSSD] confirm the mandate given to the BSP  Executive Bureau and the PSSD leadership to analyze the  situation, define the position of the BSP, and conduct  negotiations.</p>

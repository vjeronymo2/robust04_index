			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> The death threat by Iranian leaders against a British author, plus the sizable  bounty to murder the writer, represents a serious challenge to Muslim leaders  throughout the world. They have a choice to renounce this vicious example of  terrorism or to remain silent and give the impression that such despotism is  not inconsistent with Islam.  </P> <P> Political democracies, especially Britain and the United States, are also  challenged. Are they willing to permit interference with the artistic freedom  of expression that has played such a central role in Western civilization? Our  recent history suggests that such attacks on our basic values should not be  ignored.  </P> <P> HOWARD H. KENDLER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

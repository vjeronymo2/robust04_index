			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> For the first time, California raisins are headed for store shelves in Japan,  with the first shipment of about $1.5 million worth of the fruit leaving the  Port of Oakland. The raisins are being exported by the California Dried Fruit  Co., a consortium of 18 San Joaquin Valley companies. Nicholas Boghosian,  president of the consortium, said the sale of bulk raisins to Japan culminates  four years of negotiations. He said the company has also developed packaging  and advertising to meet Japanese standards and has licensed Japanese importers  and distributors to use the California dancing raisins logo on all packages and  in television commercials in Japan. If raisins are a hit with Japanese  consumers, Boghosian said he hopes that the consortium can increase shipments  in future years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> No Merger Vote: The B. Manischewitz Co. said that at its special shareholders  meeting on Monday it will not consider the $44.6-million buyout offer made by  Beverly Hills-based Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co., dashing prospects for  a revived merger plan between the two firms. The companies had reached a  preliminary merger agreement, but then broke off talks on Monday after  differences emerged. Manischewitz also said it received a demand by Levine  Tessler for a termination fee and expenses totaling $3.4 million as a result of  the alleged failure by Manischewitz to try its best to complete the proposed  merger.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Food-aid rules confirmed The European Commission has been told by the European Court of Justice to repay money withheld from a trader who was late in delivering goods covered by European Community food-aid rules. Cebag, a Dutch exporter, sued the Commission for payments due under a food-aid tender contract relating to colza oil destined for Uganda, Mozambique and Bangladesh. The Commission claimed Cebag made late deliveries of the oil allocated to it under the tender and therefore it was entitled to withhold delivery guarantees by making deductions from the final payment. Delay in delivery was not disputed. The main legal issue arose from the fact that the Commission had notified Cebag that it had been released from its delivery guarantees but then proceeded to deduct Ecu104,508 (Pounds 84,860) from the sum due at final payment. This deduction was contrary to a ruling by the European Court of Justice in January 1991 in which the court interpreted the EC food-aid rules as precluding the Commission from making deductions for late delivery. When Cebag requested repayment of the money, however, the Commission refused. In its telexed refusal, which Cebag asked the ECJ to annul, the Commission said no reliance could be placed on the court's January 1991 ruling in respect of payments made before that date. In confirming its previous ruling the court rejected the Commission's arguments. The court held only renunciation of the right to reimbursement, which had not been suggested by the Commission, or legal prescription, which was no longer contended by the Commission, could prevent Cebag's claim. The court also upheld Cebag's claim for interest on the late payment. Two unusual procedural points were raised by this case. First, the court decided there should be no oral hearing; and second, Cebag brought claims under the Rome treaty provisions which give the court jurisdiction to give judgment in respect of any arbitration clause contained in a contract concluded by or on behalf of the Community whether the contract is governed by private or public law. The Commission had argued Cebag's application was inadmissible because the legal relationship between the Commission and the tenderer was exclusively governed by the provisions in the relevant EC food-aid regulations and that the provisions referring to the jurisdiction of the court did not amount to an arbitration clause incorporated in the contract between the Commission and Cebag. The court disagreed. It said the legal relationship was also subject to the terms of the tender contract and that the provisions granting jurisdiction to the ECJ were an integral part of the contract which were to be treated as an arbitration clause within the meaning of the treaty. Case C-142/91, Cebag BV v Commission, ECJ 5CH, 11 February 1993. Inward-processing entitlement IN THE course of proceedings between Textilveredlungsunion (TVU) and German customs in respect of a claim for repayment of customs duties, the Munich Finanzgeright asked the ECJ to interpret certain of the European Community's inward-processing rules. EC inward-processing rules cover imported goods or raw materials which are processed in the Community and then re-exported. In general customs duties paid on the imported goods are refundable after they are re-exported. The duties reclaimed by TVU had been paid in connection with yarn imported from Korea by another German company which had then been re-exported to Bulgaria after TVU had dyed the yarn under a subcontract. The court ruled that it was for the German court to decide the meaning of the inward-processing regime applicable to TVU as a sub-contractor. However, the court clarified details of the EC inward-processing rules. It said where the processing of non-Community material was carried out for a principal established within the EC customs territory, the sub-contractor could apply for inward-processing relief but must do so in the name of the principal.

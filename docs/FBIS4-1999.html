			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has made active efforts to  accelerate its construction of market mechanisms.    According to officials with the regional administration of  industry and commerce, a network of commodities markets of  various kinds has been formed in Ningxia, one of China's  relatively undeveloped provinces.    At present, large and medium-sized state-owned commercial  wholesale firms in the region handle wholesale and retail  businesses at the same time. Local large commercial retail  stores have adopted various forms of the responsibility system  in operation, while half of the small commercial shops, which  make up 80 percent of the region's total number of commercial  centers, have introduced flexible management methods, with the  central government as the owner of fixed assets.    Last year, the autonomous region, with more than 30,000  commercial organizations, achieved 4.3 billion yuan in turnover  from retail trade.    So far, the autonomous region has also built 261 rural and  urban free markets, as well as 31 markets of means of  production, with 60,000 households engaging in such businesses.    While the autonomous region has been making efforts to  invigorate commodities markets, markets of finance, technology,  labor and real estate have also come into existence. Last year,  the autonomous region issued 800 million yuan in valuable papers  and 30 million yuan in shares, and swapped 20 million U.S.  dollars through the markets.    The autonomous region has issued licenses for the  establishment of 300 technological and trade organizations and  non-governmental scientific research units.    The business volume at the technological markets hit 230  million yuan last year. Technology trading has also helped  launch 80 percent of the region's projects on "Spark program,"  designed to use practical skills to promote local economy,  transform outdated technology and enhance economic efficiency.    The officials said 80,000 people have found jobs with the  help of various labor organizations.    While stepping up market construction, the autonomous region  has worked out a series of local rules and regulations to  standardize market operations and ensure a healthy development  of the market, in accordance with relevant laws of the central  government and compatible with local conditions.    Last year, more than 80 percent of the region's farm  products  and by-products, as well as 70 percent of its means of  production, were traded through markets, said the officials.    Ningxia has also made active efforts to win over  international aid and preferential loans, while luring more  overseas investors to sink their money into the region.    So far, about 300 foreign-funded enterprises have been set  up  in the autonomous region, involving a use of 120 million U.S.  dollars in foreign investment.    Meanwhile, the autonomous region has expanded its business  overseas. Besides setting up six enterprises in foreign  countries, the region has signed contracts concerning  contracting foreign projects and exports of labor involving 60  million yuan. A total of 240 kinds of local products have  entered the international market.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CYCLISTS PEDAL TO HELP THIRD WORLD;  </P> <P> BICYCLING: 100 RIDERS WILL FOLLOW FIVE CROSS-COUNTRY ROUTES TO RAISE MONEY FOR  LOCALLY INITIATED PROJECTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  </P> <P> They remember the little-known towns along America's rural highways: De Quincy,  La., or Hamlet, N.C., or St. Charles, Minn. They talk about riding their  bicycles 70 miles a day, about sleeping in YMCAs, high-school gymnasiums or  private homes, about pitching in to help community groups paint fences or feed  the homeless. And mostly they recall their wonderful conversations with  Americans of every stripe.  </P> <P> They are the alumni of a phenomenon called Bike-Aid, a cross-country bicycle  trip gearing up for its fifth summer.  </P> <P> "There are some really beautiful people out there," says Judi Fox, a recent  graduate in economics from UC San Diego. "I felt much more American at the end  of this trip -- and I also felt that I really loved the American people."  </P> <P> For Fox, "this trip" was last summer's five-week, 2,000-mile ride from Austin,  Tex., to Washington with 12 other bicyclists. The goal: to raise money for  locally initiated development projects in Third World countries funded by the  Overseas Development Network, Bike-Aid's parent organization.  </P> <P> Since 1986, nearly 400 cyclists, ranging from teen-agers to a 61-year-old  grandmother from Miami, have ridden up mountains and across windy plains -- and  raised more than $500,000.  </P> <P> The 100 bikers who will participate this summer, riding five different  cross-country routes to the nation's capital (from Seattle; Portland, Ore.; San  Francisco; Los Angeles and Austin), are each asked to solicit $2,000 in pledges  from friends and neighbors.  </P> <P> Like other large-scale events -- the 1985 Live-Aid concert to aid victims of  Ethiopian famine and the 1986 Hands Across America effort, which contributed  funds to the homeless and needy -- Bike-Aid seeks to raise local and national  awareness about overseas problems and contribute funds for grass-roots  development projects.  </P> <P> The ride is not a race, say the organizers, but a chance to learn about  community challenges and successes here and abroad.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty intense experience," says Cathy McGovern, one of two  coordinators for this year's Bike-Aid, which begins June 17 (July 16 from  Austin) and ends Aug. 21 at the Lincoln Memorial.  </P> <P> The bikers take pride in their contributions to Third World development. They  also take a few layover days along the way to work on projects in host  communities: McGovern remembers the Sunday they agreed to "paint a porch in  south Chicago," only to discover that the porch was a three-tiered structure on  a refurbished tenement that took a squad of bicyclists more than a day to  complete.  </P> <P> Wherever they go, says Benay Lazo, the other Bike-Aid coordinator at the  group's San Francisco office, the bikers make a lasting impression. "They touch  and inspire people in the host communities," she says, recalling her own  experiences with after-dinner community meetings and noontime conversations  with passers-by at country stores. She says the funds raised and sent overseas  can have a significant effect. But the real benefit, she insists, lies in "what  happens to the cyclist."  </P> <P> Ben Kahrl, a recent Harvard University graduate who rode in both 1988 and 1989  and now coaches track in Bath, Maine, agrees. "I would say I learned to care,"  he says when asked how the experience changed him. "I saw a lot of people  helping others -- people who had very little to start with, dedicating their  lives to bettering the lot of others rather than going to Wall Street and  earning a lot of money."  </P> <P> For Andy Yates, a third-year graduate student in engineering-economic systems  at Stanford University, the experience provided "a foundation and a personal  belief about major problems and what would be a good approach to solving them."  </P> <P> What most impressed him, he says, was the fact that "the middle part of the  country seems to be disappearing quickly. A lot of the small towns,  particularly the farming communities, are closing up. They used to have two or  three grocery stores; now they don't have any, and you have to ride maybe 40  miles to the next big town."  </P> <P> He worries that "if you were to do this ride in 20 years, it might be extremely  difficult to find small towns along the back roads. You're going to be confined  to riding along interstates and eating at McDonald's and staying in Motel 6's."  </P> <P> The idea of linking bicycling and third-world development came from Nazir  Ahmad, who with his younger brother, Kamal, founded ODN in 1982. He seized on  cycling in part because of the powerful metaphors it presented.  </P> <P> "Cycling, other than walking, is the most common form of transportation in the  world," he says. He credits the idea of a cross-country student ride to a  summer trek called Harvard Rides for Life, which followed a single route. ODN  added multiple routes -- in part, he says, because there is "a tendency to  think of development as all going the same way, and yet here were those  different routes going to the same end."  </P> <P> He also notes that most of the nation's decisions about development issues are  made in East or West Coast power centers, and that "middle America," where the  cyclists of necessity spend most of their time, often getting "left behind or  ignored."  </P> <P> Finally, he says students needed to learn how to raise funds for causes they  support. "I have always thought of Bike-Aid's fund-raising as an investment in  learning," he says. "It's a very empowering process to know that you can raise  resources to do the things you want to do."  </P> <P> As he raises funds for this summer's ride, Kahrl agrees. "It's not only that we  can make a difference but that we have to," he says. "People need to care; they  need to make a difference."  </P></p>

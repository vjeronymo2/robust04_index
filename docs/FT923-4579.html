			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / The dark knight returns, his strange genius undimmed: Bobby Fischer is back, still bad and still brilliant AFTER 20 years' hibernation Robert James Fischer has proved that, whatever powers he has lost, he has not lost the power to cause offence. His remarks at the press conference at the outset of his return chess match with Boris Spassky were vintage Bobby. As The Times reported: 'Time has not mellowed his eccentricity. Judaism, Israel and the United Nations all came in for fusillades. Fischer did, however, attempt to clarify the widespread assumption that he is, despite having a Jewish mother, a convinced anti-Semite. Not at all, said Fischer, with his usual loopy logic: 'Anti-Semitism is a nonsense term because my understanding is that the Arabs are also Semites, not only the Jews. And I'm definitely not anti-Arab.' Fischer is still, though, a rabid Russophobe, calling all the top former Soviet players 'criminals . . . the lowest dogs around.' As for the American government, Fischer found that words failed him: he simply spat on a letter from the US State department requesting him not to play the match which, being held in Serbia-Montenegro, infringed the United Nations embargo against that country. All in all, the ravings of a charmless and unpleasant person. And yet the next day Fischer, in his first chess game for 20 years, produced what I can only describe as a perfect work of art. He destroyed Spassky's ultra-solid position by a series of elegant manoeuvres all strung together by infinitely subtle mental pirouettes. To the chess addict, and I confess I am one, it was an almost heavenly experience to witness the creation, move by move, of a 20th century masterpiece, which, if it had been a painting, only the Getty museum could afford. Above all there was the stark contradiction between Fischer's crude and unpleasant political posturings, and the flawless beauty and integrity of his inner thoughts, made visible on the chess board in Sveti Stefan. For some reason we do find it very difficult to accept that the genius can also be a clown, or worse. Perhaps it arises from the popular view that true genius is a rare gift from God, and that someone touched by Divinity can not also be touched by the Devil. Peter Shaffer made this the theme of his play Amadeus. The main character, Salieri, an ambitious and devout hack court composer, could not accept that the sublime music of Mozart emanated from a man whose character in all other respects was crude and jejune. So Salieri lost his faith in God and murdered Mozart. Strangely, literature has also touched on this theme in the context of chess. Stefan Zweig's story The Chess Player is in part an account of the supremacy in chess of a crude peasant, Cvetkovic, a man totally devoid of any culture. For Zweig, a fleeing Jew writing at the outset of the Second World War, Cvetkovic was a symbol of the dull and philistine power destroying everything he cherished. Zweig committed suicide before The Chess Player was published. I wonder what Fischer would make of it all, if he ever bothered to read The Chess Player. It is of course, naive to think that what we call genius is simply a gift, whether God-given or simply genetically inspired. Fischer's creations are the result of a fantastically single-minded study of chess from a very early age. Consider such other sporting 'geniuses', as Nigel Mansell and Nick Faldo. Like Bobby Fischer, they are completely driven men. And while Mansell and Faldo, unlike Fischer, have managed to marry and start families, it is still clear that they are difficult men, frequently self-centred and charmless. For some reason sports addicts find this very difficult to accept. Racing fans want to believe that Nigel Mansell is a 'great guy', and golf fans want to believe the same of the prickly and (sometimes) offensive Faldo. George Orwell touched on this strange human weakness in a brilliant 1944 review of Salvador Dali's autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dali. At that time the book was considered far too obscene to be published in Britain, and indeed Orwell's review of the American edition was also banned in this country. Orwell himself was disgusted by Dali's necrophilia and other warped sexual obsessions, but at the same time insisted that Dali 'has 50 times more talent than the people who would denounce his morals and jeer at his paintings.' Yet Orwell noted that those who admired Dali's work could not accept that the man was depraved, and those who thought the man depraved could not accept the brilliance of his draughtsmanship. Such people, Orwell said, are 'unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be aesthetically right.' That telling phrase encapsulates the paradox of Bobby Fischer.

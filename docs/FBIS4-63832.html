			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Chubarov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "We will not withdraw  our troops from Estonia until the issue of the retired  servicemen is resolved in a civilized fashion," Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today before flying to Tallinn. He  was going to Estonia to take part in a ministerial session of  the Council of Baltic Sea States. The Russian minister also  intends holding a series of meetings with Estonian leaders.    According to the Russian foreign minister, discussion of the  Tartu treaty [signed by Estonia and Russia in 1920, dealing with  territorial issues] is pointless. "We do not intend to discuss  any territorial claims," the minister noted.    Touching on the situation in Crimea, A. Kozyrev stressed  that  the main thing now is to refrain from using force. Talks  between Russia and Ukraine on this issue are continuing at this  time.</p>

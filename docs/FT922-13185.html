			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Greek premier hedges bets on Macedonia THE Greek prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, yesterday sacked his foreign minister, a strong opponent of Greek recognition of Macedonia - and then proceeded to endorse some of his hardline views. In a series of contradictory moves, Mr Mitsotakis appeared to have decided to make a scapegoat out of Mr Antonis Samaras amid fears that Greece faces a humiliating diplomatic defeat by the EC over the Macedonian question. But he seemed to be hedging his bets by announcing he would take over the foreign ministry himself 'to enable Greece to follow effectively and responsibly the policy demanded by the people'. He added that he would appoint a retired diplomat, Mr Ioannis Tzounis, as foreign under-secretary. In recent weeks, Mr Tzounis has acted as the prime minister's personal adviser on the issue. Mr Mitsotakis appears to fear that Mr Samaras' rise in popularity as a result of his strong stance on Macedonia has undermined his position at the head of the ruling New Democracy party. He called for a parliamentary vote of confidence to be held on Friday night. Until yesterday, Mr Mitsotakis had let it be understood that Greece would recognise Macedonia if its name had a prefix to distinguish it from the northern Greek province of Macedonia, and if past claims of kinship with Slav speakers in Greece were dropped. Yesterday, however, he reversed his position, backing Mr Samaras' insistence that Macedonia should find an entirely different name. He also made public proposals by Mr Samaras which included threats to veto EC recognition of Macedonia and to close the border between the two countries - a move which would hurt Greek as well as Macedonian exporters. However unrealistic these proposals may be, given that international recognition of Macedonia under its present name could come as early as next month, they are backed by a sizeable number of conservative deputies and a large segment of public opinion. Mr Mitsotakis has quarrelled with half-a-dozen cabinet ministers in the past year. With the departure of Mr Samaras his government looks increasingly shaky. A crushing win by the main opposition Socialists in a by-election last week underlined the fragility of the conservatives' grip on power, with only a one-seat majority in parliament. Yet even if he yields to nationalist sentiment on Macedonia, Mr Mitsotakis will still be under fire from conservatives because of the gloomy economic outlook. It is more than a year since Greece promised strict implementation of a medium-term stabilisation programme in return for an Ecu1.1bn (Pounds 780m) EC loan. But annual inflation is still stubbornly high at 18.3 per cent, despite a public sector pay freeze, while the public debt, which amounted to 95 per cent of gross domestic product last year, shows little sign of shrinking in 1992.</p>

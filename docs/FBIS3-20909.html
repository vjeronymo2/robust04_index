"It is absolutely essential for us to be able to get beyond  the recession so that the basis of our know-how is preserved and  we can reap the fruits of our investments in a national system  of innovations in the future as well," the chairman of the  council, Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), said during a  press conference on the report in Helsinki on Friday.    According to him, it is also a question of changes in  challenges. "Internationalization is imposing a demand for  absolute quality. Only high-quality products are successful on  international markets, just as only research that represents the  international level has a chance of participating in  international collaboration on equal terms."  <H5>  Funding for Research Must Be Realistically Increased </H5>   The report that outlines the three-year period, 1994-1996,  "A  Finland of Knowledge and Know-How," considers it to be  especially important for us to be able to realistically increase  funding for research and do it so that the percentage of the  gross national product (GNP) invested in research increases.  Both private firms and the state must increase funding for  research. The goal is a 2.7-percent share of the GNP by 1997.  With this relative investment Finland would rank fifth among the  OECD countries this year.    The Science and Technology Council points out that  government  funding for research will clearly be reduced next year. The  detrimental effects of the cuts will especially heavily hit the  universities. The council considers preservation of their  ability to operate to be important. According to it, university  research resources would have to be developed in cooperation  with the Academy of Finland.  <H5>  Painful Decisions Have to Be Made </H5>   We must be able to improve the quality and productivity of  research. As the chief ways of doing this, Aho cited making  appropriations more competitive, systematic evaluation of  research projects, and structural improvement of research  activities.    "We are also inevitably facing painful decisions: the  reallocation of funds and the elimination of poor quality  research without prospects of success," Aho said.    In its development strategy the Science and Technology  Council expresses the view that, in addition, new funds are  needed to achieve objectives of current importance and to  strengthen our future know-how.  <H5>  More Funds Through Budget-Internal Transfers </H5>   "In connection with this, the council has concentrated on  the  status of basic research and the universities and on the  possibilities of increasing our contribution to research and  development projects stemming from the needs of the future  through budget-internal transfers of funds. It is obvious that  the new funds must be channeled to carefully selected projects,"  Aho said.    The vice chairman of the council, Minister Seppo Kaariainen  (Center Party), pointed out that the development of private  sector activities based on knowledge and know-how will have a  significant effect on the society's ability to create new jobs.    "This development will be stronger than it has been in the  future. For example, the electrical equipment and electronics  industry has itself estimated that it will need 10,000 new,  well-trained employees for research, production, and marketing  jobs over the next few years."  <H5>  Opportunities for Innovations Must Be Created </H5>   According to him, if it is implemented, this development  would have noticeably more far-reaching effects on employment  when we include the indirect effects on employment in  subcontracting networks and the service sector. "It goes without  saying that the public sector must protect opportunities for  realizing this development by developing a national innovation  system," Kaariainen said.    As a member of the council who participated in the study,  Prof. Ilkka Niiniluoto was, like the other investigators,  satisfied with the report's appropriation guidelines. "The  message is ideally suited to raising people's spirits, which are  currently at a very low ebb in the universities," he said.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Government Research Appropriations in Budget Proposals for 1991-1993 by O-|  |rganization                                                               |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Millions of Markkaa                         |Real Change (%|  |              |                                            |)             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |1991          |1992          |1993          |1991-1993     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Universities  |1,513         |1,541         |1,481         |-5.3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Academy of Fi-|449           |450           |449           |-3.2          |  |nland         |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tekes*        |930           |1,040         |1,347         |+40.2         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Research inst-|1,580         |1,624         |1,560         |-4.5          |  |itutes        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other funding |790           |836           |897           |+9.9          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total         |5,262         |5,491         |5,734         |+5.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* [Technology Development Center]                                         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Academy of Finland                                                |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> Joint Statement of Chairman Janet D. Steiger and Commissioner Christine A. Varney in Eli Lilly/McKesson, File No. 941&hyph;0102 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We voted in favor of the proposed consent agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (``Lilly'') in connection with its acquisition of PCS Health Systems, Inc. from McKesson Corporation. We believe the consent agreement offers immediate effective relief, avoids protracted litigation, and represents the best non-structural relief available to remedy the potential anticompetitive consequences of the transaction. Moreover, the proposed consent achieves these goals and allows potential efficiency gains to be realized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we remain concerned about the overall competitive impact of vertical integration by drug companies into the pharmacy benefits management market. Through monitoring this proposed order and through analysis of these evolving markets, the Commission intends to assess all the ramifications of vertical integration here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Eli Lilly and Company, Inc., File No. 941&hyph;0102 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Today, the Commissioner accepts a consent order for public comment that exudes a lack of conviction in the underlying theory of competitive harm on which the order is based. The order does not cure the competitive problems alleged in the complaint. Three of the four primary provisions in the order are inadequate, and the fourth, which addresses a memorandum of understanding between Lilly and McKesson, is based on no colorable factual showing of a violation of law. In addition, there is no justification for making the duration of the order half that of other Commission orders. Finally, imposing this order without addressing similar acquisitions raises a question of evenhandedness and leaves unanswered the broader question of the competitive effect of vertical integration in this industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I dissent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29183 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

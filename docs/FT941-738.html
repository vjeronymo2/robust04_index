			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Binder partner sceptical of merger The managing partner of the Scottish arm of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest accountancy firm, yesterday expressed scepticism over the possibility of merging with Arthur Andersen, the fourth-largest. Mr Ian Valentine said: 'The whole deal has got to be very carefully looked at. I can see difficulties in the size, culture and nature of the regional offices.' His views reflected concerns expressed by several partners in the 11 regional practices that comprise Binder and which could jeopardise a merger of the entire firm. The comments came after it emerged over the weekend that Mr Jim Wadia, managing partner for Arthur Andersen, wrote to Binder's senior partner two weeks ago proposing a merger. The regional heads of the firm met last night to learn fuller details of the proposals. It also emerged yesterday that both the single Binder firm covering London and Leeds, and the separate partnership for Manchester, were involved in the discussions with Andersen. These two practices represent the bulk of the firm's income and clients. Senior partners within these two Binder's practices are believed to be keen to press ahead with a merger. Andersen is believed to be willing to accept even if none of the other practices want to proceed. Full details of the merger are still subject to discussion. However, it is unlikely that the deal would involve any payment. Most discussion will concentrate on the terms on which partners in Binder would be allocated 'units' or shares within the Andersen partnership. Partners at Binder are now examining their deeds in detail to understand the nature of the voting that would be necessary to approve any merger.</p>

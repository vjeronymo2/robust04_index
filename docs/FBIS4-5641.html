			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Government and the Muslim rebel  group -- the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] -- will not  be able to hold peace talks in Jakarta, Indonesia next week.  The talks were originally scheduled for May, but the two sides  are hoping to hold them earlier than scheduled.    However, the Indonesian Government informed Philippine panel  member Eduardo Ermita that it cannot adequately handle the talks  because Indonesia will be hosting a number of international  meetings this month.</p>

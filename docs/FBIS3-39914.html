			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "VVD and CDA Programs Offering Most </F> Jobs"]    [Text] The Hague -- The electoral programs of VVD [People's  Party for Freedom and Democracy] and CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal] are offering the largest numver of jobs for the next  cabinet period. The PvdA [Labor Party] program would lead to  the most even distribution of purchasing power. This was  revealed by the Central Planning Office's (CPB) figures  published this morning with regard to the electoral programs of  CDA, PvdA, VVD, D66 [Democrats 66] and GroenLinks [Green Left].    All electoral programs focus on employment. Cuts in public  spending must yield the necessary funds to reduce labor taxes  and fees. CDA's cuts during the next cabinet period will be  highest, i.e., 18.4 billion guilders. The other parties will  save 17.6 (VVD), 12.6 (D66), 8.8 (PvdA) and 8.4 (Green Left)  billion guilders.    These cuts, announced by the parties in their electoral  programs, come on top of the 5 billion guilders announced by the  Lubbers/Kok cabinet in its "Million Note 1994." The decrease of  taxes and fees decided by the cabinet last Friday [18 February],  does not take account of this deficit in the budget. The CDA,  VVD and D66 would have found it wiser if the cabinet had first  covered this deficit, before reducing payments. "It is a shame  that a cabinet which is leaving the setbacks for the next team,  is already handing out bonuses which remain to be seen," VVD  leader Bolkestein says. "One should not open the sunshade  before one knows that the sun is actually shining, otherwise one  might end up in the dark," Representative G. Tepstra, financial  spokesman for the CDA party, says.    The cabinet wants to reduce payments permanently in 1994 and  1995 by 5 billion guilders. In an interview with our newspaper,  CPB Manager G. Zalm states: "It seems to me that these  reductions are excessive, especially if they are not compensated  fo by adjustments. There is the chance that the next cabinet  will have to scrape together the cuts required to finance  decreased income."    In the PvdA program, the purchasing power of minimum  wage-earners and people with an average income (40,000 guilders)  decreases by 0.25 percent a year. The purchasing power of those  earning twice the average income, decreases by 1 percent. The  differences are a little more outspoken in the CDA, VVD and D66  programs. The purchasing power of the minimum wage-earners  increases by 0.5 percent in Green Left's program, while payments  by people earning average and twice-the-average income increase  heavily.    The CDA freezes all social allowances. The VVD also freezes  allowances, except Old Age Pensions (AOW). D66 reduces  indexation by more than half, but permits reduction of the gap  between those on pension and people under 65 receiving an  allowance. The PvdA wants to apply the indexation of allowances  to the evolution of wages up to two-thirds during the next  cabinet period. Yesterday, PvdA Party Leader Kok said that  there is a "real possibility" that allowances would partly  follow wages from 1995 onwards. Freezing the allowances has a  "demoralizing effect. This is already true for a period of one  year, let alone if you freeze it for four years," Kok stated on  AVRO radio.  <H5>  D66 Reducing Deficit to 2.5 Percent </H5>   D66's electoral program leads to the lowest financing  deficit, i.e., 2.5 percent of the GNP in 1998 (the present  deficit is 3.7 percent). The VVD arrives at a slightly higher  figure, while the other parties arrive at a financing deficit of  3 percent. This is why VVD and D66 have less leeway in easing  payments, which in turn has an unfavorable effect on growth,  employment, and purchasing power over a four-year period.    The overall tax burden (sum of taxes and social fee) reaches  42.0 percent in 1998; the VVD arrives at a slightly higher  figure. D66 and PvdA reach a tax burden of 43.3 and 43.7  percent respectively. Green Left reaches an overall tax burden  of 45.5 percent, due to the implementation of the energy tax.  It is the first time that Green Left had its electoral program  audited. The small Christian parties did not have their  programs audited, although "quality support" was given.    In VVD's program, new jobs are the result of a system  change.  The VVD introduces a minisystem for new cases, for whom the  allowance amounts to 60 percent of the minimum wage. "Both in  1998 and in 2002, the VVD is the job champion, although few jobs  are created in the public sector," CPB Deputy Manager Van den  Berg explains. It is remarkable that in Green Left's program,  employment decreases in the market sector, while the number of  jobs increases in the public sector.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hemingway begins to make gains In 1991, a year of transition, Hemingway Properties incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.62m, compared with Pounds 6.92m. The interim loss was Pounds 2.1m. Last August the company, formerly Marylebone Estates, was the subject of a reverse takeover. It recapitalised through a rights issue, and introduced new management and policies. While the results were 'far from irrelevant', said Mr Leonard Phillips, chairman, he believed they did not provide an accurate indication of future performance. Rental income rose 19 per cent to Pounds 3.69m. The loss was struck after Pounds 725,000 reorganisation costs (Pounds 4.38m exceptionals). Losses per share worked through at 6.02p (32.93p). Net asset value per share had fallen from the pro-forma 37.8p to 31.4p, because of the revenue deficit and reduction in value of certain London properties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] To celebrate 27 April Day, the immortal day of  democracy in the life and history of our people [first  anniversary of first legislative elections in Yemen], a grand  popular speech rally was held today in 70 Square in Sanaa, the  capital of the revolution and the unity. The celebration was  held in an atmosphere of overflowing national zeal streaming  from the depth of the Yemeni people's national conscience, faith  in God almighty, confidence in the present and future, and  awareness of the importance of the Yemeni revolution and the  blessed unity. [passage omitted]    Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential  Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He  delivered an important national speech. Addressing the masses  who assembled in 70 Square, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said:  This day last year, our people, men and women, throughout the  governorates of the Republic of Yemen orderly headed for the  polls to elect their representatives to the House of  Representatives. [passage omitted]    The brother chairman said: We stress to the masses of our  people that we will not agree to seeing the role of the  legislative institution -- the House of Representatives --  marginalized. We call on the representatives of the Yemeni  people -- being above parties and narrow party affiliations --  to exercise their Constitutional tasks without hesitation, for  they are the representatives of the Yemeni nation. Our Yemeni  people struggled before and after the revolution until we  arrived at 27 April, the day when the first parliament in the  history of unified Yemen was elected. I call on state officials  to respect the nation and to head for the Constitutional  institutions in order to take the Constitutional oath and to  exercise their tasks. Any practices outside Constitutional  institutions or the Constitution will be considered  illegitimate. For over nine months, our Yemeni people have been  suffering a great deal as a result of a grueling and suffocating  crisis. It is a crisis for which some have been paid filthy  money -- the same money that once tried to abort the revolution  and now tries to abort unity and democracy. However, it is a  bet on a losing horse. Our people, who supported the revolution  and the republic and held fast at the 'Ayban, Zafar, and Radfan  mountains, are again ready to collectively confront the enemies  of unity and democracy and the advocates of separation. They  have been paid the price of the crisis. Yet, they continue to  talk about the people's suffering and living conditions. They  have received the price of the crisis to purchase mines, machine  guns, and tools of death to [words indistinct] and to abort the  unity and democratization. In their view, returning the  homeland to pre- 22 May 1990 is a cultural achievement. Our  understanding of a cultural achievement is democracy,  development, progress, social justice, and boosting national  unity among the sons of the Yemeni people. No cultural plan can  call for disintegration, destruction, planting the mountains  with mines and lethal weapons. Yet, they claim to be speaking  for unity and on behalf of the masses. From this place, I call  on the valiant children of Yemeni people in Aden, Hadhramaut,  (?Rassan), al-Dali', al-Yafi', Shabwah, al-Maharah, Abyan, and  throughout all the governorates of the republic to lie in wait  against all anti-unity forces and separatist elements. If the  separatists manage to control any part of the homeland, the iron  fist will return. However, our entire Yemeni people throughout  the homeland will be waiting for the separatists and will  confront them. Our people will stem those who stop at the gates  of some capitals to receive filthy money to abort unity. Our  people and their Armed and Security Forces will say no to those  people. They will collectively erect an impregnable wall  against outlaws and those who want to harm the unity and  democracy.    The brother chairman said: We proudly assure the masses of  our Yemeni people that the unity enjoys extensive Arab, Islamic,  and international support. This is because the unity is a  guarantee of regional security and stability. We call on the  unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party to speak out and to  firmly oppose the advocates of separation, who are inimical to  the Yemeni people. We say yes to unity and democracy and no to  infighting, blocking roads, and embellished speeches; yes to  development, paving roads, building hospitals, and purchasing  medicine, instead of purchasing tools of destruction,  subversion, and death, and fattening overseas bank accounts.    Earlier, the festival was opened with Koranic recitations.  Afterward, many speeches were delivered, including a speech by  the popular commission for defense of unity and opposing  separation in the capital. The speech was delivered by brother  Jamal Sharhan. [passage omitted]</p>

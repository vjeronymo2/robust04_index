			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina by Klaus </F> Grubelnik; place and date not given: "`Certain Reserves'"]    [Text] [Grubelnik] Minister, the Wifo [Economic Research]  Institute paper on "Austria in the European Union [EU]" has  predicted a budget shock for 1995. Net borrowing will be 35  billion schillings higher than without joining the EU. Has the  course of budget recovery thus failed?    [Lacina] I have great doubts about this figure. Of course  there will initially be a higher burden on the budget, but I  will certainly not accept that everything that is related to EU  accession will be classified as new burden. A large part of it,  for example in the sphere of subsidies for agricultural sector,  industry, and labor has to be financed through shifting funds:  Those industries that will benefit strongly will have to make a  solidarity contribution in favor of those that are exposed to  major difficulties. All in all, the crucial thing is the  alternative, and that is not joining the EU.    [Grubelnik] What does that mean for Austria?    [Lacina] We are in the middle of a phase of upswing and are  benefiting from an investment drive, because people are already  expecting EU membership. If this expectation is thwarted, then  it will mean insecurity and a flagging economy. Last year, we  were able to experience dramatically the effects of low economic  growth on the budget when our deficit jumped up 34 billion  schillings over the draft budget. I much prefer a higher burden  as a result of an offensive strategy to one that is caused by a  slump in the economy.    [Grubelnik] Yet, the Wifo has not exactly predicted  thrilling  results for the economy as a result of our accession to the EU:  The economic research experts expect an accumulated additional  growth of 2.8 percent up to the year 2000.    [Lacina] That is not the point. The point is what will  happen if we do not join the EU. Then businesses will simply  reduce investment. In the event of unemployment, the EU will  set up trade barriers against third countries and discriminate  against them. The Wifo simply did not work out the costs of  non-membership, and these costs would be very high.    [Grubelnik] It is indisputable that EU membership would  produce an additional burden on the budget. Under the motto of  "What happens if nothing happens," the Wifo has predicted the  net deficit to explode to 5.2 percent in 1995, while debt would  skyrocket from the current 56 percent of GDP to 70 percent.  Would we still be able to cope with that?    [Lacina] I am used to counteract predictions with the  appropriate measures, which is what we are going to do this  time, too. We will mainly look at the spending side, because we  do not want to stiffle growth with higher taxes. Besides, these  contributions cannot be financed exclusively by the Federal  Government alone, but the provinces and communities will also  have to contribute. All of Austria is going to join, not just  the Federal Government. This will require tough negotiations  for financial equalization. Since we managed to finance the  main bell in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral with the help of  the provinces [after World War II], we might be able to make  such a national effort together with regard to the EU.    [Grubelnik] Will there be massive privatization campaigns to  finance the extraordinary burdens?    [Lacina] Privatization revenues are not permanent revenues,  even though they can help prevent short-term budget shocks,  which is what we have done time and again in the various stages  of the tax reform. We still have certain reserves.    [Grubelnik] Yet, sooner or later the VAT [value-added tax]  rates, which are 5 percent lower in Germany, will have to be  cut. This will cost the budget another 20 billion schillings  per year.    [Lacina] The VAT rates are lower in Germany, while in Italy  they are about the same. There is also a 5-percent difference  with Denmark, but there these rates are higher. Denmark also  shares a border with Germany and can afford higher VAT rates.  We will look at the matter from the point of view of  competition policy. Anyway, I receive proposals for new taxes  on a daily basis, and I might feel like introducing one or the  other and cut the VAT.    [Grubelnik] All in all, Austrian farmers will get 117  billion  schillings in compensation payment for losses suffered from EU  entry, about half of which will be provided from the Austrian  budget, the remainder from the EU. Has the farmers's support  for EU entry been bought?    [Lacina] Distributed over a period of four years, the 117  billion schillings are about the same as what the farming sector  has received in direct and indirect subsidies so far, namely  28-30 billion schillings per year. Some of this money came from  subsidies from the state budget, some from artificially high  prices to be paid for by the consumers. Without EU membership,  the farmers would also have to put up with lower agricultural  prices as a result of the GATT agreement that was adopted last  December -- but without getting full compensation. I do not  rule out that some farmers, for example those in Alpine regions,  may be better off as a result of EU accession.</p>

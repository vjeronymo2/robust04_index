			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Unfinished business poses threat - Lingering problems from 1994 could spell danger next year Compared with the frothiness of 12 months ago, the securities markets are starting this new year on a much more even keel. So, I would see 1995 as a year of fluctuations, rather than one with any pronounced trend. These are hazardous times for forecasters, though - especially forecasters of economies. Last year, economic growth overshot expectations in most countries outside Japan and inflation, in an entirely uncorrelated (even contradictory) way, provided a surprise by undershooting. We cannot be at all confident that established economic models will tell us anything helpful about what will happen in 1995. At present, the consensus is that the pace of economic growth in the US and UK, at least, will moderate. That could be wishful thinking, but I shall use it as a working hypothesis. If, on the other hand, growth is sustained or even accelerates, then overheating will become an increasingly urgent issue. In any event, short-term interest rates are going up. In the US, I expect money market rates to go to 7 per cent during the first half of the year. They will continue to rise in the UK as well and will embark on a rising phase of the cycle in Germany. Rising short-term interest rates always create difficulties for the long-term markets in bonds and equities, and there are particular structural hazards this time. In this sense, the main dangers in 1995 could well arise from the unfinished business of 1994. The unwinding of speculative excesses in the bond markets has not been completed satisfactorily. Certainly, we must assume that rising interest rates will uncover some further horror stories in proprietary trading and corporate treasury mismanagement. Moreover, they will put increasing pressure on US mutual fund cash flows, which went negative for bond funds months ago but have showed signs of doing the same for stock funds only recently. Repatriation of US capital has caused problems for many stock markets around the globe in recent weeks, with a flurry of redemptions in Latin America within the past few days. For the moment, however, this has conferred safe haven status on Wall Street itself. But Wall Street could find 1995 more difficult. The long-term strategic problem remains that of the combination of dangerous financial imbalances in the US - now toying with the alarming and wholly inappropriate possibility of tax cuts - with the financial insecurity of Japan, where investors are hoarding yen rather than mopping up the glut of dollar securities. This produces a structurally weak dollar and the constant danger of a surge in US Treasury bond yields. Still, Wall Street appears to have come back from the edge of a precipice within the past few weeks. For the third year running, the US stock market has displayed astonishingly low volatility in 1994, while bonds have fluctuated wildly. But Wall Street is surely headed for a more serious setback some time in 1995. In sharp contrast, the UK economy appears better balanced than for many years. A massive transfer of resources is under way, from the personal sector into company profits and higher government net revenues. Over the past two years, company profits have jumped by 27 per cent while real personal disposable incomes have climbed by just 1.7 per cent. People hate it, but the shifts could persist for another year - until, finally, the government starts to panic about the imminent electoral consequences. For the UK's equity market, these changes are generating a benign framework in which the stock market's basic arithmetic is looking better all the time. True, the numbers looked more favourable before the Christmas rally and the All-Share dividend yield dipped below 4 per cent at one stage this week - awkward when gilt-edged yields have drifted back up to 8.7 per cent. But the company sector is cash-rich and dividends have risen by 8 per cent over the past year, with the good prospect of at least the same again in 1995. Equities are, therefore, priced rather less tightly against long gilts, and an index-linked gilt yield of 3.9 per cent, than they have been, at times, in the past year. The prospective yield ratio, 12 months out, could be about 2. All the same, shares will need assistance from a reasonable bond market if they are to perform positively. My general reason for caution - although not pessimism - about 1995 is that we are now moving towards the later stages of the economic cycle in which stock markets tend to encounter financial pressures, encouraging shares to become rather cheap. I have two specific reasons as well. The profits boom looks anomalous in the face of comparatively weak domestic demand, and could lead to competition becoming more intense. That could undermine the market's present earnings per share projection as rates of increase fall off disappointingly in the second half of the year. Second, political tensions may well rise during 1995. The possibility that the UK government might fall in some unscheduled crisis during the coming year is not factored properly into the market. In any case, the possibility of a Labour victory late in 1996 or early 1997 is bound to become a more obvious drag on market values by the end of 1995. If it is a problem for gilts, it will be a problem for equities, too. And gilt-edged will have to face the prospect of a government seeking popularity desperately in 1996. On the other hand, political uncertainty could hold back sterling - whereas, otherwise, sterling strength would be my suggestion for the biggest potential financial surprise for 1995 (if that is not too much of a contradiction in terms). From the point of view of a UK stock market investor, 1995 seems likely to bring a contrast between domestic corporate sector optimism and increasing tensions in the global capital markets. Both bulls and bears may, at different times, have cause to feel satisfaction.</p>

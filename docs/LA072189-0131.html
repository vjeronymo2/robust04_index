			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $15-MILLION PAYMENT IN BIG ROCK CASE OKD  </P> <P> The Assembly on Thursday overwhelmingly gave final approval to a bill to set  aside $15 million -- the state's final share -- to settle lawsuits stemming  from a 1983 landslide in the Big Rock Mesa area of Malibu.  </P> <P> The bill, by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who represents the district,  was approved by a 71-0 margin and now goes to Gov. George Deukmejian for his  signature. The governor's press secretary, Kevin Brett, said Deukmejian intends  to sign it.  </P> <P> Thursday's action was a step toward completing a $97-million settlement between  the state, Los Angeles County and insurance companies.  </P> <P> The state Department of Transportation was found liable by a Superior Court  jury of contributing to the landslide by cutting through a hillside to build  Pacific Coast Highway. The state's share of the settlement is $40 million, of  which $25 million was paid last year.  </P> <P> After the vote, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who handled the bill  on the Assembly floor, said, "I think this matter is put to rest."  </P></p>

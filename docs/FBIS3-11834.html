Aninat said the administration will place special emphasis  on  the access of Chilean agroindustrial products in the European  Union, Pacific Asia, and the Northern hemisphere.    Aninat said the finance, economy, and foreign ministries  will  act jointly to increase Chilean knowledge of those countries.    Aninat also disclosed that on 14 March, after President  Eduardo Frei opens the Meeting of World Businessmen, he will  announce the guidelines of his government's macroeconomic policy.    The finance minister said special emphasis will be placed on  the reconversion of certain productive sectors as well as on  microeconomic aspects, or "defining the peoples' real problems."  He stressed that this government will try to improve the  quality of job opportunities.    Aninat said the government will especially seek to maintain  the level of certain key prices and to safeguard stability and  growth, in addition to continue to curb inflation. [passage  omitted]</p>

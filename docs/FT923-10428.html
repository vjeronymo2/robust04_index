			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Observer: Long term Will he jump off the bench, or wait to be pushed? So goes the question being asked in lay quarters about the hapless Mr Justice McKinnon, criticised by the Court of Appeal for his role in the Blue Arrow fraud trial 'disaster'. But the query betrays total misapprehension about how these things work. After all, if judges resigned every time they were taken to task by their loftier brethren, the High Court bench would have more space than bottoms. Implicit in an appeal system is the recognition that judges aren't infallible, and so can err without being incompetent, malevolent or out of their wigs. But it just happens that there are some judges who never get promoted to the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords, a reflection perhaps of their stature in the eyes of the Lord Chancellor. So probably the worst prospect ahead of Pounds 87,620-a-year McKinnon is eking out his working life - which as he's only 53, could last another 19 years - on High Court bench and crown court circuit.</p>

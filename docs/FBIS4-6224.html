			<p>BFN     [Text] Lt. Gen. Arturo T. Enrile, chief of the Philippine  Army and incoming chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP), vowed yesterday to give top priority to the  10 year modernization program of the AFP which, he said, is  expected to have an expanded and more dynamic role in view of  the country's fast improving political, social, and economic  situation.    In an interview at the Philippine Army Headquarters at Fort  Bonifacio, Makati, Enrile said that in his tour of duty as the  next chief of staff, the military organization will assume more  relevant roles in economic development, particularly in the  field of infrastructure and environmental preservation.    He said that his program "peace offensives" in the  Philippine  Army is applicable for the entire AFP since it will be the  military's contribution to nation building. Enrile, a member of  the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class '62, was named by  President Ramos, also commander-in-chief, as the next AFP head  replacing Gen. Lisandro C. Abadia who is scheduled to end his  three-year term as AFP chief of staff on 12 April. Abadia who  is turning 56 next month, is also a member of PMA Class '62.    As Army chief, Enrile has vigorously pursued the Chief  Executive's campaign to protect the country's remaining forests  through the involvement of Army Special Units.    The Army chief also revealed plans to redeploy armored,  fighting vehicles in forest areas as a deterrent to illegal  loggers amidst the decline of communist threat.    However, Enrile said that he will give emphasis on the  modernization of the AFP since, he claimed, his predecessors had  successfully worked for the unification and professionalization  of the military institution.    "Actually, there is a much lesser work load for me now  because of the effectiveness of my predecessors. But still, I  am ready to make innovations that would keep the AFP as relevant  as it is," he said.    Despite giving a list of five candidates for the top AFP  post, military sources said Abadia endorsed Enrile to President  Ramos because of his professional competence.    Enrile said he is not expecting any "sour graping" from any  of the four candidates. "All of us are professionals and experts  in the military career," he said.    Enrile was born in Lucena City, Quezon on 20 June 1940. His  parents are Felix D. Enrile of Lucena City and Jovita Tiongson  of Nueva Ecija.    He is married to Mara Miciano of Metro Manila and is blessed  with a 12-year-old daughter Tanya Angela.    Many remember Gen. Enrile as the only Army officer who  convinced more than 400 rebel soldiers to "return to barracks"  after occupying the high-rise buildings in Makati for seven days  during the December 1989 failed coup attempt.    As superintendent of the PMA, Enrile was also responsible  for  instituting reforms at the country's premier military academy,  particularly the eradication of traditional hazing activities.    President Fidel Ramos designated yesterday Maj. Gen. Alfredo  Filler as new vice chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP) in place of Vice Admiral Mariana Dumancas.    Filler's appointment followed the designation of Gen. Arturo  Enrile as incoming AFP chief of staff, vice Chief of Staff  Lisandro Abadia who is retiring on 12 April.    Malacanang [presidential office] said Dumancas had earlier  requested the president to be allowed to go on terminal leave  effective today prior to his compulsory retirement on 30 October  1994. The president approved his request.</p>

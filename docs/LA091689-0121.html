			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN ACE WRESTLER'S LIFE CUT SHORT;  </P> <P> CSUF ATHLETE IS KILLED ON MOTORCYCLE  </P> <P> Erin Millsap, a champion wrestler at Cal State Fullerton who started in the  sport at age 5 and dreamed of making the 1992 Olympic team, died early Friday  when he was thrown from a motorcycle he was riding near campus.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old junior was a passenger on a motorcycle driven by Paul Reutzel,  a former teammate. Reutzel lost control of the vehicle as they were traveling  east down a steep slope on Bastanchury Road just east of State College  Boulevard, throwing them onto the pavement, said Fullerton Police Sgt. Rex  Strickland. Millsap was dead at the scene at 12:12 a.m. Friday. Reutzel, of  Diamond Bar, was in guarded condition Friday with a mild concussion at St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton.  </P> <P> News of the accident hit Millsap's friends, teammates and Sigma Pi fraternity  brothers hard Friday.  </P> <P> The 118-pound athlete had been in training for a new wrestling season,  scheduled to begin in November. Cal State Fullerton wrestling coach Dan Lewis  canceled Friday afternoon practice and met with the team, most of whose members  were aware of the accident.  </P> <P> "It's hard for us all to believe," Lewis said. "It will take a while.  </P> <P> "He was a real good motivator to the athletes," Lewis said. "It's so  unfortunate for such a young player."  </P> <P> Outside the wrestling gymnasium, about a dozen of Millsap's teammates sat, some  silent, others crying, still stunned by the news.  </P> <P> "He's so young -- it's hard to imagine," said Ramon Diaz, 21, who said he and  Millsap were best friends. "I thought it was just a bad joke when someone told  me. It's hard for me to know he's gone. This was our year."  </P> <P> Diaz said that he and Millsap had high hopes of being teammates in the 1992  Olympics.  </P> <P> "He had so much talent," Diaz said. "He could have been on top of the world."  </P> <P> Millsap competed in the NCAA Wrestling Tournament at Oklahoma City in March but  did not place in the 118-pound class. He had a season record of 36-8-2 as a  sophomore and 22-13 as a freshman.  </P> <P> In 1988, Millsap took third in the freestyle Espoir Cup championship, an  international competition of five countries in Newfoundland. He also finished  fourth in the six-country Greco-Roman championships in Athens.  </P> <P> Millsap often competed against larger opponents. What he lacked in size,  Millsap told the Times in a January interview, he made up for in strength,  speed, good technical skills and a quality he called "slickness."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, he made the national Top 20 by the Amateur Wrestling News.  </P> <P> "I was always the underdog," Millsap said at the time. "I'd rather prey on  sympathy than have to go out there and be No. 1. . . . Now I'm going to have to  get past that."  </P> <P> Lewis said that Millsap had been on his way to becoming an All-American, which  was one of his goals before finishing college.  </P> <P> Diaz remembered the help he got from Millsap when he was thrown from a  motorcycle last year and was hospitalized for a concussion.  </P> <P> "He was always there to walk me through the bad times," Diaz said. "He was  always cheering me on.  </P> <P> "God teaches you things in funny ways. I don't know what I'm going to learn."  </P> <P> Millsap was always on the go, Diaz said. A picture sticks in his mind, Diaz  said, of a time when they were staying at a hotel in St. Louis to compete in a  tournament.  </P> <P> At the time, Diaz said, Millsap got up early in the morning and shouted, "  'Good Morning, St. Louis!' " mimicking the movie, 'Good Morning Vietnam,' and  that is how I remember him, standing in front of that window."  </P> <P> Former Sigma Pi fraternity President Eric Gustafson described Millsap as a  "zestful kind of person."  </P> <P> Steve Jacques, the fraternity's president, said that Millsap had had problems  financially and in school and wrestling but lately "everything was coming  together for him."  </P> <P> Millsap was born in Saigon in 1968. His parents, Leonard and Iam Millsap, met  while his father was a U.S. Marine in Vietnam. They have another son, Erick,  22.  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements were pending Friday. Leonard Millsap, who is in the  merchant marine, was returning home from Japan to handle the details.  </P> <P> Millsap had been living for the past three months about a mile away from campus  with five other men, many former wrestlers, in an old Victorian home on East  Ameridge Avenue.  </P> <P> Rich Zele, 24, who lived in the house and was a former teammate, said that news  of the accident "really hasn't sunk in yet."  </P> <P> In his senior year in high school, Millsap was the undefeated state high school  champion in his division. He also was the national freestyle champion in his  junior and senior years.  </P> <P> "He was just a super individual," said Lon Gwyn, Millsap's coach at South Hills  High School in West Covina. "He was like a family, he was like my son. I'm  going to miss him."  </P> <P> Millsap started competing in wrestling when he was 5 years old, Diaz said, and  from then on it was a top priority.  </P> <P> "Wrestling was his only identification," Diaz said. "Wrestling was his life."  </P></p>

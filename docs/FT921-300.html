			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (8): Investors shrug off conflict - A Case study WHEN is the right time to privatise a company? Certainly not during a war. But this is precisely what happened in June 1991 when the Yugoslav federal army attacked the republic of Slovenia. It was also the first large transaction in Slovenia in which the Privatisation Agency and the development fund sold 76.5 per cent of a company to two foreign partners. The company involved was Tobacco Company Ljubljana (TCL). Established 120 years ago as a state tobacco monopoly, it was the seventh-largest cigarette factory in the former Yugoslavia, producing 4bn cigarettes a year, and holding 7.1 per cent of the total market. It also produced 1.1bn units for other tobacco companies, and exported 200,000 units. It distributed 80 per cent of all cigarettes of various brands consumed in Slovenia. The number of employees totalled 1,780 in 1991. Over the past 40 years, TCL was run by the workers' council which, under the terms of the federal government's legislation on privatisation, had decided it would initiate privatisation proceedings. It needed capital. The company was running into problems. Its market share has declined from 17 per cent to 7 per cent over the previous decade because of a change in consumer demands. In addition, exports were likely to fall because the cigarettes were not of international quality. In late 1990, TCL decided it wanted to link up with an international cigarette manufacturer. Management and employee buy-outs were deemed unsuitable since these methods of privatisation would not tackle the company's long-term problems - and aims. Its goal was to produce an internationally-known brand and a new generation of cigarettes with low tar and nicotine content. It hoped to increase the quality of existing TCL brands; obtain new machinery for this purpose; introduce modern management techniques, particularly in the marketing sector; and gain better access to international markets. The agency was called in and negotiations started with two foreign tobacco manufacturers: the German-French Reemtsma/Seita firm and a US company. After months of valuation and analysis, both potential investors were invited to submit their offers and were asked to describe how they would meet the goals of TCL. The offers were received by the agency on June 10. But both offers were too low in comparison with the appraised value by the agency's licenced appraiser. Fresh negotiations were started - in July - at the height of the war in Slovenia. 'That was an important signal for us that these foreign companies had a genuine interest in investing in TCL,' explained Mr Simoneti. 'The key issue they were concerned with was how much should the rate of return be increased to accommodate for the political risk in our country. On this point, we took a strong position - arguing that political instability is a short-term problem and that in the long run, political and economic risks in Slovenia are much lower,' said Mr Simoneti. By the end of July, both offers were increased by 40 per cent. Reemtsma-Seita had the edge on its US rival because it proposed a partnership that would preserve the identity of TCL and thus continue the business tradition of one of Slovenia's oldest companies. Over the next few months, the nuts and bolts of the deal were put together in the following way: The socially-owned company was transformed into a limited liability company. The shares were transferred to the development fund, which then became the seller of the company; Some 76.5 per cent of TCL shares were bought by Reemtsma-Seita. The remaining 23.5 per cent of the shares were reserved by the fund for the future sale, or future free distribution to employees. The foreign partners were willing to accept employees as shareholders; The contract included a detailed investment programme spread over five years which, along with the purchase price, totalled DM110m; A modernisation plan was agreed involving no redundancies, and an extensive training programme was written into the contract. Mr Simoneti, who prefers a long-term business plan to a quick sale, says the contract shows that even in a war, business can be concluded. More importantly, he says enterprises themselves are now taking the lead in starting privatisation proceedings. 'Although we do not have a clearly-defined strategy about what should be privatised, interest among the enterprises is increasing and contracts are being signed. Foreign investors are now looking at Slovenia as a market, not just for this republic, but for the former Yugoslavia as well,' he said.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread tops City hopes with Pounds 136m WHITBREAD, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, surpassed City expectations with a 13.4 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 119.7m to Pounds 135.7m. Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said the results for the six months to August 28 were achieved with 'very little assistance from any economic upturn.' Profit growth at the trading level was also held back by an Pounds 8m contribution to the group's pension fund - the first for four years - and the disposal of 450 pubs. Sir Michael added: 'This gives us confidence that we are in a strong competitive position when growth returns to our markets.' The shares gained 19p to 519p. Interest charges fell from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 13.8m. Basic earnings improved to 20.89p (17.47p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5p (4.75p). Operating profits declined from Pounds 149.2m to Pounds 146.1m on turnover marginally ahead from Pounds 1.16bn to Pounds 1.19bn. Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pubs, increased profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 51.2m, before a pension charge of Pounds 2.1m, on turnover 5 per cent higher at Pounds 275.2m. The best results came from pubs focused on the sale of food, with the 200 Brewers Fayre outlets achieving an 18 per cent growth in turnover. Average sales per pub grew 14 per cent in food, 6 per cent in drinks and 7 per cent in amusement machine income. Overall profits from Pub Partnerships, the leased estate, fell from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 25.2m as the number of pubs was reduced by 450. The restaurants and leisure division raised profits by 22 per cent to Pounds 28.6m before a pension charge of Pounds 1.7m. Turnover was ahead 6 per cent at Pounds 536.5m. Beefeater improved turnover by 7 per cent and profits by 10 per cent. Pizza Hut increased market share with a 10 per cent growth in turnover; Thresher's maintained trading profit on a 3 per cent increase in sales despite increasing personal imports of alcohol. A stronger performance from the group's hotels was led by the budget Travel Inns with a 27 per cent increase in turnover. Profits from beer and other drinks fell from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 41.9m after a pension charge of Pounds 3.2m and a Pounds 1.3m lower contribution from Britvic. Overall beer volumes declined 5 per cent. Market share was reduced 0.5 per cent in the free pub trade where margins were maintained despite competitive discounting. However, strong volume gains, led by Stella Artois and Boddington's, gave the group market leadership in the take-home sector. See Lex</p>

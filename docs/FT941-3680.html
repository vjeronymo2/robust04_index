			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fairey impresses City with 27% rise to Pounds 21.8m Shares in Fairey Group climbed 18p to 759p yesterday after the specialist electronics and engineering company unveiled a 27 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 21.8m. The improvement was fuelled mainly by the electronics and electrical power division, which contributed Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 10.7m). Mr John Poulter, group chief executive, said the division, representing 68.6 per cent of operating profits and 62 per cent of turnover, was the driving force behind the company and would be the focus of further expansion. The group is understood to have identified a number of potential acquisitions and is said to be in talks with several target companies. Such acquisitions are expected to be funded from the group's positive net cash balance of Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 2.14m), although Mr Poulter did not rule out coming to the market if a larger opportunity emerged. He said Fairey's ability to expand had been underpinned by increased profits in the group's two other core businesses - aerospace and defence, which reported gains of Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 2.24m) and filtration and specialised ceramics, ahead 18 per cent at Pounds 3.4m. Together they boosted total operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 15.8m) and lifted group turnover to Pounds 130.2m (Pounds 104.3m). Mr Poulter said the results had also benefited from a Pounds 1m currency gain on earnings by US subsidiaries. While welcoming the 'healthy figures', Mr Michael Fay, group finance director, said earnings per share of 37.8p (33.4p) had not advanced further because of tax changes in the US and the diluting effect of a Pounds 10.3m vendor placing in 1992 to acquire Infrared, the gauges business. A final dividend of 8p makes an 11.8p (10.2p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. COMMENT Despite its bulging wallet, Fairey is not about to embark on a shopping spree. It has a reputation for spending money only on companies which can deliver high margins in difficult markets. That cautious approach has, for example, won new business for the aerospace and defence business at a time when the industry is contracting. Impressed by a management whose catchphrase could be 'the price is right', analysts are not expecting dilutive acquisitions and have upgraded profit forecasts to Pounds 24m. Although that puts the shares above the sector average on a prospective multiple of 18.5, it could be a price worth paying for a business which last year reported underlying cash generation of Pounds 12.4m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, Taj-al-Din </F> 'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, and Najib  Sadiq in Aden: "Al-'Attas Stresses That Declaration of  Democratic Republic of Yemen Was a Foregone Conclusion Because  Building of Unitary State Had Been Obstructed. The United Arab  Emirates Refer to al-Bid as `His Excellency the President'"]    [Excerpt] The official EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY yesterday  referred to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential  Council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], as "his  excellency the president," an expression seen by political  circles as "United Arab Emirates [UAE] media recognition of the  DRY." According to informed sources in Abu-Dhabi, "the use of  the expression 'his excellency the president' in reference to  al-Bid was made on the instructions of political authorities."    Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, DRY Prime  Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said that "the  declaration of the new state was a foregone conclusion because  of the situation which prevailed following the announcement of  unity between the two parts of Yemen on 22 May 1990 and because  of the failure to build Yemen's unitary state as a result of the  insistence of the authorities in the Yemen Arab Republic on the  old methods of government, until the war came to end the pending  situation."    Al-'Attas emphasized that "the declaration of the DRY is a  station to stop at and pause, so as to prevent matters getting  out of hand and prevent expansion of the scope of the war in a  manner that would lead to the emergence of new entities. It is,  therefore, better to restore the pre-22 May 1990 situation and  then use our brains to think about the unity march, taking into  consideration matters which were ignored in the past when  emotions ruled supreme and reason was totally absent."    The UAE sources said that "the media move may be an  expression of extreme displeasure with President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's disregard for the cease-fire appeals made by UAE  President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly on more  than one occasion." They added that that "may be a new way of  putting pressure on Sanaa to respond and of warning it of the  consequences of further escalation of the fighting to include  densely populated towns."    Whereas the sources pointed out that the media recognition  "might be a prelude to an official recognition of the DRY as an  independent state, making the UAE the first state to recognize  the new political situation in south Yemen and its declaration  as an independent state," diplomatic observers noted that the  EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY "avoided describing al-Bid as chairman of  the DRY's Presidential Council and just gave him the protocol  phrase preceding the name."    The sources also said that the UAE "was perhaps holding  intensive contacts with other states to coordinate its steps  with these states, although it may be the first to implement  such steps."    It is worth noting that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that  there has been some kind of shift in the U.S. position away from  insistence on Yemeni unity as called for by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. Furthermore, the statements made by [Egyptian  Foreign Minister] 'Amr Musa at his news conference yesterday  denoted a similar shift with emphasis on a cease-fire in Yemen.    The diplomatic sources said that "the UAE's recognition of  the DRY may depend on the development of military operations on  the ground, and if the south Yemeni forces managed to regain the  initiative and stand fast in the face of the northern forces,  that would not only pave the way for recognition but also for  abandoning the neutral line taken on the conflict and making  initiatives that would compel the intransigent party to accept  mediation and good offices."    Al-'Attas said that the declaration of the southern state  was  "the only realistic way out in the current circumstances,  placing on the shoulders of the northern leadership the  responsibility of preserving a minimum degree of national unity  to be developed in the future, while at the same time searching  for a formula for new relations between the two Yemeni states  and the states of the region to provide security, stability, and  development for the entire region in the new conditions."    Asked what he thought of the position of the tribes and  organizations opposed to Sanaa's leadership in northern Yemen,  al-'Attas said: "That is an unfamiliar situation, a position of  inaction despite the fact that there are patriotic figures and  oppressed tribes there. The fighting taking place in the south  is in defense of those people and their rights against the  rulers there." He added: "Had they acted and supported the  steadfastness of the southern and eastern governorates, the  situation would have been different now and the label of  north-south conflict would have disappeared, and the military  clique would not have had the chance to strike at the unity  forcing us to declare the southern state."

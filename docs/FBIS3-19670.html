			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Christian Stoeger in Brussels; date not given: "`NATO Will Not  Force Its Friendship Upon Anybody'"]    [Text] "Those who are in it are 99 percent safe, those who  are outside are unsafe," Manfred Woerner, bearing the signs of  his serious illness, said in an interview with DER STANDARD.  "This is also true for ethnic conflicts, which should not be  neglected. After all, NATO membership is also a declaration of  support for basic democratic values and thus the guarantee for  stability within the member states. This also applies to the  new Partnership for Peace [PfP]."    [Stoeger] Is the Partnership, which was adopted in January,  and which even Russia now intends to join, to be regarded as a  step-by-step extension of NATO?    [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is intended to extend  stability further to the East, but must not be regarded as an  antechamber to NATO or as waiting room for accession to the  community. A step-by-step extension of NATO is quite possible  -- and also desirable. However, not all countries that want to  can immediately join NATO. It requires coordination. For some  countries that participate in Partnership for Peace it is  certainly the path toward NATO membership, while for others it  is not.    [Stoeger] Austria is also free to join the partnership, but  it has so far shown little interest. What will NATO do to  convince the Austrians of the advantage of such accession?    [Woerner] Nothing. The Austrians know themselves what they  have to do and they are free to decide. Moreover, Partnership  for Peace is only an offer that may or may not be taken up.  NATO will certainly not force its friendship upon anybody. All  I can say is if you do not want to, well, then you do not have  to. We have enough applicants.    [Stoeger] Some former East Bloc countries initially rejected  this offer as insufficient, but ultimately accepted it. Why?    [Woerner] Because there is no efficient alternative. Why is  everybody trying so hard to get into NATO? Because of our  beautiful blue eyes? Certainly not. It is because we offer  absolute security. This is not only hot air but the essence of  the security concept. NATO will certainly not stand idly by in  case a partner is attacked. Still I will not say what we would  do. That is also part of deterrence.    [Stoeger] Both Greece and Turkey are NATO members;  nevertheless, the Cyprus problem remains unsolved.    [Woerner] The Cyprus problem is not within NATO's  responsibility, but within that of the United Nations. Yet,  NATO membership certainly prevented escalation, because there is  still more dynamite around. If the two countries involved were  not members the problem would be much worse.    [Stoeger] As in the former Yugoslavia? What has NATO been  able to do in this conflict?    [Woerner] First of all, I would like to emphasize that in  this conflict the responsibility does not lie with the United  Nations. An earlier use of limited military power would have  been better, as could be seen by the example of the Sarajevo  ultimatum. NATO has long since been ready, but the UN order did  not come. Now one is able to regain credibility. After all,  peace securing includes three main points: first, the necessary  means to deter the aggressors, second, the will to use these  means fully if necessary, third, also to make that clear to the  aggressor.    [Stoeger] Still, particularly in the case of the Balkan war,  there are still some deficits, especially regarding the Serbian  embargo.    [Woerner] By and large, the sea embargo is working. Here  there are no problems. NATO units have virtually sealed off the  coast. The NATO-monitored no-fly zone is also being respected.  Still, as far as efficiency is concerned there are still  deficits, particularly regarding coordination between the United  Nations and NATO. In many cases UN orders to take action take  too long. NATO would be able to react much faster.</p>

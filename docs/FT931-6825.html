			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / S Korea promotes political reformers MR Kim Young-sam, the new South Korean president, yesterday appointed a combination of bold political reformers and cautious economic bureaucrats to his cabinet. Many of the 24 ministers come from outside the political establishment. They include academics and former opposition politicians who served with Mr Kim before he joined the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in 1990. The reformers mostly fill politically sensitive positions, such as head of the intelligence agency, as part of Mr Kim's programme to remove the last vestiges of the former military dictatorship. The key economic agencies, however, are occupied by bureaucrats, who indicated they will resist rapid economic deregulation. 'We will seek reforms in a gradual way that will not invite bad effects,' said Mr Lee Kyung-shik, who becomes head of the Economic Planning Board. Mr Lee was an EPB official and presidential adviser during the administration of President Park Chung-hee, when economic policy was dominated by central planning. He then became a senior executive at Daewoo, the country's fourth biggest conglomerate, during the 1980s and is now president of the state-run Korea Gas Corporation. Although he favours the reduction of bureaucratic controls on industry, he added that he did not support 'the rash implementation of financial deregulation'. Mr Hong Jae-hyung is the new finance minister and a former bureaucrat in the ministry. He is now chairman of the state-owned Korea Exchange Bank and was the president of the Export and Import Bank, another government bank. Mr Hong also favours a cautious approach to financial liberalisation and is likely to resist foreign demands, particularly from the US, for more rapid market-opening measures.</p>

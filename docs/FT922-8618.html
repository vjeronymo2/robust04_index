			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown seeks the right chord - The debate over the future of the Liberal Democrats IF Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, thought the world would have changed when he arrived at the Commons yesterday, then indefatigable optimism had got the better of him. His weekend speech calling for Labour to work with him on an anti-Tory alliance opened up age-old questions among Liberal Democrat MPs about the role of the third party in a inherently two-party system. There is no sign that the answers are any clearer. His well-timed comments were strong on mood music but devoid of prescription. The text suggested he believes in more than Micawberism - waiting for something to turn up - and is restless about leading a party with a voice only in local government and think tanks. But his vision lacked a specific end game - even if Labour were to play ball. It was probably quite enough for his parliamentary colleagues at this stage, however. They are too used to misplaced promises of late surges or of promised breakthroughs that became mirages. The consensus among the party's MPs was that change had to be gradual. Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said: 'I don't think realistically that we are going to see anything happen on the centre left until Labour have got themselves sorted out, probably not until next spring.' Even then there would be no scope for 'compromising our intellectual integrity'. Liberal Democrat MPs see their general election performance only as a success - even though the party's share of the vote fell 5 points and parliamentary representation shrank by 2. The result is a rather grandiloquent presumption, which Mr Ashdown seems anxious to rework that the impossible might still be achievable without a fundamental rethink of strategy. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, said: 'There is a fairly widespread view that our job is to keep our identity, avoid getting into pact/deal muddles and achieve the end of Tory rule without allowing Labour to recover. It is how you do that which is difficult.' He encapsulated the party's internal contradictions, however, by adding: 'For most Liberal Democrat members and MPs, there is a limit to the number of times you can see your party return to be a third party and in opposition.' Freshly elected MPs such as Mr Don Foster, who defeated former Tory chairman Mr Chris Patten in Bath, are keen for influence on the issues that won them their seats - education, unemployment and so on. But Mr Foster, too, insists that that has to be 'subject to being totally unwilling to give up the philosophy of the party'. Given that sense of wanting to have their cake and eat it, coupled with Liberal Democrat MPs' determination neither to bend too far towards either Labour or the Tories, Mr Ashdown was careful in his speech to set out how Labour would have to move towards him. He would, after all, risk losing his own Yeovil constituency if he were to let an unreconstructed Labour party into office. So Labour needs to back liberal market economics, not producer interests; embrace constitutional reform; oppose authoritarian and remote government; and break links with the trade unions, for Mr Ashdown's support. Since the election, though, his thinking has moved away from aiming to replace Labour as the main opposition party. His failure to win electoral reform notwithstanding, he now wants to move towards a European-style pluralism with opposition political parties competing and co-operating. He knows he cannot both set out to destroy the Labour party and urge its friendship. Yet his careful balancing means that even Labour MPs who would be willing to start a dialogue are deeply distrustful. One shadow cabinet member said yesterday Mr Ashdown was too arrogant. 'A bit of humility would be nice.' Mr Ashdown talks of the Liberal Democrats' acting as a catalyst or 'the gathering point for a broader movement'. In practice, he may be content to move his party towards some form of consensus-building forum with an agenda initiated by the new Labour leadership. Conceivably, some of his colleagues might be prepared to compromise their ambitions a little if, for instance, Labour were to become committed to electoral reform. Mr Hughes said: 'All of us are willing to facilitate ways of bringing about an end to minority Tory government. That means exploring ways of creating a coalition of parties and individuals committed to electoral and constitutional reform.' Mr Ashdown has wisely refused so far to enter into speculation about what might or might not be workable. In reality, at this stage he does not know; and he is aware of the sensitivities of excessive risk-taking that might scare some Liberal Democrat MPs, perhaps too used to the tranquil waters of third party politics. His quest for real Liberal Democrat influence means, however, that he is unlikely to be restrained for long.</p>

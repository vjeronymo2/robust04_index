The discolored rice was discovered in a 5,775-ton shipment  of  long-grain rice for food processing that arrived from Bangkok at  Hakodate Port on January 1.    Inspectors found the discolored rice in some of the  50-kilogram bags that are being unloaded from a  Panamanian-registered freighter. A total of 1,400 tons of the  rice had been unloaded through Sunday.    The Hakodate Bureau of the Hokkaido Food Office was not  certain if the discolored rice was like that when it left  Thailand or if it became discolored during the trip to Japan.    The officials said that the rice was not discolored by the  kind of mold caused by condensation that was found in imported  rice from Thailand at the port of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture last  month.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW IRWINDALE SITE FOR RAIDERS PARK SUGGESTED  </P> <P> The possibility of shifting the site of the proposed Los Angeles Raiders  stadium in Irwindale has been raised by Irwindale Mayor Pat Miranda, who  expressed concern about resistance by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Los  Angeles County officials to providing parking land for the preferred stadium  site.  </P> <P> After learning of adverse environmental comments by federal officials to  proposals to use a 170-acre parcel in the Santa Fe Dam basin for stadium  parking, Miranda told a City Council study session last week that he felt it  might be advisable to choose another location for the stadium.  </P> <P> The alternate site would be on private land in Irwindale, not subject to  federal or county control, west of the San Gabriel River Freeway and south of  the Foothill Freeway. Other private land nearby could be used for the parking.  The preferred site up to now is about a mile away, north of the Foothill  Freeway just west of the Irwindale Avenue exit.  </P> <P> The alternate site is listed as a possible choice in a stadium environmental  impact report that has been under preparation for more than a year and is  expected to be approved Thursday by the City Council.  </P> <P> But Miranda's comments about actually using it drew a suggestion from City  Manager Charles Martin that it is probably premature to discuss it. And John  Herrera, a senior Raiders official who was at the meeting, said he knew little  about the proposed site.  </P> <P> Questions about the stadium site are but one of many uncertainties that have  arisen in the last few months about the Raiders' Irwindale deal. Irwindale has  been under a September, 1987, Superior Court order blocking it from going ahead  with a final stadium agreement with the Raiders and arranging financing for the  stadium until the environmental report is approved by the court as well as the  City Council.  </P> <P> In the meantime, questions have arisen whether adequate financing can be  obtained for a project with a cost estimated at $150 million, and two of the  three men who negotiated a preliminary agreement with the Raiders -- Xavier  Hermosillo and Fred Lyte -- have been discharged from the matter by city  authorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Harm to Wildlife Cited  </P> <P> And in a Dec. 13 letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency opposed any lease of the 170 acres of federal property to  Irwindale or the Raiders for parking at the preferred stadium site.  </P> <P> At present, this vacant land is leased by Los Angeles County, and both county  and Corps of Engineers approval would be needed for it to be used.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency letter called the land in question a  "premiere remnant example of alluvial sage scrub habitat" and "an integral part  of a wildlife corridor that stretches from the (Santa Fe Dam) basin to the San  Gabriel Mountains." It suggested there would be irreversible harm to the  wildlife if it were paved for parking.  </P> <P> "It looks like the county and the corps are trying to hold this project back,"  Miranda said at the Council study session. He said the alternate site might be  better because it "would not involve them at all."  </P> <P> But W. J. Lockman, whose firm is in charge of preparing the environmental  impact report, told council members that frequent contacts he has had with the  Corps of Engineers and county authorities led him to believe that eventually  they will support the leasing of the parking land. "Of course, it will take a  lot of time," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Way to Speed Up Corps  </P> <P> The corps usually moves slowly in such matters, and Irwindale officials said  they have received suggestions that the only way to effectively move the agency  along is to find a willing congressman who has clout with it.  </P> <P> But there are troubles at the county level too, with some county supervisors  reluctant to support any step that would facilitate the Raiders' plans to quit  the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Irwindale.  </P> <P> The preferred stadium site is on private land, but unless proposed parking land  controlled by the government agencies is made available, stadium-goers would  have to be shuttled by bus from as far as a mile away.  </P></p>

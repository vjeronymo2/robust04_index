			<p>BFN     [Text] Mainz (DDP/ADN) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin is presently on a private visit to Mainz to have a  kidney stone complaint examined. His Moscow doctors advised him  to obtain a second opinion in Germany, Chernomyrdin told a news  conference in Mainz today. Treatment for the illness, from  which he has suffered for several years, could not be put off  any longer. Chernomyrdin said the kidney complaint "bothers"  him, but it does not impair his work in any way. The prime  minister announced that the treatment will presumably begin in  Mainz and be continued in Moscow. A long stay in Germany is not  planned: "I may fly back before Friday [10 June]," Chernomyrdin  said.    Rudolf Hohenfellner, the doctor treating Chernomyrdin at the  Johannes Gutenberg University Clinic in Mainz, confirmed that  Chernomyrdin is not suffering from any other illnesses. "His  state of health is actually excellent," Hohenfellner said. A  decision on treatment will not be made until the final diagnosis  has been obtained this afternoon, the doctor said.</p>

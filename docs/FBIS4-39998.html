			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik, and Galina Nekrasova]    [Excerpts] Lvov, 12 Jun -- Today, for the first time,  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk unveiled his program for the  26 June presidential elections during a working trip to Lvov  Oblast.    At a meeting at Lvov Polytechnic State University with  representatives of the authorities of the western region of  Ukraine, businessmen, the intelligentsia, and clergy, Leonid  Kravchuk spoke of the main tenets of his program. Its main  thesis is "to strengthen the state and speed up the reforms  through civic accord." He sees his main task as head of  government as ensuring that "the economic reforms get going and  that people begin to live better lives," that Ukraine's state  construction moves ahead.    Speaking of the Crimean problem, Leonid Kravchuk stressed  that "no matter how events develop, Ukraine will not allow the  territorial integrity of the state, its unity, to be violated.  Regardless of what the Supreme Council, the government, the  president of the Crimean autonomous entity do, everything will  be done to ensure that events on the peninsula do not spill over  the bounds of the Constitution of Ukraine. There can be no  alternative here." [passage omitted]    During his trip today Leonid Kravchuk unveiled a monument in  Lvov's central boulevard to Mikhail Grushevskiy who, in 1917-18,  was the first president of the Ukrainian People's Republic.    The president of Ukraine left for Kiev in the evening.</p>
